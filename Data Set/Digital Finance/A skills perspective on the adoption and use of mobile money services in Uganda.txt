Abstract
Adoption rates of mobile financial services within sub-Saharan Africa still appear to be below par. The 2016
Groupe Spe ´ciale Mobile Association report shows that over 60 per cent of the adult population in sub- Saharan
Africa do not use mobile financial services. We investigate how cognitive resources, namely, mobile phone
skills and English literacy, influence the use of mobile financial services. We test our hypotheses using a sample
of 208 individuals from an urban location in Central Uganda. We measure actual mobile phone skill using a
newly developed scale. The results show that a marginal increase in mobile phone skills has a strong effect on
the odds of adopting mobile money, but a less strong effect on the extent to which the functionalities of the
mobile money application are used. On the other hand, English literacy has no influence on both adoption and
the magnitude of services individuals use.

Introduction
Following the rapid diffusion of mobile phones in
Africa, the impact of mobile technology can be found
in various domains. Mobile phones in developing
countries have been associated with: job creation and
entrepreneurship (Afutu-Kotey et al., 2017; Asongu
et al., 2017); access to credit facilities for small busi-
nesses leading to growth (Asongu and Odhiambo,
2017); income redistribution among the poor and
gender income equality (Asongu, 2015); good gov-
ernance, both politically and economically (Asongu
and Nwachukwu, 2016); higher productivity in
agriculture (Issahaku et al., 2017); as well as financial
inclusion (Peruta, 2017). In this paper, we payparticular attention to mobile technology in the finan-
cial inclusion realm with an emphasis on understand-
ing the role that cognitive resources play in adoption
and use.
Financial inclusion is a situation within which indi-
viduals have access to financial services tailored to
their needs (Peruta, 2017). In general, developing
countries post poor financial inclusion demographics

(Zins and Weill, 2016). People in developing coun-
tries face many challenges and constrains in access to
finances and financial services (see for example,
Solano and Rooks, 2018). Mobile financial services
have taken center stage in improving financial inclu-
sion in many developing countries (De Albuquerque
et al., 2016; Donovan, 2012; Kikulwe et al., 2014;
Murendo et al., 2018; Nyeko et al., 2014). The use
of mobile financial services by the unbanked has been
recognized as one of the best opportunities for eco-
nomic growth, poverty alleviation, and establishing
financial security in developing countries (Mothobi
and Grzybowski, 2017; Peruta, 2017). The most pop-
ular mobile-based financial service in these countries
is ‘mobile money’. Mobile money is a mobile-based
platform that allows individuals to make financial
transactions using cell phone technology (Jack and
Suri, 2011; Murendo et al., 2018).
The first mobile phone-based money transfer sys-
tem (M-PESA) that allowed individuals to deposit,
send, and withdraw funds using their cell phones was
introduced in Kenya in the year 2007 (Donovan,
2011; Etim, 2014; Jack and Suri, 2011). (‘M’ for
mobile, ‘pesa ’is Swahili for money) With limited
access to formal financial institutions, the aim of this
platform was to extend and include the ‘poorest of the
poor’ in the financial circle (Peruta, 2017). M-PESA
has since then grown rapidly, spilling over into neigh-
boring states under disparate code names by telecom
providers and is widely viewed as a success story to
be emulated across the developing world (Donovan,
2012). Extending financial services to the unbanked,
mobile money improves productivity while lowering
the cost of transactions (Aron, 2015; Jack and Suri,
2011; Peruta, 2017). Focusing on Uganda, there is
evidence that mobile money has improved rural
household incomes through remittances from urban
areas (Kikulwe et al., 2014; Munyegera and Matsu-
moto, 2016). In other countries, mobile money has
generated employment opportunities and created a
platform on which other businesses grow (Kendall
et al., 2012). Moreover, since access to mobile money
funds is safeguarded by the use of personal identifi-
cation numbers (PIN codes), mobile money provides
a secure method of savings for rural populations who
have limited access to formal financial institutions
and face risks caused by traditional means of money
transfer and saving (Duncombe and Boateng, 2009;
Jack and Suri, 2011; Kikulwe et al., 2014).
Despite the increasing number of people adopting
it, mobile money is still far from being widespread(Etim, 2014; Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions, 2015, 2016b). According to the World Bank1
indicators, only 35 %of the population in Uganda was
using mobile money in the year 2014. Subsequently,
the 2016 financial inclusion report on Uganda2
reflected an increase in mobile money adopters from
35%(2014) to 48 %(2016). This report categorizes
mobile money non-users as primarily poor and less
educated with limited access to technology, and a lack
of requisite skills as their biggest barriers. These
encumbrances, however, are not tested empirically
and have remained anecdotal findings.
To use mobile money, individuals need certain
skills. Given that mobile mo ney platforms operate
on mobile phone technology, and predominantly
function using the English language, it is expected
that before one can apprec iate and efficiently use
mobile money services, one has to possess at least
basic technical mobile phone skills and linguistic abil-
ities. In developing countries, where the digital divide
is still a challenge, and large inequalities in literacy,
access, and use of technology exist (Alampay and
Bala, 2010; Gebremichael and Jackson, 2006; Medhi
et al., 2011), not everyone can operate a mobile
phone. Also, the English language, though widely
used formally and integrated into the education sys-
tem, is not native to many countries, even more so in
sub-Saharan Africa (Negash, 2011).
Literature review
Mobile money refers to a repository of electronic
money operated via mobile phones (De Albuquerque
et al., 2016). Mobile money provides an integrated
platform that eases financial transactions in the form
of a one-stop center. In other words, given its ubiqui-
tous nature, mobile money facilitates transactions
over a wide range of sectors. Mobile money has been
extensively applied in many domains including, busi-
ness, finance, health, agriculture, and education. In
Uganda, telecom companies have partnered with
banks to synchronize both banking and mobile finan-
cial services. With continuous evolution, mobile
money facilitates financial transactions encompassing
mobile and bank account balance checks, deposits and
withdrawals, goods and service payments, purchase
of prepaid mobile phone credit, and money transfers
(Hughes and Lonie, 2007), and lately also features
bank transfers, savings groups, personal savings, and
access to credit (Gencer, 2011; Global System for
Mobile Communications, 2015).2 Information Development XX(X)A recent literature review shows that most mobile
payment adoption studies investigate adoption with a
specific theoretical background, such as the Technol-
ogy Acceptance Model (TAM); the Unified Theory of
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT); Task-
Technology Fit (TTF); the Theory of Reasoned
Action (TRA); the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) (Dahlberg et al.,
2015). The growing body of research surrounding the
drivers and constraints in adoption of mobile money
in developing countries encompasses: cost (Jack and
Suri, 2011); perceived ease of use and perceived use-
fulness (Etim, 2014; Tobbin, 2012); social network
effects (Kikulwe et al., 2014; Murendo et al., 2018;
Okello Candiya Bongomin et al., 2018); access to
formal banking institutions (Peruta, 2017); technol-
ogy anxiety (Lee and Warkentin, 2004) and complex-
ity, trial ability, age and gender (Faqih and Jaradat,
2015; Nyeko et al., 2014).
These studies notwithstanding, researchers have
not systematically studied the influence of skills on
adoption and use. Thus, there is good reason to study
how skills influence mobile money use. In line with
Dahlberg, Guo and Ondrus’s (2015) call to study
mobile technology adoption as a dynamically evol-
ving service in different contexts, Wyche and Stein-
field (2016) investigated, in a qualitative study, why
farmers in Kenya are not able to use cell phones. Their
study reveals barriers created by a lack of skills in the
use of mobile technology. The respondents in the
study were challenged by the phone functions such
as texting, and they were unable to comprehend the
English language used in the mobile phone menus.
Hence, in a developing country, basic skills and com-
petencies could be a significant predictor of mobile
money use.
Mobile money is used by literate, semi-literate and
illiterate persons, and is p articularly widespread
among people who cannot easily access financial ser-
vices in the formal sector (Donovan, 2012; Jack and
Suri, 2011; Kendall et al., 2012). This segment of the
population is characterized by low literacy levels
(Medhi et al., 2011). Previous research shows that
illiterate populations avoid complex functions, and
primarily use phones for making calls, because their
knowledge of the mobile phone is limited (Chipchase,
2005; Lippert and Forman, 2005). Furthermore, they
use a mobile phone with minimal reading and com-
prehension abilities of what they are doing (Wyche
and Steinfield, 2016). Their skill levels to efficiently
use a mobile phone are low. Skills refer to technicalknow-how to operate a given technology. Mobile
phone skills refer to the technical skills and know-
how to operate a mobile phone, for instance, texting,
comprehending texts, menu functions of a mobile
phone (Alampay and Bala, 2010; Wyche and Stein-
field, 2016). In addition, more technically related
skills are required within the application itself, such
as scrolling and hierarchical navigation, soft-key
mapping, numeric input, and understanding technical
language (Medhi et al., 2011). There is broad consen-
sus among scholars that technical know-how is an
important factor in the use of technology (Alampay
and Bala, 2010; Irura and Munjiru, 2013; Lippert and
Forman, 2005; Morawczynski, 2011).
To be able to use mobile money effectively, one
needs to be in a position to operate a mobile phone.
Mobile phone functions used for services such as
loading prepaid credit, subscribing to monthly data
or credit plans, checking credit balances, to mention
but a few, follow the same pattern as mobile money
functions. For example, in the context of mobile
money, a synchronized access code used across two
major mobile networks in Uganda is *165#. Once
input, this code processes the main set of mobile
money options, which will then provide a menu that
appears on the handset for subsequent selection of a
required mobile money service.
The mechanism behind using mobile money
requires the use of such codes and following sequen-
tial instructions to execute transactions. Hence, we
argue that having prior mobile phone skills will influ-
ence the extent to which an individual can use mobile
money. Prior experience with technologies has been
shown to promote use and adoption of mobile money
(Schierz et al., 2010; Wei and Zhang, 2008). For
example, Schierz et al. (2010), while studying indi-
vidual behavior patterns, found that prior experience
was instrumental in the adoption of mobile payment
systems in Germany. Prior experience gained from
using a mobile phone will enable a smoother transi-
tion into how to use mobile money. Correspond-
ingly, fully exploiting and effectively utilizing a
technology necessitates h aving the required skills
to operate a technology (Shen et al., 2010). Not only
will prior experience with a mobile phone enable
individuals to use mobile money, but it will also
provide opportunities to explore the more compli-
cated functionalities of the technology system
(Lippert and Forman, 2005).
In developing countries, where literacy levels are
rather low (Alampay and Bala, 2010; Medhi et al.,Kiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 32011), it is prudent to consider English literacy con-
straints in adoption of mobile financial technology.
Previous studies have argued and shown that low lit-
eracy users find it hard to complete tasks in the Eng-
lish based user-interfaces (Medhi et al., 2009, 2011).
Taking the case of M-PESA, in Kenya, some users not
fluent in English had difficulty reading text portions
of receipts from the mobile money transactions
though they could identify the numerical values
(Donovan, 2012). Further still, recent qualitative
research by Wyche and Steinfield (2016) found that
English menus embedded within the mobile money
application posed a barri er for illiterate users. Not
only did the language limit interactivity with the sys-
tem, but it also posed a blockade to accessing the
technology. The above literature underscores the
importance of both abilities and literacy in facilitating
the operation of the mobile money application.
Correspondingly, if one faces a barricade in using
mobile money due to English language barrier, the
attempt to explore various services offered will be
limited. We argue that individuals who can read Eng-
lish will be able to explore the variety of mobile
money services and therefore will be more likely to
use them. This reasoning follows from findings in
Wyche and Steinfield (2016) that depict that technol-
ogy based on the English language is difficult to oper-
ate for persons with low literacy. Furthermore, in their
study on the use of the internet, Lissitsa and
Chachashvili-Bolotin (2014) found that proficiency
in English facilitated variety of use of the Internet.
Research objectives
Dahlberg, Guo and Ondrus (2015) called for more
innovative context-specific constructs and approaches
into mobile payment research. In line with this call,
we add to the literature a new perspective on adoption
of mobile technology by highlighting the importance
of skills in the decision to use mobile money. In this
study, we also focus not only on the adoption decision
(whether one uses it or not) but also on what we term
variety of use of mobile money services. We define a
variety of use as the extent to which individuals
exploit the different functionalities of the mobile
money application. Previous studies exploring a vari-
ety of use in other domains, model this concept as a
complex behavior which involves higher cognitive
effort and points to the importance of studying this
notion more thoroughly (Leary et al., 2014; Shih and
Venkatesh, 2004). Nevertheless, what remainsunclear are the factors that hinder or support variety
of use of mobile money services.
Specifically, the research objectives for this study
are:
1. To examine the effect of mobile phone skills
and English proficiency on mobile money
adoption.
2. To assess the influence of mobile phone skills
and English proficiency on variety of use of
mobile money services.
Study hypotheses
H1- The higher the mobile phone skills an individual
possesses, the more likely that (s)he adopts mobile
money.
H2- The higher the mobile phone skills an individual
possesses, the larger the variety of mobile money ser-
vices (s)he will use.
H3- Having proficiency in English will positively influ-
ence adoption of mobile money.
H4- Proficiency in English will positively influence
variety of mobile money services use.
The remainder of the article is structured as fol-
lows. Following the methodology used in this study,
the results section is advanced by a discussion.
Finally, we present the implications arising from the
findings.
Methods
To test our hypotheses, we make use of data that was
collected via a survey in May 2015. Wakiso district
was purposively selected because it is the largest
district by population in Uganda. Wakiso has a pop-
ulation that is 13 %3higher than the capital city Kam-
pala, and it has a highly urbanized and accessible
population. Survey location was selected using a
multistage sampling pro cedure. In Uganda, urban
districts are divided into municipalities, divisions,
wards, and cells or sub-wards. Randomization was
used to select Entebbe out of the major administra-
tive units in Wakiso. Similarly, one division within
the selected municipality, one ward within the
selected division, and finally a list of sub-wards.
From this list, the first fiv e sub-wards were randomly
selected for the data collection (one can think of a
sub-ward as a village).
Within each of the five sub-wards, systematic
sampling of 50 households was done based on the4 Information Development XX(X)sub-ward’s population leading to a total of 250
sampled households. Based on the list of registered
households provided by the sub-ward’s local council
chairperson, the nth household was selected for an
interview. For instance, in Nakiwogo sub-ward that
had 576 registered households, every 11th household
(576/50) was selected for participation. Within each
household, one respondent was selected. Typically,
the person who opened the door was asked to par-
ticipate. If the person was under the age of 16, the
research assistant asked whether an adult was present.
In total, 47 of the 250 initially sampled households
refused or could not participate in the study. The
response rate was quite high (81.2 %). Some of
the reasons for non-cooperation were the fact that the
household head was not around and the potential par-
ticipant was not authorized to talk to strangers, a lack
of time on the respondent’s part, or being busy at the
moment of the interview. If a household was found to
have no individual to interview or a non-cooperative
individual, then the next-door household was consid-
ered for an interview.
The face-to-face interviews were conducted by six
trained Ugandan interviewers who visited partici-
pants’ homes and collected all information using the
Survey Gizmo tool (Survey Gizmo, 2006) on tablet
computers. The interviewers were selected and
trained for a day and a half in the use of the tablet
computers that were used to collect the responses,
the objectives of the data collection, and general
techniques for managing interviews. All inter-
viewers were MSc students who had previous expe-
rience with conducting social scientific research. At
the end of the data collection, a total of 249 inter-
views were finalized. Unfortunately, some inter-
views were lost because of a problem with
intermittent internet access. All in all, 41 surveys
were lost or not usable. The final number of valid
observations is 208.
Measures
The development of the survey included a back-and-
forth process with pre-testing of the questionnaire to
construct scales and evaluate whether or not items
were reliable and valid in the Ugandan context (pre-
tests were done on the street with mobile money users,
typically 10 users). Initially , self-perception scales
were developed to test for variables such as mobile
phone skills. However, they were prone to social
desirability. Therefore, the decision was made tofocus on abilities rather than self-perception. This
process took approximately two weeks. The instru-
ment was available in both English and the local lan-
guage, Luganda (the main spoken language in Central
Uganda) to ensure that questions were standardized
and not ambiguous.
Dependent variables
Mobile money adoption. Mobile money adoption is a
measurement of whether one uses or does not use the
technology. The variable Mobile Money Adoption is
a single item measure based upon the question “do
you currently use mobile money?” that was asked to
participants of the study, with the possible answers
being “yes” and “no”.
Variety of use of mobile money. Variety of use was mea-
sured based on the differe nt services available on
mobile money platforms in Uganda at the time of the
data collection. If respondents indicated that they used
mobile money, then they were subsequently asked
whether they used the following services: buy airtime
(“buying airtime” refers to the purchase of prepaid
mobile credit to make use of a cell phone); receive
money; send money; deposit / withdraw money, store
/ save money; pay for goods / receive payment for
goods; pay for bills, pay school fees; and transfer
money to/from a bank account.
Independent variables
Mobile phone skills. To test the participant’s actual
mobile phone skills, a 12-item scale was developed
based on the Actual Digita l Skills questionnaire
developed by the European Computer Driving
License (ECDL) in their 2009 report on digital lit-
eracy (ECDL, 2009). The instrument focuses on per-
sonal computer skills, and includes questions such as
“Which of the following is a portable storage
device?” and “Where would you click to attach a file
to an email?” The version developed for this study
focuses on mobile phone skills, with questions about
hardware functionality (“Which of these is most
likely failing if your phone loses power quickly?”)
and software related questions (“You want to send a
picture from your phone to a friend, which of these
systems does not allow you to do that?”). Questions
had varying degrees of difficulty. All items had five
possible options, one of which is correct. Participants
had the option to say they do not know the correct
answer (this option minimized guesswork). At the endKiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 5of the survey, all answers were recoded to ‘correct’ or
‘incorrect’.
English literacy. English literacy was measured using a
4-point Likert scale. Respondents’ were asked; “How
well can you read in English?” Response categories
were ‘Not at all, A little, Good, and, Very Good’.
Control variables. Several variables are included to con-
trol for possible confounding effects. These variables
were selected based on the existing literature on
mobile money adoption.
Mallat (2007) indicates that network externalities
can have a positive effect on the adoption of mobile
money services, depending on whether or not the
system is perceived as having enough users. The
existence of network externalities implies that when
more peers adopt mobile mo ney, the utility of adopt-
ing and using mobile money is increasing for an
individual as well.
Peer adoption. Ac o m m o ns u r v e ym e t h o di ns o c i a l
network research is the so-called name-generator
method (Marsden, 1990), which has been exten-
sively used in developing countries (for example,
Rooks, Klyver, and Sserwanga, 2016; Solano and
Rooks, 2018). In this method, respondents are asked
to list people with whom they interacted in a par-
ticular period. In this study, respondents were asked
‘Looking back over the last six months – who are
the people whom you have discussed important
matters with? Think of people in your family, in
your work, your friends, and so forth. It can be
anyone who you have talked recently and whose
opinion you consider to be important’. The inter-
viewer then noted names of these contacts. After
obtaining the list of names, the participant was
questioned about specific characteristics of each
contact he or she named. The variable network size
is the number of contacts mentioned in the name
generator.
A common practice when using name-generators is
the limitation of the maximum number of contacts, to
cope with time constraints in a survey while maintaining
measurement precision and minimizing measurement
bias (Sosa, 2011). For this study, the name-generator
was limited to a maximum of ten names.
For each contact mentioned in the name-generator,
we asked respondents ‘does [ contact name ]u s e
mobile money?’ Possible responses included, ‘yes;
no; and I don’t know’. Based on the informationgathered we calculated # peer adopters as the number
of contacts in a network of whom the respondent
knows that they use mobile money.
Demographic variables. Income influences have been
shown to sustain the use of mobile technology
(Crabbe et al., 2009). Mobile money is a financial
service, therefore users with a higher income are
expected to have a stronger need to use the system
a n di nm o r ev a r i e dw a y s .I n c o m ew a sm e a s u r e db y
asking the question “What is your current average
monthly income?” To control for social desirability
and provide for privacy, the participant was not
asked to provide the exact amount, but was given
the following categories: 0-100,000 UGX;
100,001-250,000 UGX; 250,001-500,000 UGX;
500,001-1,000,000 UGX; 1,000,001-2,000,000
UGX; >2,000,000 UGX. The exchange rate is 1
dollar to 3,629 Uganda shillings (UGX) using the
current exchange rate from Bank of Uganda4.
Finally, we included three other demographic vari-
ables in our analysis, Age, Gender, and whether one
has a bank account or not. We included them as con-
trol variables to test whether our hypotheses would
hold in the presence of these influences.
Results
Mokken scaling results
Variety of use of mobile money services. We tested the
scalability of the mobile money service items with
Mokken scale analysis, a non-parametric item-
response model (Gillespie et al., 1987). A Mokken
scale can be seen as a probabilistic version of Gutt-
man scaling (Van Schuur, 2003). Survey items of a
binary nature (yes or no items) form a Guttman scale
if the items can be arranged in a way that when an
answer to an item of a higher rank-order is one (or
yes), then answers to items of a lower rank-order are
likely to be one (or yes) as well. The resulting rank
order arranges the items from “functionalities that are
used by few users” to “functionalities that are used by
many users”. If these usage forms constitute a Mok-
ken scale, then users who pursue the more difficult
activities are probable to also pursue the easier activ-
ities. In our case, this implies that if the user transfers
money from/to a bank account”, which does not hap-
pen often, then this user will likely pay bills with
mobile money as well. The result of a Mokken scale
analysis is a hierarchy of use, which together consti-
tutes a scale, indicated by a measure of homogeneity6 Information Development XX(X)for the scale (H), a measure of fit for each item (Hi),
and reliability score ( r). In our Mokken scale analysis
one item, “send money”, had to be excluded, since it
was not scalable. In the final scale, the H coefficients
of all items are larger than .40, which is the standard
threshold for inclusion of items. The overall H-value
of the scale is 0.45, which suggests a medium-strong
scale. We checked whether model assumptions were
met and found no violation of the model assumptions.
All calculations were carried out using the software
MSPWIN version 5.0 (Molenaar and Sijtsma, 2000).
The variety of use variable thus consists of a score
ranging from zero (no adoption) to six (all six usage
forms are utilized).
Table 1 presents the result of the Mokken scaling
for a scale measuring variety of use of mobile
money.
Table 1 shows that receiving money is very com-
mon with 91 %of the participants. Many users treat
mobile money as a wallet, depositing money for a
short while (85 %). Buying airtime for mobile phone
use (pre-paid phone credit) is also common (73 %).
Less common are the functionalities to pay for goods
and bills (20 %and 29%respectively). Even less com-
mon is the use of mobile money for bank transfers
(6%). The final measure of variety of use is the sum of
the different services used for mobile money in
Uganda at the time of the data collection.
Mobile phone skills. Validity and reliability of the
instrument was once again checked using a Mokken
scale analysis (for an explanation of the Mokken
model see above). Test items 7, 2 and 11 were not
scalable, therefore were excluded. The mobile phone
skills variable thus consists of a score ranging from
zero (no skills) to nine (high skills). Table 2 presentsthe result of the Mokken scaling for mobile phone
skills. The final scale is strong and reliable with an
H-value of 0.50.
Table 2 shows that identification of a sim card,
hash and space buttons, as well as knowledge regard-
ing which part of a phone needs attention if it loses
power quickly, are the questions that were correctly
answered the most, with 96 %,9 4%,8 3%and 82%
respectively. Less known functionalities include what
a PUK code is, the use of iTunes and Google play,
Voicemail services, and knowledge on 3G technology
with 16 %,1 4%,9%and 2%respectively. Since the
test items “Battery”, “PUK code” and “3G Tech-
nology” were not scalable , we excluded these test
items. The final measure of mobile phone skills is the
sum of the different correct answers given by an indi-
vidual. The mobile phone skills variable thus
consists of a score ranging from zero (no skills) to
nine (high skills).
Descriptive statistics
Table 3 shows that 54 %of the respondents were
women and the average age of the respondents is 36
years. The average monthly income is 326,322 Ugan-
dan shillings which are approximately 90 United
States dollars at the current exchange rate. (1 dollar
to 3,629 Uganda shillings) On average, respondents
know 50 %of the functionalities on their phones, and
84%of the respondents use mobile money. Those that
adopted mobile money use, on average, 50 %of theTable 1. Results of Mokken scaling for variety of mobile

read English with an above average number of 11
years spent at school. The average number of contacts
per respondent is 5. Further, within an individual’s
network, about 4 people on average use mobile
money, and 51 %of the sample have a bank account.
Table 4 shows that adoption of mobile money and
variety of use have the same correlates. Therefore, an
increase in mobile phone skills, English literacy,
number of peer adopters, education, and having a
bank account may influence an increase in mobile
money adoption and variety of use.
These preliminary findings indicate a state of
inequality in access and use of mobile money
technology. The younger generation, individuals whoare more educated, those with access to formal financial
institutions (banks) and the male gender are in an advan-
taged position to utilize the mobile money technology.
Also, we observed high correlations, particularly
between English literacy and Education in number of
years spent in school (0.70), prompting the testing for
multicollinearity among independent variables in our
subsequent analyses. The Variance Inflation Factors
were all /C202.50 with a mean-variance inflation factor
of 1.72, indicating the absence of multicollinearity.

predictors (English literacy and mobile phone skills),
indicate that mobile phone skills are the only signif-
icant predictor of the two. ( b¼0.75 [4.10], p <
0.001). Model 3 includes both predictors, and it sup-
ports the above finding. Therefore, we conclude that
whereas hypothesis 1 is supported, hypothesis 3 is not
supported by our data.
Based on a model with only the significant predic-
tors of mobile money adoption (namely; mobile
phone skills, number of peer adopters and network
size), we estimated the probability that a person with
a certain level of mobile phone skills will adopt
mobile money. In order to do this, we use 10 cases,
where the mobile phone skill levels are varied based
on the Mokken scale analysis reported earlier (0 - 9),
and the number of adopters and network size is held at
the sample mean of four (4) and five (5) respectively.
The predictive probabilities in Figure 1 show that
the difference between a person who has zero skills
and a person with low skills (0 vs 3) is almost 49
percentage points (0.74- 0.25). Compare this to the
difference between medium-skilled and low skilled
respondents (3 vs 6) of 20 %(0.96- 0.74). This indi-
cates that helping individuals at the beginning of
mobile phone acquisition to acquire basic (low skills)
such as, ‘what do the buttons on your phone repre-
sent’; ‘where to locate the hash button on your phone’,
can have a drastic effect on the use of mobile-based
applications, an effect that is larger than helping low
skilled persons achieve a medium-skilled level.
Increasing a medium level of mobile phone skills toa higher level does not seem to have much relevance
to the adoption of mobile money, as seen by the low
increment in probabilities of adoption (0.96 to 0.99).
Variety of mobile money use analysis
The linear regression results predicting the variety of
use of mobile money are presented in Table 6. Dis-
tinctions between the explained variance of each of
the two main predictors are shown in Models 4 and 5,
similar to the results in Table 5. Model 6, which con-
tains all the constructs, shows that neither mobile
phone skills nor English literacy predicts the variety
of use of mobile money, ( b¼0.08, t¼1.46, p >0.05);
(b¼0.15, t¼1.30, p >0.05) therefore H2 and H4 are
not supported by the data.
Furthermore, model 6 shows that the number of
peer adopters in an individual’s network positively
influences variety of use, ( b¼0.13, t ¼2.37,
p<0.05). Hence, the higher the number of contacts
an individual has that use mobile money, the more
likely that the person will also use many services of
the mobile money platform. Mobile phones are
mainly used among one’s network, and therefore, it
is not surprising that mobile money transactions too,
seem to rotate within individual networks. Not only
do networks present occasions to learn about mobile
money services, but also provide opportunities to exe-
cute various transactions because you possess a net-
work that understands and uses the technology.

fold. First, we analyze skills as determinants of the
adoption of mobile financial technology, consistent
with earlier suggestions in the literature. Secondly,
we extend existing studies by also investigating deter-
minants of variety of use. Thus, we not only focus on
the adoption decision in isolation but also study how
people use it.
Our results show that mobile phone skills are
indeed an essential driver in the adoption of mobile
financial technology in Uganda, whereas theimportance of English language skills is much smaller
or non-existing. These results could be pertinent to
Ugandan policymakers and other developing econo-
mies faced with the dilemma of low adoption rates of
mobile money. Through providing a basis to create
relevant solutions tailored to improving mobile phone
skills, the uptake of mobile money services can be
improved. The results also show that it is pertinent
to include users and their capabilities in the develop-
ment of mobile technology services (Dahlberg, Guo
and Ondrus, 2015).

are all positive mobile technology effects that have

Discussion
This article advances research on adoption and use of
mobile phone applications in developing countries by
focusing on skills of individuals, specifically mobile
phone skills and English literacy. We argued that
skills will affect adoption and use in two ways,
namely; [1] the higher the mobile phone skills an
individual has, the more likely the individual will
adopt and subsequently make use of the various ser-
vices offered by mobile money; [2] the higher the
English language profici ency of an individual, the
more likely s(he) will adopt mobile money and use
more services offered by the technology.
The findings corroborate that individuals who are
skilled at using a mobile phone will find it easier to
operate the mobile money technology, more so in
developing economies where the ubiquity of mobile
phones is rising (De Albuquerque et al., 2016), and
illiteracy levels are still high (Gebremichael and Jack-
son, 2006; Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions, 2016a; Matotay and Furuholt, 2010; West,
2012). Thus, skills are an important consideration in
use of mobile financial technology products. There is
a need for policymakers to enhance skills and subse-
quently adoption and usability of the technology for
financial inclusion.
This study is the first to systematically demonstrate
the importance of basic mobile phone skills in the use
of mobile financial services in a developing country.
Our results provide an empirical corroboration of pre-
vious non-empirical speculation of the importance of
skills in technology adop tion (Alampay and Bala,
2010; Donovan, 2012; Medhi et al., 2009; Tobbin,
2012; Wyche and Steinfield, 2016). Though the above
studies provided a platform on which this study is
based, our study is different from the above studies
as we develop a measurem ent scale to test actual
mobile phone skills and consider these in relation toactual usage of mobile money services in a develop-
ing country context.
Findings show that though mobile phone skills are
important for initial adoption, they are not relevant for
the subsequent use of other services over the same
platform. Mobile money transactions follow an iden-
tical format; therefore if an individual learns to carry
out one transaction, it is highly likely that transfer
learning will occur and one can follow sequential
instructions to execute other transactions. This could
explain why mobile phone skills are not crucial for
variety of use.
Rather surprisingly, English language proficiency
showed a positive trend though not significant for the
adoption of mobile money. Mobile money is a pre-
dominantly English- based platform. Therefore, it was
expected that persons endowed with more skills
regarding English literacy would be better-suited to
use this particular technology. However, our findings
show that this is not the case.
Our analysis suggests an explanation of this result.
Further quantitative analysis using the covariates,
specifically, social influence reveals that individuals
can execute transactions possibly through social net-
works which provide tech-support regarding aware-
ness, information provision, and actual hands-on
facilitation. Murendo et al. (2018) confirmed the
above reasoning. In other words, relatives, friends,
and acquaintances of less tech-savvy mobile money
users assist them to use mobile money, either using it
on their behalf (proxy use) or through teaching them
how to use it. The above phenomenon could explain
why English proficiency might not be a requirement
to use mobile money.
Anecdotal evidence from previously mentioned
studies (Donovan, 2012; Medhi et al., 2009) and our
fieldwork (informal qualitative inquiry carried out
after the interviews), further support the above find-
ings. This anecdotal evidence showed that illiterate
individuals find mobile technology solutions through
constant repetition, trial and error and not necessarily
through understanding the underlying dynamics. For
example, individuals may have the ability to complete
a transaction, but may lack the capacity to compre-
hend the confirmation message received thereafter
from the service providers (Wyche and Steinfield,
2016). Similarly, the use of mobile money agents as
intermediaries in the transaction process facilitates
low literate users to carry out transactions.
Notwithstanding the above social support, mobile
money is a financial tool where access is by “secretKiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 11codes” commonly referred to as PIN (Personal Iden-
tification Numbers) codes. Therefore, the risk of fraud
arising from third party assistance and support
through proxy use is imminent. Thus, it is pertinent
that individuals can operate the technology on their
own. Arguably, skills can be derived from social net-
works (Cross and Cummings, 2004; Kikulwe et al.,
2014; Kreindler and Young, 2014; Murendo et al.,
2018) and future studies being undertaken by the
researchers will shed more light on the mechanisms
through which individuals acquire mobile money
skills through their social networks.
This article has some limitations. The study was
cross-sectional and beca use it was constrained by
resources, it focused on an urban sample. The urban
sample depicted an above average level of literacy,
though this could explain the irrelevancy of English
literacy in explaining adoption and use in this study. It
would be more enriching if a rural sample where illit-
eracy largely affects the population segment was used
to investigate further the effect of skills on the use of
mobile money. Future research should look into the
dynamics of skills and their role in technology use
between these two different settings.
In addition, to use mobile money, one needs mobile
money skills. These are the direct skills to use the
technology. However, to acquire these skills, an indi-
vidual needs to know how to operate a mobile phone.
In this study, we used mobile phone skills as a pre-
cursor to using mobile money. It would be prudent to
test and measure mobile money skills and further
examine whether these two skills are different from
one another. Future research could focus on exploring
the differences and effects of these two skills on the
use of mobile money technology.
Implications
Skills are an integral part of the adoption process of
mobile financial technology
The practical implications emerging from our study
indicate the need for policymakers to promote skills
and literacy for the adoption and use of technology.
We live in a digital world, and the inequality in who
can access and use digital technology is wider in
developing economies (Aron, 2015; Wei and Zhang,
2008). With clear evidence from this study, the indi-
viduals with access to skills, literacy, and income are
in advantaged position for the adoption of mobile
money. Though these indicator constructs are posi-
tive, this status quo defeats the original purpose of themobile money innovation, which was to include the
“poorest of the poor” in the financial circle. It is thus
of vital importance to mitigate the causes of this
inequality and find solutions to reduce this divide.
Target specific technology needs of users through
assessing their skill levels
With the surging move to use of technology in the
financial domain, financial education and literacy
have received consensus as instruments to enable the
poor better understand and u tilize financial products
such as mobile money (Carpena et al., 2015). How-
ever, at the root of the problem is not the intention or
structure of the education c ampaigns, but the failure
to observe the cause of ineffectiveness in the educa-
tion programs (Kaiser and Menkhoff, 2017). This
study sheds light on one of the sources of ineffective
education campaigns. The lack of prior skills. “A
teachable moment” as described by Miller et al.
(2015) can be adopted by assessing skill levels of
individuals, determined using the measurement scale
developed in studies such as this, to assess cognitive
limitations and give contextualized and relevant
training that maximizes the behavioral change in a
target group.
Change-agents through social networks
Additionally, policymakers should initiate and foster
social network activities in various population seg-
ments in order to create focus groups for mobile
money adoption and diffusion. They also could iden-
tify opinion leaders who could then act as change
agents in smaller communities. Future research can
build on our findings by elaborating the network per-
spective and applying other perspectives that take into
account the effects of social influences and the
broader social context for explaining the adoption of
mobile money and other important innovations. Also,
similar research needs to be repeated in other African
countries to find out whether network characteristics
matter there as well.
The need for usability studies on mobile
financial technology
In respect of financial inclusion technology products
and service providers and the wider technology com-
munity, the findings provide information on user
behavior in developing economies. Debatably, there
is a general impression that attitudes towards using12 Information Development XX(X)technology are stimulated by numerous factors. How-
ever, this study clearly shows that in developing coun-
tries, adoption and continued use of technology is
mainly a function of requisite skills to operate the
technology. As these mobile technology solutions
advance, systems and services providers should con-
sider not only the additional value of their technology
but also how practical it is for an individual to use.
Usability studies should be a prudent requirement for
release of new technology to the market more so in
emerging countries.
