Abstract
Purpose –Mobile money, a service permitting monetary value to be digitally stored in a mobile phone and
transacted to others through text messaging, is increasingly becoming available in several African countries
including Eswatini. This study examines the factors associated with mobile money usage and the extent towhich mobile money accelerates financial inclusion in Eswatini.
Design/methodology/approach –Data were collected from the nationally representative FinScope
Consumer Survey for Eswatini conducted in 2014. The authors use a quasi-experimental method in propensityscore matching (PSM) with bootstrapped standard errors to alleviate the possibility of selection bias associated
with mobile money use and bank account ownership. As a sensitivity check, the authors calculate the average
treatment effect (ATE) using kernel-based matching methods, as well as estimate a multilevel model thataccounts for the hierarchical structure of data.
Findings –The authors found that higher education, entrepreneurship, being female, improvement in work
situation in the past year and living in urban area and in the Lubombo region all positively influence theprobability to use mobile money. The results also show that individuals who use mobile money are 19% more
likely to own a bank account at a formal financial institution with a higher probability estimate observed
amongst rural residents.
Originality/value –This study examines whether mobile money accelerates financial inclusion in Eswatini.
On analysing data from the 2014 FinScope Consumer Survey, the results show that mobile money does not
seem to be accelerating the reach of financial services to those who are structurally excluded from the formalfinancial system and suggest the need for ongoing review of the financial inclusion strategies of the country to
enhance access to financial services in underserved areas.

Mobile money, a service that facilitates the storage and transfer of money digitally through
mobile phone, has increasingly become available in several countries in Africa including
Eswatini (known as Swaziland in the past). There is a growing consensus concerning the
myriad of benefits associated with using this technology, some of which include povertyMobile money

control of payment systems and reduction in communication costs ( Corbett, 2008 ;Aker and
Mbiti, 2010 ;Pollard, 1995 ). Inclusive finance impacts the ways in which communities and
individuals participate in the economic development process ( Leyshon and Thrift, 1994 ).
Thus, while it is possible that communities with banking infrastructures generally exhibit
faster growth rates on an average, a mere presence of banks may not necessarily be a
sufficient condition for overall economic growth and development.
Access to banking infrastructure remains an issue of concern in several sub-Saharan
African (SSA) countries including Eswatini, especially in rural and remote communities where
an estimated 60% of the population resides ( World bank, 2019 ). Having banking
infrastructures in rural areas is less likely to be a cost-effective strategy for development,
given that a significant part of the rural population does not have regular incomes and hence,
a low volume of financial transactions is expected. This is where mobile money comes into
play as a potential accelerator for financial inclusion, especially amongst the financially
excluded segment of the population. Increasing the reach of financial services to the
underserved population has the potential of reducing vulnerability from economic shocks
through increased incomes in the broader economy, thus, reducing poverty and overall
welfare. In 2010, the Government of Eswatini established the Microfinance Unit, through the
Ministry of Finance, to implement the Rural Finance and Enterprise Development Programme
(RFEDP) ( FinMark Trust, 2014 ). The 2014 National Consumer Survey for Eswatini suggests
that an estimated 64% of the Liswati adult population owns a bank account at a formal
financial institution. While this is a positive development, there are still barriers that render
certain societal groups structurally excluded from participation in the formal financial system.
The uptake and success of mobile money has been inconsistent across individual
countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region ( Fanta et al., 2016 ).
A fundamental question is whether using mobile money is contributing to enhancing
financial inclusion in Eswatini. Mobile money is a service that facilitates the cheap and secure
transfer of money electronically through mobile phones and is premised to advance the
financial inclusion agenda ( Jack and Suri, 2011 ). Previous studies have shown that using
mobile money increases the probability of borrowing, receiving ( Munyegera and Matsumoto,
2018) and saving money for health emergencies ( Kyet al., 2018 ). However, in the context of
Eswatini, not much is known about the specific factors influencing mobile money usage and
the extent to which it is an accelerator for financial inclusion.
The analyses focuses on Eswatini, particularly given that the rate of mobile money usage/
uptake was considered low when compared to other countries using survey data collected by
the FinScope Consumer Survey in 2014 and estimated to be around 21% ( FinMark Trust,
2014). The Government of Eswatini through its central bank has implemented several
initiatives targeted at enhancing financial inclusion in the country including the
establishment of a National Payment System (NPS) in 2000 targeted at facilitating
improved access to financial services by the underbanked and unbanked segments of the
population ( Central bank of Swaziland, 2016 ). The National Financial Inclusion Strategy
(NFIS), 2017 –2022, was also created to further increase the depth of financial inclusion in the
country ( Government of Swaziland, 2017 ). The focus on the determinants of financial
inclusion in Eswatini is consistent in large part to the objectives articulated in the NFI
strategy. The Centre for Financial Inclusion –the agency responsible for the implementation
of the Eswatini National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) –released the results of the
FinScope Consumer Survey of 2018 in MTN (2019) and showed that mobile money usage
increased by 28% to 71%. The results also show that bank account coverage declined from
54% in 2014 to 50% in 2018. The survey also shows that enhancing financial inclusion is not
only a question of increasing supply, but of understanding the nature of demand of financial
products, developing products and services that more effectively meet the needs of the people.IJSE

694This study examines the factors associated with mobile money usage and its implications
on financial inclusion in Eswatini. Our contributions to the broader literature on mobile
money in low-income countries are twofold. First, we characterise the specific factors
associated with mobile money usage in Eswatini. Second, we examine the extent to which
mobile money usage accelerates financial inclusion or substitutes formal financial services in
Eswatini using the propensity score matching method (PSM) to account for the possibility
that some observed and unobserved factors might be driving the decision to use mobile
money and own a bank account at a financial institution. To the best of our knowledge, we are
unaware of any studies that explore these issues in the context of Eswatini. The empirical
analysis uses the nationally representative individual household-level data set from the 2014
FinScope Consumer Survey for Eswatini.
1.1 Background: mobile money in Eswatini
Mobile money access and usage have evolved in Eswatini over the past few years. The 2018
FinScope Consumer Survey suggests that mobile money usage has increased by an estimated
28% to 70% between 2014 and 2018. Mobile money users can withdraw their funds from any
automated teller machine (ATM) of participating banks, in addition to access through service
agents. Swazi MTN, in collaboration with Old Mutual, also offers users of the service the
opportunity to qualify for funeral assistance ( Mutual, 2018 ). Users can transfer mobile money
to another subscriber at least once a month (for a year) in order to qualify for SZL500 funeral
assistance, three to four times a month to qualify for SZL1, 500 assistance and more than five
times a month to qualify for SZL 2,000 assistance —an amount that can be claimed for a
period up to 12 months. Swazi MTN is also piloting a “tap and pay ”system, which enables
mobile money users to pay at point-of-sale machines using mobile money cards ( Observer,
2017). All these are examples of efforts by local banks in close partnership with the central
bank that are targeted at enhancing financial inclusion in the country.
1.2 Access and usage of mobile money in Eswatini
In Figure A1 of the supplementary material, the value of mobile money transactions is high
with an average of SZL57.0 million being deposited per month from October 2014 to
December 2016. This value indicates that mobile money is a valuable platform for money
transfers in Eswatini. The value of both withdrawals and deposits has been steadily
increasing, with troughs seeming to occur regularly towards the end of each year. This may
be because towards the end of the year fewer remittances are made as people working far
from home return to their homesteads for the end-of-year holidays, only returning to work
after New Year ’s Day. Initially, the value of deposits was larger than the value of transactions,
but in April 2015, a switch occurred and deposits have been consistently lower than
withdrawals. In Figure A1 of the supplementary material, withdrawals constitute the
majority of mobile money transactions. Even though making mobile money withdrawalsaccessible through ATMs has certainly alleviated the agent liquidity challenge, this may also
work to disincentivise the active agents, particularly those in urban centres within the
proximity of the ATMs (see Figure A1).
1.3 Mobile money service agents in Eswatini
Figure A2 in the supplementary material shows the distribution of service agents and active
customers between October 2014 and January 2017. It appears that there is a large disparity
between the cumulative number of active customers and service agents. Additionally, the
growth in service agents must be taken with a grain of salt owing to high agent dormancy
rates. Only 60% of registered agents were considered as active in 2015 ( FinMark Trust, 2014 ).
Majority of the current mobile money agents are converted airtime resellers, and this
indicates a lack of incentive to register to be an agent (see Figure A2). Recently, Swazi MTNMobile money
695faced a number of challenges regarding its service agent network –most of which emanated
from the lack of a coherent agent recruitment and management structure. Agent liquidity
problems and the unavailability of agents on Sundays and public holidays were a big
hindrance to the efficiency of the mobile money service ( Shongwe Sam, 2017 ). Mobile money
thrives because of the convenience it offers, and once that is compromised, consumers may
stop using the service.
1.4 Mobile money transactions in Eswatini
Figure A3 of the supplementary material breaks down the type of transfers carried out from
October 2014 to December 2016. Here, we observe that mobile money is predominantly used
for person-to-person transfers. This is not surprising since mobile money was introduced as a
platform for personal money transfers. Owing to its success in Eswatini, mobile money is now
being promoted for business use. According to the Observer (2017) , MTN offers a retail
product for business owners and landlords. MTN assigns businesses a unique number, like
an account number, to be used by clients when making payments. MTN does not provide any
specific incentives to business owners using mobile money to receive or make payments. The
regulation on the mobile thresholds for the mobile money transactions per customer
(maximum SZL4,000 per day and SZL25,000 per month) was not amenable for the business-
to-person transaction. Therefore, both factors may possibly explain why mobile money is not
extensively used for business transactions. Business-to-person transfers are the least
common, but this may be because instances in which businesses need to pay individuals are
uncommon. Typically, transactions are made by a client to a business in payment for a
service or good delivered.
2. Related literature
In line with the study ’s objectives, we structure the literature review into three sections: (1)
that focussing on examining the factors associated with mobile money usage, (2) a strand
exploring the associations of mobile money with other outcome variables and (3) another
strand providing a brief overview of studies on the merits and demerits of mobile money
usage. The development of mobile money in SSA started in Kenya in 2007 when M-Pesa –a
cell phone-based money transfer system/technology that permits individuals to deposit, send
and withdraw funds with relative ease and convenience –was launched ( Jack and Suri, 2011 ).
The popularity of this mobile service in SSA is especially interesting because it was
unanticipated by the research community and financial sector ( Etzo and Collender, 2010 ).
While a lot has been written about the merits and demerits of mobile money ( Aker and Mbiti,
2010;Donovan, 2012 ;Allen et al. , 2014 ), we briefly discuss the factors associated with its
usage and its role in financial inclusion. The consensus in much of the available evidence so
far is that mobile money improves financial inclusion, especially amongst the poor and low-
income groups of the population, given its affordability and convenience in access.
Previous literature has documented several factors associated with mobile money usage,
some of which include (just as examples) differences in income, access to information through
social media platforms and improved literacy ( Sarma and Pais, 2011 ). The idea is that
countries that exhibit higher levels of per capita income, literacy and have better access to
information tend to be more financially inclusive than those experiencing low levels of such
factors. Broadly, research evidence suggests that factors associated with mobile money
usage can be classified into what can be considered structure-based, policy-oriented and
individual-level factors. Structural-level factors are those that create enabling opportunities
for financial inclusion and are related to how the economic, social, policy environment is
organised or structured to enhance financial inclusion. Policy-oriented factors deal with
specific policies that target, for instance, improved bank competitiveness to enhance financial
inclusion ( Demirg €uç-Kunt and Klapper, 2013 ;Allen et al., 2016 ). Individual-level factors on theIJSE
47,6
696other hand include sociodemographic factors such as the age, gender, employment and
education status of individuals ( Suri and Jack, 2016 ;Mattson and Stuart, 2018 ). In a study
conducted amongst women entrepreneurs in Kenya, Gichuki and Mulu-Mutuku (2018) found
that membership to table banking groups, control of enterprise finances and decision-making
all increased the prospect of adoption of mobile money services in the country. However, the
study noted that women were less likely to adopt mobile money when the technology was
likely to be distant from their communities ( Gichuki and Mulu-mutuku, 2018 ).
The empirical literature has also linked mobile money to several outcomes including
financial inclusion ( Aron, 2018 ). Recent empirical evidence has shown that increased mobile
money usage has helped to enhance the probability of saving, borrowing and receipt of
remittances within the population in Uganda and Nigeria ( Munyegera and Matsumoto, 2018 ;
Lwanga Mayanja and Adong, 2016 ;Ajefu and Ogebe, 2019 ), while in Burkina Faso mobile
money usage was associated with increased savings for health emergencies ( Kyet al., 2018 ).
A recent review featured in the World Bank Research Observer singled out risk-sharing
behaviour as an important channel through which mobile money influences economic
activity. The study including others also concluded that mobile money fosters risk-sharing
behaviour and promotes welfare and savings, even though the latter evidence was considered
less robust ( Aron, 2018 ;Jack and Suri, 2014 ;Aker and Mbiti, 2010 ;Ouma et al. , 2017 ;
Munyegera and Matsumoto, 2016 ). In related research for Kenya, mobile money usage was
associated with increased per capita consumption, subsequently lifting an estimated 2% of
households out of poverty ( Suri and Jack, 2016 ).
Even though the literature has documented several benefits associated with mobile money
adoption as noted earlier, there are potential challenges hindering the growth of this
technology in developing countries, as banks face difficulties with reducing transaction costs
to affordable levels to increase uptake by the poor ( Fanta et al., 2016 ). A substantial body of
literature has qualitatively explored the merits of mobile money with very few studies
looking at the drawbacks and potential concerns of the digital service. Understanding the
limitations of mobile money as a service is essential information for economic development
(Etzo and Collender, 2010 ). One of the concerns around usage of mobile money has been that
using this technology as a savings vehicle is problematic given that the service pays zero
interest, thereby discouraging its use for that purpose ( Mas and Morawczynski, 2009 ). Others
have argued that using mobile money has the potential to widen the gap between the poor
and poorest ( Etzo and Collender, 2010 ). Others have also noted some challenges with the
digital technology ’s user interface as a potential barrier for using the service especially
amongst the illiterate individuals ( Medhi et al., 2009 ).
The goal in this study is to examine the relationship between mobile money usage and
financial inclusion in Eswatini –a country where we know very little about this nexus. As a
secondary objective of the study, we examine the factors associated with mobile money usage.
All analyses were done using nationally representative individual-level data for Eswatini.
3. Methods
3.1 Data source
The data for the empirical analysis were collected from the 2014 FinScope Consumer Survey
–a nationally representative survey of the general Eswatini population. Developed by
FinMark Trust and conducted in 19 countries including Eswatini, the survey seeks to
measure the levels of financial inclusion, describes the landscape of access, as well as
identifies the drivers and barriers of the use of financial products and services ( FinMark
Trust, 2014 ). In Eswatini, the survey serves as an essential research tool designed to identify
the specific barriers contributing to financial access disparities especially amongst the
underserved populations and provides a benchmark for ongoing surveys that measure theimpact of policy interventions related to access of financial services in the country. TheMobile money
697survey has been conducted in 19 countries to date including Zimbabwe, Zambia and South
Africa amongst several others.
The 2014 FinScope Consumer Survey consisted of 3,440 face-to-face interviews conducted
by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), with technical assistance received from FinMark Trust.
The survey was conducted on a nationally representative sample of the adult population aged
18 years and above in Eswatini. The survey relies on a multistage sampling design, in which
enumeration areas from population estimates are selected using a probability proportional to
size sampling procedure. About 6 –10 households are then randomly selected from each
shortlisted enumeration area using a systematic sampling with one representative individual,
then chosen per household using the Kish grid ( FinMark Trust, 2014 ).
3.2 Measuring financial inclusion and mobile money usage
The outcome variable in this study is a measure of financial inclusion, captured using a
binary indicator variable taking 1 if an individual currently owns a bank account and
0 otherwise. Each respondent in our study was asked the question: “which services do you
use in cell phones? ”Responses to this question ranged from SMS services, calls, the Internet,
mobile banking or mobile money amongst others. We use responses to this question to createa binary indicator equaling 1 if an individual indicated that they used mobile money on their
cell phone and 0 otherwise. Other explanatory variables included in our models are detailed in
the empirical model section.
3.3 Econometric approach
The empirical analysis in this study seeks to estimate the potential causal association
between mobile money usage and financial inclusion –measured by whether an individual
respondent has access to bank account or not as observed at the time of the survey. However,
estimating the causal effect of mobile money usage on financial inclusion poses some
econometric challenges since we cannot simultaneously observe the outcomes for the same
individuals in treatment and control groups ( Heckman, 1996 ,Heckman and ROBB, 1985 ). For
instance, in our study, we can only observe the outcomes for individuals using mobile money,
but we cannot observe the results for the same individuals in both states simultaneously. The
ideal solution to this problem will be to implement some kind of randomised controlled
experiment, in which individuals with similar observable characteristics are assigned to atreatment group (having access to mobile money) and control group (no access to mobile
money). However, in the absence of randomised control data, standard practice is to use
quasi-experimental methods such as PSM methods to consistently estimate an average
treatment effect (ATE) of the intervention or treatment.
The analysis here uses the PSM technique to assess the possible causal impact of mobile
money usage on the probability that an indi vidual currently owns a bank. In essence, PSM
creates statistically comparable treatment and control groups that are similar in observable
characteristics and differing only in their av erage probability in access to mobile money
(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985 ;Rosenbaum, 2002 ). The approach is a two-step procedure in
which the first step involves the estimation of a propensity score, pðXÞ(i.e. the probability
that an individual uses mobile money) using s tandard non-linear models such as probit or
logit and controlling for a vector of observable characteristics ( X). The characteristics ( X)
we include are gender (1 if female); age (years) a n di t ss q u a r e dt e r m ;e d u c a t i o n a la t t a i n m e n t
(none, primary, secondary, high school/vocational or college/university); geographical
location (Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni and Lubombo); marital status (1 if married);
employment situation (1 if work situation im proved in the past year); household headship
(1 if head); proportion of households with a ccess to information via television or radio
within a given enumeration area and an ur ban residence dummy indicator. The second
stage involves matching individuals from ho useholds using mobile money to non-users ofIJSE
47,6
698mobile money. A comparison of the fraction of individuals who own a bank account in the
treatment and control groups can then be attributed to the impact of mobile money, and that
selection into the programme is sorely based on the vector Xof observed covariates.
3.4 The average treatment effect on the treated
To minimise the potential bias due to the possible endogeneity of mobile money (our
treatment variable, pmoney ), we use the PSM technique as explained earlier. Endogeneity in
this case implies that there are some observed characteristics that drive mobile money usethat are correlated with unobserved characteristics influencing bank account ownership.
Thus, the simultaneous determination of financial inclusion and mobile money usage is the
primary source of the endogeneity problem here. Alternatively, the endogeneity problem
might as well emanate from an omitted-variable bias. A potential solution to this problem is
the use of instrumental variables ( Kyet al., 2018 ). However, given the challenge associated
with getting appropriate instrumental variables, we resort to using quasi-experimental
methods. Formally defined, let Fin
1iandFin 0idenote the outcome variables for individuals in
treated and control groups, respectively. Define pmoney ∈f0;1gas the binary indicator for
the treatment –mobile money usage. Following Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) , the propensity
score pðXÞcan be specified as follows:
pðXÞ¼probðpmoney ¼1jXÞ¼Eðpmoney jXÞ (1)
where Xis a vector of observed characteristics believed to influence mobile money usage,
which we have described earlier. Using the propensity score pðXÞcalculated in Equation (1) ,
the ATE on the treated ðdATT Þcan thus be specified as follows:
dATT ¼EfFin 1i/C0Fin 0ijpmoney i¼1g¼E½EfFin 1i/C0Fin 0ijpmoney i¼1;pðXÞg/C138
¼E½EfY1ijpmoney i¼1;pðXÞg /C0 EfFin 0ijpmoney i¼0;pðXÞgjpmoney i¼1/C138
(2)
Equation (2) shows the average effect of the treatment, if the conditional independence (CIA)
and overlap assumption holds. The CIA assumes random programme participation given the
observed covariate Xand can be written as ðFin 1;Fin 0⊥pmoney jXÞ. The overlap
assumption implies that for each X, there are corresponding control and treatment
observations, that is, f0< Prob ½pmoney ¼1jX/C138<1g.
3.5 The nearest-neighbor matching method
The second stage in the PSM technique involves matching treatment observations to control
units. This paper uses the widely employed matching algorithm –the one-to-one nearest-
neighbor (NN-1) matching technique with replacement and within a specified caliper. The main
idea in this matching method is that the propensity score of each treatment unit is matched to
the closest control case with a propensity score closest in value to it. The NN matching
estimator with replacement and within a caliper can formally be specified as follows:
dATT ¼1
N1X
i¼1fFin i/C0Fin jg (3)
For a given caliper of size w>0;jis selected such that,
w>jpðXiÞ/C0pðXjÞj ¼ min k∈IfjpðXiÞ/C0pðXjÞjgMobile money
699Any control observation joutside the caliper wradius of the treated observation iwill be left
unmatched and thus excluded from the analysis. The analysis in this study uses the NN
observation within the w¼0:0025 radius to create the counterfactual for each treatment unit
i. To enhance precision in the calculated estimates, bootstrapped standard errors using 500
replications are calculated.
3.6 Robustness checks
We conducted several sensitivity checks to enhance the credibility of our empirical estimates.
First, we re-estimated the ATE using a kernel-based matching method with bootstrapped
standard errors using 500 replications. Second, we used a propensity score-based weighted
regression in which the propensity score is used as a sampling weight, also known as inverse
probability weighting ( Kumar and Vollmer, 2013 ;Holmes, 2014 ). This is a commonly used
method in the programme evaluation literature ( Hirano and Imbens, 2001 ;Hirano et al., 2003 ;
Rosenbaum, 1987 ;Kumar and Vollmer, 2013 ). Finally, we estimated a three-level mixed
model in which individuals (level 1 units) are nested in enumeration areas (level 2 units) and
regions (level 3 units). For brevity, results for the robustness checks are presented as
supplementary materials (see Tables A1 –A3). All data management and analysis were
conducted using Stata, version 15.1, with the matching procedure completed using the user-
written command, psmatch2 , while multilevel mixed models were estimated using xtmixed
command ( Statacorp, 2017 ).
4. Results
4.1 Characteristics of the overall sample before propensity score matching
Table 1 provides the prematching summary characteristics for the overall sample and stratified
by mobile money use status. The unit of analysis is the individual respondent interviewed in
the 2014 FinMark Consumer Survey. The average age of individuals in our sample is 51.35
years, 43.7% are female and 38.2% are married and live in households with an average of three
(3.23) people. In terms of educational attainment, 11.6% report having no formal education,
24.9% completed primary, 25.2% secondary, 28.2% high school/vocational and 10.1%
attended college/university level. Bank account ownership is about 54.5% in the overall sample;
the average ownership of radio sets within an enumeration area was 65%, while that of
television sets was 53.8%. Nearly 35.6% of the respondents experienced an improvement in
their work situation in the previous years, 19.4% own a formal or informal business, 49% are
heads of household and 22.9% live in an urban area with the distribution by regions almost
similar. The t-test for the differences between users and non-users of mobile money reveal
significant differences in terms of age, household size, education, access to information through
the television and radio, improvement in work situation and urban residence.
InFigure 1 , we plot local polynomial regressions exploring the associations amongst
mobile money usage, current bank account ownership and educational attainment. We
observe a clear education gradient in mobile money usage and the probability of currently
having a bank account. The results in Figure 1 show that the propensity of using mobile
money and owning a bank account rises with increasing education, with individuals having
college or university education having the highest probability. This observation is consistent
across all the four regions of Eswatini.
4.2 What are the factors associated with mobile money usage in Eswatini?
InTable 1 , we also report the probit regression estimates (shown in column (5)) together with
their standard errors (column (6)), including the corresponding marginal probability effects
(ME) for the model exploring the factors associated with mobile money usage in Eswatini.IJSE
47,6
700This is the model that generates the propensity score that is used for the matching procedure.
The results show that the propensity to use mobile money decreases with age of the
respondent and when the head of household has no formal education. Particularly, we
observe that each additional year decreases the probability of using mobile money by 0.2
percentage points (pp) which is statistically significant at the 1% level. The likelihood of
mobile money usage decreases by 11.8pp, when the head of household has no formal
education. In addition, the propensity to use mobile money increases by about 10.3pp and
18.5pp for individuals with high school/vocational and college/university education,
respectively. An individual who owns a business, whether formal or informal, is 4.3pp
more likely to use mobile money, while an improvement in the employment situation in the
previous years enhances the probability for mobile money usage by about 3.2pp. Individuals
living in an urban area are 4.2pp more likely to use mobile money than their rural
counterparts are. People living in the Lubombo region are on the average 5.2pp more likely toMaximum

4.3 Quality of the PSM
Table 2 shows the differences in the mean values of the treatment and control groups. The
matching process should result in a significant reduction in the bias to make the two groups
of users and non-users of mobile money comparable ensuring the overall balance of the
covariates. The results in Table 2 indicate that the matching process resulted in a significant
reduction in the bias and that the treatment and control groups are statistically similar in
terms of observable characteristics. The t-values of below two (2) and corresponding p-values
well above the 0.05 threshold for statistical significance at 5% confirm the similarity of the
treatment and control groups.
One of the necessary conditions required for a successful matching process is the
fulfilment of the overlap condition. In other words, there needs to be a sufficient overlap of the
propensity score across treatment and control groups ( Rosenbaum, 2002 ). The visual
inspection of the density distribution of the propensity score in Figure 2 indicates a
sufficient overlap between the two groups and thus satisfies the required overlap condition
of the PSM method. In addition, comparing the density distribution of the propensity
scores before and after the matching reveals that the matching process was successful
(seeFigure 3 ).Note(s): The figure plots local regressions of mobile money usage and 
current bank account ownership on educational attainment. The 
dependent variable in the left panel is a binary indicator for mobile

dependent variable. The graphs represent the raw relationships between 
the variables. Education categories: 1 = no education, 2 = primary education,

7024.4 Mobile money usage and financial inclusion
Table 3 presents the main results of our study, the ATT for the effect of mobile money usage
on financial inclusion in Eswatini. The ATT measures the difference in the average
proportion of current bank account ownership for individuals who use mobile money to thosewho do not use it. The results show that individuals who use mobile money are more likely to
currently own a bank account. Particularly, we observe that individuals who use mobile
money are 14pp more likely to have a bank account at a formal financial institution which is
statistically significant at the 1% level. Given that the average bank account ownership rate
amongst mobile money users is 74%, the 14 pp increase in bank account ownership
represents an approximately 18.9% ð14/C3100 =74Þhigher prevalence of bank account
ownership amongst mobile money users. The results also show that amongst rural residents,
the probability of bank account ownership is much higher amongst those using mobile
money (15.9pp). Given that 67% of rural residents in our sample own a bank account, the
15.9pp increase in bank account ownership translates to an approximately 23.9% higher
prevalence of bank account ownership amongst rural residents. The results for the urban
sample do not show statistical significance.
To test the sensitivity of our estimates, we present results of the PSM using kernel
matching (see supplementary material Table A1). The results are consistent with those we
found using the NN matching method, except that mobile money usage is now significantly
associated with bank account ownership for the urban subsample. Table A2 in the

704calculated estimates could partly be explained by different methodological assumptions
imposed on the different modelling strategies.
4.5 Hidden bias and sensitivity checks
The purpose of conducting a PSM is to minimise potential bias due to observable
characteristics. However, there could still be some other unobserved biases influencing the
results and hidden from the researcher. To investigate this possibility, we calculated
Rosenbaum bounds –a non-parametric test recommended for binary outcomes –using the
Mantel –Haenszel (MH) test ( Mantel and Haenszel, 1959 ). The MH tests the null hypothesis
that, given random sampling, the probability of owning a bank is not influenced by the usage
of mobile money. Table 4 provides the results for this test, where gamma ( Γ) measures the
odds of differential assignment due to unobservable characteristics. In the instance whenthere is zero hidden bias, Γ¼1, the Q
MHtest statistic equals 4.079 and suggests strong
evidence that mobile money usage is strongly associated with bank account ownership in
Eswatini. The matching process resulted in a positive and statistically significant effect of
mobile money; hence, we focus on interpreting the results shown in the column (4) of Table 4 .
We find these results to be robust to a certain degree. Specifically, we found in Table 4 that
increasing the odds of mobile money usage in each of the two groups to 1.6 times the current
odds ratios make the results become less robust. The upper bounds on the significance levels
forΓ¼1, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 are p< 0.000, 0.002, 0.030 and 0.156, respectively. Thus, our
estimates are insensitive to hidden bias that would increase the odds of mobile money usage
to 1.4 times but sensitive to a bias that would increase the odds by 1.6 times.

705formal financial services in Eswatini. Our findings suggest that increased education (i.e.
having a college education), improved work situation in the past year, having a small
business, married, being an urban resident and residence in the Lubombo region all positively
correlate with mobile money usage. The PSM results reveal that individuals who currently
own a bank account are more likely to be users of mobile money. Our findings are largely
consistent with previously related studies ( Aker and Mbiti, 2010 ;Suri and Jack, 2016 ).
The observation that mobile money usage is highly associated with a higher probability of
bank account ownership might reflect a supply-side effect at play here. These findings are
consistent with the previous literature that also documents a positive relation between mobile
money usage and financial inclusion ( Della peruta, 2018 ,Aron, 2018 ;Aker and Mbiti, 2010 ;
Okello Candiya Bongomin et al., 2018 ). The positive correlation between mobile money use
and current bank account ownership can possibly be explained by the realisation that, as
mobile money use increases, local banks might respond to this increased use either by
competing or partnering with mobile money service providers and facilitate the opening of
new bank accounts for customers. This is quite possible given that some local banks such as
the Swazi bank have already formed partnerships with mobile money service providers such
as MTN and have incorporated mechanisms to facilitate the withdrawal of money sent using
mobile money services through their ATMs, hence a higher possibility for individuals to open
bank accounts with the bank ( MTN, 2019 ). Also, FNB Eswatini has established an aggressive
strategy to grow their e-wallet and Cashplus, Standard Bank Eswatini with instant money
and the Eswatini Bank with the Visa Prepaid card. Nedbank Eswatini launched their new
banking application with improved features which is also likely to support functionality for
cell phone-based money transfers.
Furthermore, the finding that mobile money positively correlates bank account ownership
in Eswatini with a higher proportion of users in urban areas appears to suggest that mobile
money does not seem to be increasing the reach of financial services to those who are
structurally excluded from participating in the formal financial system in Eswatini, mostly
those in rural areas of the country. However, the results of FinScope Consumer Survey of 2018
show a significant 28% increase in the growth of mobile money since 2014. Mobile money
application in Africa has been a key platform for financial transactions in the areas of
commerce, healthcare, agriculture and other sectors ( Donovan, 2012 ). It is important to note
that much of these sectors mostly serve the already banked and working-class population
mostly resident in urban areas and not in areas with greatest need. Insurance products andpeer-to-peer transfers are likely to constitute most of the transactions undertaken by mobile
users in most developing countries. Mobile money is more than a telephonic technology, as it
requires cash-in and cash-out infrastructures, hence the need for a constant interaction
between ICT and financial services. From a policy standpoint, this observation echoes a call
for continued or ongoing government support for strategies targeted at improving ICT
infrastructure in the country. Also, the need for efforts to improve entrepreneurship and
employment opportunities in the country cannot be overemphasised as these have a direct
positive correlation with mobile money usage.
The results also show that the rural population and the relatively uneducated are amongst
the least users of mobile money in Eswatini. This observation is possible, given that most
financial products are more prevalent in urban areas where the infrastructure is relatively
well developed compared to rural areas. This finding suggests the need for strategies that
deliberately target increasing investment in physical banking infrastructures to rural areas,
improved financial education, as well as the promotion of mobile money usage through
activities like roadshows in remote locations to raise awareness and hence uptake of mobile
money. Investment in physical infrastructure is not likely to be a cost-effective strategy, given
that a significant part of the rural population does not have regular income. Moreover, the
value of transactions is very low to warrant the investment. The accelerated coverage of theIJSE
47,6
706mobile money agents is covering the space as shown by the rapid uptake of the mobile money
usage. Also, banks are considering potential solutions including virtual wallets as possible
strategies to extend coverage to the rural population, for example, FNB bank ’s Cashplus and
e-wallet initiatives. Increasing mobile money access to rural areas is more likely to enhance
the saving capacity of the poor, less educated and those with irregular incomes and
subsequently improve healthcare access and utilisation amongst the rural populace
(Munyegera and Matsumoto, 2018 ;Kyet al., 2018 ).
This study is not without its limitations. First, we rely on a cross-sectional data set, which
has its own limitations. Research questions of this nature are best tackled in the context of
longitudinal data sets, in which we can observe individuals over extended periods and make
robust conclusions, especially regarding the causal nature of mobile money use on financial
inclusion. Second, while the empirical analysis used a quasi-experimental strategy to
minimise the possibility of bias due to self-selection associated with mobile money usage, our
estimates could still be minimally plagued with endogeneity problems. The lack of good
instrumental variables within our data sets precludes more credible analyses using
instrumental variable methods –techniques that are specifically designed to tackle such
econometric problems. Third, we are unable to ascertain whether it is mobile money
influencing financial inclusion or the other way around. Thus, we interpret our findings as
representing mere associations between mobile money usage and financial inclusion. The
authors also acknowledge the recent release of the 2018 FinScope Consumer Survey for
Eswatini into the public domain, which at the time of writing this paper was not available.
Thus, it is plausible that the conclusions made in this paper could potentially be at odds with
the 2018 survey. Part of such differences in the conclusions could be explained by the recent
policy developments targeted at increasing financial inclusion in the country. Regardless of
the noted concerns, our study makes vital contributions to the emerging literature on the
influence of mobile money use on financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-
income countries.
6. Conclusion
This study examines the factor sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hm o b i l em o n e yu s a g ea n dt h ee x t e n tt ow h i c h
mobile money usage is an accelerator for financi al inclusion or rather a substitute for formal
financial services in Eswatini. Our findings show that mobile money usage in Eswatini positively
correlates with bank account ownership –a possible indication of a supply-side response or
collaborative partnership with mobile money service providers by local banks in Eswatini. This
finding, together with a lower mobile money preva lence rate in rural areas, suggests that mobile
money use does not seem to be increasing the reach of financial services to those who are
structurally excluded from participating in the formal financial system in Eswatini.
