Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsExecutive Summary
Scientific consensus is that rapid and aggressive reductions 
in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed if significant 
climate disruption and irreversible environmental impacts 
are to be averted. The changes required necessitate 
large-scale investment and governments at all levels are 
responding with combinations of regulatory mandates, 
incentives and market-driven solutions. In this post-Kyoto 
Protocol era, there is a growing application of pricing 
mechanisms, especially markets, in multiple contexts to 
address mitigation of emissions. The new generation of 
climate markets is thus likely to develop as a network of 
decentralized markets, linking at regional, national and 
subnational levels.
The Paris Agreement (the Agreement) recognizes the 
heterogeneity of approaches. To foster higher ambition 
and sustainable development, and encourage large-
scale financing towards the most effective mitigation 
measures, Article 6 recognizes that parties may 
engage in cooperative approaches, including the use of 
internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMO) 
towards their individual nationally determined contribution 
(NDC). 
Such a bottom-up framework promotes innovation 
and addresses jurisdictional priorities. Nevertheless, 
the growing diversity in the type, design, and scope of 
schemes does not encourage economic efficiency or the 
effective application of available financial resources. As 
such, an identified need is development of tools, services 
and institutions to foster and enhance this next generation 
of climate markets that accommodate such a “patchwork” 
of different domestic climate actions.
Different climate markets trade different units (assets), 
have differences in structure and governance, and rely on 
separate, centralized registries. The result is a multitude of 
schemes trading instruments within closed technological 
systems (with centralized registries) and differing rules, 
such as those associated with monitoring, reporting and 
verification (MRV). To facilitate larger, more liquid and 
resilient trading across heterogeneous climate markets, a 
new architecture is needed. 
There is a corresponding need, also, for the capability 
to generate, manage, and harmonize information 
representing the outcomes of GHG mitigation actions 
across multiple industry sectors and governmental 
jurisdictions. The complexity of conducting transactions 
between heterogeneous climate actions across 
jurisdictions increases when additional instrument types 
(that is, not just emission allowances) are traded. Thus, 
the next generation of bottom-up climate markets must 
include mechanisms to address these differences so that the technological limits of an infrastructure based on 
centralized registries does not inhibit achieving the scale, 
heterogeneity, and functional complexity required.
At the same time, a rapidly evolving technological 
landscape presents opportunities for efficient and robust 
design and development of this next generation of climate 
markets, as well as risks, both in terms of failure to engage, 
or in failing to understand how to engage effectively. 
Blockchain, Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), smart 
contracts and other disruptive technologies hold out 
the promise of addressing the needs of new generation 
climate markets post-2020. 
Blockchain, in particular, provides data sharing and 
transaction management elements well aligned with 
the requirements of climate markets. Blockchain is an 
implementation of distributed ledger technology (DLT), 
which, broadly, combines a distributed ledger (that is, a 
copy of the ledger is held by all network participants), 
public/private key encryption, and a decentralized 
infrastructure. The ledger is organized into blocks of 
information, each block containing information, such as 
a collection of transactions. Once there is consensus, 
the block is added to the ledger, which is immutable and 
accumulative. These characteristics support data integrity 1.

the Internet of Things 
(IoT), smart contracts 
and other disruptive 
technologies hold 
out the promise of 
addressing the needs 
of new generation 
climate markets 
post-2020.5and security, while the distributed nature of the ledger promotes 
transparency.
There are also challenges associated with blockchain, both technical 
and non-technical. The former includes the fact that certain types 
of blockchain networks require high energy consumption (although 
these are unlikely to be suitable for climate markets), and potential 
issues with the speed and security for data transfers to and from 
blockchain applications, for example, with other digital systems. 
Non-technical challenges include a paucity of understanding of the 
technology and its applications by many stakeholders. In particular, 
a challenge for adoption of the emerging digital technologies that 
must be resolved quickly is a culture change among regulators, 
standards developers, and policymakers. It is important to recognize 
that established interests and legacy systems could inhibit the 
adoption of digital technologies. 
Significant factors characterizing the changing landscape of 
stakeholder needs, driving the transition from current to emerging 
technologies and practices, thus include the increasing diversity of 
regulations, MRV systems, climate assets, and values of mitigation 
outcomes, within and across jurisdictions; the increasing size and 
scale of post-2020 climate markets, as well as linkages with related 
climate actions and other markets; the expectation of new cross-
jurisdictional trading arrangements (e.g., clubs, regional trading 
schemes, sectoral trading schemes); and greater financial flows 
and types of transactions, such as peer-to-peer and results-based 
finance.
It is concluded that digital innovations can help address these 
challenges firstly, through blockchain-enabled distributed ledgers 
that provide transparency and robust rule implementation via smart 
contracts; secondly, through collaborative governance systems that 
enable more efficient development of MRV standards structured as 
holistic systems of modular, compatible and extensible methods and rules; and finally, through smart meters and other devices 
associated with the IoT, combined with big data analytics, so as 
to facilitate the automated data flows necessary to harness the 
potential of blockchain technology in supporting new generation 
climate markets.
It is recommended that:
1. A roadmap for the implementation of blockchain and other 
emerging digital technologies in climate markets should be 
developed with the objective of making substantive progress 
on overall design, demonstration activities, and implementation. 
There should be close coordination with the technical policy 
agenda, both at the international level, for instance, in terms of 
the Article 6 work schedule and milestones, and at the national 
level. Specifically, these new technologies are most relevant in 
helping to address agenda items such as transparency, double 
counting, environmental integrity, and alignment with NDCs. 
2. Additional research should be conducted, firstly, to clarify and 
elaborate how other types of emerging technologies, such 
as smart meters and other devices associated with the IoT 
and Big Data, can complement applications of blockchain 
that support new generation climate markets; and secondly, 
to confirm the technical, economic and legal underpinnings 
of the perceived advantages of blockchain applications in 
addressing the challenges that confront the new generation 
climate markets.
3. By way of extension of the research carried out under 
the preceding recommendation, pilot markets should 
be established to test research outcomes in “real world” 
environments. Such pilots should also serve to elucidate 
stakeholder understanding of how, in practical terms, the new 
technology will interface with existing technologies, will be 
embedded, implemented and operated. 6
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsIntroduction 2.
Market Provisions Under the 
Paris Agreement
Since its adoption in December 2015 by the 21st Conference 
of Parties (COP21), within the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 175 countries to 
date have ratified the Paris Agreement (“the Agreement”). 
These countries have made commitments (NDCs), in some 
cases contingent on financing by developed countries, 
to limit or reduce their GHG emissions through a variety 
of measures including more significant deployment of 
renewable power, energy efficiency, land-use controls 
such as conservation of forests and grasslands, carbon 
pricing, and other measures compatible with each 
country’s national circumstances and capabilities.
Even with full ratification of the Agreement by all 197 
signatories, the aggregate effect is projected only to slow 
the rate of GHG emissions growth from the 24 percent 
increase, between 1990 and 2010, to an anticipated 
increase between 2010 and 2030 of between 11 and 
23 percent.1 Far greater reductions, approaching net 
zero emissions, will be needed after 2030 to meet the 
Agreement’s goals of limiting the rise in global temperature 
to below 2° C, or ideally below 1.5° C.
To foster higher ambition and sustainable development, 
and also encourage large-scale financing towards the 
most effective mitigation measures, Article 6 of the 
Agreement recognizes that countries may engage in 
cooperative approaches, including the use of ITMOs 
towards their individual NDC. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, 
under which emissions trading was restricted to developed 
countries, who also could purchase emission reductions 
generated by projects in developing countries, Article 6 of 
the Agreement potentially allows countries to contribute a 
diversity of climate actions with mitigation outcomes that 
can be transferred in any direction between cooperative 
Parties.
In this new, complex and diverse environment, this 
paper aims to examine emerging digital technologies 
and architectures that could be used to enhance and 
connect the heterogeneous climate actions across 
countries, thereby supporting post-2020 climate markets 
that facilitate the most cost-effective achievement of the 
highest possible ambition. Given the speed with which 
information technology, system architectures, domestic

DIGITAL-Single-Pages.pdf.policy, and other relevant elements are developing, the 
roadmap laid out in this paper will likely continue to evolve 
significantly over the next few years.
Objective: Development of the 
Next Generation of Climate 
Markets
Today, there is a broad use of pricing mechanisms, 
especially markets, in multiple contexts to address 
mitigation of emissions. Market mechanisms have proven 
to be an economically efficient way to mitigate GHG 
emissions to deliver a specific objective (e.g., an emissions 
reduction target by a specific date). There are 40 countries 
and more than 20 cities, states, and provinces that 
have already established or will soon be implementing 
some form of carbon pricing system — either cap-and-
trade or a carbon tax, including seven of the world’s ten 
largest economies. Carbon pricing initiatives now cover 
approximately 13 percent of annual global GHG emissions.2 
There are jurisdictions engaging in cooperative programs 
(e.g., EU Emission Trading System (ETS), Regional 
Market mechanisms 
have proven to be an 
economically efficient 
way to mitigate GHG 
emissions to deliver 
a specific objective 
(e.g., an emissions 
reduction target by a 
specific date).  7Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), California-Quebec-Ontario3) 
but even connecting independent emissions trading schemes 
necessitates mechanisms to deal with different accounting rules, 
scope, pricing, offset eligibility, governance, complementary 
policies, and other key features. In reality, pricing mechanisms 
may take a variety of forms including as carbon taxes, schemes 
generating project-based credits, or certificates schemes for fuel 
switching or renewable energy. All these have the potential for 
integration in the broad mix of global “climate markets” post-2020.
While such a bottom-up framework promotes innovation and 
addresses jurisdictional priorities, the growing diversity in the 
type, design, and scope of schemes does not foster the most 
efficient and effective application of the financial resources 
available. Against this backdrop, the World Bank is working with 
governments, the private sector, academia and civil society to 
develop the tools, services and institutions needed to foster and 
develop the next generation of climate markets that accommodate 
such a “patchwork” of different domestic climate actions. 
3 California, Quebec, and Ontario established a linkage agreement that became effective on January 1, 2018.To ensure an efficient and robust design and development of 
this next generation of climate markets, it is critical to consider 
the rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this 
paper is to provide background clarity to understanding the 
emerging technology trends that can support both the design and 
function of new climate markets from the bottom-up. While other 
technologies such as the IoT and big data analytics are mentioned 
(and elaborated briefly in Section 5), specifically, this paper will 
focus on the application of blockchain technology, and how it can 
work cumulatively with those other technologies. 
To achieve the vision of a new generation of climate markets 
driving higher mitigation ambition, it is essential to first consider the 
current practices and technologies that have been used to support 
pricing and the challenges they present. Understanding the issues 
and gaps is essential to assessing the potential for emerging 
practices, technologies and architectural frameworks to harness 
the power of markets in delivering on the objectives outlined in the 
Paris Agreement.8

and Practices in Existing 
Climate Markets3.
Current Data Collection
In spite of their differences, carbon pricing mechanisms 
around the world share common elements (e.g., data-
driven emission caps and allowances, offset provisions, 
defined sectors),4, 5, 6 and there are a multitude of MRV 
practices and technologies encompassing data collection, 
data processing, and data analysis that underpin these 
mechanisms. Since the 1990s, new technologies have 
enabled expanded MRV practices, from simplified 
organizational and subnational inventories and project-
specific calculations to more accurate and comprehensive 
accounting, including, for example, continuous emission 
monitoring systems (CEMS), integrated life cycle 
assessment (LCA) databases, and cloud-based, tracking 
software systems for supply chains and programs of 
activities (POA). 
More recently, innovative MRV practices and technologies 
utilizing information and communication technologies 
(ICT),7 such as mobile and remote monitoring, are being 
advanced for transportation, distribution of household 
appliances and land use mitigation activities. 
At a time when climate markets are gaining interest,8 
and advances in technological adoption and automation 
of MRV is occurring, nevertheless most climate change 
related MRV practices still involve manual processes 
that rely on disconnected data trails, spreadsheets, and 
static PDFs to achieve market and environmental integrity. 
These processes stand in contrast to the increasingly 
interconnected, highly transparent digital paradigm that 
is emerging globally,9 constraining market integration and 
scalability.

initiative/.Current Market Schemes
The Kyoto Protocol took a homogeneous approach to 
tradable units, which by definition were all equal to one 
tonne CO2-equivalent GHG emission. The two most 
common types of tradable units in climate markets have 
been allowances and credits and following the Kyoto 
approach, these are generally set at a value of one 
tonne as well, although what it is a tonne of (e.g., CO2, 
or CO2 — equivalent, or another GHG) will depend on the 
nature of the particular scheme. 
The next generation 
of bottom-up climate 
markets must 
include mechanisms 
to address these 
differences so 
as to not inhibit 
reaching the scale, 
heterogeneity, and 
functional complexity 
that will be required.9Allowances are issued under cap-and-trade programs where 
emissions within a defined boundary (e.g., country, industry 
sector) are capped. The allowances are issued to entities that are 
regulated within the boundary of the cap, to be surrendered by 
them against their emissions. Thus, the face value of an allowance 
reflects a unit of the amount the regulated entity can emit, rather 
than the amount of GHG emission mitigation brought about by a 
unit of that scheme. 
Credits can encompass a variety of instruments, most notably GHG 
offset credits, renewable energy certificates ,10 and renewable fuel 
certificates (RINs).11 As opposed to an allowance, a credit can reflect 
a unit of the amount of GHG emission reduction achieved, although 
depending on the type of credit, it may need to be converted into 
a base unit such as tonnes CO2-equivalent: for example, renewable 
energy certificates  may be expressed in KWh and need to be 
converted in order to be comparable with other units.
In any case where diverse pricing mechanisms are connected so 
as to allow transactions between them, in other words to provide 
for “fungibility” (or the mutual interchangeability) of their respective 
tradable units, there will need to be a mechanism to enable 
comparability. This is discussed further below.
Existing Technological Architecture
A functioning climate market requires rules, institutions, and 
infrastructure to enable proper market operation, transparent 
accounting and to ensure environmental integrity. A fundamental 
building block for market infrastructure is the accounting system(s) 
in which tradable units are held, transferred, retired, and recorded.
The World Bank has defined three types of emissions accounting 
systems (illustrated in Figure 1.)

12 California Air Resources Board, “ARB Offset Credits Issued,” accessed September 30, 2017, https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/offsets/issuance/arb_offset_credit_issuance_table.pdf.The term registry can refer to a GHG emissions inventory, a list 
of project and program information, or databases with varying 
levels of functionality. While there are multiple considerations in 
the development, administration and regulation of GHG registries, 
there is a commonality in the underlying technological architecture 
of existing registries. Regardless of structure or level of complexity, 
existing transactional registries utilize a technological architecture 
based on a centralized ledger (or database) to support the 
transaction of units. There are good reasons for this design around 
central ledgers. Centralized ledgers are reliable and provide a 
system of record for transactions within a given scheme with 
clearly defined, tradable units. 
Due to legal constraints, confidentiality concerns, institutional 
barriers, or other factors, there may be multiple registries or 
multiple centralized ledgers used within a single jurisdiction. 
Integrating multiple centralized ledgers requires not only new 
architecture (see Figure 2), but also overcoming constraints so as 
to facilitate the integration and transfer of relevant data.
For example, under California’s Cap-and-Trade Program, details 
associated with an approved project may be stored across 
multiple websites each referencing serialized numbers and 
reports held in various places. The California Air Resources Board 
(ARB) summary for a project will be a set of serialized numbers 
held in the ARB central ledger, but these same numbers might 
initially have been held as a separate serialized set of numbers 
in a centralized register operated by another registry, such as 
the American Carbon Registry (ACR) and backed by a separate, 
PDF verification report.12 In order for the original set of serialized 
numbers representing offsets issued under the ACR and held on 
the ACR registry to be transferred to ARB’s centralized ledger, 
ACR must (a) “retire” the serialized numbers in its central ledger, 
(b) manually transfer the same numbers to ARB via spreadsheet 
or CSV to ARB, and (c) have ARB reissue a new, equivalent set of 
serialized numbers in ARB’s central ledger.
An approach, such as in this example, may be sufficient within 
a given jurisdiction with appropriate governance and oversight. 
However, when the centralized ledgers are in different jurisdictions, 
standardized rules and oversight to enable transfers of units 
between those ledgers may not be available. 
Figure 2 illustrates the systems supporting GHG data collection, 
aggregation, accounting, and reporting in jurisdictions usually 
organized around centralized databases. The databases have 
varying degrees of integration, depending on the jurisdiction and/
or program considered. This is indicative of the system architecture 
in many jurisdictions with a market program in operation, each 
of which operates with its transaction registries at the core of 
its design. Each transaction registry will reflect the particular 10
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate Marketsdesign and type of scheme of which it forms part, and thus will 
be technologically separate from those in other jurisdictions with 
different schemes, as will be the units, transactions in which are 
recorded in that ledger. 
To address these differences, specific bilateral or multilateral 
agreements are required for any cross-jurisdictional transactions 
to occur. When the climate actions in the different jurisdictions 
are both emissions trading schemes, agreement as to the relative 
respective value of the units (and as to what those units/that value is a measure of) is necessary. The complexity of conducting 
transactions between heterogeneous climate actions across 
jurisdictions increases when additional instrument types (e.g., not 
just emission allowances, but also renewable energy certificates, 
RINs, offsets) are introduced. Thus, the next generation of bottom-
up climate markets must include mechanisms to address these 
differences so that the technological limits of an infrastructure 
based on centralized registries does not inhibit reaching the scale, 
heterogeneity, and functional complexity that will be required.

New Market Design4.
As noted above, different climate markets trade different 
units (assets), have differences in structure and governance, 
and rely on separate, centralized registries. The result is a 
multitude of schemes trading instruments within closed 
technological systems (central-ledger-based registries) 
and differing rules—for example, those associated with 
MRV. There are examples of linked programs (e.g., the 
California-Quebec-Ontario cap-and-trade program) that 
aim to facilitate larger, more liquid markets by providing 
for cross-jurisdictional transactions, but the advent of 
more advanced technological approaches and designs 
that could provide more secure, efficient transactions of 
assets (carbon allowances, credits, or other carbon units) 
is changing the paradigm. 
To facilitate larger, more liquid and resilient trading across 
heterogeneous climate markets, a new architecture 
is needed. There is a corresponding need, also, for 
the capability to generate, manage, and harmonize 
information representing the outcomes of GHG mitigation 
actions across multiple industry sectors and governmental 
jurisdictions. Advances in technology and standards, 
discussed in subsequent sections, allow conceptualization 
and design of systems in which information pertaining to 
different qualities of assets can be identified and tracked 
separately, but in connection with, other information 
concerning those assets, as they are transacted in the 
markets.

and Potential Fungibility of 
Mitigation Outcomes Across 
Bottom-up, Heterogeneous 
Markets: Tracking 
Environmental Attributes of 
Various Commodities
Physical commodities such as oil, coal, palm oil, or 
soybeans can vary in value according to grade or quality 
or source location. Assets in climate markets (emission 
allowances, credits, renewable energy certificates or other 
units), although they are not natural commodities but a 
function of the policies and legislative schemes by which 
they are created, similarly may vary in value, in terms of the 
GHG mitigation in which they result. The variations will be 
a function of many factors, such as scope of the scheme, 
coverage, specific rules and scheme boundaries; the 
suite of policies and measures within which the scheme 
operates; or the jurisdiction’s particular circumstances, 
capacity and ambition. 
For different physical commodities, a digital asset can be 
created to represent and provide title to the commodity 
asset, as well as the multiple outputs (e.g., energy content) 
and outcomes (e.g., GHG emissions, energy access 
enhancement, poverty reduction impact) associated with 
its production and/or lifecycle.13 The digital asset can be 
registered at the point of initial production to create a 
single, immutable record of the embedded attributes for 
that unit of the particular physical commodity. 
Similarly, for tradable units in climate markets, information 
concerning value in terms of mitigation, or in relation to 
co-benefits such as energy access enhancement, or 
poverty reduction impact, can be identified as separate 
elements and tracked independently, while at the same 
time maintaining information concerning their source 
or identity. Blockchain technology can provide a digital 
mechanism for recording and tracking these separate 
streams of information associated with units, including 
when they are transacted across jurisdictional boundaries.This delineation and 
tracking of separate 
value elements in 
the units is the key 
idea behind this new 
architecture.12
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsThis delineation and tracking of separate value elements in the 
units is the key idea behind this new architecture. As long as firstly, 
the integrity of the recording of the information is maintained, 
secondly, the information is aggregated in an accepted form of 
a climate information asset (or “climate asset”), and thirdly, the 
necessary mechanism is in place to convert climate assets to a 
common metric for comparability, such as their mitigation value, 
then transactions can take place across jurisdictions. Further, any 
type of market instrument (e.g., allowances, credits, RINs, renewable 
energy certificates), can be so transacted, provided such a metric 
(as, for example, mitigation value) can be applied. Furthermore, 
irrespective of how markets bundle and transact, the underlying 
information for the climate asset remains the same. This approach 
ensures market and environmental integrity by precluding double 
counting in relation to climate assets.
In this paradigm, ideally, new and existing markets (commodity 
markets, environmental and climate markets) might incorporate, 
or be configured in relation to, a universal ledger and trade the 
underlying attributes. Physically measurable events, represented 
by production and operational data, could be certified against new 
standards and aggregated into universally accepted assets. In 
the case of electricity, for instance, each MWh of power (derived from coal, natural gas, solar, hydro, or wind) could be accurately 
associated with its embedded impact within a given electricity 
market or, as in the case of renewable energy certificates, 
transacted separately. 
This approach is dependent on the integration of production 
data (supported by appropriate technology, e.g., the IoT), the 
next generation of governance that supports digital approaches 
to MRV, larger scale data analysis to support MRV processes 
(e.g., big data analytics), and the broad application of blockchain 
functionalities in a dynamic market context at (or close to) real time. 
Such an integrated approach is unlikely to be possible through the 
combination of manual audit processes and multiple, disaggregated 
databases at the producer, auditor and/or market level. Further 
analysis of these emerging technologies and practices is included 
in Section 5.
The combination of blockchain technology, IoT, and the governance 
of the next generation of climate markets (discussed below), 
enables the creation of digital representations of commodities that 
can be used for existing markets and for transacting across climate 
markets (see Figure 3). The function of each layer illustrated in this 
vision of the new architecture in Figure 3 is outlined in Table 1.

This simple “information service provider” architecture is the 
key to transacting across climate markets from the bottom-
up. If deployed across multiple jurisdictions over time, the 
technological link between jurisdictions together with appropriate 
mechanisms to allow comparability of tradable units would 
enable direct transfers of mitigation outcomes and decrease the need for complex trading agreements across separate, 
centralized registries housing non-fungible assets. Over time, 
the foundational approach of generating climate assets could 
encourage standardization of MRV processes, enhancing the 
reliability of the mitigation outcomes of different instruments. 14
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsThe emerging and accelerating technological landscape 
holds promise in supporting the new generation of climate 
markets from the bottom-up in a post-2020 environment. 
Specifically, blockchain technology, trends referred to 
as IoT and Big Data,14 and smart contracts should be 
considered in the future design of climate markets. 
While this section examines the application of blockchain 
technology and smart contracts on post-2020 climate 
markets, more detailed analysis on other types of 
emerging technologies, such as IoT and Big Data, 
should be considered moving forward. Briefly, by way of 
background, the IoT is a very broad, constantly changing 
concept, for which one technical professional organization 
has sought to establish a baseline definition15 that gives 
an all-inclusive definition that ranges from small, localized 
systems confined to a specific location to a large globally 
distributed system, composed of complex systems.16 
The expression “Big Data” describes:
“… high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety 
information assets that demand cost-effective, 
innovative forms of information processing that 
enable enhanced insight, decision making, and 
process automation. ”17
These concepts are mentioned as technologies that can 
be complementary to applications of blockchain that 
support the new generation of climate markets and, as 
such, they are areas for future research. However, they 
are not considered here in more detail, the principal focus 
of this paper being on blockchain and its applications.
14 There are also other aspects not necessarily falling within the concept of “Big” data, such as the inclusion of specified and necessary data points.

20 Nakamoto, Satoshi, 2008, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” November https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf.Blockchain
While secure chains of blocks of data,18 incorporating 
cryptographic hashing,19 have been defined and designed 
since the early 1990s, the first production implementation 
of blockchain technology was in a white paper authored 
by a person (or persons) using the pseudonym “Satoshi 
Nakamoto” in 2008.20 The paper proposed an innovative 
peer-to-peer electronic currency called Bitcoin that would 
enable online payments to be transferred directly, without 
an intermediary. Bitcoin has garnered much attention, 
but the underlying technology, blockchain, is particularly 
relevant here. Blockchain as an 
Emerging Technology5.
Blockchain technology 
can synthesize 
and support the 
transaction of all types 
of emission-related 
data (e.g., facility level, 
projects, programs, 
quantified production, 
and life cycle 
attributes) in a shared, 
globally accessible 
environment.15Blockchain is just one possible implementation of Distributed 
Ledger Technology (DLT). Deloitte describes DLT as:
“a type of database that is spread across multiple sites, 
countries, or institutions. It is decentralized in nature, 
eliminating the need for an intermediary to process, 
validate, or authenticate transactions. Each party (e.g., 
individual, organization, or group) is represented by their 
computer, called a node, on the network. Each node keeps 
its own copy of all transactions on the network, and nodes 
work directly with one another to check a new transaction’s 
validity through a process called consensus. Each of these 
transactions is encrypted and sent to every node on the 
network to be verified and grouped into time-stamped 
blocks of transactions.”21 
Putting this another way, transactions are grouped into 
timestamped blocks. Blocks that have been chosen for adding to 
the chain by the consensus mechanism are sent to every node on 
the network.
Blockchain can be seen as enabling the collaborative creation 
of ledgers with properties and capabilities that go far beyond 
centralized ledgers and as having broad application for the transfer 
of value in human systems — including climate markets.
Financial services companies have shown early support for 
blockchain due to its ability to reduce risks and costs, although 
discretion and solutions are still needed for anti-money laundering 
(AML), as well as combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). The 
technology is increasingly being used in a variety of other sectors 
as well, including retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, media 
and entertainment, and healthcare.22 
The basic premise of blockchain can be illustrated by comparing 
two types of transactions: (a) peer-to-peer; and (b) via a centralized 
hub (an intermediary or series of interconnected, trusted 
intermediaries).

In order to transact money or anything of value, society has 
relied on intermediaries such as banks, governments, escrow, 
and settlement services to perform a range of services to build 
flexibility and trust into transactional processes. 
There is no requirement for an intermediary in peer-to-peer 
transactions. However, intermediaries are important when making 
a digital transaction. Digital assets, like money in a bank account or 
credits on a registry, are electronic files that are easy to reproduce. 
This creates the “double spending” (or in the case of climate 
markets, a “double counting”) problem. 
Figure 5. Generic Structure of Blockchain Solution
Blockchain solutionA B B A C
As can be seen in Figure 5, blockchain technology combines the 
“pros” of peer-to-peer with the “pros” of a centralized hub listed in 
Table 2. The accumulative and immutable nature of the blockchain 
enables multiple parties to securely transact directly between 
each other without a central “trusted” authority.
Blockchain can be used in public (permissionless) or private 
(permissioned) networks. A public blockchain network is open 
to anyone who is interested in joining and participating in the 
network. On the other hand, a private blockchain network can 
only be joined by invitation and participants will be validated by the 16
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate Marketsnetwork initiator. Therefore, a private blockchain network is usually 
a permissioned network that places restrictions on the type of 
eligible participants and/or transactions.23 
Blockchain in Climate Markets
In a post-Kyoto Protocol era, carbon-constrained world, GHG 
mitigation in all its forms increasingly has financial value. Blockchain 
technology can synthesize and support the transaction of all types 
of emission-related data (e.g., facility level, projects, programs, 
quantified production, and life cycle attributes) in a shared, globally 
accessible environment. A blockchain-based architecture can 
accommodate data that is captured automatically or manually 
to support an integrated network of climate markets over time 
without disruptive action. Recent publications by the University of 
Edinburgh present the advantages of blockchain in this context 
and make the case for the transition to “networking” of markets 
through the new architecture.24, 25
As noted in one of the Edinburgh publications, currently public and 
permissionless blockchain networks (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) 
tend to use mining as a mechanism to reach consensus without 
a single entity dominating the network or participants being able 
to tamper with the distributed ledger. However, this mechanism 
requires significant computing power, and therefore, significant 
energy consumption. If the energy consumed is from high GHG-
emitting resources such as oil and coal, then these types of 
blockchain networks may not be suitable for climate markets.
Thus, the proposed conceptual model advocates the use of 
permissioned networks that do not undertake mining, but rather 
reach consensus by agreement of the permissioned nodes, and 
allow for the flexibility to define user roles and privileges that will 
deliver the required functionality across different organizational 
and regulatory environments. 
Blockchain’s ability to collect an increased amount of data at a 
national and subnational level and make it available to every 
participant in a network may create concerns about data 
sensitivity. In some cases, a private blockchain network may be 
useful to address these concerns. However, this topic requires 
more in-depth consideration in future studies.

26 Technology diffusion considerations are described in detail in Jackson et al. (supra).Transformative
In the context of transacting across climate markets pertaining to 
jurisdictions at various levels of technological maturity, DLT (hence 
blockchain) can be transformative:
■■DLT does not require sophisticated IT infrastructure; it can 
support the migration to increasing levels of IT sophistication 
and functionality requirements over time. This is important, 
as global climate markets span jurisdictions with varying 
degrees of technological sophistication and also jurisdictions 
with existing, “legacy” infrastructure and processes.26
■■The immutability of transactions supports market integrity , and 
the distributed nature of the ledger supports transparency  in 
line with the METRIC Principles (see Section 6). 
■■The shared environment provides a common source of data 
to support the creation of new and/or the refinement of 
existing methodologies and governance systems. 
Integrity
The current process for assuring integrity of mitigation outcomes 
for most tradable units requires a significant amount of manual 
verification by third-party, independent auditors. The “notary 
function” as a standard component of blockchain technology could 
be deployed to automate many aspects of existing verification 
processes. This would entail, for purposes of validation, verification, 
or issuances, creation of computer code logic to automatically 
require “proof of existence” of permits, certifications, standards, 
and/or other verification methods by referencing information 
that is publicly available on outside databases, as well as data 
from private sources (e.g., remote sensing, satellite imagery and 
encryptions, data providers, etc.) to ensure integrity of any and all 
digital assets.
Further, the assurance of marketplace integrity is supported 
through consensus across the ledger. A blockchain ledger is 
replicated across multiple member nodes and each location 
maintains its copy. Each member’s copy of the ledger is updated 
based on new transaction data. Figure 6 illustrates a sequence of 
three transactions. In transactions #1 and #2, the data and signature 
information are properly validated by all three Member Nodes with 
identical hash values. However, the hash located at transaction #3 
at Member Node 1 does not match the corresponding records at 
Member Nodes 2 and 3. Thus, this non-conforming record will be 
corrected by a consensus of the other member nodes.17Smart Contracts
A “smart contract” refers to transactional terms and conditions 
embedded in computer code which allow automatic execution of 
the relevant transaction once precise conformity with those terms 
and conditions has been established. 
In the context of transactions between climate markets, smart 
contracts have multiple applications. First, they can provide the 
mechanism for transactions between existing market schemes 
domiciled in different jurisdictions operating different registry 
infrastructures with differing instruments at the national, sub-
national, or even industry level. This would only be the case if there 
27 World Bank, “ Mitigation Action Assessment Protocol ,” accessed September 30, 2017, https://maap.worldbank.org/#/homepage.were an independent assessment framework or frameworks 
to provide a common metric to value the differences between 
units of differences schemes, thereby affording those assets 
fungibility. This could include the internalization and execution of 
mutually agreed-upon equivalencies at the unit level by integrating 
independent assessment of mitigation actions and outcomes 
(for example through the Mitigation Action and Assessment 
Protocol (MAAP)27). Furthermore, smart contracts can be used 
to internalize governance (e.g., standards, policy, verification, 
data sources and commercial terms) between two or more 
jurisdictions or counterparties to prevent negative consequences 
(e.g., leakage), inhibit “bad actors” in the marketplace and ensure 
the environmental integrity of the market.

Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate Markets6. How New Technology Aligns 
with Policy Frameworks 
To support new generation markets post-2020, 
policymakers and stakeholders need the means to 
assess the suitability and effectiveness of direct, indirect, 
and other, more innovative, forms of cross-jurisdictional 
transacting. The METRIC Principles, outlined in Figure 7, 
provide a framework for such assessment.

28 Gold Standard, 2015, “Gold Standard For The Global Goals: Leveraging Climate Action for Greater Impact in Sustainable Development,” www.goldstandard.org/articles/gold-standard-global-goals . Building on the METRIC 
Principles
Further to the framework provided by the METRIC 
Principles, technology needs to be aligned with policy in 
designing effective connections between climate markets 
that can put the world on a path to achieve the ambitions in 
the Paris Agreement. Thus, it is important that technology 
design takes into account factors such as future growth 
(extensibility) and the need to accommodate increasing 
amounts of work (scalability). 
Extensibility
Extensibility means that design takes into account future 
growth. The principle of extensibility in this context refers 
to practices and technologies for MRV and market 
instruments that can encompass multiple attributes, such 
as activities involving diverse Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), as well as the ability to be applied in a 
modular and interoperable approach. 
Existing environmental markets have overlapping and 
sometimes redundant requirements such as carbon 
emission caps, fuel switching (coal to natural gas), 
renewable energy targets, renewable energy credits, 
rebates for energy efficiency and electric vehicles, 
direct sector-specific regulatory controls, and carbon 
fuel-intensity limits. In addition, local public health and 
economic impacts may be difficult to account for in cases 
where a reduction in GHG emissions is the only metric. 
Accounting units and standards need to be extensible 
and interoperable for MRV at different levels of application, 
such as at the project-level and throughout the value 
chain level. Additionally, MRV standards and practices 
need to be modular to facilitate multiple environmental 
attributes and claims, such as the structure of the new 
Gold Standard for the Global Goals.2819Scalability
Scalability means the capacity of a system or network to 
accommodate an increasing amount of work, or the potential 
to be enlarged in order to do so. The principle of scalability 
applicable in this context refers to practices and technologies 
for MRV and market instruments that can be efficiently applied 
to large-scale climate actions at local and regional levels such as 
supply chains and commodity markets. Heavy reliance on manual 
processes of current practices and technologies, described earlier, 
combined with multiple, dissociated and centralized registries 
inhibits the ability to scale market mechanisms and provide for 
markets to connect more globally. Thus, scalability is an important 
consideration to be addressed.
Governance Systems for Emerging 
Practices and the New Architecture
To operationalize and provide oversight for these new connected 
climate markets, underpinned by emerging technologies such as 
blockchain, new systems of governance will be required. With 
the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, and the Paris Agreement as 
the new global framework for addressing climate change, an 
unprecedented diversity of initiatives and innovative models 
integrating environment, society, and economy, with significant 
implications for the existing world of governance,29 have been 
recognized. Though blockchain is a powerful technology to ensure 
rules are observed and applied, how to develop appropriate rules 
for the digital age and bottom-up implementation of the Paris 
Agreement is a separate issue. For example, connecting markets 
will require rules to govern trading of assets across multiple 
jurisdictions. The new architecture enabled by digital technologies 
requires a new set of operating rules such as smart standards and 
rules for smart contracts.
The next generation of governance will shape the application of 
digital technologies to support or automate activities such as data 
input and processing, quality assurance and quality control (QA/
QC), audits and verifications, and standards collaboration. Digital 
technologies also enable greater participation and transparency for

institutional frameworks. stakeholders into governance-related activities and documentation, 
while being able to balance necessary data protections. 
Beyond these advances, additional innovations and enhancements 
may be needed for a next-generation governance system that will 
support a blockchain or digital platform. Elements that might be 
included in such are listed in the Appendix at the end of the paper. 
A next generation of governance systems that provide greater 
agility and scalability will be essential to support the transformation 
of the economy and communities with new digital technologies 
like blockchain. The following figure illustrates an example of a 
governance system for blockchain applications.Though blockchain is 
a powerful technology

Note: The initiatives listed in 1–5 are indicative and not intended to be exhaustive. 21Challenges, Vulnerabilities, and 
Uncertainties for Blockchain
As with other digital technologies, there are technical challenges 
associated with blockchain, such as the fact that certain types of 
blockchain networks require high energy consumption to adopt 
financial applications ubiquitously30 (and generally the association 
of the technology with bitcoin). There may also be issues with 
the speed and security of data transfers to and from blockchain 
applications, for example, with other digital systems such as 
those in the IoT. Currently, there are also only a limited number 
of blockchain developers (as of June 2017, the estimate is only 
20,000),31 yet a further consideration is the risk that the diversity 
of types of blockchain technologies could create incompatibility. 
Therefore, industry stakeholders will need to establish blockchain 
governance and standards to avoid the technology lock-in risk. 
Among the widely-recognized, major, non-technical challenges is 
the lack of understanding of the technology and its applications by 
many stakeholders, for instance, in relation to issues of privacy on 
transactions, access to commercially-sensitive data, security of the 
digital assets, access to digital technologies (e.g., smart devices), 
and the costs and benefits of using blockchain as an alternative 
to conventional financial services. Additionally, stakeholders may 
lack understanding as to what the technology can and cannot 
provide, while intended recipients’ capacity to implement also 
needs to be considered. The lack of, and the overarching need for, 
a governance system to support blockchain applications can also 
create uncertainty.32 
In summary, blockchain technology has the potential to establish 
efficient peer-to-peer transactions without the need to have an 
intermediary (such as a bank, in the case of financial systems). 
However, new governance systems will be needed to ensure 
market and environmental integrity in a peer-to-peer environment. 
Realizing the speed, agility, and scalability that distributed 
technologies offer will require new types of collaborative “distributed 
governance” systems that incentivize and motivate participants. 
Otherwise, the deployment of the digital technologies and climate 
actions necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement 
and the SDGs could be inhibited by bottlenecks associated with 
the application of technical governance (standards, protocols, 
methodologies) mechanisms in a digital context.
30 As noted in section 5, public and permissionless blockchain networks (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) can involve intensive algorithmic computations to confirm financial transactions, incurring high energy consumption. In contrast, 
permissioned blockchains (e.g., IBM Hyperledger) require lower energy consumption.

Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsConclusions and 
Recommendations7.
This report has focused on the potential and issues 
associated with emerging digital innovations, principally 
blockchain and its applications, which could enable a 
new architecture to be designed and operationalized 
to support the next generation of climate markets and 
its related diversity of assets in the post-Kyoto Protocol 
era. While hurdles remain for digital innovations to 
become fully operational, such as the integration of digital 
technologies and governance systems to support a new 
digital paradigm, the benefits of the emerging technologies 
outweigh the limitations of the current technologies and 
practices.
Significant factors characterizing the changing landscape 
of stakeholder needs and drivers to precipitate the 
transition from current to emerging technologies and 
practices include:
■■The increasing diversity of regulations, MRV systems, 
climate assets, and values of mitigation outcomes, 
within and across jurisdictions;
■■A demand for more robust MRV systems 
corresponding to the needs of climate finance for 
ITMOs;
■■The increasing size and scale of post-2020 climate 
markets, as well as linkages with related climate 
actions and other markets;
■■The expectation of new cross-jurisdictional trading 
arrangements (e.g., clubs, regional trading schemes, 
sectoral trading schemes); and
■■Greater financial flows and types of transactions, 
such as peer-to-peer and results-based finance.
Digital innovations can help address these challenges 
through:
■■Blockchain-enabled distributed ledgers that provide 
transparency and robust rule implementation via 
smart contracts, to address the array of regulations 
and standards, and provide both the accountability 
and transactional efficiency required by regulators, 
investors, and market participants;
■■Collaborative governance systems that enable more 
efficient development of MRV standards that are 
structured as holistic systems of modular, compatible 
and extensible methods and rules; and■■Smart meters and other devices associated with the 
IoT, combined with big data analytics, so as to facilitate 
the automated data flows necessary to harness the 
potential of blockchain technology in supporting new 
generation climate markets.
While considering how emerging technologies and 
practices can be deployed, it is essential to support different 
sectors and jurisdictions, proceeding at various rates and 
applying combinations of practices and technologies, 
to ensure a stable transition to a new global “disruptive 
technology” architecture. Investors and companies are 
already demonstrating enthusiastic bottom-up adoption 
of blockchain for financial and non-financial applications. 
A key, non-technical, challenge for adoption of the 
emerging digital technologies that must be resolved 
quickly is a culture change among regulators, standards 
developers, and policymakers. It is important to recognize 
that established interests and legacy systems could 
inhibit the adoption of digital technologies. Culture change 
requires acceptance by these stakeholders of the need 
to support development of rules and standards via 
collaborative governance systems and to encourage 
greater innovation. 
On the basis of the challenges and opportunities 
described in this report, the following recommendations 
aim to support a rapid phase of capacity building and 
implementation of emerging digital solutions.
Recommendation #1
A roadmap for the implementation of blockchain and other 
emerging digital technologies in climate markets should 
be developed with the objective of making substantive 
progress on overall design, demonstration activities, and 
implementation. There should be close coordination with 
the technical policy agenda, both at the international level, 
for instance, in terms of the Article 6 work schedule and 
milestones, and at the national level. Specifically, these 
new technologies are most relevant in helping to address 
agenda items such as transparency, double counting, 
environmental integrity, and alignment with NDCs. 
Through its different initiatives building climate markets, 
the World Bank will support countries to make informed 
decisions and facilitate parallel development and alignment 
of policy and technology, so as both to address and resolve 
constraints, and to identify and leverage opportunities. 23Recommendation #2
Additional research should be carried out, firstly, to clarify and 
elaborate how other types of emerging technologies, such 
as smart meters and other devices associated with the IoT 
and Big Data, can complement applications of blockchain that 
support new generation climate markets. Secondly, and perhaps 
more importantly, there should be research conducted to test 
and confirm the technical, economic and legal underpinnings 
of the perceived advantages of blockchain applications in 
addressing the challenges that confront the new generation 
climate markets (including, for example, the dichotomy between 
greater transparency and the need to preserve data privacy and 
confidentiality). It is important that this research be coordinated 
and dovetail with the agenda items focused in the roadmap, 
and dive deeper to examine key aspects such as the delineation 
and tracking of separate value elements of climate assets, the 
identification and application of common metrics for comparability, 
and the mechanics of transactions (e.g., including smart contracts) 
in these new generation climate markets.  Recommendation #3
By way of extension, pilot markets should be established to test 
research outcomes in a “real world” environment. The pilots might 
not only engage a variety of sectors and regions, but should focus 
on diverse elements, so as to better identify drivers of design 
aspects in the new generation markets, thus assisting in the 
prioritization of issues going forward. Such pilots should also serve 
to elucidate stakeholder understanding of how, in practical terms,  
the new technology will interface with existing technologies, will be 
embedded, implemented and operated.
On this front, the World Bank is working with a number of countries 
to identify a pipeline of climate actions where blockchain and other 
emerging digital innovations could be applied. By targeting different 
stages and layers of climate markets (e.g., asset generation and 
digitization vs. transferring and reporting; national vs. individual 
trading), the World Bank aims to effectively build countries’ 
knowledge and capacity, address challenges and concerns, and 
thus create opportunities for timely blockchain developments in 
these countries. To facilitate this process, the World Bank — through 
its “Blockchain Lab” — has already started to engage and partner 
with leading technology companies, start-ups, entrepreneurs, 
innovators and other development organizations.24
Blockchain and Emerging Digital Technologies for Enhancing Post-2020 Climate MarketsAppendix
Additional innovations and enhancements that may be needed for a next-generation governance system to support a blockchain or digital 
platform might include:
(1) A community of experts (e.g., standards development, management, application) using advanced online collaboration tools much 
more extensively;
(2) Standards structured so that specific parts can be updated more easily (as a “living document”) without compromising the overall 
integrity of the document or governance system, in contrast to current practices with loosely-related static published documents;
(3) Standards linked to contextual content within a larger collaborative knowledge management (KM) system, including platform and 
user communities, for example: 
(a) Links to the online knowledge base (e.g., a Wiki) and supporting research or work that has gone into the development of a 
standard, 
(b) Links to “how to” guides, templates, data sources, and other resources to support the better implementation of a standard, 
(c) Direct engagement with online expert groups (such as a mini social network of professionals) sharing expertise in Q&A 
forums;
(4) Standards designed to be more modular within a comprehensive framework, 
(a) Modular standards made to be interoperable building blocks to reduce conflicting or duplicative requirements, as well as to 
avoid wasted resources and uncoordinated proliferation of standards; and
(b) Standardized or sectoral approach developed with a good balance of environmental integrity and the MRV cost;
(5) The specific content and methods in the standards that reflect the new digital, automated processes enabled by blockchain and 
IoT (in contrast to the largely manual or Excel-based current practices);
(6) The foundational governance system rules, e.g.,“the standard for developing a standard,” and validation of new standards, that 
reflect more open, decentralized participatory or democratized collaboration models enabled by online tools, in contrast to the current 
practices that are more hierarchical and bureaucratic; and,
(7) Participants motivated to develop standards by a new economic model that is results-based, built on the outcomes of the use of 
the standards, in contrast to current practices in which strained expert volunteers experience “standards fatigue,” or standards bodies 
sell copyrighted standards to recover the high cost of developing standards. For example, revenues associated with the carbon assets 
generated by the application of the standard(s) are shared directly with the standards participants as compensation. This approach 
is analogous to the blockchain model in which cryptocurrency “miners” are compensated according to a consensus validation of 
transactions on the blockchain.
Studies by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) demonstrate standards have created significant economic value.33
