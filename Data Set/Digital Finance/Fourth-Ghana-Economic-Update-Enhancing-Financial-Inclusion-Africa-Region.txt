EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent Economic Developments
Ghana’s real GDP expanded in 2018, albeit at a slower rate than in 2017; the expansion was spurred 
by the mineral component of the industry sector. Official data released in April 2019 indicate an overall 
growth rate of 6.3 percent in 2018. In terms of sectoral growth dynamics, industry continued its lead with 
10.5 percent. The second-highest sectoral growth rate was recorded in agriculture with 4.8 percent; sustained 
increases in the forestry and logging, crops, and livestock sub-sectors drove agriculture growth in 2018. The 
services sector grew by only 2.8 percent in 2018. Non-oil GDP reached 6.5 percent growth in 2018. 
Ghana’s average inflation rate for 2018 was the lowest in five years. Inflation fell from its peak of 19.2 
percent in March 2016 to 9.4 percent in December 2018. Inflation continued to be in single digits in the 
first four months of 2019; but it gradually rose from 9 percent in January to 9.5 percent in April 2019. The 
favorable price developments in 2018 reflected continued monetary restraints by the Bank of Ghana (BoG), 
fiscal consolidation and the sharp reductions in non-food inflation. The lower non-food inflation reflected 
lower costs of health, education, and communications services. As inflation eased, the BoG reduced its policy 
rate from 21.5 percent at its peak in 2016 to 16 percent in January 2019, in an effort to spur non-oil growth.
Heightened vulnerabilities in the financial sector in 2018 triggered a swift response from the 
authorities. Between August 2017 and December 2018, nine domestically owned universal banks were 
closed. The assets and liabilities of two banks were transferred to a state-owned universal bank while those 
of the remaining seven banks were transferred to a bridge bank (Consolidated Bank Ghana [CBG]). The 
CBG was capitalized by the Government of Ghana (GoG) in the amount of about US$100 million (0.2 
percent of GDP). The Government also issued a domestic bond equivalent to US$1.65 billion (2.5 percent 
of GDP) to cover the gap between the liabilities and the good assets assumed by the CBG. The total fiscal 
cost of the interventions was equivalent to around 3.4 percent of GDP in 2018.
The government sustained its fiscal consolidation efforts in 2018 despite challenges. Shortfalls in 
Value Added Tax (VAT) and “other revenues” and overruns in expenditure on goods and services (altogether 
equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP) were largely offset by overperformance in corporate income taxes relative 
to target (due to improvements in compliance); and cuts in capital spending. As a result, the 2018 fiscal deficit 
target was met with 3.8 percent of GDP (provisional outturn data), excluding the financial sector clean-up 
cost. With the inclusion of the one-off financial sector cost, the fiscal deficit would be 7.2 percent of GDP in 
2018. Fiscal data for early 2019 is not yet publicly available.
The current account deficit narrowed further in 2018 but portfolio capital outflows put pressure on 
reserves. The current account deficit narrowed to an estimated 3.1 percent of GDP , relative to 3.4 percent 
of GDP in 2017. The current account deficit was primarily financed by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 
which in 2018 stood at 5.6 percent of GDP (same as 2017). However, lower-than-expected foreign capital 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSIONx
inflows reduced the capital and financial account net inflows to only 1.7 percent of GDP , compared with 
percent of GDP in 2017. This reflected the rapid decline in portfolio investments, which was 1.2 percent of 
GDP in 2018 (down from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2017). As a result, imports coverage of gross international 
reserves fell to 2.6 months from 2.8 months in 2017.
The Ghanaian cedi came under considerable pressure in the second half of 2018 and in the first 
quarter of 2019. At the end of 2018, the cedi had depreciated against the dollar by 8.9 percent, cumula-
tively. The BoG intervened in 2018 to slowdown the depreciation, and as a result, gross international reserves 
declined by US$250 million. This policy was discontinued in an effort to stop the loss of reserves. As a result, 
first quarter 2019 depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi intensified. The cedi depreciation reached its lowest 
point on March 15, 2019 when year-to-date depreciation reached 11.1 percent. With the successful issu-
ance of three Eurobonds totaling US$3 billion on March 19, 2019, the increased foreign exchange reserves 
provided enough buffer to reverse the downward trend. As a result, the Ghanaian cedi bounced back and 
by mid-April it had appreciated by 6 percent over the March 15 low-point. Still, the cedi was down by 7.1 
percent year-to-April.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Economic Policy Challenges
Economic growth is expected to be stronger in 2019; but over the medium term a more diversi -
fied economy is an imperative. Growth is projected to increase to 7.6 percent in 2019, driven by both 
the oil and non-oil sectors. Growth in the non-oil sector is expected to remain high at 6.2 percent, as 
policy interventions in agriculture and industry are expected revitalize the productive sectors. These 
interventions would be important in diversifying the economy and bringing about a more broad-based 
sustainable economic growth over the medium to long-term. But to facilitate the transition toward a 
more diversified economy, there is a need to invest Ghana’s current natural resource wealth in non-
natural resource sectors for sustainable growth in the medium-to-long-term. The Government needs to 
improve on the economy’s competitiveness for private sector-led investments in the non-oil sector for 
growth. Without that, total factor productivity is projected to remain stagnant or decline marginally 
over the medium term.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to slow in 2019; the overall stance will likely remain intact over 
the medium term, but domestic revenue mobilization is an imperative. The overall fiscal deficit in 2019, 
excluding financial sector clean-up cost (expected to be about 1.6 percent of GDP), is expected to be 4.0 
percent of GDP , rising to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2021. The deficit, inclusive of expected clean-up costs, 
would reach 5.6 percent in 2019. An effective domestic resource mobilization strategy is an urgent imperative 
for the Government as the reduction of expenditures, including public investment, in response to revenue 
underperformances may not be sustainable. Any new tax measures should be reviewed against their social 
and economic objectives to allow prioritization of the tax regime.
The next election cycle in 2020 will be an important test of fiscal sustainability. Ghana’s fiscal and 
debt dynamics could be adversely affected by possible fiscal slippages due to: revenue underperformance 
and higher, election-related spending leading up to the 2020 elections; further negative developments in the 
already vulnerable financial sector, despite interventions made in 2018; and unfavorable external financing 
conditions. On the upside, the adoption of the fiscal responsibility law and the establishment of the fiscal 
council in December 2018, with the statutory ceiling on the fiscal deficit of 5 percent, provide an opportunity ExEcutivE Summary xi
to overcome the legacy of election-cycle-driven fiscal slippages in 2020. With the next election falling within 
a boom phase, the economy does not need any additional fiscal stimulus.
Addressing the vulnerabilities in the financial sector is urgent and will require additional efforts 
in 2019, and over the medium term. In 2019, the government will need to spend an additional GH¢5.5 
billion (equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP) to solve all challenges related to microfinance institutions MFIs; 
Savings and Loans; and the introduction of another resolution bond for the CBG to support the closure 
of two additional banks that took place in January 2019. To help strengthen resilience and stability of the 
banking system, the authorities increased the minimum capital for banks to GH¢400 million (US$83 mil-
lion) effective in December 2018 (up from GH¢120 million) and are strengthening supervision, includ-
ing through enforcement of prudential standards, implementation of a new capital requirements directive, 
introduction of risk management and corporate governance directives, among others.
Financial Sector Development and Financial Inclusion
The financial sector in Ghana has grown rapidly since 2010, and with it the share of Ghanaians with 
access to formal financial services, which is a measure of financial inclusion. Total financial sector assets 
grew from 53 percent of GDP in 2010 to 78 percent in 2017. Financial inclusion means that individuals 
and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs.
But access to financial services across regions and by key demographics is still low. Rural access to 
formal financial accounts is still low, but almost doubled between 2011 and 2017, due to a rising market 
share of non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), including mobile money providers. Women are less finan-
cially included than men in Ghana. Yet, excluding women from access to financial services means wide-
spread lost opportunity for their households and the economy as a whole. Not surprisingly, the poor have 
significantly lower access to formal financial services than the non-poor. Insufficient financial literacy is an 
important long-term factor for low savings rates in Ghana, and more broadly, financial illiteracy suppresses 
consumers’ demand for financial services. In addition, persistently high interest rates in Ghana are a major 
barrier to affordable access. 
Despite all the challenges in building a more financially inclusive economy, there has been a sig-
nificant growth in the number of financial access points over the past five years. This growth has been 
primarily related to the spread of mobile money. The total number of mobile voice subscriptions grew 39 
percent from 25.6 to 37.4 million between 2012 and 2017. Mobile phone penetration has created oppor-
tunities for the expansion of financial services and increased the role of non-financial institutions as much 
as e-money issuers, positioning Ghana as the fastest growing mobile money market in Africa. This dynamic 
development indicates the potential of digital financial services and payments to further enhance financial 
inclusion in Ghana.
The expansion of the agent distribution network was critical to the success of mobile money. The 
number of active agents increased from around 6,000 in 2012 to more than 150,000 in 2017—a 25-fold 
increase. This expansion of agents offered users more cash-in and cash-out opportunities and increased the 
overall convenience of using mobile money.
The government has facilitated interoperability across payment instruments by establishing a mobile 
money switching solution. In May 2018, the Ghana Interbank Payment Settlement System (GhIPSS) went 
live with one of the first interoperable mobile money switch in Africa. Interoperability has increased the 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSIONxii
convenience and value proposition of digital financial services (DFS) for many financial consumers. Another 
notable government initiative was the introduction of the E-zwich biometric card in 2018. E-zwich cards 
can be used at any E-zwich enabled point of sale terminal or ATM, at any bank, and also for payments, 
including salaries and pensions, which can be loaded onto a cardholders account.
But more can be done to leverage innovative digital technology, as is recognized in the Government’s 
National Financial Inclusion and Development Strategy (NFIDS). As a compliment to the NFIDS, the 
Government has also developed its DFS Policy, which establishes a three-year roadmap (2018–2020). The 
roadmap aims to build on technological advances and ecosystem evolutions to create a resilient, inclusive, 
and innovative DFS ecosystem in Ghana that bolsters social development and a robust economy that sup-
ports a thriving private sector.
Enhancing Financial Inclusion
In support of the Government’s efforts, the financial sector analysis in this Economic Update concludes 
with five specific recommendations for enhancing financial inclusion in Ghana:
 Digitize government and utility payments. There remain significant opportunities in the payments space 
for driving financial inclusion, specifically in the area of government collections and utility payments;
 Link informal channels with formal financial services. Since informal groups, which are largely 
organized, play a critical role in the provisions of financial services in Ghana, there is an opportunity to 
increase formal financial inclusion by linking them for formal financial services providers;
 Promote agent banking. Many banks and non-bank financial institutions are yet to take advantage of 
agent banking and other low-cost models to increase their footprint throughout the country;
 Improve financial capability. Improved financial literacy programs could stimulate demand for services 
as it would arm the financial consumers with the information needed to identify the benefits and risks 
of financial products; and
 Leverage data to improve access to finance. The Government should take the lead in developing sound 
policies and/or legal frameworks to mandate data-sharing.1
GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC 
CONTEXT1
Global growth slowed in 2018 and the outlook is 
weak. According to the latest World Bank, Global 
Economic Prospects Report (January 2019), global 
financing conditions have tightened, industrial pro -
duction has moderated, trade tensions remain elevated, 
and some large emerging market and developing 
economies have experienced significant financial mar -
ket stress. As a result, global growth in 2018 was at a 
low 3 percent, and is expected to remain subdued at 
2.9 percent in 2019, and 2.8 percent over the 2020 to 
2021 period. Faced with these headwinds, the recov -
ery in emerging market and developing economies 
has lost momentum. Downside risks have become 
more acute and include the possibility of disorderly 
financial market movements and an escalation of trade 
disputes. Debt vulnerabilities in emerging market and developing economies, particularly low-income coun -
tries, have increased. More frequent severe weather 
events would raise the possibility of large swings in 
international food prices, which could deepen poverty. 
In this difficult environment, it is of paramount impor -
tance for emerging market and developing economies 
to rebuild policy buffers while laying a stronger foun -
dation for future growth by boosting human capital, 
promoting trade integration, and addressing the chal -
lenges associated with informality (World Bank 2019).
Financial and exchange rate market volatility 
has increased, which led to an appreciation of the 
U.S. dollar in 2018. Investor concerns about soften-
ing growth prospects and a search for higher-yielding 
safe assets have led to a further compression of the U.S. 
yield curve, despite higher inflation and ballooning 
U.S. government deficits driven by fiscal stimulus 
measures. Global equity markets dropped in the final 
quarter of 2018, partly reflecting a deterioration in 
market sentiment regarding global activity and trade 
policy shifts. Divergent monetary policy among major 
economies also contributed to a significant apprecia-
tion of the U.S. dollar in 2018.
Emerging markets and developing economies 
(EMDE), experienced significant capital outflows 
in 2018. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar, together 
with increased investor risk aversion and renewed 
attention to external vulnerabilities, contributed to 
significant capital outflows in many EMDEs. Since 
the U.S. dollar started strengthening in April 2018, 
EMDE currencies fell by an average of about 10 
percent—the most significant episode of sustained 
depreciation since early 2016. Cumulative portfolio 
outflows from EMDEs also surpassed those seen after 
the 2013 “Taper Tantrum”, reflecting a broad-based 
sell-off in both equity and bond funds.In the face of global economic headwinds, Ghana’s 
economy continued its rapid expansion in 2018 with an 
estimated 6.3 percent annual growth. The country’s average 
inflation rate reached single-digit levels in 2018 and was 
the lowest in five years. However, financial stability was 
tested by tighter financing conditions as some banks came 
under pressure. Heightened vulnerabilities in the financial 
sector triggered a swift response from the authorities. The 
Government sustained its fiscal consolidation efforts in 
2018 despite challenges, and the current account deficit 
narrowed further. The Ghanaian cedi was stable for the first 
half of 2018 but came under considerable pressure in the 
second half of the year, and the pressure continued in the 
first quarter of 2019. Medium-term growth prospects remain 
strong at 6–7 percent. Fiscal consolidation is expected to 
slow in 2019 but the overall stance will likely remain intact 
over the medium term. Further reducing the vulnerabilities 
in the financial sector is an urgent agenda and will require 
additional efforts in 2019, and over the medium term. Key 
downside risks to the outlook include fiscal slippages in the 
lead up to the 2020 elections, financial sector vulnerabilities, 
and unfavorable external financing conditions.4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION2
While financial market stress was most pro-
nounced in T urkey and Argentina, many other 
EMDEs, including Ghana, also suffered from dete-
riorating market sentiment. Countries with current 
account deficits financed by volatile capital flows, as 
well as countries with large short-term external debt, 
were most severely impacted, pointing to heightened 
investor focus on external vulnerabilities. Elevated 
domestic debt, above-target inflation, and idiosyn-
cratic factors such as policy uncertainty played a role 
as well. As in previous episodes, EMDEs with more 
liquid currency and equity markets were particularly 
affected by shifting market sentiment and contagion 
effects. EMDEs sovereign credit ratings have contin-
ued to deteriorate, with some falling below invest-
ment grade, reflecting concerns about rising debt and 
deteriorating growth prospects. Yields on EMDEs 
debt issued in international bond markets rose by 140 
basis points in 2018—the third largest increase over 
the last two decades.
As a result, growth in EMDE is expected to 
slow in 2019. With softening global trade and tighter 
financing conditions EMDEs growth is expected to 
slow to 4.2 percent in 2019—0.5 percentage point 
below previous World Bank Global Economics 
Prospects (GEP) forecasts, partly reflecting the lin-
gering effects of recent financial stress in some large 
economies (e.g., Argentina, T urkey), with a sharply 
weaker-than-expected pickup in commodity export-
ers accompanied by a deceleration in commodity 
importers. EMDEs growth is projected to plateau at an 
average of 4.6 percent in 2020–21, as the recovery in 
commodity exporters levels off. Per capita growth rates 
will remain anemic in several EMDE regions—most 
notably, in those with a large number of commodity 
exporters—likely impeding further poverty alleviation 
(World Bank 2019).
In the same vein, sub-Saharan growth is esti-
mated to have decelerated from 2.5 percent in 
2017 to 2.3 percent in 2018; below the regional 
population growth rate for the fourth consecutive 
year (World Bank 2019b). The slowdown of growth is 
attributed to weaker exports from the region’s larger oil exporters with lower productions resulting from vola-
tile oil prices on the world market. The sub-Saharan 
African economies continues to face challenging con-
ditions as prospects of the advanced economies and 
EMDEs also continue to be downgraded. Preliminary 
data suggest that sub-Saharan growth continued to 
moderate in the first quarter of 2019 reinforcing the 
weak conditions that ended 2018 in Nigeria, Angola 
and South Africa. Manufacturing and mining sectors 
continued to remain flat in South Africa as the coun-
try’s power crises continues unabated, while regulatory 
uncertainty and maturing oil fields in Nigeria and 
Angola pose greater constraints to oil production. 
On the demand side, Purchasing Manager’s Indices 
(PMI) in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia and Uganda 
showed some moderation in the first quarter of 2019. 
Despite the slow start, growth is expected to recover 
from the 2.3 percent level in 2018 to 2.8 percent in 
2019, supported by exports and private consumption, 
on the demand side, while expected rebound in agri-
culture, mining and services will spearhead the supply 
side growth. The regional GDP growth is expected to 
reach 3.3 percent in 2020 (World Bank 2019b).
Meanwhile, commodity prices are expected to 
stabilize in 2019 after marked volatility over most 
of 2018. Global price developments are particularly 
important for Ghana in three areas: crude oil, gold, 
and cocoa.
 Crude oil prices fluctuated markedly in the sec-
ond half of 2018, mainly due to supply factors, 
with sharp declines toward the end of the year. 
Prices for crude oil averaged US$68 per barrel 
(bbl), slightly lower than initial 2018 forecasts, 
but about 30 percent higher than in 2017. While 
robust global oil consumption contributed to 
this increase, supply-side factors were the main 
drivers of price movements throughout the year. 
Oil prices are expected to average $67/bbl in 
2019 and 2020, $2/bbl lower than initial projec-
tions; however, uncertainty around the forecast 
is high. While growth in oil demand is expected 
to remain robust in 2019, the expected loss in Global and rEGional Economic contExt 3
growth momentum across EMDEs could have a 
greater impact on oil demand than expected. The 
outlook for supply is uncertain and depends to 
a large extent on production decisions by OPEC 
and its non-OPEC partners (World Bank 2019).
 Prices for precious metals declined by 2 percent 
in 2018 and are projected to decline by another 1 
percent in 2019, primarily driven by weakening 
demand. Gold demand, which experienced the 
largest decline since 2009 over the first half of 
2018, has been weak both for use as a production 
input and for investment purposes. The apprecia-
tion of the U.S. dollar and tightening monetary 
policy in some advanced economies has reduced 
the attractiveness of gold as an investment asset. Supply, on the other hand, increased in 2018, 
supported by stronger-than-expected mine pro-
duction. Looking forward, strengthening supply 
and weak demand are expected to push gold prices 
marginally lower in 2019 (World Bank 2018a).
 Cocoa prices plunged nearly 13 percent in the 
third quarter (quarter-on-quarter) of 2018 in 
response to upwardly revised estimates of global 
output. Most of the growth in cocoa production 
is expected to come from West Africa, includ-
ing Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest 
producers. Despite the recent weakness, cocoa 
prices are expected to gain 2 percent in 2019 as 
consumption is expected to outpace production 
(World Bank 2018a and Figure 2.1.2).5
2RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
AND OUTLOOK
Ghana is one of the fastest growing 
economies in Africa driven by mining and oil 
sectors
Real Sector
Ghana was the second-fastest growing economy in 
Africa in 2017, with growth of 8.1 percent, driven 
by the mining and oil sectors. Oil production rose 
strongly because the Offshore T urret Remediation 
Project was deferred from 2017 to 2018 and new 
oil fields were added. In addition to this one-off 
effect in the oil sector, gold output was high, while 
cocoa production levels remained stable. Overall, the 
industry sector growth was the highest in 2017 at 
15.7 percent, followed by agriculture growth of 6.1 
percent and services with an outturn of 3.3 percent. 
Non-oil growth remained at 4.6 percent, same as 
in 2016, as marginal expansions in the services and 
agriculture sectors offset slower growth in non-oil 
industry in 2017 (Figure 2.1.1). The decline in the 
growth of the non-oil industry sector was attributed 
to contractions in mining and quarrying, as well as 
construction activities.
Real GDP continued to expand in 2018, albeit 
at a slower rate than in 2017; the expansion was 
largely spurred by the mineral component of the 
industry sector. Growth estimates released by the 
Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) in April 2019 indicate 
that Ghana’s economy grew by 6.3 percent in 2018, 
0.1 percentage point above the world bank’s projec -
tion. (Figures 2.1.2–2.1.4). The industry sector, which 
has a GDP share of 34.0 percent, recorded the highest 
growth of 10.5 percent in 2018, compared to 15.7 per -
cent in 2017 (Figures 2.1.1 to 2.1.4). The mining and quarrying subsector (which grew by 23.3 percent) was 
also a major determinant of industry sector and overall 
growth in 2018. The strong growth of the mining sector 
is attributed to the recent increase in investments in the 
sector (which led to higher production in 2018). For 
instance, in 2017, the year-on-year growth in invest -
ment within the mining sector was over 17 percent 
representing an increase from US$907 million in 2016 
to $US1.09 billion. The good developments in 2018 
were also partly attributed to favorable price develop -
ments in 2018 in some key commodity markets.
Agriculture growth was high in 2018 and a key 
supportive sector to overall growth. The second sec-
tor in terms of growth performance was agriculture, 
supported by sustained expansion in the forestry and 
logging, crops, and livestock sub-sectors. The services 
sector on the average, grew by 1.8 percent in the first 
three quarters of 2018 but improved to 2.8 at the 
end of the year. The financial and insurance subsec-
tors experienced a continuous contraction since the 
first quarter of 2017 ending the year at –7.9 percent 
in 2018, attributed to the uncertainty in the sector 
with regards to undercapitalized banks and vulnerable 
special deposit institutions. The non-oil sector grew by 
4 percent in the first quarter, 5 percent in the second 
quarter and ended the year at an overall growth of 6.5 
percent (Table 2.1).
Still, the services sector remains the dominant 
sector in Ghana’s economy. In 2018 the services sec-
tor accounted for 46.3 percent of GDP , slightly above 
the 46 percent of GDP in 2017. Industry, the second 
largest sector continued to consolidate its position 
with its share increasing from 32.7 percent in 2017 
to 34 percent in 2018, attributed to increased mining 
activities. Agriculture’s share of GDP at 19.7 percent, 
was at the lowest since 2013. (Figure 2.1.5).4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION6
On the expenditure side of GDP , exports have 
driven overall growth in 2018. Exports growth for 
2018 remained high at 10.3 percent in 2018, even 
though this was lower than the 2017 levels of 16.5 per -
cent (which benefitted from one-off effects of increased 
oil exports); imports growth remained relatively high at 
4.6 percent in 2018 compared to the 2014–2016 aver -
age of 0.1 percent. Government consumption expanded 
significantly in 2018 (by more than 70 percent), after a 
of 35.5 percent contraction in 2017. This was primar -
ily due to the base effect of steep expenditure cuts in 
2017 and a gradual easing of the government’s stance 
on fiscal consolidation in 2018. Overall consumption 
growth for 2018 was 4.9 percent compared with 5.8 
percent in 2017, as household consumption weakened 
in 2018. Total investment continued to decline for the 
second successive year in 2018, with negative growth 
of –5.5 percent, as major investments recorded in both 
the oil and the mining sectors in 2016 could not be 
replicated in 2017 and 2018. Overall domestic demand 
(including investments and consumption) grew by 2.4 
percent in 2018, representing a slowdown from the 
2017 levels of 4.1 percent.
Inflation has fallen to a single digit in line 
with the medium-term target
Ghana’s average inflation rate for 2018 was the 
lowest in five years. Inflation fell from its peak of 19.2 
percent in March 2016 to 9.4 percent in December 
2018. On annual basis, Ghana’s average inflation rate 
in 2018 was 9.8 percent, which is lower than the level in 2017 (12.4 percent) and within the medium-term 
target range set by the BoG of 6–10 percent. Although 
inflation rates for the first quarter were marginally above 
the central bank’s target range, those for the subsequent 
quarters were within the BoG limits ending the year 
at 9.4 percent—the first time this was achieved in the 
last five years (Figure 2.1.6). The favorable price devel -
opments in 2018 were driven by continued monetary 
restraint by the BoG and the reductions in non-food 
inflation. Lower services costs for health, education, and 
communications, accounted for the lower non-food 
inflation path. On an annual basis, both non-food and 
food inflation declined in 2018. Inflation continues to 
be in single digits in the first four months of 2019; grad -
ually rising from 9 percent in January to 9.5 percent in 
April 2019 on the back of rise in non-food inflation.
Financial and Monetary Sector
The Ghanaian cedi came under pressure 
in 2018 as portfolio flows reversed …
The BoG monetary policy remained focused on 
keeping inflation in the targeted range of 6 to 10 
percent over the medium term. The moderation 
in inflation created room for monetary policy eas -
ing1. Consequently, the Central Bank cut its policy 
rate from 21.5 percent in July 2017 to 20 percent in 
September 2017, and further to 17 percent in March 
2018. In January 2019, the central bank further 
reduced the rate to 16 percent—the lowest rate since 
2013. The weighted average interbank rate, the interest 
rate on short-term loans made between commercial 
banks, eased further to 16.2 percent in October 2018 
from 20.9 percent a year ago, in line with the mon-
etary policy rate. The average lending rates of banks 
also declined to 26.9 percent in October 2018 from TABLE 2.1:  2018 Quarterly GDP Growth

1  The effectiveness of the monetary policy framework on the inflation rate 
is mixed in Ghana. Available data show a good correlation between the 
policy rate and inflation. However, due to lingering structural difficulties, 
such as over-dependence of the economy on a variety of imports and the 
inability for the economy to rapidly diversify, the exchange rate tends 
also to be a strong determinant of domestic prices.rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 7

29.1 percent a year ago, consistent with the increase 
in credit to the private sector.
The Ghanaian cedi remained stable in the 
first half of 2018 but came under considerable 
pressure in the second half of the year and in the 
first quarter of 2019. Between January and May 
2018, the cedi depreciated (cumulatively) only by 
1.3 percent but the pressure on the cedi remained 
relatively strong after May as external financing 
pressures rose, and the US dollar strengthened and 
yields on US treasury instruments increased, causing 
investors to rebalance their portfolios. As a result, at 
the end of 2018, the cedi had depreciated against the 
dollar by 8.9 percent. The BoG intervened in 2018 
to slowdown the depreciation, and as a result, gross 
international reserves declined by US$250 million. 
This policy was discontinued in an effort to stop the 
loss of reserves. As a result, 2019 first quarter depre -
ciation of the Ghanaian cedi intensified. The cedi 
depreciation reached its lowest point on March 15, 
when year-to-date depreciation reached 11.1 percent. 
With the successful issuance of three Eurobonds in a 
total value of US$3 billion on March 19, 2019, the 
increased foreign exchange reserves signaled enough 
buffer to reverse the downward trend. As a result, 
the Ghanaian cedi bounced back and by mid-April 
it had appreciated by 6 percent over the March 15 
low-point. Nevertheless, the cedi is still down by 7.1 
percent on a year-to-date basis in 2019.
… and international reserves have declined
International reserve buffers have been rebuilt 
since 2016, but both gross and net international 
reserves declined in 2018. The stock of Ghana’s 
gross international reserves at the end of 2018 
was US$5.3 billion (equivalent to 2.7 months of 
imports), down from US$5.5 billion (equivalent to 
2.8 months of imports) at the end of 2017. Over 
the same period, net international reserves declined 
from US$4.6 billion (equivalent to 2.4 months of 
imports) to US$3.9 billion (equivalent to 2.0 months 
of imports) (Figure 2.2.2). The large gap between net and gross reserves reflects the anticipated short-term 
foreign exchange outflows associated with the 2019 
bond redemption cycle. Closing the gap between 
the market and official exchange rates and limiting 
the foreign exchange market interventions would be 
important steps to prevent further decline of interna-
tional reserves. With the issuance of the US$3 billion 
Eurobond in March 2019, the international reserves 
have significantly improved in 2019 (Figure 2.2.2). 
Gross International Reserves improved from US$ 6.7 
billion (equivalent to 3.4 months import cover) in 
January 2019 to US$9.9 billion (equivalent to 5.1 
months of imports) in March. This, however, mar-
ginally decreased to US$9.3 billion (equivalent to 
4.7 months of imports) in April 2019, as the BoG 
responded to pressures on the cedi.
The financial sector came under stress in 
2018 … 
Heightened financial sector vulnerabilities 
resulted in the resolution of five domestically 
owned banks in 2018, with substantial fiscal 
costs to the government. The government closed 
five domestically owned universal banks—uniBank, 
Royal Bank, Beige Bank, Sovereign Bank, and 
Construction Bank, in August 2018, and transferred 
their assets and liabilities to a bridge bank (the CBG). 
The CBG was capitalized by the Government in the 
amount of US$100 million (0.15 percent of GDP). 
The Government also issued a domestic bond in an 
amount equivalent to US$1.65 billion (2.5 percent 
of GDP) to cover the gap between the liabilities and 
the good assets assumed by the CBG. In early 2018, 
the Government also issued a bond to capitalize both 
the UT Bank and Capital Bank in an amount equiva -
lent to US$500 million (0.75 percent of GDP) that 
allowed the GCB to take over all depositors formerly 
with the two banks. The total fiscal cost of these 
interventions amounted to 3.4 percent of GDP in 
2018. The fiscal deficit including the financial sec -
tor clean-up in 2018 reached 7.2 percent of GDP 
(compared to 3.8 percent without the financial sector rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 9
clean-up). As the clean-up cost extends to 2019, the 
2019 fiscal deficit (including the financial sector 
clean-up) is projected to reach 5.6 percent of GDP 
(compared to 4.0 percent of GDP without the finan -
cial sector clean-up) (Annex 1).
… and financing conditions have tightened
The BoG has increased the minimum capital 
requirement to strengthen the banking sector, but 
areas of vulnerabilities remain. The average gross 
NPL ratio declined from 21.6 percent in December 
2017 to 18.2 percent in December 2018, in part due 
to the closure of problem banks, write-offs of NPLs, and settlement by the Government of some energy 
sector SOEs’ debt. Average after-tax profitability–mea -
sured by the return on equity–stood at 18.5 percent in 
December 2018. The bank-wide capital adequacy ratio 
(CAR) stood at 20 percent in December 2018—well 
above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent and the 
BoG’s recommended level of 13 percent. However, some 
banks remain vulnerable to high NPLs. All commercial 
banks were required to meet the new minimum capital 
of GH¢400 million by end 2018, raised from GH¢120 
million. An additional area of vulnerability in the finan -
cial sector comes from specialized deposit-taking institu -
tions (SDIs). The liberal licensing of financial institutions 
over the years, often without thorough due diligence, FIGURE 2.2:  Monetary Sector

allowed lightly capitalized institutions and unfit owners 
to operate deposit-taking businesses, putting small savers 
at risk. The Government—through the BoG—has put 
in place resolution and recovery plans for these SDIs and 
revoked the licenses of 386 institutions.
In a marked shift from 2017, tight financing 
conditions affected the local bond market in 2018. 
Yields on short-term securities increased, while auc -
tions for longer maturities were either canceled or 
went largely undersubscribed, reflecting the authori -
ties’ reluctance to accept higher yields. For instance, 
while the 5-year GoG bond yield declined between 
October 2017 and October 2018 by 175 bps to 16.5 
percent, rates on the 2-year and 3-year GoG bonds 
both increased by 250 and 125 basis points respec -
tively to settle at 19.5 percent. Rates on the secondary 
bond market also increased, reflecting tight financing 
conditions. As a result, issuances of existing long-dated 
instruments with relatively shorter remaining maturi -
ties were opportunistically used to cover financing 
needs—with the downside of clustering redemptions 
into the next 18 months (IMF 2019). Private sector 
credit growth increased by 10.6 percent in 2018 over 
the 2017 levels (Figure 2.2.3), reflecting the decline in 
the average lending rate from 29.2 percent in 2017 to 
26.9 percent in 2018. The main recipients, in terms of 
the total share of credit were: services (20.7 percent); 
commerce and finance (17.9 percent); and construction 
(10.3 percent). Developments in credit growth in the 
first four months of 2019 show even a further expan -
sion in credit growth as credit expanded from 10.4 
percent year-on-year growth to 22.1 percent in March 
and slightly dipped to a growth of 19.8 percent in April 
2019. The 2019 April credit growth compares favor -
ably with the 5.6 percent growth recorded a year ago.
Fiscal Sector
Fiscal consolidation has gained traction …
In 2017, the government launched a concerted 
fiscal consolidation effort aimed at reducing the 
large fiscal deficits.  The fiscal deficit was reduced from 6.1 percent in 20162 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 
2017 (Annex 1), achieved primarily through spending 
cuts (1.1 percent of GDP) imposed on both recur-
rent and capital expenditures. The Government also 
amended the law to cap transfers to Earmarked Funds 
at 25 percent (compared to 33.5 percent in 2016) of 
tax revenues to bring about more discretion for fiscal 
adjustments in times of need. The sizable reduction 
in the fiscal deficit was achieved despite the fact that 
revenue (including grants) underperformed by 0.9 
percent of GDP in 2017. As the primary balance 
shifted from a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2016 
to a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP (–0.4 percent with-
out oil revenue) in 2017, the debt-to-GDP ratio fell 
from 56.8 percent in 2016 to 55.5 percent in 2017.
The Government sustained its fiscal consolida -
tion efforts in 2018, although achieving revenue 
targets remains a challenge. The total Revenue and 
Grants outturn for the 2018 fiscal year were estimated 
at 15.7 percent of GDP—4.6 percentage points below 
the revised annual target (Annex 1 and Figure 2.3.1). 
This weaker-than-expected outturn reflects two key 
factors: first, most revenue categories performed below 
their targets;3 and second, there were no receipts from 
gas, contrary to initial projections because the Volta 
River Authority (VRA) was unable to settle their bills 
2  The Government finalized and published the results of a GDP rebasing 
exercise in October 2018. Accordingly, the size of the economy increased 
by about one quarter, compared to the previous GDP measure. This 
document uses rebased GDP figures, unless otherwise noted. Given the 
increase in nominal GDP , many figures expressed as a share of GDP 
have decreased.
3  In July 2018, when it became clear that the revenue underperformance 
and insufficient constraint on expenditure over the first 5 months of 
the year was insufficient to maintain fiscal targets, the Government an-
nounced a series of measures to address the situation through the mid-year 
budget review: The revenue measures to be implemented after the review 
included conversion of the Ghana Education T rust Fund value added 
tax rate of 2.5 percent to a straight levy of 2.5 percent; imposition of 
luxury vehicle tax on vehicles with capacity of 3.0 liters and above; and 
introduction of an additional band of GH¢10,000 and above per month 
at a rate of 35 percent on personal income tax. On the expenditure side, 
there were reductions in Domestically Financed CAPEX (0.3 percent 
GDP) and increases in Wages and Salaries (0.1 percent of GDP), Goods 
and Services (0.1 percent of GDP), and Domestic Interest Payments (0.1 
percent GDP). The net effect of the expenditure adjustments resulted in 
downward revision of total Expenditure (including arrears clearance) by 
0.1 percent of GDP—from GH¢62,010 million (25.7 percent GDP) to 
GH¢61,657 million (25.5 percent GDP).rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 11
with Ghana Gas, and as a result, Ghana Gas has not 
paid the Government its participation interests. In 
response to the low revenue, the Government made 
cuts to both the recurrent and capital expenditures, a 
strategy it also implemented in 2017. As a result, the 
total expenditure (including arrears clearance) was 19.9 
percent of GDP , 3.2 percentage points below the revised 
annual budgeted amount, significantly offsetting the 
revenue underperformance. Consequently, the 2018 
fiscal deficit on a cash basis (excluding financial sector 
clean-up and bank capitalization) narrowed to 3.8 per -
cent of GDP (Figure 2.3.2; and Annex 1), in line with 
the target set under the IMF program. The primary 
balance (excluding the financial sector cost) further 
improved from the 2017 level to 1.9 percent of GDP 
but this reduces to 0.5 percent of GDP without oil 
revenue. The trend continued in 2018 as the primary 
balance further increased to a surplus of 1.9 percent of 
GDP (however, the primary balance including financial 
services cost and excluding oil revenue was a deficit of 
2.6 percent of GDP [Annex 1]). 2019 fiscal data has 
not been released by the time of writing this report.
… but contingent liabilities are building up 
in SOEs …
A number of State-Owned Enterprises 
(SOEs) build up liabilities that are not separately 
accounted for in the budget. The market value of all 
Government stakes in SOEs was estimated at US$9.1 
billion (in 2016), equivalent to about 20 percent of 
GDP (GoG-Deloitte 2018). The state’s investment 
performance varies and returns on invested capital in 
SOEs are not always positive; in fact, between 2012 
and 2016, they were positive on average only in one 
year (with 1.3 percent ROIC in 2014). In addition, 
due to lack of proper oversight, SOEs are building up 
liabilities that are not accounted for in the budget. For 
instance, the Energy sector accumulated approximately 
US$2.7 billion of arrears in 2018 (about 4.2 percent of 
GDP) and the amount is expected to grow, due to a sig -
nificant revenue shortfall, which was US$789 million 
(about 1.2 percent of GDP) in 2018. In addition, the decision by the previous Government to fast-track IPP 
contracting (through noncompetitive processes) led 
to power purchase agreements (PPAs), well in excess 
of demand. If no corrective measures are taken, the 
capacity charge for the excess capacity, could rise to as 
high as US$680 million per year (1 percent of GDP). 
This represents a sector-wide unsustainable financial 
situation that needs to be urgently addressed to avoid 
a large negative fiscal impact. The Government’s com -
mitment to develop a comprehensive Energy Sector 
Recovery Program (ESRP), is an important first step 
to bring the sector back to financial sustainability.
… and domestic resource mobilization 
remains weak.
There is an urgent need to fundamentally 
improve revenue mobilization, through tax compli-
ance and broaden the tax base. An effective domestic 
resource mobilization strategy is an urgent imperative 
for the Government as the reduction of expenditures, 
including public investment, in response to revenue 
underperformances may not be sustainable given the 
pressures to implement election promises (World 
Bank 2018b). Better use of taxpayer information 
through the integration of data and analytical report-
ing could help the Ghana Revenue Authority improve 
tax compliance. In addition, accelerating the process 
of bringing together the Total Revenue Integrated 
Processing System (TRIPS) and the Ghana Customs 
Management Systems (GCMS) into an Integrated 
Data Warehouse could substantially improve the 
effectiveness of tax administration. Furthermore, 
streamlining tax incentives as recommended in the 
2017 World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review could 
reduce tax expenditures, which have a considerable 
fiscal cost (5.2 percent of GDP; World Bank 2017). 
New tax measures should be reviewed against their 
social and economic objectives to allow prioritization 
of the tax regime. For instance, zero-rating tends to 
reduce prices more than outright VAT exemptions and 
hence, zero-rating may serve as a policy option in a 
case where Government intends to reduce tax burden 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION12
on consumers. On the other hand, tax expenditures 
targeting consumer goods that produce no positive 
social or economic spillovers should be rationalized.
The rebasing of the GDP has helped the 
debt situation …
Fiscal policy outcomes over the past years have 
had a clear and real impact on debt levels in Ghana. 
While Ghana was one of the first countries to benefit 
from HIPC/MDRI debt relief, recent macro-fiscal 
dynamics have resulted in a marked increase in debt 
levels. Prior to the debt relief, Ghana’s debt averaged 
145.8 percent of GDP on average between 2000 and 
2003. Debt relief reduced Ghana’s public debt-to-GDP 
ratio to 78.5 percent by 2005 and to 26.2 percent by 
2006. However, Debt-to-GDP (rebased GDP) reached 
57.2 percent in 2018;4 and the ratio is expected to peak 
at 58.9 percent in 2019 despite the nearly 25 percent 
increase in GDP due to the rebasing in September 
2018. (Figure 2.3.6). Contingent liabilities from 
energy SOEs represent a material risk to debt sustain -
ability as shown in the latest 2019 IMF/World Bank 
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). The downward 
trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio was interrupted in 
2018, reflecting the realization of significant contin -
gent liabilities in the banking sectors.
…but Ghana remains at high risk of debt 
distress
The latest 2019 IMF/World Bank DSA main -
tains Ghana’s high risk of debt distress. The baseline 
assumes real GDP growth of about 5.5 percent over the 
medium term and 4.3 percent over the long term; mod -
eration of inflation in line with the authorities’ target of 
8 ± 2 percent; sustainable fiscal position with an average 
primary surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP and a long-term 
surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP; and a current account 
deficit of about 5 percent over the medium term, 
eventually falling to around 4 percent of GDP over 
the long term. Under these assumptions, Ghana will 
remain at a high risk of debt distress. This is despite the fact that the external debt indicators have significantly 
improved relative to the previous DSA on account of a 
rebased GDP , but vulnerabilities associated with debt 
service remain. T wo out of four indicators–debt service 
to exports and debt service to revenue—are in breach 
of the thresholds under the baseline. The debt outlook 
remains sensitive to standard shocks under the DSA. 
The standard stress tests suggest that Ghana is particu -
larly vulnerable to a decline in exports, confirming the 
need to diversify the economy and increase resilience 
to external shocks (Figures 2.3.4–2.3.5).
Ghana issued its seventh, three-tranche (7-years, 
12-years and 31-years) Eurobond on March 20th, 
2019, which amounted to US$3 billion. The cou -
pon rates were 7.85 percent for the 7-year (US$750 
million) bond; 8.13 percent for the 12-year (US$1.25 
billion) bond and 8.95 percent for the 31-year (US$1 
billion) bond (See Table 2.3). Out of the US$3 bil -
lion total bond issued, US$2 billion will be used for 
budgetary financing while US$1 billion for liability 
management operations. It is anticipated that the 
Eurobond issuance will not significantly raise the for -
eign currency-related debt (which fell in the second 
half of 2018 due to exit of non-residents from the 
market). Furthermore, it is expected to contribute 
to higher reserves, thus, also mitigating public-sector 
exchange rate risk. And indeed, the downward trend 
of the exchange rate halted in the same week that the 
issuance took place. Bids submitted exceeded US$21 
billion (six times)—compared to just over US$8 bil -
lion in bids recorded in 2018. This reflects how well 
Ghana has performed on the international capital mar -
ket since the country’s debut Eurobond issue in 2007. 
At US$21 billion demand, this was the highest ever 
order-book for bonds issued in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Also, the 31-year bond has the longest-ever tenor for 
bonds issued by an African sovereign. The particularly 
high demand is likely related to the interest rate; Benin, 
for instance, issued a EUR328 million 7-year bond on 
the same day with a rate of 5.75 percent (Table 2.2).
4  The December 2018 stock comprises external debt of GH¢86.2 billion 
(US$ 18.0 billion) and domestic debt of GH¢ 86.9 billion (US$ 17.9 billion).rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 13
Interest rate risks are a still a concern for both 
external and domestic debt with mixed develop-
ments in recent times. While the weighted average 
interest rates for domestic debt has fallen from 20.0 
percent in 2016 to 16.4 percent as at end September 
2018, that of external debt has increased marginally, by 
0.2 percent as at end September 2018. The domestic 
debt portfolio showed an increase of its Average Time 
to Maturity (ATM) from 7.2 in December 2017 to 
7.8 years in September 2018. The ATM of the external 
debt also improved from 9.1 years at the end of 2017 
to of 10.0 years as at end September 2018. The Average 
Time to Re-fixed (ATR) of the total debt portfolio 
as at end September 2018 improved to 8.7 years, an 
improvement from 7.2 years in 2016 (Table 2.3). The 
share of the overall public debt portfolio requiring 
re-fixing within one year declined from 25.9 percent 
in 2017 to 24.7 percent in September 2018 largely 
due to the re-profiled short-term domestic debt and 
the relatively small proportion of variable-rate external 
debt. This is further expected to reduce to 17.2 percent 
in 2019 (Table 2.3).
In addition, over half of the total government 
debt is exposed to exchange rate risk. As at September 
2018, Ghana’s debt portfolio carrying exchange rate risk 
had fallen to 49.1 percent from December 2017 level 
of 52 percent but is project to rise to 54.6 percent in 2019, with issuance of the US$3 billion Eurobond in 
March 2019 (Table 2.3). In 2018, like all other years, 
the main exposure is to the U.S. dollar (57 percent of 
the total external debt), followed by the SDR (24.4 per -
cent) and then the Euro, accounting for 11.1 percent 
(Figure 2.3.4). The composition of external debt is in 
line with the strategic benchmark of 65 percent U.S. 
dollar exposure (+/– 5 percent). However, the overall 
share of foreign exchange denominated debt in the 
portfolio fell significantly in 2018 due to reduced net 
portfolio inflow due to favorable developments of the 
U.S. market. Even though the nominal exchange rate 
was relatively stable in 2018, with recent depreciation 
of the cedi in the first quarter of 2019 (Figure 2.2.1) as 
an example, combined with the relatively higher pro -
portion of external debt, Ghana’s public debt portfolio 
is still vulnerable to exchange rate volatility.
External Sector
Ghana’s merchandise trade balance shifted to sur-
plus, and the current account deficit almost halved 
in 2017. Merchandise exports grew by 24.2 percent 
while imports fell by 1.7 percent, resulting in a trade 
surplus and a narrowing of the current account deficit 
from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2016 to 3.4 percent of 
GDP in 2017 (Figures 2.4.1–2.4.2).TABLE 2.2:  Government of Ghana International Bond Issuance

Ghana’s merchandise trade data in 2018 contin -
ued to record surpluses indicating stronger perfor -
mance in earnings from oil.  Ghana’s external position 
continued to improve at the end of 2018, which reflects 
continued increases in oil exports (Figure 2.4.3). The 
trade balance for 2018 showed a surplus of US$1,779 
million compared to a smaller surplus of US$1,151 
million recorded in 2017. The value of merchan -
dise exports was US$14,868 million compared to 
US$13,836 million recorded for the same period in 
2017, representing 7.5 percent growth, year-on-year. 
The increase was attributable to improvement in export 
receipts from oil and non-traditional exports which 
benefited, to a large extent, from higher volumes of 
exports. T rade data in the first quarter of 2019 was 
similar to trends in 2018. T rade balance at the end of 
March 2019 was US0.8 billion (equivalent to 1.2 per -
cent of GDP) compared to US$0.7 billion (1.1 percent 
of GDP) recorded in April 2018. This was mainly as 
a result of decrease in value of both oil and non-oil 
imports (from US$3.3 billion in April 2018 to US$3.2 
billion in 2019), while exports remain at same levels a 
year ago. The capital and financial account continued 
to improve in the first quarter of 2018 increasing to 
US$2.9 billion (4.2 percent of GDP) from December 
2018 levels of US$1.5 billion (2.3 percent GDP); and March 2018 levels of a deficit of US$0.6 billion (0.9 
percent GDP). As a result, the current account balance 
narrowly expanded to a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP 
in March 2019 compared to a surplus of 0.3 percent 
in 2018; while the country’s reserves improved signifi -
cantly at the end of March 2019 (see Paragraph 15).
The current account has improved with the 
trade balance turning into surplus.
The improvement of the current account of 
the balance of payments continued into 2018, but 
lower than expected capital inflows led to a draw-
down in international reserves. The current account 
deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP was primarily financed 
by Foreign Direct Investment, which fell slightly to 
4.5 percent of GDP in 2018 (from 5.6 percent of 
GDP in 2017). Lower than expected foreign capital 
inflows narrowed the capital and financial account to 
an estimated surplus of only 1.7 percent of GDP . This 
was driven by a rapid decline in inflows through port-
folio investment (Figure 2.4.4), which was 1.4 percent 
of GDP in 2018 (down from 4.4 percent of GDP in 
2017). In 2018, just like many EMDEs, Ghana was 
on the receiving end of stifled portfolio investments 
net inflows as foreign investors sought to rebalance TABLE 2.3:  Comparison of Debt Risk Indicators, 2016 and 2017

their portfolio due to favorable developments of the 
U.S. market leading to their repatriation of coupons 
and principals. Official financing (aid) registered a net 
outflow in 2018 in the order of 0.5 percent of GDP , 
compared to 0.6 percent in 2017. As a result, both 
gross and net international reserves declined (More 
details from BoP statistics are shown in Annex 2).
Macroeconomic Outlook and Economic 
Policy Challenges
Economic growth will remain strong, with 
inflation in single digits.Ghana’s medium-term economic prospects is posi-
tive, with economic growth expected to accelerate 
to 7.6 percent in 20195. The primary driver of growth 
is the oil sector, reinforced by non-oil growth, which 
is expected to remain strong at 6.2 percent as policy 
interventions in agriculture and industry are expected 
revitalize the productive sectors. Further reforms in FIGURE 2.4:  External Sector

5  First quarter 2019 growth data is not yet published; but the Stanbic 
IBTC Bank Ghana Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), a leading in-
dicator for economic sentiment, increased slightly from 51.3 points in 
February to 51.5 in March 2019. A reading above 50 points indicates 
improving business sentiment; the increasing trends reflected sustained 
growth in new orders in March, amid signs of improving demand (Fo-
cusEconomics, May 2019).rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 17
the regulatory environment for the private sector, and 
efforts to facilitate regional and international trade 
will support the agribusiness sector and strengthen 
the link between private sector development and 
jobs creation. Overall, real GDP growth is expected 
to average nearly 7 percent between 2019 and 2021 
as the impact of the short-term increase of oil and 
gas production fades, while an average of 6.5 percent 
growth is projected for the non-oil sector over the 
medium term (Figures 2.5.1–2.5.2). To facilitate the 
transition toward a more diversified economy, there 
is a need to invest Ghana’s current natural resource 
wealth in non-natural resource sectors for sustainable growth in the medium-to-long-term. The government 
needs to improve on the economy’s competitiveness 
for private sector-led investments in the non-oil sector 
for growth. Without that, total factor productivity is 
projected to decline marginally over the medium term 
and the growth momentum will gradually come from 
more capital accumulation (Figure 2.5.3).
Inflation is projected to remain within the 
BoG target range of 6–10 percent over the medium 
term, subject to the normalization of exchange rate 
pressures. Annual inflation rates are projected to 
remain in single digits over the medium term as the 
fiscal deficit is contained within the 5 percent cap of

the fiscal rule, and non-food inflation remains low as 
reserve buffers are rebuilt. This will allow the central 
bank to continue the gradual lowering of the policy 
rate to facilitate increases in domestic credit to the 
private sector in line with the medium-term growth 
objective. The lower inflation-cum-lower interest rate 
environment will be supported by better coordina -
tion of monetary and fiscal policy. This will allow the 
inflation targeting framework adopted by the BoG 
to be more effective in maintaining low inflation 
in line with the medium-term target, based on low 
and stable inflation expectations in the economy. It 
will be important to gradually lower inflation even 
below the lower range of the BoG target to ensure 
that the poor, who are primarily engaged in non-oil 
economic activities can sufficiently increase their real 
incomes to escape poverty. The inflation outlook, is 
however, subject to recent flipping of the cedi’s per -
formance against the U.S. dollar. In the first quarter 
of 2019, the cedi cumulatively depreciated against 
the dollar by 3.9 percent compared to a cumulative 
appreciation of 1.9 percent for the same period in 
2018 (Figure 2.2.1). The performance of the cedi, 
therefore, provides significant risk to the inflation 
outlook which is already relatively high, close to the 
central bank’s upper band target of 10 percent.
Fiscal consolidation will slow but remain 
within the fiscal rule over the medium-term.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to slow in 2019 
(largely due to the financial sector clean-up) but to 
remain intact over the medium term. For 2019, the 
Government projected total revenues, including grants 
of 17.1 percent of GDP . This represents a growth of 
20 percent over the nominal level for 2018, well above 
the projected inflation rate of 8 percent. The forecast 
for non-oil revenue in 2019 is 15.5 percent of GDP 
to be achieved through gains from ongoing reforms 
in revenue administration and improved tax compli-
ance. Non-interest expenditure is expected to fall over 
the medium term as Government continues measures 
to control the wage bill and transfer payments, but interest payment is expected to rise, in line with the 
higher interest rates and the depreciation of the cedi 
(Table 2). The overall fiscal deficit for 2019, exclud-
ing financial sector clean-up cost, is projected at 4.0 
percent of GDP—marginally above the outturn of 
3.8 percent for 2018 (Figure 2.5.4).
Government revenues in 2019 are supported 
by measures, which the Government started 
implementing in the second half of 2018. Revenue 
measures introduced in the 2018 midyear budget are 
expected to be fully realized in 2019. To complement 
collection efforts of the Ghana Revenue Authority 
(GRA), a medium-term revenue policy is expected 
to be rolled out in 2019. Several revenue-enhancing 
strategies will be adopted in 2019 including the inten -
sification of revenue compliance. An Exemptions Bill 
under preparation is expected to rationalize exemp -
tions and strengthen the power of the Minister for 
Finance to minimize exemptions. The Government is 
also committed to broadening the tax base with the 
mandatory rollout of the Tax Identification Number 
(TIN) by sanctioning state and private entities that 
fail to enforce these TIN requirements. Over the 
medium term, the Government, with support under 
the World Bank Ghana Economic Strengthening 
Project, will be able to use Third-party data/intelli -
gence from National Identification Authority, Driver 
Vehicle Licensing Authority, Law Enforcement 
Agencies among others, to bring more persons into 
the tax net.
The overall fiscal deficit is not expected to 
exceed 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium term—
in line with the fiscal responsibility law passed 
in 2018. The Government has put in place various 
mechanisms to internalize fiscal restraint since 2016. 
This includes the enactment of the Public Financial 
Management Act (PFMA) in 2016 which mandates 
the adoption of numerical fiscal rules. In line with the 
PFMA, the Government passed a Fiscal Responsibility 
Act in December 2018, resulting in the legal establish-
ment of the fiscal rule by setting a ceiling to the over-
all cash budget deficit at 5 percent of GDP . A Fiscal 
Responsibility Advisory Council was also established rEcEnt Economic dEvElopmEntS and outlook 19
BOX 2.1:  Procyclicality, the Election Cycle and the Fiscal Responsibility Law
Ghana has suffered from large fiscal volatility around election cycles for the past two decades. This volatility has 
been identified as one of the key challenges for Ghana’s future development path in the 2018 World Bank Systematic Country 
Diagnostic (SCD). Fiscal deficits increased sharply and above 5 percent of GDP in all but one election year since 2000 (that is, 
2004). And the level of overshooting in fiscal election cycles has increased over the past decade with the discovery of offshore oil 
fields in 2007 (World Bank SCD 2018: p.32). Between 2005 and 2012, public expenditure rose rapidly—related to increased 
spending on wages due to the introduction of the single spine salary structure (World Bank 2017)—from 20 to 30 percent of GDP .
Fiscal policy in Ghana is notably procyclical. Procyclical policy reinforces rather than smoothens economic cycles. 
The cyclicality of public expenditure can be measured as the correlation between the cyclical components of real government 
expenditure and real GDP (the business cycle). Ghana was among the most procyclical countries over the period 1980 to 1999, 
with a correlation of 0.7 (Box Figure 1a). And there is a clear bias toward overspending during good times, which explains why 
procyclicality is higher in boom than in bust periods (Box Figure 1b). Strikingly, Ghana has become even more procyclical in the 
recent period 2000–17, while many countries were able to leave fiscal procyclicality behind.
The procyclicality is related to both the commodity and electoral cycles. The dynamics of the cyclicality over the 
business cycle can be assessed through estimating a time-varying measure of the fiscal pro-cyclicality using the Local Gaussian 
Weighted OLS method (Box Figure 1c). There is a clear relation of procyclicality and the commodity and electoral cycles; between 
1990 and 2016, four phases of procyclicality can be observed: First , a substantial reduction of procyclicality in the 1990s following

BOX 2.1:  Procyclicality, the Election Cycle and the Fiscal Responsibility Law (continued)
to act as an advisory body to the President. While 
the deficit ceiling is relatively high to act as an annual 
guidepost, and the exact role of the Fiscal Council 
(which ideally should be an independent body with 
sanctioning authority) is still the subject of public discourse in Ghana, the establishment of the law 
and the council are critical steps toward a sustain-
able long-term fiscal path (see Box 2.1). Importantly, 
these efforts need to be complemented by policies to 
increase domestic revenue, another area of focus for the fiscal reforms of the 1980s. Second, procyclicality increased sharply in the run-up to the 2000 election. Third, procyclicality 
trends remained stable over most of the 2000s, when fiscal policy was conducted under a “quasi-fiscal rule” during the beginning 
of John Kufuor’s government. Fourth, the discovery of oil in 2007 and the approaching 2008 elections set the procyclicality on 
a rising trend all the way to 2017.
In an attempt to overcome the fiscal election cycles, Ghana introduced a fiscal responsibility law and a Fiscal 
Council in December 2018. The law establishes a de facto 5 percent cap on fiscal deficits in any given year. While this is a 
relatively high annual ceiling (the West Africa Monetary Zone primary convergence criteria for fiscal deficit is 4 percent of GDP), 
it is a suitable target to contain excessive fiscal over-expenditure in election years, where deficits tend to overshoot. While the 
exact implementation of the Fiscal Council, which ideally would be an independent body, is still the subject of public discourse in 
Ghana, the establishment of the law and the council are critical steps toward a sustainable long-term fiscal path.
The next election cycle (2020) will likely fall into a boom phase. In a stark contrast to the mere 3.4 percent real GDP 
growth in the last cycle (2016), growth is expected to be above 6 percent over the period 2019 to 2021 (World Bank 2019a), and 
potentially higher if oil output can be increased in the short-term. The macro-fiscal economy is largely back on track after years 
of adjustment, supported by the World Bank and the IMF . This means that Ghana will go into the next fiscal election cycle in 2020 
from a much stronger position than in 2016. There are downsides as well, of course, as witnessed by the recent banking sector 
resolutions, which cost the equivalent of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2018. But the medium-term fiscal outlook is still positive. With the 
fiscal responsibility law and the fiscal council now in place, the 2020 election provides a unique opportunity to break the ever-
increasing fiscal election cycles as strong economic growth in the medium term does not require additional fiscal stimulus in 2020.BOX FIGURE 1:  Procyclicality of Government Expenditure in Ghana

additional, procyclical fiscal stimulus. With the new 
institutional mechanisms now in place, the 2020 
election provides a unique opportunity to break the 
ever-increasing fiscal election cycles.
The current account will narrow further, but 
the financial sector will remain challenging.
Ghana’s external position is expected to remain 
at current levels over the medium term with a cur -
rent account deficit of between 3 and 3.5 percent 
between 2019 and 2021. Ghana’s trade balance is 
expected to remain in surplus over the medium-term 
supported by high volumes of oil and precious min -
erals (which could offset possible marginal declines 
in their prices); as well as projected marginal price 
increases of cocoa. For the year 2019, even though 
the trade surplus is expected to narrow, relative to 
the 2018 levels, improvements in the net services 
and income accounts as well as net transfers are 
expected to help maintain the lower current account 
deficit of the balance of payments at 3.2 percent of 
GDP . The current account deficits will be adequately 
covered by foreign direct investment (FDI), as well 
as official and private financing to result in net addi -
tions to reserves. Thus, gross reserves are expected to 
increase from US$5.3 billion in 2018 (2.7 months of imports) to US$7.1 billion in 2021 (2.9 months 
of imports), falling just short of the recommended 
three-month import cover.
Financial sector challenges are expected 
to remain over the medium term. In 2019, the 
Government will need to continue with the ongoing 
interventions to fully resolve these challenges (see 
Section 3 for the state of Ghana’s financial sector 
and specific interventions planned by government 
for 2019 and the medium term). Improving financial 
inclusion will be an important element to deepen 
the financial sector. Financial inclusion means that 
individuals and businesses have access to useful and 
affordable financial products and services that meet 
their needs. Chapter 2 of this Economic Update 
focuses on the specific challenges for a more inclusive 
financial sector.
6  The Government anticipates that enhanced revenue administration 
would reduce exemptions and increase tax compliance in a way that 
would boost overall tax revenues by about 0.5 percent of GDP over the 
medium term. The law on tax exemptions is expected to be passed by the 
Parliament in 2019. Total expenditure is expected to rise by just under 2 
percentage points of GDP in 2019 but increases thereafter are expected 
to be relatively modest. The two main drivers on the expenditure side 
will be interest payments and capital spending. The earnest expansion 
of the GIFMIS financial module to cover four Statutory Fund Agencies 
and 216 MMDAs in 2018 is an indication of the Government’s com-
mitment to better control spending and meet it fiscal targets following 
the end of the IMF program.23
3FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 
AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION
The State of the Financial Sector in 
Ghana
Reducing financial sector vulnerability will 
require more effort in 2019
The financial sector in Ghana has grown rapidly 
since 2010 but remains bank-dominated and rela -
tively shallow. Total financial sector assets grew from 
53 percent of GDP in 2010 to 78 percent in 2017. Alongside the rapidly increasing financial sector since 2010, 
the share of Ghanaians with access to formal financial 
services—a measure of financial inclusion—has increased. 
Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses 
have access to useful and affordable financial products and 
services that meet their needs. But access to financial services 
is heterogeneous across regions and key demographics. 
Rural access to formal financial accounts is low, but almost 
doubled between 2011 and 2017, due to a rising market 
share of NBFI. Women are less financially included than men 
in Ghana. Yet, excluding women from access to financial 
services means widespread lost opportunity for their 
households and the economy as a whole. Not surprisingly, 
the poor have significantly lower access to formal financial 
services than the non-poor. Insufficient financial literacy is an 
important long-term factor for low savings rates in Ghana, 
and more broadly, financial illiteracy suppresses consumers’ 
demand for financial services. In addition, persistently high 
interest rates in Ghana are a major barrier to affordable 
access. But despite all the challenges, there has been 
significant growth in the number of financial access points 
over the past five years, primarily related to the spread 
of mobile money. This indicates the potential of DFS and 
payments to further enhance financial inclusion in Ghana. 
In the meantime, Ghana has a banking sector that has been 
facing serious soundness challenges, which after years of 
build-up culminated in 2018 with a series of necessary and 
expensive banking resolutions. Bringing the financial sector 
back on track is urgent and will require additional efforts in 
2019, and over the medium term.Universal banks are dominant, with assets equivalent 
to 46 percent of GDP in 2017, followed by the fund 
management sector with 15 percent, and pension funds 
with 12 percent. A significant part of the financial sec -
tor is state owned, and the level has increased in 2018. 
As of 2016, there were 15 banking institutions that 
were at least partially state owned, and the financial 
SOEs represented one-fourth of all active state-entities 
in Ghana (GoG-Deloitte 2018). As of 2018, the state 
owned four major banks, two of which are among the 
three largest in Ghana. While private credit to GDP 
(18 percent in 2017) is on par with the Sub-Saharan 
median, it is below the level implied by Ghana’s level 
of income (FinStats 2018). Likewise, domestic credit to 
the private sector is low in Ghana (World Bank 2018d).
The banking sector is affected by high, albeit 
declining non-performing loans (NPLs). The bank-
wide capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 20 percent 
in December 2018, up from 18 percent a year earlier 
and well above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent 
and the BoG’s recommended level of 13 percent. The 
increase in CAR was in part due to the new minimum 
capital that came into force on December 31, 2018. 
The system is liquid, with the ratio of liquid assets to 
short-term liabilities of 34 percent in December 2018, 
largely stable since 2014. Average after-tax profitabil -
ity–measured by the return on equity–stood at 18.5 
percent in December 2018. The average gross NPL ratio 
declined from 21.6 percent in December 2017 to 18.2 
percent in December 2018, in part due to the closure of 
problem banks, write-offs of NPLs, and settlement by 
the Government of the energy sector SOEs’ debt. The 
private sector, being the largest recipient of outstanding 
credit balances also accounted for the greater propor -
tion of banks’ NPLs, only slightly decreasing from the 
December 2018 levels of 97.1 percent to 96.9 percent 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION24
in February 2019. The proportion of banks’ NPLs 
attributable to the public sector declined from 7.3 
percent in December 2017 to 2.9 percent in December 
2018 but has slightly increased to 3.1 percent attributed 
to increases related to public enterprises. Most private 
sector non-performing loans were debts of indigenous 
enterprises accounting for 75.4 percent of total NPLs 
in February 2019.
The authorities have taken commendable steps 
to address soundness challenges in the banking sec-
tor. In the August of 2018, BoG closed five domesti-
cally owned universal banks – uniBank, Royal Bank, 
Beige Bank, Sovereign Bank, and Construction Bank, 
with their assets and liabilities transferred to a bridge 
bank (the CBG). The CBG was capitalized by the 
Government of Ghana, and a domestic bond was 
issued to cover the gap between the liabilities and the 
good assets transferred to the CBG. Earlier in 2018, 
the Government also issued a bond to cover the gap 
between the liabilities and the good assets of UT 
Bank and Capital Bank and facilitate their purchase 
and assumption by GCB. The total fiscal cost of these 
interventions amounted to 3.4 percent of GDP in 
2018. Finally, in January 2019, the authorities closed 
two more banks – Premium Bank and Heritage Bank.
In addition to closing troubled banks, BoG has 
taken other measures to strengthen the banking sec -
tor. All commercial banks were required to meet a new 
minimum capital of GH¢400 million by end-2018, 
raised from GH¢120 million. This led to three merg -
ers, downgrading of one bank to a Savings and Loans, 
one voluntary winding up, and the establishment of 
the Ghana Amalgamated T rust (GAT), a vehicle to 
pool funds from investors to acquire equity stakes in 
five indigenous banks to enable them to comply with 
the new minimum capital requirement. With the new 
capital levels, banks are expected to be able to engage 
in relatively larger transactions, both individually and 
through syndications. BoG is also strengthening super -
vision, including through enforcement of prudential 
standards, implementation of a new capital require -
ments directive, introduction of risk management and 
corporate governance directives, among others.In addition to banks, there are many 
(non-bank) SDIs and informal institutions, which 
often serve the least financially included segments 
of the population. These institutions are primar-
ily regulated by BoG7 and include Microfinance 
Companies (MFCs), Micro Credit Companies 
(MCCs), and Financial NGOs—jointly classified 
as Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); Rural and 
Community Banks (RCBs); Susu Collectors; Savings 
and Loans Companies (S&Ls); and Finance Houses 
(FHs). As a group, SDIs account for around 14 percent 
of banks. In terms of size, S&Ls and FHs are relatively 
larger and focus on consumer lending, while RCBs 
are owned and governed by local communities and 
tend to have broader outreach, offering savings, credit, 
and payment services to less included groups such as 
women, the poor, and rural residents. Moreover, there 
are informal financial services providers such as Village 
Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs).
Many SDIs are not operating in a safe and sound 
manner and are in violation of prudential norms. 
Not all the SDIs are currently active because they have 
either stopped reporting or have folded. Others are 
financially distressed, facing liquidity and/or solvency 
challenges. The BoG estimates that about a third of 
the 707 MFIs and RCBs are distressed or have folded, 
putting more than 700,000 depositors at risk (BoG 
2017). Given that the most distressed entities have no 
recoverable assets, their resolution entails fiscal costs. 
Moreover, a considerable number of active MFIs do 
not comply with the minimum capital requirement.8 
In response to these challenges, BoG revoked licenses 
7  S&Ls and FHs are under the BoG’s Banking Supervision Department 
while the remaining institutions are under BoG’s Other Financial Institu-
tions Supervision Department. The RCBs are also under the oversight 
of the ARB Apex Bank, with delegated functions from the BoG. Susu 
collectors and individual money lenders are supervised by Ghana Coop-
erative Susu Collectors Association on behalf of the BoG. 
8  As of June 30, 2017, the minimum capital requirements were GH¢7 
million for S&Ls and FH; GH¢ 0.5 million for MFCs, MCCs, and RCBs; 
and GH¢0.3 million for FNGOs. The new minimum capital require-
ments are GH¢15 million for S&Ls and FHs (effective December 31, 
2018); GH¢ 2 million for MFCs and MCCs (effective June 30, 2018); 
GH¢1 million for RCBs (effective December 31, 2017); and GH¢0.3 
million for FNGOs (unchanged). Individual money lenders and Susu 
collectors are not subject to minimum capital requirements. Financial SEctor dEvElopmEnt and Financial incluSion 25
of 347 Microfinance Companies and 39 Micro-credit 
Companies on 31 May 2019. At the same time, Bank 
of Ghana is strengthening its regulatory and supervi -
sory framework for SDIs, including reviewing licens -
ing and supervisory policies and directives, reviewing 
capital requirements and encouraging consolidation, 
enhancing governance, and increasing resources avail -
able for supervision (BoG 2019).
Reducing financial sector vulnerability is 
urgent and will require additional efforts in 2019, 
and over the medium term. In total, in 2019, the 
government will have to spend an additional GH¢5.5 
billion (equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP) to solve 
all challenges related to the MFIs, Savings and Loans, 
and the introduction of another resolution bond for 
the CBG to support the closure of two additional 
banks that took place in January 2019 (IMF 2019). 
The resolution of SDIs, which includes MFIs, S&Ls, 
and FHs follows action plans developed by BoG. The 
Government is planning a phased approach of the 
SDI-resolution agenda. The implementation of these 
action plans and stronger supervision and regulation 
of the sector will help mitigate vulnerabilities. The 
Government has also established a Financial Stability 
Council integrating financial regulators and Ghana 
Deposit Protection Corporation to, among other 
things, assess the vulnerability of the financial system 
on an ongoing basis. To help strengthen resilience and 
stability of the banking system, the authorities are 
expected strengthen the regulatory and supervisory 
framework and introduce roll-out a deposit insurance 
scheme. The reform agenda for SDIs is supported by 
the World Bank.
A Case for Financial Inclusion
More financial inclusion is good for the 
economy …
Financial inclusion means that individuals and 
businesses have access to useful and affordable 
financial products and services that meet their 
needs. With access to a financial account, people no longer need to rely on and transact solely in cash or 
use their mattresses as savings cabinets (World Bank 
2018c). Financial access connects people into the for-
mal financial system, making day-to-day living easier. 
As account holders, people are more likely to use other 
financial services, such as credit and insurance, to start 
and expand businesses, invest in education or health, 
manage risk, and weather financial shocks, which can 
improve the overall quality of their lives. Ultimately, 
more and better financial intermediation will have 
a positive impact on growth, mostly through lower 
transaction costs and better distribution of capital and 
risk across the economy (World Bank 2014).
Alongside the rapidly increasing financial 
sector since 2010, the share of Ghanaians with 
access to formal financial services has increased. 
According to Consultative Group to Assist the Poor 
(CGAP 2015) 58 percent of Ghanaians had access 
to formal financial services in 2015, up from 41 
percent in 2010 (Figure 3.1.1). While banks con -
tributed 36 of the 58 percentage points in formal 
access, they only contributed 2 of the 17 percentage 
points increase between 2010 and 2015; conversely, 
mobile money alone accounted for 7 percentage 
points of the increase, and mobile money and other 
NBFIs—regulated MFIs, credit unions, insur -
ance companies, etc.—jointly accounted for the 
remaining 8 percentage point increase. The share 
of Ghanaians with a registered financial account 
(bank, NBFI, or mobile money account) was 48 
percent in 2015. More recent data (Findex 2017), 
shows that the percentage of Ghanaians with reg -
istered financial accounts increased to 58 percent 
in 2017, while the percentage with mobile money 
accounts increased from 13 to 39 percent between 
2014 and 2017 (Figure 3.1.2).
Yet, some regions and key demographics 
have only limited access to financial services.  
In terms of regions, the five poorest regions (Upper 
West, Northern, Volta, Upper East, and Brong 
Ahafo) remain the least financially included, despite 
the largest gains in financial inclusion taking place 
in these areas between 2010 and 2015. Similarly, 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION26
rural residents, women, and the poor have less 
access to financial accounts compared to the aver -
age population and their respective counterparts 
(Figure 3.1.3).
… yet rural access is low, the poor and 
women are largely excluded from financial 
services.
Rural access to formal financial accounts is 
low, but almost doubled between 2011 and 2017, 
due to a rising market share of NBFIs . People liv -
ing in remote areas usually face a physical distance 
to financial access when banks or other access points 
are simply too far away to reach, unless long bus 
rides can be afforded (World Bank 2012). Yet, rural 
access in Ghana almost doubled, between 2011 and 
2017, from 26 to 51 percent (Figure 3.1.4). Much 
of the growth in rural access has come from formal 
accounts being offered by NBFIs, that have grown 
their footprints in underserved regions of the coun -
try, in a combination of mobile money and other 
non-bank formal institutions (World Bank 2016). 
In fact, rural residents—such as women and the 
poor—rely more heavily on NBFIs and informal 
financial services than do urban residents, men, and 
the non-poor.
Almost one-third of all adults in Ghana used 
informal financial services in 2015. According to 
CGAP (2015), 29 percent of adult Ghanaians used 
informal financial services and products, which are not 
regulated by the Government. VSLAs are one impor -
tant type of informal financial institutions. They are 
typically groups of around 30 members and often take 
the form of rotating savings and credit associations, in 
which members make deposits into a group fund and 
take turns borrowing funds for investment purposes 
or household needs. According to Savings Groups’ 
Information Exchange, there are 10,832 savings groups 
in Ghana, comprised of 282,001 members (an average 
of 26 members per group).9 Of these members, women 
are the largest participants, comprising 76.4 percent or 
approximately 214,320 members. These groups have approximately US$13 million in savings and US$8.7 
million in outstanding loans. The dropout rate among 
members is relatively low at 2.9 percent.
Women are less financially included than men 
in Ghana. The exclusion of women from financial 
services is a prevalent phenomenon at the global level 
for a variety of reasons, including the fact that women 
often may not be aware of the services available to 
them or may be prevented from making use of them. 
In addition, it is far too common that women lack 
collateral for loans, making them ineligible to access 
financial services (Grandolini 2015). In Ghana, female 
inclusion continues to fall below the national average. 
In 2017, 54 percent of women had an account with a 
formal financial institution, compared to 58 percent 
for the general population and 62 percent of men. 
The percentage difference between female inclusion 
and inclusion of the general population has widened 
according to the Findex survey (one percentage points 
difference in 2014 compared to a four percentage 
points in 2017), suggesting that men are now being 
included at a faster rate than women.
Excluding women from access to financial ser-
vices means widespread lost opportunity for their 
households and the economy as a whole. Access 
to financial services helps women shape household 
spending decisions (often toward education and 
health-related causes), make investments, and man-
age economic risk. A 2018 study on Ghana showed 
that women who were provided the ability to utilize 
a commitment savings account prioritized savings to 
ensure their ability to smooth household consumption 
and respond to shocks. The women in the sample also 
maintained pressure on their partner to meet current 
needs and invest in children and property for the 
future (Friedson-Ridenour et al. 2018).10 A literature 
9  The data captures only 49 projects, mainly facilitated or implemented 
by CARE, Plan International, and World Vision. Therefore, the actual 
number and reach of savings groups in Ghana is much higher.
10  More Ghana-specific insights will come from an analysis of the latest 
household survey (GSSL7). The World Bank plans to produce a new 
Ghana Poverty Assessment over the next 18 months based on the latest 
survey. Financial SEctor dEvElopmEnt and Financial incluSion 27

review of global experiences (Klapper 2015), illustrates 
other yet similar examples of the power of financial 
access for women. In Burkina Faso and Senegal, 
access to insurance helped women farmers to increase 
yields and better manage food security (Delavallade 
et al. 2015). In Niger, mobile cash transfers strength-
ened women’s bargaining power, boosted spending 
on nutritious foods, and allowed women to spend 
more time on productive tasks by reducing the need 
to travel to receive cash payments (Aker et al. 2015). 
Women-headed households in Nepal spent 20 percent 
more on education after receiving a savings account 
(Prina 2015).
The poor have significantly lower access to for-
mal financial services than the non-poor. According 
to Findex (2017) only 48 percent of the poorest 40 
percent had a financial account, compared to 64 
percent of the richest 60 percent. This finding is not 
surprising since globally, poverty is the leading cause 
for being “unbanked.” According to World Bank 
(2012), almost two-thirds of the global financially 
excluded population cite poverty as the main obstacle; 
the poor in most cases have no income to afford the 
cost of opening or maintaining an account nor do 
they have the possibility to build up savings. This is 
particularly true for women. In Ghana, the poor tend 
to rely more on informal financial services than the 
non-poor (Findex 2017).
The share of the population that save in a for-
mal financial institution fell between 2014 and 
2017. While the share of those saving at a finan-
cial institution (including in rural areas) increased 
between 2011 and 2014, it fell between 2014 and 
2017. Similarly, the share of the respondents who 
had saved in the 12 months preceding the survey, 
declined from 55 percent in 2014 to 50 percent in 
2017 (Figure 3.1.5). This finding is likely associated 
to the fact that the macro-fiscal situation in Ghana 
was uncertain over this period in an economy that 
had lost the dynamism to provide widespread oppor-
tunities for its people; inflation rates were high (19.2 
percent in 2016), and economic growth was low (only 
3.6 percent in 2016). The World Bank’s recent SCD found that the period between 2012 and 2016 has, for 
the first time in decades, seen an economy unable to 
generate poverty-reducing economic growth (World 
Bank 2018d). It is therefore not surprising that sav-
ings fell in that period.
Low financial literacy and high interest rates 
are key issues for financial inclusion
Low financial literacy is an important long-term 
factor for low savings rates and suppressed demand 
for financial services in Ghana. Baidoo et al. 
(2018) show that financial literacy is key to promoting 
domestic savings in the country and hence, according 
to the authors, the issue requires more policy attention. 
Indeed, financial illiteracy has an even more profound 
impact that goes beyond savings. Financially illiter-
ate consumers are not actually able to demand the 
services they need on the market. So, with a sizable 
proportion of the adult population still underserved 
by formal financial institutions, there is an argument 
for stimulating demand among these groups, through 
targeted financial literacy and education campaigns. 
In a crowded market with many formal and informal 
financial institutions offering their services, financial 
inclusion-related issues arise from the relationship 
between providers and their consumers, not only 
related to the use of services, but also to the low level 
of financial capability in general.
Persistently high interest rates are a major bar-
rier to access. High interest rates partially reflect a 
high default risk as implied by high NPL rates posted 
by banks. In that context, leveraging data to support 
the development of credit markets is critical to market 
growth and better service provision for both individu -
als and SMEs. The aggregation of data on transaction 
history of customers presents a significant opportunity 
to better ascertain the viability of a particular customer 
or business when it comes to the provision of credit 
facilities. Similarly, social media platforms, are devel-
oping data analytics tools that can predict financial 
behavior of individuals, which could be leveraged for 
developing fit for purpose credit products. However, Financial SEctor dEvElopmEnt and Financial incluSion 29
the sharing of data throughout the financial sector in 
Ghana is not uniform. While some DFS providers 
are employing data analytics to develop alternative 
credit profiles, significant segments of the market 
remain at a data disadvantage, limiting their ability 
to develop and sell credit-based products. The result 
is an underdeveloped credit market, which presents 
significant risk for default and offers services at sus-
tained high interest rates that constrain borrowing 
and fuel over-indebtedness.
Despite all the challenges, there has been sig -
nificant growth in the number of access points 
over the past five years, primarily related to the 
spread of mobile money. The penetration of select 
access points—ATMs, branches, and mobile money 
agents—has continued to increase since 2013 
(Figure 3.1.6). However, the penetration of mobile 
money agent locations throughout Ghana is far 
greater than traditional access points such as ATMs 
and branch networks, highlighting the importance 
of new technology to advance the financial inclu -
sion agenda.
Digital Financial Services and Payments
Digital innovations play a key role for a 
more financially inclusive economy …
Mobile phone penetration has created opportu -
nities for the expansion of financial services and 
increased the role of non-financial institutions. 
Ghana is the fastest growing mobile money market 
in Africa. The total number of mobile voice subscrip -
tions grew 39 percent from 25.6 to 37.4 million 
between 2012 and 2017 (Figure 3.2.1). In tandem, 
registered mobile money accounts increased six-fold 
between 2012 and 2017, from 3.8 million to 23.9 
million. Active mobile money accounts increased 
significantly from 345,434 to 11.2 million between 
2012 and 2017. As a result, the number and value of 
mobile money transactions skyrocketed since 2012 
to 982 million and GH¢156 billion in 2017, respec -
tively11 (Figures 3.2.3 and 3.2.4). The market share is very skewed with one provider accounting for over 
80 percent of the market. While registered mobile 
money customers and usage increased in tandem with 
mobile phone penetration, they remain significantly 
below mobile phone ownership, demonstrating that 
there is space for mobile money to contribute even 
more to financial inclusion. The expansion of the 
agent distribution network was critical to the suc -
cess of mobile money. The number of active agents 
increased from 5,900 in 2012 to 151,745 in 2017 
(Figure 3.2.2). This expansion of agents offered 
users more cash-in and cash-out opportunities and 
increased the overall convenience of using mobile 
money.
 Banks have recently contributed the least to 
increasing financial inclusion across the country. 
Much of this is the result of their lack of focus on 
offering financial solutions to everyday Ghanaians, 
but instead focusing on corporate banking and 
high net worth individuals. However, the growth 
of mobile money has demonstrated the potential of 
retail financial services. Recognizing that mass mar -
ket banking presents a significant opportunity for 
growth, many banks are now also utilizing digital 
channels to broaden their reach and customer base. 
Liberalization of the Unstructured Supplementary 
Service Data (USSD) channel has been critical to the 
market, allowing banks to also leverage the mobile 
phone as a channel for delivering financial services. 
Multiple banks have developed mobile banking ser -
vices, deploying solutions developed by domestic 
fintech companies.
 Other forms of electronic payment instru-
ments are also growing, albeit at a slower rate than 
mobile money. T ransactions at ATMs and POS ter-
minals facilitated by the national switch have grown 
consistently since 2012 (Figure 3.2.5), with over 2.3 
11  The rate of growth of the volume of mobile money transactions rose 
sharply after 2015, following a shift in regulatory approach by the Bank 
of Ghana (switch from a model that mandated a group of banks to 
partner with a group of Mobile Network Operators (MNO)s and agents 
were required to be shared, to a model that allows MNOs to operate 
independently through subsidiaries regulated and supervised by BoG).4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION30

million being undertaken in 2017 alone. Similarly, 
direct credit transactions, which are transfers from 
one bank account into another, through the central 
electronic fund transfer system of Ghana, have also 
continued to increase. While banks have not been 
a driving force for increased financial inclusion in 
Ghana, they are seeing existing accounts being utilized 
more by existing customers, suggesting a deepening of 
financial inclusion and literacy among their current 
customer base.
The government has facilitated interoper -
ability across payment instruments by establish -
ing a mobile money switching solution. In May 
2018, the GhIPSS went live with the one of the first 
interoperable mobile money switch in Africa. An 
extension of the existing GhLink switch, the new 
system allows customers to push and pull funds 
across mobile money providers and between mobile 
money providers and banks. Recognizing the impor -
tance of payment systems and financial inclusion to 
improved economic growth and performance, the 
Government has shown a high level of commitment 
in driving digitization and innovation in payments. 
This commitment is within the context of a very 
active and burgeoning fintech space, where the rate 
of innovation across providers has driven the usage 
of mobile money accounts and other forms of trans -
action account.
Interoperability has increased the convenience 
and value proposition of DFS for many financial 
consumers. As active usage increases, so has the range 
of products and services riding on the DFS infrastruc-
ture. Customers are beginning to access micro-credit 
directly from their mobile phones, without having to 
enter a bank branch; similarly, international remit-
tances from relatives overseas are being terminated 
directly onto mobile wallets, significantly increas-
ing convenience and efficiency for beneficiaries. 
Partnerships between different financial institutions 
have been essential for much of the use-case devel-
opment observed in Ghana. For instance, a leading 
bank and mobile money provider have come together 
to offer savings accounts linked to mobile money wallets that offer customers competitive annualized 
interest rates.
… and the Government has taken some 
initiatives to encourage financial innovation.
Another notable government initiative was 
the introduction in 2008 of the E-zwich biomet -
ric card. E-zwich cards can be used at any E-zwich 
enabled point of sale terminal  or ATM, at any 
bank, and also for payments, including salaries or 
pensions, which can be loaded onto a cardholders 
account. The uptake and usage of the E-Zwich card 
has been increasing, but it is constrained by limited 
merchant acceptance. As of December 2018, 2.7 
million E-Zwich cards had been issued, with 7.7 
million transactions worth GH¢5.6 billion (2 per -
cent of GDP). However, only 53 percent of the cards 
have residual value because most E-zwich transfers 
are immediately “cashed out.” Although not as sig -
nificant as the growth seen in use of mobile money, 
direct credit, or check-based transactions, there has 
been substantial growth in the number of E-zwich 
cards issued, (both in volume and in value of trans -
actions) since 2010. The number of cards issued in 
2018 when compared to 2010 has grown by 5 times, 
while the value of transactions moving through the 
system have seen significant growth of over 60 times 
the value transacted in 2010.
The success of DFS in driving financial inclu-
sion has encouraged the Government to develop 
both a vision and strategies to expand financial 
inclusion in Ghana. Working with development 
partners such as the World Bank and CGAP , the GoG 
has developed a NFIDS that covers the 2017–2023 
period. In addition, with a growing FinTech market, 
a DFS policy has also been developed, setting out a 
clear vision for establishing a truly digital economy in 
Ghana. Importantly, both the NFIDS and the DFS 
policy highlight clear opportunities and growth areas 
going forward.
The NFIDS (2017–2023) outlines reforms 
to increase financial inclusion from 58 percent 4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION32
in 2015 to 85 percent in 2023. The reforms are 
structured around five mutually reinforcing pri -
ority areas or pillars of financial sector develop -
ment: (i) Financial Stability; (ii) Access, Quality, 
and Usage of Financial Services; (iii) Financial 
Infrastructure; (iv) Financial Consumer Protection; 
and (v) Financial Capacity. In particular, the NFIDS 
acknowledges Ghana’s financial stability challenges 
and seeks to address them as a pre-condition for 
promoting sustainable financial inclusion and devel -
opment. The increase in access to financial services 
is expected to create economic opportunities and 
contribute to poverty reduction.
As a compliment to the NFIDS, the govern -
ment has also developed its DFS Policy, which 
establishes a 3-year roadmap (2018–2020).  The 
roadmap aims to build on technological advances and 
ecosystem evolutions to create a resilient, inclusive, 
and innovative DFS ecosystem that bolsters social 
development and a robust economy that supports a 
thriving private sector. The DFS seeks to achieve two 
goals by 2020: First, all Ghanaians will have access to a 
broad range of suitable and affordable DFS—includ -
ing payment, credit, savings, insurance, and invest -
ment. Payment flows will have been digitized and 
formalized, thereby shrinking the informal economy, 
increasing government revenues, and making mon -
etary policies more effective. Second, businesses and 
government will have achieved greater transparency 
and efficiency to contribute to the economic growth 
of the nation.
The ongoing rollout of the biometric central -
ized national ID system will provide the sup -
porting infrastructure to facilitate the financial 
inclusion of the remaining 42 percent of adult 
Ghanaians. Currently there are nine separate identity 
databases across various public-sector entities. The 
rollout of the new centralized system will accelerate 
digital payments by adopting a unified approach to 
identification and authorization of transactions. In 
fact, 22 percent of Ghanaians identified the lack of 
documentation as the reason for not having a financial 
account (Findex 2017).Opportunities to Improve Financial 
Inclusion
Digitizing government and utility payments 
will be critical.
There remain significant opportunities in the 
payments space for driving financial inclusion, 
specifically in the area of government collections 
and utility payments. While government to person 
payments are nearly all electronic, there are untapped 
opportunities for digiting government collections, 
the majority of which are still paid in cash. Similarly, 
digitizing payments of electricity and water, which 
are almost exclusively still paid in cash, will bring sig-
nificant convenience to millions of people, deepening 
financial inclusion further. Current approaches remain 
piecemeal and clear direction from Government 
is needed to further push existing projects in these 
areas. To do so, financial and technical support to the 
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), and 
utilities is required to update their internal accounting 
systems. This would allow full integration via open 
application program interfaces (APIs) into institutions 
such as GhIPSS, allowing for individuals to use their 
bank account or mobile wallets to pay for government 
services or utility bills.
In 2014, the GoG launched the Ghana 
E-Payment Portal (GEPP) but the one-stop-shop 
idea for digitizing G2P payments has yet to take 
off. The GEPP has been rolled out in only twelve 
Municipal and District Assemblies and only very few 
services are offered, such as the marriage registration 
fee payment under Accra Metropolitan Assembly 
(AMA) services. Those services that are offered gen-
erally require only one-off payments. Coupled with 
the fact that a transaction fee is charged to customers 
for use of the portal, it is not surprising that there is 
low uptake of these services. Whether a centralized 
approach as seen with GEPP or bespoke solutions for 
individual MDAs is taken, it is evident that there is 
a need for a policy mandating the digital payment of 
all fees and fines to Government.Financial SEctor dEvElopmEnt and Financial incluSion 33
Collections of taxes from small payers—which 
are almost exclusively done via cash payments—
offer a significant opportunity to leverage a large 
volume of payments to support financial inclusion 
efforts. GEPP began accepting payment of taxes 
online in 2017, commencing with large taxpayers; 
however, issues with service delivery have limited 
tax transactions via the portal. The Small Tax Offices 
(STOs) of the Ghana Revenue Authority, which are 
responsible for processing a significant volume of 
tax payments from individuals, business, and infor-
mal sector, almost conduct all transactions in cash. 
Therefore, mandating that such transactions be con-
ducted digitally would not only support the financial 
inclusion efforts but would also address ongoing 
challenges such as fiscal leakages, while increasing 
the operational efficiency of tax offices by freeing up 
staff to better focus on increasing the overall tax base 
of the country.
Digitization of utility payments such as water 
and electricity bills has started but is still not 
complete. According to the World Bank, 79 percent 
of the Ghanaian population has access to electricity 
in 2016. The distribution is provided by two sepa-
rate state monopolies: the Electricity Company of 
Ghana (ECG)—now Power Distribution Services 
(PDS)—for Southern Ghana and urban areas (over-
all 70 percent market share; ECG 2017) and the 
Northern Electricity Distribution Company for the 
rural Northern part of Ghana. For post-paid house-
holds (those that pay for electricity after it has been 
used) there are digital options for making payments, 
including via a bank account or mobile wallet. For 
pre-paid customers, who account for the largest share 
of households, payment cards can only be used at 
ECG pay points or from third party vendors. As with 
small tax payments this can only be done via checks 
or with cash.
The water sector12 lags significantly, with few 
opportunities to make digital payments. While digi-
tization efforts are ongoing, the process needs to be 
simplified and standardized to ensure migration from 
cash-based payments. Just shifting a fraction of the customers to digital payments would be a significant 
achievement for the GoG, as studies have shown that 
access to energy and water offers a significant incentive 
for customers to register for and actively use digital 
payment channels (BTCA 2017).
Linking informal channels with formal 
financial services is key.
Since informal groups play a critical role in the 
provision of financial services, there is an oppor-
tunity to increase formal financial inclusion by 
linking them to formal financial services providers. 
There have been programs in the past attempting to 
create linkages between VSLAs and the formal finan-
cial sector. Typically, linkage programs help to create or 
train VSLA groups on how to operate as a group and 
support formal financial services providers design and 
offer products suitable to VSLAs. For example, one 
common approach is to help groups open accounts 
in banks or in other financial institutions, therefore 
substituting for traditional ‘lock box’ used to keep 
group money safe.
Mobile money is increasingly being used to 
improve the VSLA business model. Through part-
nerships between financial institutions and mobile 
money operators, VSLA groups can store and access 
their money in e-wallets on their phones and split up 
the electronic pin among multiple group members to 
ensure the security of funds. Interoperability between 
a mobile provider and a bank account has also enabled 
VSLA groups to move funds between banks, mobile 
wallets, and the group itself. This also helps ease the 
burden and risk of moving cash between a group and 
a financial institution. Such linkages can help VSLA 
members get their foot in the door of formal financial 
institutions and to build their capacity to utilize formal 
financial services, so when members are ready to join 
as individuals, they can do so by opening a savings or 
transaction account.

Water and Sanitation Agency services rural communities.4TH GHANA ECONOMIC UPDATE – ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION34
Overall, the effectiveness of linkages depends 
on the availability of access points (including a 
network of bank and mobile money agents) and 
a stronger consumer protection framework. Thus, 
there is a complementarity between linkages and the 
promotion of agent banking. Without effective con-
sumer protection, linkages expose VSLAs members 
to abusive and predatory practices by some financial 
services providers. Therefore, it is essential to educate 
consumers about their rights and to put in place a 
reliable recourse mechanism.
Promoting agent banking can increase 
institutional footprints across the country.
Many banks and other non-bank financial 
institutions are yet to take advantage of agent bank-
ing and other low-cost models to increase their 
footprint throughout the country. High costs of 
setting up brick and mortar branches and lower lev-
els of economic activity in some rural areas of Ghana 
have eroded the business case for improving financial 
access to communities in these regions. To set up 
one branch location can cost between GH¢300,000 
and GH¢600,000, with an additional GH¢10,000–
30,000 per month in operational costs. In compari-
son, the cost of starting an agent outlet is estimated 
at GH¢10,000. In addition, given their physical and 
cultural proximity to financially underserved commu-
nities, agents are better suited than traditional bank 
branches to drive financial inclusion, particularly in 
rural areas. A recent study conducted in Senegal by 
the World Bank, shows that, compared to branches, 
agent banking lowers transaction costs and encourages 
individuals to visit the agents often and to save more 
(Buri et al. 2018).
The industry is yet to respond to regulatory 
developments allowing them to authorize agents 
to act on their behalf. By authorizing retail busi -
nesses (shops, pharmacies, etc.) and individuals to 
act as agents on behalf of financial institutions, agent 
banking enables the provision of financial services in 
remote areas on a scale that is commensurate with transaction levels. Recognizing the opportunity, the 
BoG issued Agent Guidelines in July 2015 to guide 
the recruitment and management of agent networks 
by banks and electronic money issuers. However, the 
adoption of the agent banking model has been slow, 
despite a successful rollout of agent banking by a lead-
ing indigenous bank. It is clear that further promotion 
of agent banking is needed.
Financial literacy and better use of data can 
stimulate demand for services.
Improved financial literacy programs could 
stimulate demand for services. In Ghana, many 
consumers have been victims of predatory practices 
as they seek high investment returns offered by MFIs; 
others have been using digital credit products without 
fully understanding their rights and obligations as con -
sumers. Literacy and education programs should be 
tailored to the needs of target groups, and emphasize 
knowledge of financial products, financial concepts, 
and basic numeracy skills. Given the growth in the 
use of DFS, it is important to increase the digital 
literacy of the public to safeguard customers’ rights 
and prevent instances of misuse or fraud. A concerted 
effort to improve the overall level of financial literacy 
in Ghana will give consumers a better understanding 
of why financial services can be of benefit to achieving 
economic empowerment.
The Government should take the lead in 
developing sound policies and/or the legal frame-
works to mandate data-sharing. There is a role for 
Government in mandating data-sharing or data por-
tability to help level the playing field, allowing for 
new entrants into the market to create competition 
and lower transaction costs. Leveraging the concept 
that the individual is the owner of their own data, 
as outlined in the Data Protection Act 2012, the 
GoG could facilitate the introduction of a limited 
data-sharing regulation between data controllers and 
other regulated credit institutions, on the basis that 
explicit consumer consent is obtained prior to the 
sharing of any individuals information. As outlined Financial SEctor dEvElopmEnt and Financial incluSion 35
in MoF (2018), there is a clear role for the Ministry 
of Communication and the BoG in moving this for-
ward and in obtaining buy-in from other stakeholders 
such as the current data controllers in the Ghanaian 
market (MNOs, Social Media platforms, banks). This 
would build on information already provided by credit 
bureaus and the collateral registry.
In conclusion, universal financial access is an 
attainable target in Ghana with the use of innovative 
technology and approaches. This is needed as access 
to financial services is heterogeneous across regions and 
key demographics. The analysis found, not surprisingly, 
that the poor have significantly lower access to formal 
financial services than the non-poor. Insufficient finan -
cial literacy is an important long-term factor for low 
savings rates in Ghana, and more broadly, financial 
illiteracy suppresses consumers’ demand for financial 
services. In addition, persistently high interest rates 
in Ghana are a major barrier to affordable access. But 
despite all the challenges, there has been significant growth in the number of financial access points over 
the past five years, primarily related to the spread of 
mobile money. This indicates the potential of DFS 
and payments to further enhance financial inclusion 
in Ghana. In the meantime, Ghana has a banking sec -
tor that has been facing serious soundness challenges, 
which after years of build-up culminated in 2018 with 
a series of necessary and expensive banking resolutions. 
Further reducing vulnerabilities in the financial sector 
is urgent and will require additional efforts in 2019, 
and over the medium term. The GoG must lead the 
implementation of the approaches outlined in NFIDS 
and DFS Policy; this should be done in collaboration 
with the private sector. With the successes already 
realized in the payment space with mobile money, 
the demand for effective financial solutions has been 
proven. Investments should now be made to improve 
internal systems and processes of MDAs, generating 
new use cases that will bring greater convenience to 
customers.37
