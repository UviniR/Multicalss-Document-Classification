Abstract
Purpose –The purpose of this paper is to understand Indian consumers ’intention to use mobile payments
by examining their adoption readiness (AR) in the larger context of their technology readiness (TR) and theirprivacy concerns (PCs).
Design/methodology/approach –A four-city, three language, paper and pencil survey yielded a sample of
600 respondents from India. Data were analyzed using structural equations modeling.
Findings –This study finds that AR positively mediates the relationship between TR and intention to adopt
(IA) mobile payments. More importantly, PCs negatively moderate the relationship between AR and IA.Research limitations/implications –Results will vary depending on country and other variables outside
the scope of this study such as perceived risk, trust, etc. The sample was large but mainly comprised males,
between 18 and 35 years of age.Practical implications –The cash shortage due to a recent demonetization move in India had spurred
mobile payment adoption but usage and retention remained low. Many other banking self-service
technologies had not been successful and digitization was critical for easing payments and potentially paving
the way for mobile banking. However, using mobile phones for financial transactions raises PCs that
attenuate the positive impact of AR. Also, understanding overall attitudes with TR is important in a rapidlydigitizing country with relatively novice users.
Social implications –Adoption of mobile payment technology can help address social and economic
challenges in India, such as financial inclusion, corruption and tax evasion. Given the increasing awareness ofprivacy issues in India, mobile payment adoption, which already faces acquisition and retention challenges,
will likely to face greater resistance in the future.
Originality/value –The findings add to the literature on emerging markets and marketing of technology
products by identifying the critical role of privacy in the adoption of financial technology services.
Moreover, the authors demonstrate that given the rapid introduction of technology in India, consumers ’
overarching TR has to be considered along with AR for mobile payments. Thus, the authors offer a tripartite,
customer –technology –transaction view of the mobile payment adoption process in India.

1. Introduction
India had grown dramatically since its economic liberalization in 1991. Pegged as the fastest
growing emerging market in the world, it had pulled millions of its 1.2bn population out of
poverty. India ’s growth rate was 7.3 percent in 2016, when in a bold, overnight move, aimed
at curbing corruption, tax evasion and counterfeiting, its prime minister banned the two
largest currency notes (Anand and Kumar, 2016). Demonetization took nearly 86 percent of
India ’s legal notes out of circulation and was expected to reduce its growth rate by a wholeInternational Journal of Bank

percent the following year (Iyenger, 2016). Replacing the currency notes was the first step
but the next, long-term move was to increase transparency by digitizing payment systems.
This would also expand access to financial services, currently a major bottleneck in India.
However, when almost 95 percent of transactions were in cash and 90 percent of vendors did
not even have the ability to accept any other form of payment (Wade, 2017), going cashless
was a challenging endeavor for Indians.
In 2016, India had 650m mobile phone users, of which more than 300m people used
smartphones. Indeed, India was already the second largest smartphone market in the world,
second only to China (Iyengar, 2017). It seemed likely that mobile payment systems such as
M-Pesa, which had become hugely popular in Kenya (Anyaso and Otubo, 2009), could helpIndians leapfrog payment technologies such as bank transfers or credit/debit cards, and move
straight from cash to digital payments (Iyenger, 2016). However, a study found that 68 percent
of Indians still preferred cash and 48 percent believed that digital payments lacked a solid
value proposition. About 55 percent were unaware of how the system worked and thought it
was too complex (Kalavalapalli and Nair, 2016). Mobile payment providers that had faced
customer acquisition challenges before demonetization now had rapid sign-ups but low usage
or retention. The market was fragmented with rapid new market entrants and volatile market
shares. High failure rates of entrants suggested that the determinants of mobile payment
adoption were unclear.
Mobile payments systems are a relatively recent self-service technology (SST). Though
SSTs have been researched for quite some time, these insights are unlikely to be completely
pertinent in understanding mobile payment adoption in India for several reasons: first, mostSST research is conducted in developed countries that are dramatically different from
emerging markets. It is also not possible to extrapolate the learnings from one emerging
market to another (Sinha and Sheth, Forthcoming 2018); second, in any case, mobile
payments are not widely used in developed markets thereby limiting insights on its
adoption; third, some studies have been conducted in emerging markets on mobile
payments or similar technologies but many do not have large generalizable samples; fourth,
moreover, technology adoption factors for one technology may not be applicable to another.
For example, a study of three banking technologies in the US, ATMs, phone banking and
internet banking, found that ATMs had more positive appeal than phone banking, which in
turn appealed more than online banking (Curran and Meuter, 2005). For all of these reasons,
the findings from the studies of alternate technologies from other countries, especially
developed ones, cannot be easily generalized to mobile payment adoption in India.
Most technology adoption studies examine attitudes toward a specific technology. While
that is important, we believe that in countries w ith rapid the introduction of new technologies
and novice consumers, it is also important to study general attitudes toward technology.
Accordingly, we examine not just Indian consumers ’adoption readiness (AR) for mobile
payments but also their overall technology re adiness (TR). Furthermore, we also consider
attitude toward privacy in India. Traditionally, t his crowded country with joint families living
in cramped spaces had little value for either physical or informational privacy. A brief
conversation with a relative stranger can quickly segue into a discussion of children ’s grades,
marital status, salary, caste and religion (Lakshmi, 2012). Earlier, one study found low privacy
concerns (PCs) even amongst hi-tech workers (Kumaraguru and Cranor, 2006). However, India
is changing rapidly and some studies have found high PCs. Recently, India created the world ’s
largest biometric database of over 1bn citizens. Subsequently, in August 2017, the Indian
Supreme Court ruled that citizens had a fundame ntal right to privacy (Kolachalam, 2017). Thus,
given the shifting privacy landscape and the fact that this transaction involves sensitive
financial information, it is important to consid er the role of privacy in mobile payment adoption.
Most research on technology adoption in India faces sample size and generalizability
constraints which we endeavor to overcome by surveying 600 respondents across four citiesIJBM

(two Tier 1 and two Tier 2) from north, south and west India, using questionnaires in three
languages. We intentionally eschew an online instrument in favor of a paper and pencil
survey to avoid a biased sample with greater comfort with technology than the
general population. This research has important practical and theoretical implications.
Mobile payment providers as well as the Indian Government needed to not only ensure
widespread adoption but also reduce the dropout rates to dissuade people from reverting to
cash transactions. Mobile payments are critical for easing the payment process for service
providers ranging from utility companies to retailers/e-tailers. If mobile payments could
replace or even reduce the use of cash, it would be a turning point in the government ’s effort
to increase transparency and curb corruption and tax evasion. Since a large majority of the
population did not have/use bank accounts, it would help increase access to financial
services such as storing/transferring money much more easily than cash.
From a theoretical perspective, this work contributes to an expanding body of knowledge
on technology adoption and adds to the sparse academic research on PCs in emerging
markets. Academic research on privacy issues in India is sparse. Further, unlike developed
countries that are relatively similar, emerging market nations are dramatically diverse in
terms of history, geography, social/cultural/business norms and laws/regulations (Sinha and
Sheth, Forthcoming 2018). To address the high within- and between-market heterogeneity,
researchers have been strongly encouraged to conduct research in the specific country of
interest (Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006). Thus, for all these reasons, understanding AR for
mobile payments in the context of consumers ’TR and PCs would add value to literature, while
also having corporate and policy implications for India ’s drive to go cashless.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the conceptual thought
underlying the proposed model and states the research objective. Then it provides a
background for India ’s drive to go cashless and presents a brief literature review, noting the
research gaps which this study aims to fill. Section 3 focuses on model development and
presents the hypotheses. Section 4 explains the research design. Section 5 presents the data
analysis and results. Finally, Section 6 concludes with a discussion, implications for theory
and practice, limitations and direction for future research.
2. Literature review and research objective
2.1 Conceptual development
This research examines the overlap area in the consumer, technology and transaction
interface in order to identify the key variables for mobile payment adoption in India. The
tripartite conceptualization is as follows (see Figure 1): consumer –technology: comfort with
technology in general; consumer –transaction: comfort with non-cash, i.e., digital financial
transactions conducted over mobile phones; and transaction –technology: safety/privacy of
consumers ’information in mobile phone-based transactions. Needless to add, there are
many other factors that can and have been considered in other research, but these are the
tripartite issues that this research focuses on.
The consumer –technology interface involves attitude toward technology in general which is
best evaluated by TR, i.e., peoples ’overall sense of comfort or disco mfort with using technologies
for life and work (Parasuraman and Colby, 2001). In countries such as India, technologies are a
relatively new introduction and while some new t echnologies have succeeded, others have not.
The speed of technology change may be a contri buting factor. Consider how mobile phones
leapfrogged landlines for telep hone access and bypassed desktops /laptops for internet access in
India. Such rapid advances transform daily ro utines and habits with insufficient time for
adaptation and so adoption or rejection of a speci fic technology may well be rooted in a general
attitude toward technology, r ather than just attitude toward that specific technology.
The consumer –transaction interface refers specifically to using mobile phones for financial
transactions. Frameworks created in developed countries such as the technology acceptanceMobile

model (TAM), which considers the perceived ease of using the technology and the
technology ’s usefulness (Davis, 1989), have been used for studying the adoption of specific
technologies. Later, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was
developed to account for cultural differences (Venkatesh et al. , 2003). However, UTAUT
suffered from correlation issues and so based on that a new construct, AR, was subsequently
developed (Thakur and Srivastava, 2014) which is used in this study as well.
The transaction –technology interface pertains to the perceptions of the privacy and
security of financial information on mobile phones. Prior research, largely in developed
countries, has found that consumers are most willing to provide demographic and lifestyle
information, but less willing to offer financial information and personal identifiers (Phelps
et al., 2000). However, India has limited laws, regulations and awareness surrounding the
issues of privacy (Lakshmi, 2017) and culturally it is acceptable for people to routinely share
personal information with others. There is some evidence that this is changing, and combined
with the fact that Indians were not yet accustomed to non-cash, digital payment methods, it
seems plausible that the idea of making financial transactions using mobile phones would
raise privacy and security concerns. Indeed, some recent research findings support this
viewpoint (cf. Vinayagamoorthy and Sankar, 2012; Singh et al., 2017).
2.2 Research objective
The research goal of this paper is to understand Indian consumers ’intentions to adopt mobile
payments by examining their AR in the context of their TR and their need for privacy. To the
best of our knowledge, this tripartite view of mobile payment adoption described above has
not been undertaken in India previously with a large multi-city, multi-language study.
The conceptual model is presented in Figure 2 and discussed subsequently.
2.3 India ’s drive to go cashless
India has just 13.54 bank branches per 100,000 adults and these are concentrated mainly in
urban/semi-urban areas. Technological innovations, such as solar powered, multi-lingual
ATMs, had had some limited success in expanding access (Saxena et al. , 2015).Comfort with mobile

Although 70 percent of India ’s population lives in villages, only 27 percent of its bank
branches are in rural areas ( Jain, 2016). Even in urban areas, scores of people lack the
documentation to open bank accounts and/or the skills to operate them. Despite the success
of a government drive to increase bank accounts, many remain dormant and have low or
zero balances (Tewari, 2017). India has just 200,000 ATMs, 28.8m credit cards and 818m
debit cards (Reserve Bank of India, 2017). Cash is the primary means of payment. An
alternative to how people transacted was much needed. However, digital payment
innovations such as app-based e-wallets or m-wallets relied on credit card and/or bank
account numbers, and thus could not help expand reach of alternative payment solutions.
In 2007, Safaricom and Vodafone had launched M-Pesa in Kenya, a system that used
mobile minutes as a means of making payments, deposits, withdrawals, transfers and
storage. By leveraging the high penetration of mobile phones in Kenya, including basic,
no-frills ones, M-Pesa had eased money circulation, remittances, business transactions and
sales, and lowered vendor transaction costs (Tiwari, 2013). Over 70 percent of the adult
population, nearly 50 percent of which were poor, unbanked and rural, adopted this service
(Amberber, 2014), dramatically expanding their access to basic financial services such as,
conveniently and securely, sending/receiving money, making payments, etc. (Beshouri and
Gravråk, 2010). However, mobile payments were yet to offer this level of success in India.
For example, though Vodafone had pioneered M-Pesa in Kenya, it was failing in India. Its
market share of 19 percent in 2015 had dropped to 6 percent by 2016, making way for a slew
of new players such as Paytm in this increasingly fragmented market (Boden, 2016).
2.4 Prior research
Mobile payments are essentially a type of SST. Prior research on SSTs suggests that their
benefits such as customization, flexibility and improved service recovery (Bitner, 2001;
Meuter et al., 2000; Bitner et al., 2000) build customer equity and loyalty (Rust and Kannan,
2003). Technology adoption depends on factors such as usefulness, convenience, ease of use
(EU), need/avoidance of service employee and social influence (SI) (Dabholkar and Bagozzi,
2002; Davis et al. , 1989; Meuter et al. , 2000). However, interacting with technology rather
than service personnel is also known to negatively impact the perceptions of service quality,
value, and loyalty (Parasuraman and Grewal, 2000). These findings provide someframework for understanding mobile payment adoption but country and technology
insights are still needed.
Some recent research in related areas in other emerging markets is insightful, if not
directly applicable to mobile payment adoption in India. For example, one study in Mexico
identified EU, compatibility, trust and human contact as adoption antecedents for online
banking (Mansumitrchai, 2011). A cross-cultural comparison of Thai and Australian
consumers ’intention to adopt (IA) mobile banking found that while consumers from both
countries considered perceived usefulness and perceived risk, perceived EU was more
important for Australian consumers and SI was more important for Thai consumers

(Mortimer et al., 2015). One study on the adoption of mobile payments in India found the
impact of factors from the TAM and privacy (Thakur and Srivastava, 2014), while another
study also examined reliability and user friendliness (Singh, 2014). However, both these
studies used either small and/or convenience samples and in a limited number of cities, a
limitation this paper seeks to overcome.
3. Model development and hypotheses
Drawing upon extant research from the developed world and some insights from emerging
markets, the rationale for the proposed conceptual model and accompanying hypotheses areprovided below.
3.1 Technology readiness
Individuals ’traits and experiences impact consumers ’technology adoption decisions
(Rogers, 2003). When consumers engaged in service co-production (Bendapudi and Leone,
2003) their attitudes (Curran et al. , 2003) contributed to their technology adoption
propensity. A wide range of positive and negative reactions to technology may coexist
(Mick and Fournier, 1998), though the relative dominance of each would likely vary across
individuals. Thus, people can be arrayed along a hypothetical technology –beliefs
continuum anchored by strongly positive at one end and strongly negative at the other.
People existing on this continuum would likely correlate with their propensity to embrace
and employ technology.
TR is the propensity to use, embrace and empl oy new technologies f or accomplishing
personal or professional goals (Parasuraman and Colby, 2001). It refers to an overall state of
mind rather than a measure of competency and is an important measure to study for
“techno-ready marketing, ”the science and practice of marketi ng products and services that are
innovative and technology intensive such as mobile payments. Accordingly, the authors created
a technology readiness index (TRI) comprised of four dimensions: optimism –a positive belief
that technology increases control, flexib ility and efficiency; innovativeness –inclination to be a
pioneer and opinion leader in the adoption and use of technology; discomfort –overwhelming
feeling of lack of control ov er technology; and insecurity –distrust and skepticism about
technology and how it works. The TRI measur es a range of positive and negative feelings
about technology. High TR results in feelin gs of greater self-e fficacy with regard to
technology use (Venkatesh and Davis, 2007) and s tronger control over technology related tasks
(Kang et al., 2006), resulting in enhanced perceptions of the technology ’s usefulness and EU
(Gefen et al., 2003).
Customers tend to evaluate the customer –service interfaces based on their TR, which in
turn influences their cognitive service experience (Ding et al. , 2011). Most technology
adoption research, including that of mobile payments, studies a specific technology.
However, if consumers ’prior information, beliefs and experiences determine whether they
think that technologies are useful for their life and work (Parasuraman, 2000) then their TR
would likely affect their propensity to adopt any technology, making it an important
antecedent in technology adoption models.
Furthermore, prior research found that heavy users relied on their attitudes toward a
specific SST while light users relied more on their overall attitude toward SSTs (Curran
et al., 2003). This is an important insight for examining mobile payment adoption in India
because the post-demonetization spurt in adoption rates was more due to cash availability
constraints, government intervention and intensive advertising by providers, rather than an
organic growth resulting from a change in attitude. Since recent sign-ups were new adopters
who were likely to be light or non-users, their general attitude toward the use of technology
would likely influence their impressions about mobile payments. Thus, TR would be very
pertinent for studying mobile payment adoption in India. However, prior researchIJBM
Downloaded by INSEAD At 04:16 05 September 2018 (PT)
conducted on TR has mainly been in developed countries and insights from emerging or
developing markets remain limited. In a study focused on the adoption of online stock
trading systems in Taiwan, researchers demonstrated the importance of incorporating TR
into TAM (Lin et al., 2007). TR was also found to significantly influence internet banking in
Yemen (Al-Ajm and Nor, 2015) and India (Gupta and Garg, 2015).
Some international studies suggest that TR ’s influence on IA may not be direct. For
example, one study on e-services in Taiwan found that TR is positively correlated to both
perceived usefulness and perceived EU, the two salient constructs in the TAM (Lin and Hsieh,
2007). Another study conducted in India confirmed the same in the context of m-commerce
adoption (Roy and Moorthi, 2017). However, the concept of AR, which is discussed
subsequently, includes two additional dimensions as compared to TAM: SI and facilitating
conditions (FC). This paper posits that high TR would increase confidence and create openness
toward suggestions from important others to adopt a technology. This suggests the impact of
TR on SI. Similarly, high TR would suggest greater knowledge and confidence in one ’sa b i l i t y
to comprehend and use the assistance provided, making the case for the impact of TR on FC.
To the best of our knowledge, the linkage between TR and AR for adoption of mobile
payments is yet to be made. Based on all of the above, this paper proposes the following:
H1. TR will positively influence AR in India.
3.2 Adoption readiness
The TAM comprises perceived usefulness and perceived EU and is traditionally used to test
the adoption propensity of specific technologies (Davis et al. , 1989). Since TAM does not
consider the impact of culture which is important for studying technology adoption outside
the USA (Bandhopadhyay and Fraccastoro, 2007), it was adapted to incorporate cultural
differences by integrating elements from eight models resulting in a new model of adoption
called UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003).
However, it is noteworthy that in a subsequent study on mobile internet usage in
Hong Kong, the original creators of UTAUT found strong correlations between two of their
four constructs, perceived EU and perceived usefulness (Venkatesh et al. , 2012). Other
researchers have also found similar correlation issues between some of the constructs
(cf. Wessels and Drennan, 2010; Jiang and Deng, 2011), including one study which was a meta-
analysis (Qingxiong and Liu, 2004). Some researchers found correlations between all four
UTAUT constructs (cf. Curtis et al. , 2010). Therefore, instead of four separate constructs,
Thakur and Srivastava (2014) developed a comprehensive construct called AR that treats
each of them as dimensions of a single construct. Although the authors found an impact of AR
on mobile payment adoption, the sample comprised only highly educated and current users of
banking and mobile phone users, and so it is important to extend this understanding to a
broader audience. Below, the four dimensions that comprise AR are described.
3.2.1 Performance expectancy (PE) . PE is the expectation that the technology will
improve task performance. Some of the root constructs upon which this is based are:
perceived usefulness, i.e., resulting in easier and quicker accomplishment of tasks resulting
in improvement of job performance, productivity and effectiveness (Davis, 1989); job fit, i.e.,positive impact on performance in less time and/or with less effort (Thompson et al., 1991);
and relative advantage, i.e., saves time and increases productivity (Moore and Benbasat,
1995). Hofstede ’s cultural dimensions describes Indians as rather long-term orientated
(Hofstede, 2017) which suggests that technology adoption decisions may entail detailed
consideration of the learning curve and the continuing impact of moving over from cash to
mobile payments, both of which are considered in PE as well as in effort expectancy whichis described below. Expectations of superior performance of mobile payments, especially as
compared to cash, would spur adoption.Mobile

3.2.2 Ease of use . EU refers to the effortlessness of using the technology –higher the ease,
lower the effort needed. This is particularly salient in conditions where consumers are novices,
i.e., unfamiliar with the technology, which would result in greater cognitive load and difficultyin processing complex information and stimuli. Some of the root constructs upon which this is
based are: perceived EU, e.g., ease of operating the system and achieving the desired outcome
as well as ease of interaction and learning (Davis, 1989); complexity, e.g., lower cognitive load,faster learning and operations; EU, i.e., clear and understandable interaction with the system
and ease of operations (Moore and Benbasat, 1995). Although Indians were familiar with
mobile phones and mobile payments can be made using even the most basic mobile devices,the process involved in using minutes as payments would be a cognitive challenge initially.
Thus, with regard to mobile payments, Indians were novice consumers (as described earlier)
and higher perceptions of EU would increase adoption propensity.
3.2.3 Social influence . SI is the degree to which important others believe a technology
should be adopted. The root constructs upon which this is based are: subjective norms, e.g.,adoption would be based on the views of important others (Ajzen, 1991); social factors,
e.g., popularity or number of people who also use it (Thompson et al., 1991); and image, e.g.,
prestige and social symbol associated with its adoption (Moore and Benbasat, 1995). India isa society with a high level of restraint (i.e. low on indulgence) due to social norms (Hofstede,
2017), suggesting the critical role of positive SI in promoting mobile payment adoption.
3.2.4 Facilitating conditions . FC refers to the degree to which the user believes that the
company provides assistance, such as technical infrastructure, to support the use of the
service. The root constructs upon which this is based are: perceived behavioral control, e.g.,having the knowledge and resources to use the system; and the extent and type of support
provided for adopting the technology which includes the availability of guidance and
specialized instructions (Thompson et al. , 1991). Although Indians were not novices with
regard to mobile phones, using it for making digital payments is a new concept, due to
which they may rely on the provider for assistance.
Based on all of the above, this paper proposes the following:
H2. AR positively mediates the relationship between TR and IA mobile payments
in India.
3.3 Privacy concerns
Privacy is the right of self-determination for when, how and to what extent information
about oneself may be communicated to other. It relates to physical, decision-related and
informational aspects (Westin, 1967). Specifically, consumers ’PCs have been defined as the
consumers ’concerns over their ability to control the acquisition and use of their personal
information (Goodwin, 1991). Digitization and the consequent growth of e-commerce,
m-commerce and now digital payments have raised concerns about individuals ’rights over
their personal information including their financial information. For mobile phone-related
activities such as m-commerce and mobile payments, global positioning services not only
compromises information about the person ’s physical location but also their financial and
transaction-specific information which can potentially fall in the hands of unauthorized
users such as hackers (Zhang et al. , 2012). Prior research has found that PCs reduce
perceptions of trust amongst internet users (Malhotra, 2004) and low trust is associated with
higher PCs. In Malaysia, online banking adoption depends on several factors including
security and privacy (Amin, 2009). However, cultural differences may result in differing
perceptions about privacy in other countries.
In India, routine disclosures of personal information, such as date of birth, income,
marital status etc., with new acquaintances, are fairly common (Gupta et al. , 2010).IJBM
Downloaded by INSEAD At 04:16 05 September 2018 (PT)
Indeed, cyber law experts have cautioned that Indian consumers are complacent and have
low awareness of online security risks (Lakshmi, 2017). One way to understand how cultural
differences may shape PCs is by using Hofstede ’s cultural dimensions framework (Hofstede,
2017). One of the dimensions on which Indians have a high score is long-term orientation
which suggests that the belief in future rewards leads to greater comfort with the risk,
uncertainty and vulnerability, suggesting lower PCs. This trait was found to enhance new
technology adoption in China as well (Yoon, 2009). Hofstede ’s individualism/collectivism
dimension, on which India has an interm ediate score, measures the degree of
interdependence a society maintains with its members. India ’s collectivistic side suggests
that people would prefer to belong to large social framework and act in accordance to the
greater good, including being more willing to invest in maintaining a relationship with a
company as part of an extended society. Gupta et al. (2010) found partial support for low
PCs in India and attributed it to its collectivistic culture.
However, we can use Hofstede ’s (2017) dimensions to also reach the opposite conclusion.
For example, India ’s individualistic side stems largely from the Hindu philosophy of being
accountable for ones ’deeds in one ’s next birth. Consumers from developed countries that
are known to be high on individualism have been manifested high PCs (cf. Milberg et al.,
2000). Further, high power distance (PD) is the extent to which inequality in power is
considered acceptable. A 38-country comparison of online consumers, based on this
framework, found that countries with high PD scores (including India) have a high tolerance
for unequal power distribution along with high mistrust for more powerful groups, resulting
in high PCs (Bellman et al., 2004). This is in line with other global research on PCs as well as
one research in India that found that high PCs inhibited m-commerce (Thakur and
Srivastava, 2013). Further, the recent creation of Aadhaar database and related discussions
on privacy issues may have also be making PCs salient in India.
This study was not aimed at examining the cultural reasons for PCs in India; however,
by using Hofstede ’s lens one can surmise that Indians may vary in their perceptions of
privacy and therefore, for this paper, the level of PCs is measured and its moderating rather
than direct effects on technology adoption are examined. This paper posits that culturally
Indians may range on a continuum of high and low PCs, and that higher levels of PCs would
dampen the positive impact of high TR and AR on IA. Conversely, if PCs are low, then ahigh TR and AR would be likely to increase IA:
H3. PCs will negatively moderate the strength of the relationship between AR and the IA
mobile payments. Specifically, higher PCs would weaken the positive impact of AR
on the IA mobile payments.
3.4 Intention to adopt
Mobile payment systems have not yet succeeded in retaining customers in India. Since
the number of active users is very low, this study aims to elicit IA mobile payments as the
dependent variable in the model.
4. Research method
4.1 Data collection and sample characteristics
In India, the adoption of new technologies and trends first occur in metropolitan cities which
also have large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid. Then it trickles down to Tier
2 or 3 cities and eventually reaches rural India (Sen, 2014). Moreover, India has large
within-country diversity such as 22 official languages. Hence, a four-city paper and pencil
survey was conducted in the three most widely spoken languages (English, Hindi and
Tamil) in two Tier 1 cities (Delhi and Chennai from north and south India, respectively) and
two Tier 2 cities (Ahmedabad and Lucknow from west and north India, respectively). A totalMobile

usable sample of 600 adult consumers of diverse socio-economic background was obtained,
as described below. The responses were translated. Earlier, the structured questionnaire
was tested in a pilot study.
The sample comprised 85 percent male and 15 percent female; 45.3 percent were between
26 and 35 years and 35.5 percent between 18 and 25 years; 36 percent had undergraduate
education and 6 percent had graduate degrees; and 15 percent had annual incomes of below
Rs100,000 (about US$1,500) per annum, 72.5 percent between Rs100,000 and Rs500,000
(about US$1,500 –US$7,500) and 10.5 percent between Rs500,000 and Rs1,000,000 (about US
$7,500 –US$15,000). Just 5.6 percent of the respondents were completely unaware of mobile
payments. Their awareness was due to the service provider (26.1 percent) and SIs
(41.4 percent) (i.e. friends 33.6 percent and family 7.8 percent). Opportunity for increase in
the use of mobile payments seemed high since respondents indicated a latent need –about
77 percent of them transferred money to others using methods such as cash via
friends, relatives or informal couriers (90 percent), bank transfers (68.8 percent), checks
(35.5 percent) and mobiles (24.9 percent). Respondents ’preferences for payment methods
(somewhat preferred, preferred and highly preferred) ranked as follows: cash (91.7 percent),
followed by checks (74.3 percent), debit cards (68.5 percent), bank transfers (67.8 percent),
credit cards (31.6 percent) and mobiles (33 percent). Thus, notably, despite 94.4 percent of
the sample being aware of mobile payments, and 33 percent expressing some preference for
using it, only 19 percent had actually ever done so.
4.2 Questionnaire
The research model includes four factors, each measured with multiple items, taken from the
existing literature to ensure content validity. For AR, an 11-item composite of PE, EU, SI andFC was created (Venkatesh et al. , 2003; Thakur and Srivastava, 2014). Three items were
taken from Parasuraman and Colby ’s (2001) TRI, since a study of American and Chinese
consumers concluded that their scale is a valid measurement instrument in a cross-cultural
context as well (Meng et al., 2009). Three items were taken from the privacy scale developed
by Malhotra (2004). Finally, IA was measured with two items. The final questionnaire had
19 items for the four key constructs measured on a seven-point Likert scale (see Table I).
Additional questions on demographics, awareness, as well as payment needs and methods
used were also included.
5. Data analysis and results
5.1 Measurement model
Following Anderson and Gerbing ’s (1988) two-step procedure, a confirmatory factor
analysis was first run to analyze the measurement properties of the various scales with the
results of the analysis shown in Table I. The model, including the moderating variable, fit
the data well as witnessed by the respective fit statistics ( χ2¼442.5, df ¼110 CFI ¼0.95;
TLI⩾93; RMSEA ¼0.07). The procedure recommended by Fornell and Larcker (1981) was
used to test for validity (convergent and discriminant), as well as reliability. The constructreliabilities were all above 0.70, average variances extracted (AVE) exceeded the 0.50
threshold recommended by Fornell and Larcker (1981) and all item loadings were significant
(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). This demonstrates convergent validity. Finally, the AVEs
also exceeded the shared variances between each construct pairing, indicating that
discriminant validity was achieved for each of the constructs (Table II).

moderating effect on the relationship between AR and IA, H3was supported. These
relationships are described below.
5.2.1 Mediation results . To test the hypothesis that AR mediates the relationship
between TR and IA, a mediation model was calculated with bootstrapping approach in
AMOS as prescribed by Preacher et al. (2007) using 5,000 bootstrapping samples. The
results show that there was a significant total indirect effect of AR ( t(597)¼17.01,
po0.001). The direction of the effect supports H2in that higher AR is necessary in order for
high TR subjects to demonstrate high IA mobile payments in India. In order to determine
that the mediation effect is significant, the 95 percent confidence intervals must not includezero. For AR mediation was found to be significantly greater than zero.
5.2.2 Moderation results . To show that PCs do, in fact, moderate the relationship
between AR and IA, moderation analysis was conducting using Process Analysis formediation and moderation (Preacher et al. , 2007). To support the simple moderation
hypothesis, the interactions should be significant. After conducting the analysis, the
bootstrapping tests showed a significant interaction between AR and PCs on IA mobilepayments. As expected, when PCs are lower, IA increased with AR ( B¼0.29, t¼3.44,
po0.001). However, when PCs are higher, the indirect effect was not significant ( B¼0.10,
t¼1.84, ns). These results support H3.
6. Discussion and conclusion
This research demonstrated that in countries such as India where new technologies are
being rapidly introduced, overall beliefs about technology influences the perceptions of
specific technologies, in this case, mobile payments. This study also demonstrated the
pivotal role of privacy as a moderator where high PCs reduces the positive impact of
peoples ’positive attitude toward mobile payment adoption.
Although from a cultural perspective India ’s collectivism and long-term orientation reflects
in their routine disclosure of private information, in the case of mobile payment adoption PCs
appear to be influenced more by individualism as well as high PD. Indeed, high PD which
results in the mistrust of companies is likely aggravated by the lack of clearly defined digital
payment laws and practices in India which leaves consumers susceptible to fraud with little or
even no recourse or protection (Lakshmi, 2017). All of this helps explain the prevalence of high
PCs in India, which then hampers mobile payment adoption. Thus, researchers investigating
technology adoption in a global context would benefit from our conceptual framework and
findings which contribute to the growing body of knowledge in this area.
This research has managerial significance as well. The future of mobile money in India is
unclear despite the post-demonetization exponential increase in sign-ups. Low barriers to
entry and a clutter of new entrants have resulted in fragmenting a still nascent market.
As companies search for a sustainable business model, strategic thought must move from

acquisition to retention. While recent mobile payment sign-ups reflect the shortage of cash
and the government ’s push for digital money, its continued usage requires a better
understanding of the adoption process that providers can increase consumers ’comfort with
using mobile payments and address their PCs. Adopting and communicating a long-term,
cross-cultural perspective for technology adoption and actively reducing PCs will help
fintech players build long-term loyalty.
This research also has policy implications. Demonetization was widely regarded as a
game changer and heralded as the “best thing to happen to digital payments ”(Sen, 2017).
Payment providers, who had been unsuccessful in signing on users earlier, launched an
advertising blitz across India and people started signing up in record numbers. Since just
342m people accessed the internet from their mobile phones, the government had set up a
dial-in service for digital payments for those with basic no-frills phones (Lakshmi, 2017).
Despite this government and provider push for the replacement of cash with mobile
payments, most users had low to no balance, which made it easier to switch providers
(Kumari, 2017). These research findings would enable the government and fintech providers
to design their marketing mix in ways that reassure consumers in making the leap from
cash to digital payment platforms.
7. Limitations and future research
India ’s immense diversity added several layers of complexity to the task of obtaining a
representative sample. This study was conducted in four cities of varying sizes and from
different parts of India, but the applicability of this model needs to be examined in rural
areas as well. Due to the challenge of a four-city, multi-language, pen and paper survey in
India, where it is culturally more appropriate to approach male rather than female
respondents, the sample is more skewed toward males. However, since India is a patriarchal
society with decision making often resting with males, this sample skew would not be likely
to significantly impact these research findings. About 80 percent of sample was 18 –35 years
old who are likely to be more technology savvy and perhaps less concerned about privacy
than older people, but a strong impact of PCs was still found. Future research could examine
this for an older demographic. Also, based on income, 72 percent of the sample is middle
class, 15 percent upper class and 10.5 percent lower income. This is the largest and likely
the most attractive prime target audience for mobile payment providers, because the upper
class would already have access to other means of payments such as credits cards.
Demographic differences did not explain any of the variance in this study suggesting either
an artifact of the data or the ubiquity of mobile phones across all income segments, genderand age groups. Other studies have also failed to find such effects (cf. Singh et al., 2017).
Given the rapid digitization and introduction of technology in a demographically young
country, with little or no privacy laws/regulations, the perceptions of privacy may well be
changing. Future researchers would find it valuable to investigate privacy perceptions in
India from a cultural framework perspective. Qualitative methods may be especially
relevant for a study of this nature that involves a nuanced understanding of culture and
deep-rooted beliefs and values.
With this work, the hope is that it spurs further research into this area of critical importance
not just in India but also in similar emerging economies in order to compare Indian consumers
with those of other countries in terms of adoption of technologies such as mobile payments.
This would also help address the issue of limited information and data availability in the
public domain, on India and other emerging markets, which is a key limitation of this work as
well. Although, in this paper, the focus is on mobile payments, this line of thought could be
applied not just for banking and financial services but also to any other technology-centered
industry in India. This work can also guide studies in other emerging markets where mobile
technology is being used as a mode of delivery of any other services.Mobile
