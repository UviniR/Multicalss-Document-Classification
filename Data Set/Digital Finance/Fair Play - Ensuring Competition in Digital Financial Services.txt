EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
THE ARGUMENT FOR ROBUST AND FAIR COMPETITION IN DIGITAL 
financial services (DFS) markets is persuasive. Competition serves customers by 
promoting innovation and efficiencies that lead to lower prices, greater choice, better 
quality services, and improved products. At a national level, competition can curb excessive 
concentrations of economic power and potentially reduce operational risks from service 
outages. From a financial inclusion perspective, more competition increases the likelihood that 
DFS will reach low-income people currently excluded or poorly served by the financial sector.  
Yet in many emerging economies, DFS markets are limited to one or two major providers, 
reducing innovation and customer choice and potentially facilitating monopolistic or cartelistic 
behavior. Why are DFS markets prone to concentration? Is this a problem? In this paper, CGAP 
applies a simple framework to help answer these questions. In general, the barriers to effective 
competition stem from the following three categories:
• Structural impediments,  which derive from characteristics of the specific product market 
that make it difficult for new entrants to challenge large incumbents. In the case of DFS, 
these impediments include network effects, sunk costs, and economies of scale and scope.
• Strategic impediments,  which arise from the behavior of incumbent or dominant firms. 
Whereas structural barriers are usually beyond the control of market actors, strategic 
impediments result from deliberate behavior intended to deter entry or unfairly disadvantage 
rivals with less market power. Strategic barriers to entry in DFS can include limiting access to 
communication and payments infrastructures, restricting the use of agents through exclusive 
contracts, keeping data in silos, and refusing to interoperate.
• Statutory impediments,  which stem from sectoral regulations that limit entry, favor 
incumbents or advantage a certain type of market actor. In DFS markets, regulations related 
to licensing and distinctions between requirements for banks and nonbanks can constitute 
statutory impediments to competition.
Regulatory options
Regulation can have a substantial impact on competitive dynamics in the DFS marketplace, and 
policy makers can consider several options to promote more competition. To address issues 
arising from these impediments, regulatory levers include:2
FAIR PLAY
• Setting fair rules on market entry, including DFS licensing and capital requirements. 
• Creating a level playing field for all stakeholders on issues such as agent networks, data, 
and customer due diligence. 
• Requiring price transparency and disclosure to allow customers to compare terms and prices.
Regulators should be vigilant against anti-competitive behaviors that create strategic 
impediments, which can relate to access to communication channels and payments 
infrastructure, the use of agents, and interoperability.
Big data and big techs
While competition issues will continue to challenge regulators and providers, market dynamics 
are rapidly evolving, which may render certain problems less relevant and introduce new ones. 
Looking ahead, we identify two significant shifts that will change the competitive dynamics of 
DFS markets and thus require the attention of regulators:
• The entry of big technology companies (big techs),  such as Google, Alibaba, and 
Facebook, into the DFS marketplace introduces complex competition questions resulting 
from both the behavior of the firms themselves and the responses of regulators.
• The accumulation of customer data  by DFS providers and big techs gives rise to 
problems related to: 
• Market power created or strengthened by data.
• Market concentration resulting from economies of scale. 
• Abuse of dominance by players who leverage data gleaned in one market to gain unfair 
advantages in another market.
Policy makers are responding with different approaches in different countries, including 
establishing data-sharing regimes and proposing a digital authority. 
Who should read this paper?
The primary audience is financial sector regulators in emerging markets who are not 
competition experts but who can benefit from a primer on competition issues in DFS. Several 
messages are also relevant for telecommunications regulators. The paper intends to speak to 
the needs of competition authorities as well.  Its aim is to help regulators consider how new 
and existing policies and market behaviors affect competitive dynamics in DFS markets and to 
provide guidance on identifying anti-competitive behavior.3

SECTION 1
WHY DOES COMPETITION 
MAT TER FOR  
FINANCIAL INCLUSION? 
THE ARGUMENT FOR PROMOTING COMPETITION IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL 
services (DFS) markets in emerging economies is persuasive.1 In broad terms, 
competition encourages firms to innovate and seek out efficiencies, lower prices, and 
improve quality. A competitive marketplace generally offers greater choice for customers, 
limits rent-seeking behavior (i.e., gaming the system), and curbs excessive concentrations of 
economic power (Martinez Licetti et al. 2017). 
From the perspective of financial inclusion advocates, these outcomes are especially important 
for low-income people who are excluded from or poorly served by the financial sector (di Castri 
and Plaitakis 2018). Lower prices and greater affordability can make financial services more 
accessible for customers who do not have much money.2
Furthermore, research indicates that greater market power contributes to increased income 
inequality (Ennis, Gonzaga, and Pike 2019; Martinez Licetti et al. 2017). Innovation and efficiency 
encourage the development of new products that could target specific customer segments, 
including customers with low incomes.3
Pressure to improve quality and service standards can similarly help to ensure that products 
offer value and customers are treated well (see Box 1). A greater number of DFS market actors 
can also reduce operational risks associated with excessive concentration, potentially limiting 
the economic impact of a service outage.
1 Although the term “DFS” covers a broad range of services, in this paper, we focus on the issuance and 
transfer of e-money because it is the fundamental building block for all DFS. Financial products such as credit 
and insurance that are delivered digitally are touched on throughout but are not the focus of this paper.
2 Two-thirds of people without an account at a financial institution cite not having enough money as a reason. 
One quarter of them say that accounts are too expensive (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).
3 See Federico et al. (2019): “Competition policy seeks to protect and promote a vigorous competitive process 
by which new ideas are transformed into realized consumer benefits. In this fundamental way, competition 
spurs innovation.”4
FAIR PLAY
Unfortunately, many DFS markets in 
emerging economies seem to lack 
competition. Two of the most well-known 
and often-cited examples of this 
are M-PESA in Kenya and bKash in 
Bangladesh, which have commanded 
upwards of 80 percent of market share in 
their respective markets.4
While M-PESA and bKash’s dominance 
arguably played a role in the rapid growth 
of mobile money in both countries, 
their continued dominance may lead to 
high costs and weak innovation. With 
the caveat that market share serves 
as a crude indicator of competitive 
dynamics, the extreme cases of Kenya 
and Bangladesh join many other DFS 
markets, such as Uganda and Zimbabwe, 
that are dominated by one or two 
providers. Beyond limiting customers’ 
choices, higher levels of concentration 
can facilitate abuse—when a dominant 
firm disadvantages its rivals or harms 
consumers—or cartelistic behavior (see 
Appendix, Glossary).
Why are DFS markets prone to concentration?  
Is this a problem? 
A simple framework can help answer these questions.5 This framework classifies factors that 
impede fair competition into one of three categories: structural, strategic, or statutory.
Structural impediments—also known as “innocent barriers to entry”—stem from the 
characteristics of the specific product market that make it difficult for new entrants 
to challenge incumbents.  DFS markets have several characteristics, such as network 
effects, high sunk costs, and economies of scale and scope, that can impede new market 
entrants (see Appendix, Glossary). These factors make DFS markets prone to concentration 
and can even lead them to “tip” to a winner-takes-all scenario. If these structural factors were 
4 Information on Kenya market shares comes from the Sector Statistics Report of the Communications 
Authority of Kenya. Bangladesh statistics are from Roest (2018).
5 These categories normally refer specifically to barriers to entry. Here, however, they are used more broadly to 
categorize a range of factors that can limit effective competition from taking place.BOX 1.  Competition and consumer protection
While competition can improve consumer welfare, 
it is not a substitute for strong sectoral regulation, 
especially not for a robust consumer protection 
regime. Similarly, “more” competition will not 
solve problems created by the lack of appropriate 
regulation and could, in some cases, make those 
problems worse. Stucke (2013) and Gabaix and 
Laibson (2006) describe how firms can compete 
to exploit consumers’ biases and lack of willpower 
rather than to provide high-quality products. In 
the credit card market, for example, “consumers 
choose credit cards with lower annual fees (but 
higher financing fees and penalties) over better-
suited products […, and] rational companies 
can exploit consumers’ biases” (Stucke 2013, p. 
175). Thus, competition and consumer protection 
can mutually reinforce each other but are not 
substitutes. A paper cited in Stucke (2013, p. 184) 
explores the relationship between competition 
and financial stability and whether excessive 
competition encourages increased leverage and 
risk-taking among banks. These questions, while 
critical for financial sector regulators, lie beyond the 
scope of this paper.5
WhY DoES  CoM pETITIon M ATTER  FoR FInAnCIA l InC lUSIon?   the only reason for the high levels of concentration in DFS markets—and we saw no evidence 
that dominant firms were exploiting their circumstances to the disadvantage of consumers or 
competitors—then there may be no cause for concern.6
Strategic impediments to competition arise from the behavior of incumbent or 
dominant firms.  Whereas structural barriers are usually beyond the control of market actors, 
strategic impediments result from deliberate behavior intended to deter entry or unfairly 
disadvantage rivals with less market power. Strategic barriers to entry in DFS can include 
limiting access to communication and payments infrastructures, restricting the use of agents 
through exclusive contracts, keeping data in silos, and refusing to interoperate. These examples 
are discussed in greater detail in Section 4.
Statutory impediments to competition stem from sectoral regulation that limits 
entry, favors incumbents, or advantages a certain type of market actor.  Licensing 
requirements, for example, constitute a statutory barrier to entry that can limit competition. 
Intellectual property rights, such as patents, also limit competition by conferring a temporary 
monopoly status to the patent holder. Governments decide to enact such limitations in the 
interest of other public policy objectives. Licensing requirements help ensure stability and 
integrity; patents encourage investment in new knowledge. Ideally, regulators are aware of these 
trade-offs and have attempted to ensure an appropriate balance. However, this is not always the 
case. In DFS markets, regulation related to licensing and distinctions between requirements for 
banks and nonbanks can constitute statutory impediments to competition. For more on these 
examples and ways that regulation can foster greater competition, see Section 2.
The three categories are not always mutually exclusive. Statutory barriers, for example, 
could also be classified as strategic barriers if incumbent firms played a role in creating or 
strengthening legal requirements to weaken competitive pressure.7 Firms can also strategically 
augment structural barriers such as sunk costs by, for example, investing in vertical integration 
(i.e., acquiring a supplier or distributor) and making it impossible for rivals to compete unless 
they make a similar vertical acquisition (OECD 2007).
Regulators in DFS markets that lack sufficient competition face considerable challenges in 
determining whether their current market structure stems from structural impediments only 
or whether strategic and statutory barriers are further restricting competition. Because DFS 
markets embody structural factors that favor large or incumbent firms, it is even more 
important that regulators are attuned to competitive dynamics, which can come from 
regulatory frameworks and the behavior of market actors, to ensure that competition 
“on the merits” can occur.
6 Markets with extreme structural barriers to entry are sometimes known as “natural monopolies” because it 
would be economically inefficient for more than one firm to exist. Examples include energy production, water 
systems, and other utilities. Rather than attempting to foster competition within these markets, regulators 
will encourage firms to compete “for” the market (through large government contracts), implement strict 
regulation (sometimes including price caps and service-level agreements), or do some combination of both. 
Although DFS markets share some characteristics with natural monopolies, these qualities do not rise to such 
a level that would compel regulators to treat DFS as such. 
7 These could be achieved through more nefarious means, such as bribery or patronage, but those are beyond 
the scope of this paper.6
FAIR PLAY
Two other complications add to the challenges facing DFS regulators in many emerging 
markets. One is the limited market development in many of these countries. Regulators 
may hesitate to intervene for fear of stunting the growth of an inchoate market. Another is 
that regulators may not be able to respond appropriately to potential problems for several 
reasons, including capacity issues or lack of an explicit competition mandate. Although over 
100 countries have a competition law (OECD 2014), this is by no means universal in emerging 
markets, nor does it ensure effective or consistent enforcement.
In countries without a competition law or dedicated competition authority, there may 
be a partial competition mandate for sectoral regulators. In the case of DFS, relevant 
sector regulators include the central bank, other financial sector regulators, and the 
telecommunications authority. Even though sectoral regulators may be able to intervene, the 
lack of a centralized competition authority can hinder a country’s ability to develop expertise, 
complicate coordination among regulators, and lessen the priority of competition issues on the 
agenda of a regulatory authority that is balancing several different objectives. While providing 
guidance on developing a comprehensive competition policy and creating a competition 
authority is beyond the scope of this paper, it is important to acknowledge the importance of 
these institutional elements in ensuring effective competition. 7

HOW REGULATION 
FOSTERS—OR INHIBITS—
COMPETITION IN DFS
MOST COMPETITION CONCERNS ABOUT DIGITAL PAYMENTS CENTER 
on claims of abuse of dominance and are ex post —that is, they focus on how to 
address issues after the fact. They often call for competition authorities or sectoral 
regulators to implement remedies in response to anticompetitive behavior. However, regulation 
can help to strengthen competition ex ante  (in advance) and thus lower the risk of abuse in the 
first place. 
Well-designed sectoral regulation can lower barriers to entry and promote 
competition.  For example, although PSD2 (the revised Payment Services Directive)8 is not 
part of the European Union competition legal framework, it nevertheless creates a competitive 
environment across financial markets by allowing for more data sharing, breaking down data 
silos of incumbents, and creating new types of licensed entities.
On the other hand, sectoral regulation and its enforcement can also constrain competition 
through, for example, overly restrictive licensing requirements that impede new entrants. This is 
particularly problematic in cases with high levels of regulatory capture by incumbents who may 
lobby government to build or maintain legal barriers to entry.9 
8 PSD2 aims to better integrate the market for electronic payments in the European Union, open the payments 
market to new services and providers, and protect consumer rights. It introduces two new types of third-
party provider (TPP) licenses: Payment Initiation Service Providers, which can initiate payments on behalf of 
a customer, and Account Information Service Providers, which can aggregate customer payments account 
information and present this information back to a customer. By allowing these TPPs access to data held by 
banks under specific circumstances, PSD2 aims to equilibrate the current asymmetry of customer data in 
favor of banks, thus enhancing competition in the E.U. payments market. For more information, see https://
eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366 . 
9 Regulatory capture refers to “…regulated institutions exercis[ing] excessive influence on the regulator. A 
captured regulator acts primarily in the interests of the regulatees, rather than in accordance with their 
putative mandate to promote the common good” (Hardy 2006).8
FAIR PLAY
There are three key policy areas that can strengthen or weaken the potential for 
effective competition in DFS markets: market entry, level playing field, and price 
transparency and disclosure.
Market entry
To maximize consumer welfare, consumers need access to a wide range of 
affordable products that meet their needs.  In general, businesses operating in competitive 
markets strive to differentiate their products from those of their rivals, which results in more 
choices for consumers. Therefore, it is important that several different types of actors can “play” 
in DFS markets. Regulators determine who is allowed to play. 
One example that has important competition implications is the e-money licensing regime. A 
licensing regime that does not allow a specific type of actor to be licensed (and this foreclosure 
is not objectively justified by the actor’s risk profile or other characteristics) or imposes 
unnecessary barriers to entry can create an unlevel playing field and thereby undermine 
competition. Furthermore, regulatory capture by the banking sector can exacerbate unequal 
treatment of different types of providers. 
Often, the disadvantaged provider type in DFS markets is the mobile network operator (MNO). 
Regulations restrict the eligibility of MNOs and other nonbank entities in 23 of the 81 countries 
scored in GSMA’s Mobile Money Regulatory Index (Bahia and Muthiora 2019). Historically, 
regulation in Nigeria restricted mobile money operator (MMO) licenses to banks or nonbank 
players and excluded MNOs.10 In late 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued operational 
guidelines that reflect expansive changes to its licensing regime, paving the way for MNOs to 
directly apply, through a subsidiary, for a new class of license—a payments services bank.11 In 
Bangladesh, mobile financial services providers must be a commercial bank or a subsidiary 
of one. New licensees from 2018 onward need to operate as a subsidiary of a regulated 
commercial bank.12 The subsidiary can take equity partners from other banks, nongovernment 
organizations, or fintech companies, but the guidelines explicitly exclude MNOs.
Capital requirements that are disproportionate to the risks posed can also act as 
a barrier to entry and help incumbents maintain their market power.  In general, the 
restricted range of activities that e-money issuers (EMIs) are authorized to carry out makes them 
less risky than banks, which should result in lower initial and ongoing capital requirements. At 
the same time, regulators may wish to screen out applicants who are unlikely to survive before 
breaking even.13 Thus, regulation should strike a balance and set capital requirements that 
account for market context and the risks posed by the permitted activities (GSMA 2019).

hoW REgUlATIon Fo STERS —oR  Inh IbITS—CoM pETITIon I n DFSLevel playing field
Agent regulations and customer due diligence (CDD) requirements sometimes differ 
for banks and EMIs.  While these distinctions might be justified because they align more 
closely to a country’s licensing framework, agent and CDD regulations tied to activities reflect a 
risk-based approach and better support fair competition between different types of institutions 
(Staschen and Meagher 2018). This is not always the case in emerging markets.
Until the passage of the National Payment System Regulations in 2014,14 Kenya prohibited 
exclusive contracts between banks and their agents, but this did not apply to MNOs.15 In 
Uganda, mobile money services providers could contract with agents several years before 
banks were allowed to do so.16 In Indonesia and Malaysia, bank agents can open accounts 
for new customers, while agents of nonbank EMIs cannot (Aviles et al. 2019). This disparate 
treatment can limit consumers’ access to a range of financial services. 
Ideally, CDD requirements should primarily reflect the risks of the product and 
customer, not the type of entity offering the product.  In some countries, however, tiered 
know-your-customer (KYC) requirements are available only to a subset of providers (Meagher 
2019).17 In Ghana, only EMIs can offer tiered KYC,18 while in Pakistan, it seems the option is 
currently available only for branchless banking accounts (i.e., basic bank accounts serviced by 
agents) as tiered KYC does not appear in the recently issued EMI regulation and regular bank 
accounts must adhere to separate risk-based principles.19 The requirements for complaint 
resolution mechanisms should also be equivalent across comparable services, regardless of 
provider (Aviles et al. 2019).

FAIR PLAY
Price transparency and disclosure
Basic pricing and contract disclosure regulations, though more often associated 
with consumer protection, are in fact critical for competition.  Without accurate 
information, customers cannot compare services, which can lessen competition. In 2016, 
the Competition Authority of Kenya required DFS providers to explicitly disclose costs for a 
range of services (Mazer 2018). Not only did this rule help customers avoid being unwittingly 
charged, it also helped them to compare costs across providers. Regulation on disclosure can 
also contribute to the previously mentioned level playing field issues, as evidenced by several 
countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations where they generally apply only to 
banks and not to e-money providers (Aviles et al. 2019).11

HOW MARKET ACTORS 
CAN UNDERMINE FAIR 
COMPETITION—AND WHAT 
REGULATORS CAN DO
EVEN IF APPROPRIATE EX ANTE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, 
competition issues may inevitably arise due to the inherent characteristics of the market 
or the behavior of market actors, especially as DFS markets mature. It is important to note 
that anticompetitive behavior can coexist with falling prices or increased innovation, and these 
phenomena do not mean that there are no competition issues. Prices may fall in a market, for 
example, but the pertinent counterfactual question is how much they would have fallen in the 
absence of anticompetitive behavior. This section addresses a few common problems but does 
not provide a comprehensive list of potential anticompetitive behavior.
Access to communication channel
Although smartphone adoption is increasing, unstructured supplementary service 
data (USSD) and SIM Toolkit (STK) applications are still an essential channel for 
DFS in emerging markets, particularly for low-income customers  (ITU-T 2017). Thus, 
questions surrounding fair and reasonable access to the channel are key. A common problem 
occurs when a dominant MNO (or duopoly) restricts access to its USSD channel or STK 
gateway.20 This can happen through, for example, a combination of excessive pricing and other 
exclusionary behavior, such as strategically deteriorating service quality or foreclosing access—
which occurred in Uganda (Amamukirori 2015), Colombia (Marulanda 2015), and Zimbabwe 
(Maposa 2013). 
20 For more detail on issues with USSD, see CGAP (2014) and Hanouch and Chen (2015).12
FAIR PLAY
MNOs may strategically restrict access to their USSD channel to gain market 
share in the telecommunications or DFS markets.  This is an example of abusing the 
ownership of a potential “essential facility” (see Appendix, Glossary). Regulators have a wide 
range of approaches available to them, from communicating with other sectoral regulators 
and other stakeholders on access (e.g., Bangladesh [Plaitakis, Church, and Wills 2016]) or 
negotiating bilateral access pricing (e.g., Kenya [Mumo 2017]) to requiring fair, reasonable, and 
nondiscriminatory pricing (e.g., Peru and Colombia [CGAP 2014]) or defining a price or price 
range at which MNOs must offer access to the communication channel (e.g., India).21
Quality is another important factor that can affect the viability of third-party use of 
the USSD channel.  When MNOs offer their own mobile money services and simultaneously 
provide third parties with access to their USSD channel, they can weaken the quality of a 
competitor’s mobile money product by degrading the quality of the USSD channel. In some 
countries, including Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda, MMOs have complained about 
dropped USSD sessions and other quality-of-service problems (CGAP 2014). In certain cases, 
regulators have responded by creating “quality of service” provision requirements. For example, 
the telecommunications regulator in Colombia can accept and review complaints regarding 
price and quality on a case-by-case basis, and in 2016, it proposed—but never finalized—
regulation requiring that 99 percent of USSD sessions be successfully completed.22 CBN’s 
regulatory framework for using USSD in the financial system requires financial institutions and 
MNOs to enter into service level agreements benchmarked against regulation from the Nigeria 
Communications Commission.23 
Payments settlement infrastructure
Another barrier to competition can emerge if banks or regulators unfairly exclude 
access—or use discriminatory pricing to impede access—of nonbanks to payments 
settlement infrastructures,  some of which may be owned or controlled by the central 
bank or a consortium of banks.24 If incumbent banks with control over infrastructure perceive 
nontraditional providers as a threat, they may use this power to create barriers to entry that 
could amount to market foreclosure. It is generally infeasible and inefficient for excluded parties 
to create alternative settlement infrastructures. Economies of scale dictate that the number of 
settlement infrastructures in a market will remain limited.

where they play a more significant role in financial inclusion. In India, for example, nonbank 
wallet providers cannot access the Universal Payments Interface (UPI) directly and instead 
must partner with a bank—although prepaid issuers may gain direct access in the future (Cook 
and Raman 2019). Nonbank providers do not necessarily need direct  access to the payments 
infrastructure to compete on a level playing field. Providers can also access indirectly —that is, the 
provider does not participate in the system but gains access through another actor who does. 
If the requirements to gain direct access are too burdensome or costly, indirect access may be 
preferred, provided that indirect access is offered on fair terms (Garcia 2016; Aviles et al. 2019).
Without direct or indirect access to key payments infrastructure, nonbank 
providers are disadvantaged.  As CPSS-IOSCO (2012) notes, however, infrastructures 
“should have objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which 
permit fair and open access .” Thus, infrastructure operators must balance openness with 
risks to the system and its participants.
In a bid to spur greater competition, the Bank of England (BoE) announced in 2017 that nonbank 
payments firms that demonstrate compliance with BoE’s risk mitigation requirements would be 
allowed direct access to its real-time gross settlement payments system (Jones 2017). More 
recently, BoE shared plans to offer fintechs access to overnight deposit accounts (Giles 2019).
In 2018, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) created a separate clearinghouse for nonbank 
payments providers—in part to create a more level playing field. Beginning in 2019, PBC has 
also given nonbank payments providers access to its reserve accounts. These providers are 
required to store 100 percent of customer balances at PBC. 
Restrictions on agents
Agent restrictions may stifle competition. Often known as “vertical restraints,” the restrictions 
require independent agents to accept certain restrictive terms in their agency contracts with 
EMIs. The restrictions can include agent exclusivity as well as restrictions on the agent’s 
geographical placement and its use of branding and communications material. Vertical 
restrictions can create barriers to entry for new agents. Whether such restrictions are legally 
considered to be anticompetitive depends on the domestic jurisprudence on vertical restraints. 
Some jurisdictions, such as the United States, may see vertical restraints as generally 
procompetitive because they limit free-riding and encourage firms to invest (Pitofsky 1997). 
Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union, consider vertical restraints to have negative 
effects if (i) they are imposed by entities with some degree of market power and (ii) the 
agreement contributes to the creation, maintenance, or strengthening of that market power 
(Plaitakis 2019a).14
FAIR PLAY
In the early stages of DFS market development in emerging markets, agent exclusivity 
agreements were common and sometimes supported by regulators (e.g., India).25 But over time, 
some countries, such as Kenya, banned exclusivity arrangements, and others, such as Ghana, 
Tanzania, and Uganda, mandated agent nonexclusivity.26 The appropriate regulatory approach 
depends on the stage of DFS market development in a particular country. The rollout of a 
proprietary agent network can be important for the initial launch and expansion of 
DFS, but exclusivity arrangements may prevent new players from entering the market 
and consolidate existing market shares when the market has matured.
Interoperability
Despite debates on timing and mechanisms, regulators and providers agree that 
digital payments interoperability spurs competition and generates greater value for 
users.  The primacy of interoperability holds true for any networked product—for example, 
imagine if emails could only be sent within individual domains. However, a firm that holds 
significant market power has little incentive to develop interoperable arrangements. Thus, the 
question facing regulators is: What is the best way to achieve interoperability while promoting 
effective competition and not distorting incentives for investment?
This paper addresses interoperability at the platform level—that is, the ability of users to transfer 
money both on-net and off-net, without significant price differences between the two.27 In 
general, it is difficult for a regulator to know when and how to intervene and require providers 
to interoperate. Additional complications can arise when firms develop bilateral agreements 
or use third-party solutions in the absence of full interoperability (Arabehety et al. 2016). 
Conventional wisdom suggests that regulators should err on the side of caution and refrain 
from intervening too early. This approach allows maximum opportunity for market actors to 
arrive at a commercially attractive and sustainable arrangement. Regulators may perceive 
the risk of “getting it wrong” as too high; intervening too early can stall market development 
and innovation. Ghana, for example, required interoperability in its initial 2008 branchless 
banking regulation but rescinded the requirement in its 2015 revision, citing slow growth 
and “unintended consequences” (GSMA 2015). Nonetheless, regulators may want to require 
interoperability at later stages of market growth, which is why Bourreau and Valletti (2015) argue 
that ex ante  regulation should aim to guarantee that interoperability is technically feasible at a

accounts from multiple providers on a single SIM. For more information, see Kumar and Tarazi (2012).15

player refuses to interoperate, regulators face limited options and may need to 
resort to more interventionist approaches.

the domestic and/or regional competition regulator(s) to ensure that the scheme does not violate anticartel or 
anticollusion regulation.

LOOKING AHEAD:   
HOW BIG TECH AND BIG 
DATA AFFECT COMPETITION 
WHILE THE COMPETITION ISSUES DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WILL 
continue to challenge regulators and providers, market dynamics are rapidly evolving. 
These developments may render some problems less relevant while introducing new 
ones. In particular, the increasing use of customer data and the entry of global big tech players 
will affect competition in DFS markets.
The role of customer data
Certain competition issues arise with the accumulation of data, including (i) market power 
created or bolstered by the network effects of digital data, (ii) market concentration resulting 
from the economies of scale of digital data and the multisided nature of many platforms that 
focus on data collection,30 and (iii) abuse by d ominant players who leverage data they possess 
in one market to gain an unfair advantage in another market (Plaitakis 2019b). In the context 
of DFS, the last issue is the most prevalent. Specifically, dominant players in one market 
segment, such as mobile telecommunications or mobile money, may leverage the 
customer data they possess in that segment to gain an advantage in another market.  
An example of this is Safaricom leveraging mobile telecommunications and mobile money data 
to gain an advantage in the digital nanocredit market in Kenya (Plaitakis 2019b). Alternately, 
such players may refuse to provide access to their proprietary platforms and their data to 
third-party services providers. In an example from a high-income country context, several 
30 In a multisided market, “a firm acts as a platform and sells different products to different groups of 
consumers, while recognising that the demand from one group of customers depends on the demand from 
the other group(s). Crucially, if this cross-platform network externality is present, this implies that the structure 
of prices that the platform sets will determine volume, not just the level at which it sets the price across the 
different sides of the market” (OECD 2018, p. 10).17
look Ing Ah EAD : ho W bIg T ECh AnD bIg D ATA AFFECT  CoM pETITIon   large financial institutions in the United States briefly prevented third-party aggregators from 
accessing their customers’ data in 2015, citing security concerns (Huang and Rudegeair 2015). 
The banks quickly reversed course, however, in response to customer complaints (Castro and 
Steinberg 2017). 
Lastly, lenders may not provide complete data sets to credit bureaus—for example, they may 
report only negative credit information—or they may selectively provide only certain data to 
preferred parties. If these are dominant lenders, particular issues of data access in credit 
scoring may arise as they did in a market inquiry into the competitive implications of negative 
reporting in Kenya (Competition Authority of Kenya 2016).
The entry of big tech players
The entry of large nonfinancial-sector multinational technology companies—big 
techs—into DFS markets (and digital finance more broadly) can introduce complex 
competition questions stemming from both the entry itself and the regulatory 
responses.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) dedicated a significant portion of 
its 2019 Annual Economic Report to the opportunities and risks stemming from the entry of 
big techs in finance. Its analysis emphasizes the potential of big tech’s ability to leverage its 
low-cost structure to extend the provision of basic financial services to excluded populations. 
At the same time, BIS warns of the risks to consumer protection, data privacy, and competition, 
urging regulators to collaborate across borders, ensure a level playing field between types of 
entities, and use competition, privacy, and financial regulation to harness the benefits offered by 
big techs while minimizing the risks. 
Over the past several years there have been an increasing number of examples of technology 
companies offering payments services in emerging markets. Facebook, for example, partnered 
with PayMaya and GCash in the Philippines to offer mobile money payments through its 
messaging platform in 2017 (Desiderio 2017). The following year, Facebook launched a pilot 
payments service in India through its WhatsApp subsidiary, reportedly reaching a million 
monthly transactions in less than a year and threatening the dominance of PayTM, the Indian-
based platform that has received significant investment from China’s Alibaba (Murgia 2019). 
More recently, Facebook announced plans to introduce a global cryptocurrency (The Libra 
Association 2019). In the meantime, Google has also launched a mobile payments service in 
India—initially called Tez, but since rebranded as Google Pay (Sengupta 2017). Amazon, which 
has offered a prepaid wallet to Indian customers since 2016, announced in April 2019 that 
customers could use the service for person-to-person payments through UPI (Mishra 2019). 
The e-commerce giant also offers point-of-sale financing for some medium- to large-ticket 
consumer goods sold through the platform. Beyond the India market, Amazon offers prepaid 
cards in Mexico, and WeChat Pay and Alipay may soon launch in several East African markets 
through a partnership with Kenya’s Equity Bank (Xinhua 2019).
On the one hand, the entry of new players has the seemingly obvious benefit of strengthening 
competition, which would likely lead to lower prices and greater innovation for consumers. 
At the same time, these developments and their implications for competitive dynamics raise 18
FAIR PLAY
difficult questions that may not be apparent if observers examine only short-term price effects. 
Unlike smaller start-ups, the large technology companies often sit on significant amounts of 
capital in the form of cash and customer data. These companies are able to take on sustained 
below-cost pricing strategies and cross-subsidization of business lines and geographic markets 
to capture market share and then, once they control the market, to subsequently increase 
prices and decrease product choices. 
While customers may benefit in the near term, it is possible that the long-term harm 
to the competitive process will outweigh the short-lived benefits.  As Khan (2017) 
writes, the focus on consumer welfare (as measured by price and output) in contemporary 
antitrust blinds regulators to the actual harms of 21st century monopolists, who sustain 
significant losses through below-cost pricing while integrating across business lines.
The zero-cost point-of-sale financing offered by Amazon, for example, is the result of Amazon’s 
partnership with every major Indian bank. The bank charges customers interest, but Amazon 
discounts the product price by the same amount.31 Google offers its payments service in 
India at an essentially negative price since customers can transfer and receive money for free, 
all while earning referral rewards and scratch cards. At its launch, Google advertised that 
customers could earn up to 18,000 INR (around US$250) through referrals and scratch cards—
equal to approximately two months of per capita GDP.32 
Google also worked with manufacturers of Android smartphones to arrange for the payments 
app to come preinstalled (BBC News 2017). Although such arrangements exist for other 
payments apps, including rival PayTM (Shambhavi 2015), the Google Pay-Android tying could 
raise questions given its resemblance to the issue at the heart of a 2018 European Commission 
decision that fined Google $5 billion for violating antitrust laws. The violations stemmed in part 
from bundling Google apps with the operating system and paying phone manufacturers to 
exclusively pre-install Google’s search app on their handsets (EC 2018).
Within India, competition authorities and regulators seem to have taken notice of and prioritized 
responding to these market changes. In 2018, India revised its foreign direct investment 
regulation for e-commerce, with an eye toward taming Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart by 
restricting their ability to sell their own inventory through their platforms. The modifications 
touched on several issues, but a key objective was to ensure that the giants either oversee the 
platforms or sell their products on the platforms, but not both, as that could lead to preferential 
treatment of the platform’s products (Phartiyal 2019). Once the rules went into effect, Amazon 
removed from its marketplace products from its own brands and those in which Amazon has 
an equity stake.
India’s response to big tech extends to the introduction of data localization requirements. In 
April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed all payments systems providers to store 
payments data on transactions involving Indian customers exclusively on servers located in 
31 See “Will My Bank Continue to Charge Me Interest?” Frequently Asked Questions number 7, accessed 3

Amazon, and PayPal expressed frustration with the regulation and unsuccessfully requested 
more time to conform to the new rules (Goel 2018). In June 2019, RBI assured the firms that 
it would reassess the rules (Kalray and Kumar 2019). Critics of data localization requirements 
contend that the rules amount to a trade barrier and put foreign businesses at a disadvantage 
through additional costs, using security concerns as a cover.34 
In February 2019, India shared a proposed policy for the online shopping sector that would 
impose similar data localization requirements on e-commerce platforms (Kalray and Phartiyal 
2019). India is not the only country with restrictive data localization regulation—approximately 
25 countries have imposed similar requirements (Baur-Yazbeck 2018). Such policies, which may 
be intended to level the playing field for domestic firms, could do so at the expense of domestic 
consumers who face limited choices.
Identifying specific remedies for the challenges linked to customer data and the entry of big tech 
is beyond the scope of this paper. However, regulators could take several regulatory approaches 
to balance access to data. These include data-sharing regimes, such as PSD2 in Europe and 
Open Banking in the United Kingdom, and data portability, such as General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). Another data-sharing approach is to allow the consumer to have joint control 
of data, as is proposed in Australia.35 Yet another alternative is to establish a digital authority that 
would regulate the entire digital sector with regard to competition law and noncompetition goals, 
such as those in privacy, media, data use restrictions, and consumer protection (CSDP 2019). 
Such an authority, given its exposure to digital technology, would be able to quickly identify 
technical issues that give rise to competitive harm and to sanction accordingly.
Further, regulators should consider how they can use compliance data to monitor DFS markets 
and anticipate strategic barriers that are created through firm behavior. Financial supervisors, 
competition authorities, and financial regulators can, through RegTech solutions, analyze and 
visualize the data reported to authorities to identify any anticompetitive dynamics, as Mexico’s 
National Commission for the Pension System (Consar) was able to do in regard to a pension 
fund administrator cartel.36

36 Consar launched an initiative in 2013 to fortify the pension system against emerging fraud risks and to 
promote financial inclusion. By replacing paper-based processes with digital documents and identities, 
Consar greatly increased its capacity to monitor compliance, prevent fraud, and detect collusion. This 
allowed it to find that several major pension fund administrators (known as afores ) had conspired to 
prevent participants from switching between funds on several occasions between 2012 and 2014. As a 
consequence, in 2017 the competition authority levied the largest-ever fine (1.1 billion Mexican pesos) on four 
of the largest afores . See di Castri et al. (2018).20
FAIR PLAY
While competitive issues arising with the accumulation of data may not be manifest in emerging 
markets, governments should take a proactive approach. As the competition policy framework 
and institutions are often not yet established—or are still in institution-building mode—in 
emerging markets, there is an opportunity to develop a competition law framework from the 
outset. This framework should have a consumer welfare perspective that goes beyond narrow 
price effects and considers nonprice aspects of products and services, such as quality, choice, 
and data privacy, as part of its analytic approach toward competition. By integrating these 
elements, governments in emerging markets have the opportunity to leapfrog into developing 
relevant competition law and policy that align with their country’s social development goals, 
including financial inclusion.
DFS markets in emerging economies vary significantly in their stages of development. In 
nascent markets, regulators and development partners may be inclined to dismiss competition 
as a problem to address once the market has reached a more advanced level of maturity. 
However, as we show in this paper, competition issues should always be factored into policy 
decisions, even before specific challenges arise in a market. Although regulators in mature 
markets may be better positioned to address instances of abuse of dominance, regulators 
in nascent markets can still assess their existing regulation to ensure that they provide a 
level playing field and encourage effective competition.37 In countries without a dedicated 
competition authority, it may be challenging for financial and telecommunications regulators 
to balance and prioritize competition issues. In these cases, the authorities may consider 
signing Memoranda of Understanding to allocate jurisdiction and identify priorities. Going 
forward, these issues are likely to gain prominence and will need to be addressed to ensure the 
development of a safe, competitive, and inclusive financial sector.
37 Such an assessment could begin with the policy areas described in Section 2 or with a more formal process, 
such as the OECD Competition Assessment Toolkit (see https://www.oecd.org/competition/assessment-
toolkit.htm ).21
glo SSARYAPPENDIX
GLOSSARY
Dominant firm. A dominant firm typically commands a substantial share (40 percent or 
more) of a given market, with a sizeable gap between its market share and that of its closest 
competitor. Dominant firms can act independently of rivals by increasing prices above the 
competitive level, selling low-quality products, reducing supply, or slowing their rate of 
innovation below what would exist in a competitive market. Under competition law, holding a 
dominant position is not in itself illegal since it can come about legitimately by simply offering 
better products at better prices. Competition rules do, however, prohibit companies from 
abusing their dominance, which—depending on the jurisdiction—could include unreasonable 
prices, price discrimination, predatory pricing, price squeezing by integrated firms, refusal to 
deal/sell, tied selling or product bundling, and preemption of facilities.
Economies of scale and scope.  Economies of scale are typically associated with supply-
side dynamics (unlike network effects, which are on the demand side). In a product with 
economies of scale, production costs decrease per unit as volume increases, which confers 
cost advantages to larger firms. Economies of scope refer to situations in which firms enjoy  
cost savings by producing two goods or services, compared to producing them separately. 
The presence of economies of scope can make it difficult for firms to compete in one market 
without developing or acquiring a position in a related market.
Essential facility.  An essential facility refers to a facility or infrastructure that would be 
impossible or impractical to duplicate and that competitors need access to so they can reach 
customers or do business. In general, essential facilities arise in the context of two markets (an 
upstream market and a downstream market), where one firm is present in both markets and 
other firms seek access to the downstream market but are denied through outright refusal, 
excessive pricing, or poor quality of service. In the context of DFS, the concept could apply to 
the market for USSD access (upstream) and the market for mobile money (downstream). 
Network effects.  The term “network effects” refers to the phenomenon by which additional 
users or customers of a product or service increase its value. Network effects, also called 
network externalities or demand-side economies of scale, are characteristic of many digital 
products and services. They are particularly relevant for competition because they can function 
as a barrier to entry for potential competitors who cannot compete against a provider with a 
large, built-in customer base. 22
FAIR PLAY
Sunk costs.  Sunk costs are a key factor in competition policy and antitrust actions. The term 
refers to expenses or investments that cannot be recovered or avoided even if a firm exits a 
market. They are relevant for competition because they can serve as a barrier to entry—the 
costs must be paid by new entrants and have already been paid by incumbents.
