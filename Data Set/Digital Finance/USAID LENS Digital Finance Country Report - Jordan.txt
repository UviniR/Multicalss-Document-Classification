1.1. INTROD UCTION  
Jordanian o rganizations and businesses are  increasingly leveraging Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) as a cost -efficient  delivery channel for financial services. Digital Finance Services 
(DFS) have the potential to expand the delivery of basic financial services (savings, credit, insurance 
and tr ansfers) through innovative technologies and digital payment platforms. This report presents 
the state of Jordan’s Digital Financial Service ecosystem as of February  2019. It gives a full 
appreciation of the market opportunity and challenges, and examines the critical success factors needed to 
catalyze DFS operations in the Kingdom.  
DFS offers an opportunity to connect an estimated 62.5%
2 of unbanked Jordanians  to financial products 
and services. The Kingdom’s supportive regulatory 
environment and its reliable telecommunication 
infrastructure alongside r ecent initiatives undertaken 
by the CBJ such as the introduction of the Digital 
Finance Council, the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox, and the 2017 launch of the National Financial Inclusion 
Strategy (NFIS) with  DFS one of the industry pillars, all 
enhance the DFS sector. 
1.2. DFS STAKEHOLDERS  
Jordan’s DFS stakeholders include: 
• The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), the regulator.  
• Jordan Payments and Clearing Company (Jo -PACC), which owns and manages the National 
Switch (JoMoPay).  
• Payment Service Providers: Zain Cash, AL -Hulool (managing Mafazati), Dinarak, Aya Payments 
(Aya) and the Middle East Payment Services (MEPS).  
• Banks providing the following digital finance products; Cardless ATM withdrawers, debit/prepaid 
cards, mobile banking applications and Online bill payment   
• Merchant Acquirers such as MEPS and EMPS  
• MFIs using mobile applications and tablets for loan processing, disbursement and repayment.

digital devices.  
• Consumers, donor agencies (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) international non -governmental 
organizations (GIZ, USAID LENS, Mercy Corps, UNHCR), local community- based organizations 
and government agencies.  
1.3. POLICY AND REGULATIO N 
Jordan has an enabling regulatory environment for the growth of digital financial services. In its bid to 
build a digital- friendly regulatory environment, the Central Bank of Jordan released a circular on 
mobile payments in 2010, and published a  regulatory framework in December 2013 for m obile 
money (as part of their 2013- 2016 payment systems strategy) which went into effect in March 2014. 
In 2016 the CBJ issued a Mobile Payment Service Operational Framework that clarifies the structure 
of processes, techniques,  limits, and operational env ironment of the mobile phone payment service. 
Mobile wallet subscriptions and transactions finally went operational in 2016. PSPs are in the process of exploring opportunities and strategies for optimization and scale up.  
There are some regulatory constrai nts impacting growth of digital financial services, such as:  
• The maximum amounts for mobile wallet transactions (limits: P2P -500JD, withdrawal- 1,000JD) 
which is significantly lower than that most European Economic Area, and also many African countries whi ch have mobile money services.  
• Confusion on the part of providers on the mechanism used to determine the level of income tax 
they should pay, given the 5% income  tax levied on FinTech companies versus the 35% for 
financial services.  
• The high initial capita l requirements for PSPs ( JD 1.5 million (approximately US$2.1 million as 
compared to about US$370,000 in the European Economic Area) 3 ,  
• The absence to date of a KYC -lite and e -signature.  
• The non -authorisation of deposit taking that prevents the developme nt of mobile banking (push 
and pull to and from bank accounts) in the MFI sector.  
• The prohibition of PSPs from deploying NFC technology solutions, currently limited to merchant 
acquiring only.  
While the CBJ’s commitment to creating an enabling and interope rable regulatory environment is 
very encouraging, the regulation should be constantly enhanced to catch up with the evolution of technology, foster certainty in the system with regards to interoperability and, collaborate PSPs

simplifying electronic =Know Your Customer (eKYC) processes.  
1.4. INFRASTRUCTURE  
Payment Infrastructure : The Kingdom has a highly developed and well -placed infrastructure to 
support the digitizati on of domestic and international payments. The Kingdom’s infrastructure is 
characterized by a high level of interconnectivity between mobile services and the broader payments 
ecosystem. There is interoperability between e -money issuers as well as with the broader ecosystem 
(ATM switch, bill payment platform, cards acquirers etc.) through  JoMoPay, the national mobile 
payment switch infrastructure that enables low -cost purchases and bill payment transactions.  
 
Jordan’s ICT  ecosystem  sis well-  developed  given the availability of universities, a h igh quality, 
well-educated ICT trained workforce as well as a large number of graduates with strong industry 
focused skills , tech firms, global players,  investors, venture capitalists, and accelerator incubators. 
The sector’s GDP contribution was worth around 12 percent in 20154. 
Mobile infrastructure  the Kingdom is proud of a reliable and  robust broadband network with 
affordabl e services and wireless nationwide access coupled with its skilled, tech-savvy, connected and 
cost-effective labor force.  Data from several sources including Jordan Telecommunication Regulatory 
Commission5 indicates that Mobile phone and internet coverage were above 100% by the end of

11     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUNTRY REPORT-  JORDAN      20176, Mobile -cellular subscriptions per 100 inhabitants stood at 100% as well as fixed (wired) -
broadband and Mobile -broadband. While the percentage of households with a computer stood at 
55.8%, internet access at home and ind ividuals using the internet were at 82.9% and 66.8%7 
respectively.  
Road Infrastructure:  Jordan’s road network  spans across the Kingdom, connecting it with all its 
neighboring  countries.  According to a World Economic Forum  report8, the Kingdom’s overall 
transportation, communications, power, and information technology are very healthy. Jordan’s 
infrastructure ranked 61st out of 139 countries, roads ranked 44, port infrastructure 64, air 
transport infrastruc ture 35, electricity supplies 38, fixed telephone lines 100, mobile telephone 
subscriptions 68, and availa bility of the latest technology .9 
Energy infrastructure : Jordan imports about 96% of the energy it consumes . Multiple attacks on 
the Arab Gas Pipeline  from 2011 to 2014, which supplied 88% of the country's electricity generation 
needs, forced the Kingdom’s power plants onto diesel and heavy fuel oil, costing the treasury 
millions and pushing the national energy bill to record highs10.  Jordan’s geographi c position with 
some parts of the country enjoying up to 330 days of sunshine a year is a huge potential for solar 
energy. The kingdom has taken advantage of its solar potential to diversify its energy mix by reducing its energy dependence while meeting th e growing domestic demand for electricity. 
1.5. CUSTOMER AND MARKET 
POTENTIAL  
Despite a sound technological infrastructure, 
Jordan is still way below its DFS market potential ( 6.5%
11 of adult population wit h e-
wallet accounts in 2014) due to general issues like financial literacy, habits (use of cash), lack of awareness, and limited trust for financial 
institutions. However, DFS is one of Jordan’s 
three core industry pillars in its National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2018 -2020, 
and support s four cross- cutting enablers:

regulations and instructions . 
Consolidated figures from PSPs interviewed in October 2018 disclose that subscriber uptake is extremely low with only 299 ,346 e -wallet accounts of which less than 20%
12 is thought to be active. 
However, there has been remarkable progress with bill payments as monthly value average rose 
from 9,451 in 2014 to 196,477,633 at the end of the first quarter of 2018.13.Despite conflicting 
figures from F INDEX  and NFIS ( data coming from the Financial Inclusion Diagnostic Study in Jordan 
2017) , one of the Kingdom’s NFIS strategic objective s shared during its signing of the 2016 Maya 
Declaration, is  to increase the level of financial inclusion from 33.1% in 2017 to 41.5% by 2020. 
According to FINDEX this  has already been met in terms of account ownership (including mobile 
wallet accounts) and which currently stands at 42% .14  
At the client level, the re is high mobile, smartphone and internet penetration in Jordan at 150%, 85% 
and 89% respectively . There are 54% active social media users15. The 100 % GSM coverage and a 
competitive market  enable s, means  the use of mobile applications is prevalent and there is less 
reliance by PSPs for  USSD and Mobile Network Operators  more generally . However, there has 
been a lack of understanding by clients on the use of mobile wallets and , how digital technologies and 
digital attributes can add value in their daily lives . These challenges are being combatted by the 
introduction of the GIZ funded Digi#ances project and , efforts from Tanmeyah (the microfinance 
sector) as part of the NFIS to promote financial liter acy. 
1.6.  PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VOLUME DR IVERS  
Five PSPs make up the Jordan e- wallet sector . AL Holool with its product branded Mahfazti, Dinarak 
and Zain Cash top the chart s for the number of registered subscribers. Aya Pay and MEPS are yet to  
have their presence significantly felt in the market. The table below demonstrate s payment volume 
drivers in the sector as of July 31st, 2018.

by CBJ . Unlike in most countries where MNOs leverage on their distribution network f or the 
provision of mobile financial services, Jordanian PSPs rely heavily on Exchange Houses, ATMs and 
Post Offices, and have concentrated their agents in Amman and Irbid for registration , cash-in and 
cash-out operations. When combined , PSPs collectively have less than 1,000 active agents17 in the 
market , as compared to 270 at the end of 201618 (4.3 per 100,000 adults).The relatively small 
increase (versus other markets) can be attributed to a corresponding growth in the number of 
mobile  wallets, the growth in bill payment services via eFAWATEERcom , and the on- going 
awareness campaign being executed by GIZ in collaboration with Dinarak to refugees and low -
income Jordanians.  
The financial value proposition offered to agents as compared to other markets where DFS is 
exceling is not attractive enough to sustain dedicated agents and small businesses into the 
ecosystem. Most third party agents / small businesses (e.g. stand -alone local shops) don’t see any 
financial value in becoming agents for PSPs. Although agents are compensated by PSPs for cash- in -

18 CBJ Data    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     14 the commission paid to agents ranging from 0.75 and 1.00 JD for the cash -out of 50JD is a minor 
incentive compared to an alternati ve investment such as increasing stock in their shop.  
1.8. DFS ECOSYSTEM SUMMARY  
DFS in Jordan has a solid foundation thanks to its well -developed ICT infrastructure , supportive 
policy and regulatory framework. The Kingdom equally benefits from various forms o f assistance 
from donors ranging from technical to financial support in developing the DFS ecosystem,  as a result 
of the massive presence of Syrian refugees. The success of DFS in the Kingdom depends on the 
understanding and trust of the population who are still very skeptical. Jordan requires a well-
developed and robust e -wallet distribution network  of agents  covering the entire Kingdom  alongside 
a joint awareness campaign from the CBJ and PSPs to stimulate the market.  Additionally, t he 
JoMoPay business mo del should be revised such that PSPs are protected from losses from some key 
volume drivers, such as bill payment.  
1.9. KEY FINDINGS  
• Bill payment is the main volume driver for PSPs in Jordan though each transaction is currently a 
loss maker. PSPs’ revenue from transactions with eFAWATEERcom is very insignificant.  
• Interoperability at the agent level is not fully implemented.  
• Cash-out is not a revenue driver for PSPs since about 80% of cash- in is subsequently used for bill 
payments.  
• Merchant payments are entirely owned by Visa and MasterCard due to the lack of a strong value 
proposition from PSPs  
• The agent network is largely concentrated in Amman and Irbid with no clear strategy to expand the network outside traditional ATM, bank branches, Exchange houses and a fe w MNO agents.  
MNO Airtime distributors are not really considered by PSPs in the development of agent network.  
• The set transaction li mits for cash -in which is 1000JD, cash- out via ATM 500J D and cash -out via 
agent 1000 JD , limits the volume of peer -to-peer transactions  
• There are just under 1,000 agents though this includes inactive agents, and those which are potentially double or tripled counted i.e. exchange houses offering all PSP services  
• Domestic DFS P2P transactions are still low due to Exchange House s being well established and 
competitively priced for local transfers  
• Non-transparency on fees - Exchange houses are charging fees on top of cash -in transaction rates 
(which are not displayed at their outlets) raising issues on client protection.  Airtime sale is not a 
main driver in DFS payments as is the case in most developing countries due to the fact most 
Jordanians prefer buying monthly bundles 
15     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUNTRY REPORT-  JORDAN      1.10.  IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES  AND CHALLENGES  FOR DFS GROWTH  
1.1.1.  OPPORTUNITIES  
• Jordan’s sound regulatory envir onment and the numerous on -going initiatives (JoMoPay, 
eFAWATEERcom, Fintech Regulatory Sandbox, and DFS Council). The Kingdom’s ICT sector is 
dynamic, liberalized and well developed. High Mobile 150%, Smart phone 85% and internet 89% 
penetrations, when al l combined creates an opportunity for the development of a broad range of 
digital financial products and services.  
• The influx of refugees from troubled nations around the region presents an opportunity for the development of tailored local and internationa l products and services.  
• Low mobile wallet adoption and lack of awareness can be overcome by institutionalizing financial 
education/ literacy programs, awareness campaigns and e -wallets for G2P, P2G, P2B and B2B 
payments  
• The Kingdom’s has a weak e -wallet  agent network mostly concentrated (about 75%) in urban 
areas dominated by traditional financial institution branches such as Exchange Houses, Post office 
and bank ATMs. Rural and some semi -rural areas are left out.  
1.1.2.  CHALLENGES  
• Regulatory gaps – no e-KYc, a nd e-signature, no deposit taking in the MFI sector to encourage 
mobile savings.  
• Limited innovation, internal capacity and Go -to-Market capability of FSPs  
• Some PSPs may not survive thus reducing competitive market  
• Impact of mandated interoperable regulati on being enforced  
• Cross network costs are expensive, unknown and not transparent (to the consumer)  
• Small and safe country, and not such an issue of travelling from one point to another or risk of theft (a key value proposition for P2P and keeping a balance  in other countries)  
• Low level of mobile wallet adoption and lack of awareness (Less than 400,000 mobile wallet 
accounts with only 20% active) which can be overcome by a joint communication campaign from 
the CBJ and PSPs  
• Financial and Digital Literacy 
• The CBJ has much influence over the PSPs’ business model (pricing and exclusivity in bill payments) and which can lead to frustration.  DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     16 2. COUNTRY OVERVIEW  
Jordan is a middle -income economy and among 
the smallest in the Middle East. There are 
insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other 
natural resources, and this underlies the government's heavy reliance on foreign 
assistance. Jordan has a population of about 
10.4 million
19. Jordanians make up 69.3% of the 
population, followed by: Syrian s 13.3%, 
Palestinian s 6.7%, Egyptian s 6.7%, Iraqi s 1.4%, 
other 2.6% (Armenians and Circassian s)20. The 
Kingdom’s challenges include: chronic high 
rates of poverty 14.2%,21 unemployment 
(increase d from18.7 % in the second quarter of 
2018 up from 18.4 % in the previous three -
month period)  budget and current account 
deficits, and government debt.22 Although the 
Kingdom’s foreign reserves continuously declined from $10 billion by the end of July 
2018, 12% lower than end of 2017 levels
23 it 
grew to $11. 3 billion in October 2018.24 On 
the positive side, Jordan’s economy benefits from its well- educated population 95.4%,

strategic location, world -heritage tourism sites, 
and a reputation for stability in the turbulent 
MENA region.

Jordan has been witnessing a remarkable growth in the supply of financial services due to the 
following factors;  
• The increasing demand from start -ups and entrepreneurial activity over the past decade led by 
the ICT sector,  
• Government’s desire to diversify the economy and bring out  entrepreneurial and innovative potentials to the market, which has attracted many int ernational supporting partners  
• And Syrian refugees continuous efforts to gain their own economic independence since their 
current economic/financial capital is limited not only by regulatory constraints (and struggling 
economy) curbing their possibilities  to engage in employment and self -employment, but also by 
the lack of a complementary set of financial services 30.  
In a survey conducted by USAID LENS in November 2018 on MSME payments in Jordan, 72%  of 
micro -businesses31 don’t access any financial service s. 13% use in -branch services, 8% ATMs, mobile 
banking 4% and credit/debit cards 1%. Usage of digital financial services by micro businesses was very 
low, 2% for Aya  Pay, 6% for Dinarak, 7% for eFAWATEERcom , 4% for Mahfazti and 6% for Zain  
Cash. Service us ed include bill payment, check balances, and receive/send transfers and, pre -pay 
airtime/subscriptions. The overwhelming majority of micro -businesses preferred  dealing with cash 
which is faster and easier.  However, the research suggested 36% of micro -businesses would use 
DFS in their business against 44% who said they wouldn’t; 20% had no opinion.  36% of respondents 
believe customers not having an account and trust remain the major challenges.

19     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      In terms of access to finance, there is a high financing gap in Jordan’s SMEs sector stemming from  the 
limitation of loan amou nts offered by MFIs which leaves out a majority of SMEs too big to be served 
by MFIs and too small to be considered by banks  coupled with the fact that most of them  do not 
have sufficient collateral to mitigate lending risk. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (EBRD) 70% of Jordanian SMEs in the country are credit  constrained, leaving the 
government with no choice but to shift its focus to boosting SME lend ing with initiatives such as  the 
establishment of a USD 98 million Jordan Entrepreneurship Fund, a venture capital fund for  the 
Government (loan from the World B ank) to make capital investments available for economically-
feasible and innovative startups . 
According to the CBJ / GIZ Financial Inclusion Diagnostic Study  2017, one -third of adults had an 
account with a financial institution. These accounts were mostly bank accounts, but also included a 
small share of mobile wallet accounts (0.9%) and Postal Savings Fund accounts (1.1%). While the rate 
of savings with a financial institution increased from3.8% in 2014 to 903% in 2017, formal borrowing 
decreased. Formal f inancial access generally improved also for the lower income population as well 
as women (even if lower than in 2014, the female borrowing rate was higher than for men in 2017). 
According to the World Bank’s Global Findex Database (survey of 1,000 Jordania ns) statistical 
analysis, education, gender, and income are critical individual characteristics that affect financial 
inclusion in Jordan. Below are some key statistics:  
• Gender gap (26%) in account ownership persists in Jordan, with 27% of women versus 53%  of 
men having access to bank account.   
• Young people (aged 18 -24; 23.6%) are less likely to have an account than older people  
(aged 25+; 38.6%).  
• Members of the low -income group have far fewer accounts than those with high -paying jobs 
(bottom 40% vs. top  60% in terms of income; 19.3% and 43.7%, respectively).  
• 52.6% of unbanked adults are not interested in having a bank account. On the other hand, but the 
remaining 47.4% are often discouraged by the product conditions and practices of banks. High 
account fees (cited by 16.7% of adults with an account) and high minimum balance requirements, 
15.3% are the product conditions of greatest concern  
• In terms of insurance, a 2015 census found that 55.3% 32 of population had some form of health 
insurance coverage. In the census results, most of the health insurance coverage (62.5% of all covered individuals) is through the government, either the Ministry of Health (29.6% of covered 
individuals) or the Royal Medical Services (32.9%). 33

4.1.  DIGITAL  FINANCE SERVICES  OVERVIEW  
Prior to 2013, mobile money services complied with a Central Bank of Jordan’s 2010 circular on 
mobile payments, but it was not well- adapted to the opportunities and challenges repr esented by the 
nascent mobile money sector. The 2010 circular allowed limited licensing and distribution models, 
and which prevent ed the private sector from building sustainable services and extending the reach of 
the formal financial sector. The 2013 mobi le money regulatory framework culminated in the 2013 --
2016 payment systems strategy (to achieve its key objectives of financial inclusion, financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection) and which was amended in 2017. Key documents, 
related to DFS regulati on issued by the CBJ include:  
The 2013 Mobile Payment Services Instructions  (MPSI)  which provided a new regulatory 
framework for mobile money in Jordan. Mobile Payment Service Operational Framework that aimed 
at clarifying the structure of processes, techniques limits and operational environment of mobile 
financial services . 
• Maya Declaration signed 2016 34: This document was made up of nine commitments on financial 
inclusion in the framework of the Maya Declaration. Among others, this included a target on consumer protection guidelines for DFS that was later put in place in April 2017.  
• Regulations of financial Consumer Protection and Complaint Handling Mechanism Jordan Mobile Payment amended in July 2017 to include mobile money  
• Requirements for the Provision of Services of Issuance and Management of Electronic Money No. 
(11/ 2018)  
As per the Mobile Payment Service Instructions, mobile financial services in Jordan is neither bank -
led nor MNO -led, but rather allows for an open playing field amo ng various types of market players 
and which ultimately gives way for a greater variety of DFS products and services even though there 
are still obstacles (with regards to non -banks) to ensuring the licensing framework is non-
discriminatory in practice.  
A PSP license can be granted to banks, a mobile network operator, a wallet issuer or a consortium 
of such firms (Mahfazti.) Such flexibility allows for a high degree of experimentation with MFS business models and which  can lead to successful innovations. \ the downside of this  approach  is that 
Fintech PSPs may lack the financial capacity and the outreach to successfully rollout mobile money. 
Under the framework, mobile operators willing to provide mobile money services are required to set up subsidiaries wit h paid -up capital of JD 1.5 million (US$ 2.1 million).

35 CBJ, Mobile Payment Instructions (MPSI),2013.   
21     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      According to the Financial Inclusion Diagnostic Study in Jordan 
2017, cross- border transactions represent a regulatory 
challenge for new MFS providers considering that various 
countries may apply different licensing, AML and KYC policies, 
or clearance and settlement standards. In order to enable digital 
cross- border remittances such as B2B, the current national 
regulatory framework should be enhanced with the 
development of a regulatory and supervisory mechanism that 
compl ies with international standards on consumer protection, 
anti-money laundering and anti -terror financing.  The CBJ seems to be actively working on signing 
new agreements with other central banks in order to improve on or close any gaps in this area.  
4.2. MOBILE FINANCIAL SER VICE MODELS   
There are various MFS models in the market  but all of  which are compelled to interface with 
JoMoPay (National centralized switch that routes financial messages with ISO 858336 among all PSPs)  
and which is  operated and by Jo -PACC. All PSPs and banks offering mobile banking and / or mobile 
money services have to connect to JoMoPay. To ensure full interoperability of the mobile money ecosystem, JoMoPay has integrated with eFAWATEERcom , Jordan’s bill presentme nt and payment 
solution, the RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and JoNet, the national ATM switch. (See 
the Payment architecture diagram  above on 1.4 - infrastructure ) 
The Central Bank of Jordan plays a critical role in the JoMoPay commercial model.  The operational 
framework allows JoMoPay to charge commissions on transactions routed through the national switch . These are to be paid by service providers and to be debited from the provider’s account at 
the settlement bank. A grace period of two years without a fee to use JoMoPay was granted by CBJ 
to allow PSPs to keep their costs low and encourage customer adoption. However,  irrespective of 
this CBJ gesture, PSPs are faced with challenges to scale up their business to a profitable level.  
Zain Cash, A l-Hulool and Dinarak on the back end have linked mobile money accounts to both 
wallets and or paired to prepaid plastic MasterCard to enable their clients to leverage on Banks’ 
ATMs for cash -in, cash -out and online payments infrastructures.  
PSPs are yet t o come up with attractive value propositions that can convince GSM distributor to 
carry out e -wallet transactions. They all target the Post Office and exchange houses which are 
mostly concentrated in urban and s emi-urban areas. Apart from MFW which is about to come up 
with a project to convert some of its members to cash -out agents, no MFI in Jordan currently serves 
as a PSP agent  though several have been considering the opportunity . 
The interoperability  model driven by the CBJ appears frustrating to so me, for example, Orange, a 
MNO/PSP was first to go live prior to 2013 under the  2010 circular. They  expressed concerns 
around the sustainability of the business model and the approach to interoperability under the

  DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     22 regulatory  framework and decided not to be par t of the ecosystem  and so waited for a suitable 
model that is aligned with their interest s. 
4.3. AGENT  NETWORK  
Jordan’s mobile money regulatory framework allows PSPs to use agents for the acquisition of new 
customers as well as to provide cash -in and cash -out services. Agents do not need any licensing if 
they comply with the agent’s guidelines established by the Central Bank of Jordan in the JoMoPay 
instructions, which include specific criteria37 on who can be a mobile money agent, and the structure 
of the relationship between the PSP and the a gent. As per the regulation, PSPs are required to 
regulate the relationship with their agents through written agreements that indicate the roles and 
responsibilities of each party under the CBJ guidelines.  
The agen t network in Jordan is limited to certain categor ies of businesses , and usually  within similar 
high density locations. PSP s heavily rel y on exchange houses , and b ank ATMs , and with efforts to 
include Post Office branches, airtime distributors and fuel stations to expand their growth. 
According to the CBJ, there were 1,409 agents in the market in July 2018, but these numbers are contradicted by PSPs projecting figures are below 1 ,000
38. The high cost of developing and managing 
an agent network coupled with the current business model leaves most PSPs with no option other 
than to work with already established cash  liquid  institutions. Current trends indicate that it may be 
very difficult for Jordan’s mobile money  sector  to take off without an agent network outsi de of 
wholly -owned subsidiaries and exchange houses. Mobile money agents remain limited to Zain and 
Umniah shops, as well as some exchange houses, and a few grocery and barber shops , this 
significantly limit ing the potential for mobile money to reach a goo d majority of the unbanked 
customers and especially those living outside of urban conurbations . Cash intensive outlets such as 
Post offices, MFI branches, MNO airtime agents, cooperatives, pharmacies, petrol stations and other 
micro businesses are yet to b e exploited by PSPs. A common characteristic in the Jordanian market 
is that outlets are double counted as agents. For instance, an exchange house with three outlets is 
considered as three agents.  
Unlike in some countries where the agent model is designed to include an agent -hierarchy (Float re -
balancers, Super agents and agents), the agent model in Jordan is a flat structure (one account per 
agent) as per the CBJ’s mobile money instruction. The lack of a well -structured agent network has 
some impacts on us er uptake, since agents often pose as the first point of contact for unbanked 
users to learn about the service, understand how to perform basic transactions and , provide  the 
brand visibility  that is  needed to create trust and service reliability.

23     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      4.4. KYC /AML  
The Jordanian AML/CFT regime is based on the 2007 Anti -Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist 
Financing Law (no.46/2007), which established an independent anti -money laundering unit, 
criminalized money laundering and terrorist financing. The law applies to  banks, money transfer 
companies, foreign exchange companies, and other financial companies, including PSPs. Even though 
KYC requirements differ from one bank to the other, the MFS ecosystem put in place by CBJ allows 
users, even those without access to tr aditional bank accounts, to make financial and payment 
transactions. The Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for JoMoPay “are designed such that new customers can register by providing their national ID number (for Jordanian citizens), their 
passport num ber (for foreigners), their UN [HCR ID] number (for refugees), or the number of their 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) service card. Mobile wallet transaction amounts are capped as a major to check money laundering activities. The CBJ is working on an e -KYC syst em that will be linked to the 
Kingdom’s national identification system for biometric signature, and an instruction on financial 
certificates for banks, MFIs, and PSPs to implement e -signatures in their operations.  This would 
certainly reduce the length of  time PSPs use to on -board a subscriber, eliminate paperwork and 
facilitate real -time loan processing with tablets in the MFI sector. 
4.5. CONSUMER PROTECTION  
Prior to 2017, there were no general laws relating to consumer protection in Jordan and no specific 
financial consumer protection regulations apart from the 2012 Instructions on Dealing with 
Customers Fairly and transparently that on ly cover ed customers bank accounts. In 2017, the CBJ 
improved the regulations by introducing “Instructions on the Protection of Personal Data of the 
Clients of Payment Services and Electronic Transfer of Funds39” for non- banks to safeguard 
customers’ money, to issue consumer protections rules, to develop customer complaints, to ensure 
systems governance and safety,  and to develop  data collection, analysis and visualization.  
4.6. OTHER  ISSUES  
Payment Service Providers lack clarity on the level of taxes they are subject to. This is due to 
existing gaps on the classification of their activities. Fintech firms with similar functions as tho se of 
PSPs are subject to 5% income tax in Jordan, while the income tax for financial service providers is 
35%. The question on whether Fintech firms are exempt from sales tax (like banking services) 
persists. A clarification on this is still pending and c ould have a direct effect on the cost of services. 
In the short -term, a comprehensive tax regime is recommended to be put in place in order to 
encourage market growth.  
The limits for mobile wallet transactions are significantly lower than those of other m arkets in the 
European Economic region. Some MFIs complain that clients with loans superior to maximum cash-
out limits disbursed via mobile wallet are not comfortable because they are compelled to do several 
cash-out transactions  which is costly.. In the s hort-term, this does not seem to be a major issue 
                                                
 
 
39  A transaction that takes place over a computerize network amongst accounts of the same bank or to

market,  yet these limits would need to be 
revised for a more active transition to digital 
financial services and reducing.  
The current commission structure practiced 
by eFAWATEER.com the exclusive bill payment aggregator , leaves PSPs with very 
little margin to cover cash -in and operational 
cost unlike in most markets where PSPs either 
work d irectly with billers or through 
aggregators. The three -way commission split 
between eFAWATEERcom , PSPs and the CBJ , 
PSPs tend to be the looser  and this  remains a critical issue to be reckoned with in the Jordanian 
market given the fact bill payment is the principle driver of DFS transactions . The fact that these 
PSPs don’t derive significant commissions from bill payment transactions  could be one of the main  
reasons why the ir agent network is not well- developed in the Kingdom.  
4.7. OTHER INITIATIVES  
1.1.3.  THE DFS COU NCIL :  
With funding from GIZ, the CBJ has established the Digital Financial Services Council , made up of the 
government, pri vate sector, NGOs, International entities, and startups who meet on a quarterly 
basis to discuss a host of topics related to the DFS ecosystem. According to the CBJ, the main 
objective of the platform is to counsel the CBJ on all policy and regulatory issu es around DFS in 
Jordan. The Council gathers  suggestions and concerns of the private sector  and which are then 
considered during the development of new regulations and guidelines . The council c oordinat es with 
other regulatory entities a nd ensure d the voice s of the DFS ecosystem are heard.  
So far, a series of meetings have been held under the council covering the following topics: the 
future of digital financial services in Jordan, DFS dialogues, consumer protection, user awareness and 
financial literacy, t he responsible digital payment guidelines of the Better than Cash Alliance, agent 
network challenges, anti -money laundering & countering the financing of terrorism , and lately 
challenges that PSPs face.

25     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      The CBJ is in the process of implementing the Fintech regulatory Sandbox incubator . It will  
be anchored as its own  unit within the CBJ . The sandbox will allow the  expansion of services  
for Fintech entrepreneurs. At the time of this report, the CBJ was establishing the gov ernance 
procedures of the Unit and will soon be expecting applications from interested parties.  
The incubator will provide entrepreneurs a testing environment  on JoMoPay but with limited 
regulatory constraints                     
                                    
5. FINANCIAL SECTOR  
5.1. OVERVIEW  
Jordan has a well -developed financial system made up of 26 banks (891 branches), 9 Microfinance 
institutions (186 branches), 1,516 ATMs, 31,902 payment terminals, 140 exchange houses, five 
payment service providers, 32 leasing companies, 24 insurance companies and more than 1600 
cooperatives of which 900 are active42. The Central Bank of Jordan regulates these players, with 
additional regulations in the financial sector coming from the Jordan Securities Commission. 
Accord ing to the CBJ, the financial sector represents about 20% of GDP, with commercial banks 
holding the lion’s share of the industry.  
Banks are the main source of funding for both the public and private sectors, and have a capital 
adequacy ratio of 19%, well above the prudential requirement of 12%. They have comfortable 
liquidity, with an average ratio of 138.1%, well in excess of the regulatory minimum of 100%. The 
microfinance sector has a high potential to play a strategic role in the Jordanian financial se ctor. Its 
outreach could be widened to cover insatiable areas so as to fulfill the shortages in demand for 
financial services, and match the national challenges facing its socio -economic status (the poverty and 
unemployment) in Jordan.  
5.2. FINANCIAL INCLUSION  
In terms of financial inclusion, about 58% 43 of the Jordanian population is unbanked. They mostly 
rely on over -the-counter transactions through exchange houses for local remittances and, use 
informal channels, such as savings clubs or saving with a person outside the family for deposits rather 
than open a bank account, this often due to the relatively high minimum balance to open the 
account. 44 Formal financial access is gradually improving for the lower income population though 
the gender gap of 29% (accord ing to Findex 2017) is the highest in the world, and where only one

gender gap from 53% to 35% by 202045. 
5.3. BANKS   
Despite ongoing regional volatility, low oil prices and slowing GDP growth within the Kingdom, the 
banking sector remains resilient, stable and attractive to investors. There are 26 banks in operation, 
15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), led by the largest, Arab Bank; regional 
institutions include Kuwait National Bank, Egyptian Arab Land Bank, BLOM Bank and National Bank 
of Abu Dhabi; and Western multinationals is made up of Citibank, Bank Audi and Standard Chartered . Amongst the banks, four are Islamic: JDIB, Jordan Islamic Bank , Al Rajhi Bank and Islamic 
International Arab Bank.
46 Services of these banks cover almost all parts of the Kingdom through 
their 806 branches and 70 offices (according to the data of 24 banks). The banking density indicator (population to the total number  of branches of banks operating in Jordan) was about 12,473 people 
per branch by the end of 2017.
47 
By the end of 2017, the number of ATMs reached 1,707 machines, up from 1,606 machines by the 
end of 2016. These machines are spread all over the King dom, with varying percentages. The capital, 
Amman, has the lion’s share, 66.1%, followed by Irbid Governorate (10.4%). Zarqa Governorate 
ranked third (6.7%). The remaining ATMs are in the other governorates.48 ATMs play a significant 
role considering that n ewly installed machines of ten have greater capabilities, allowing not only for 
cash withdrawals but also cash deposits (11 out of 25 banks are reported to have such ATMs at the end of 2015; CGAP’s 2017 report estimates that 30% of all ATMs have this functi onality.  Cameras  
with software upgrade s and face-recognition technology are used in these ATM machines to allow 
for an accurate identification of clients, reducing the risk of ATM frauds.  About 230 of these ATMS 
can be used for mobile wallet Cardless trans actions , and are being rolled out by Cairo Amman Bank. 
Work is underway to finalize cardless withdrawal transaction testing in Jordan -Kuwait Bank.

(MSME) were in use in Jordan. This was estimated to be a relatively small number considering that 
the country registered 157,000 formal MSMEs in 2014, of which a considerable number could be using more than one PoS terminal.  
Adult Jordanians are often discouraged by bank product conditions, with high account fees and high 
minimum balance requirements being of greatest concern, only 6.8% of the population received their 
wages into an account an d only 5.8 % of people do so for government transfers, leaving considerable 
potential for the digitalization of Business -to-Person and Government -to-Person transfers through 
mobile wallets. The Central Bank of Jordan is leveraging on these factors to impro ve the existing 
DFS-friendly regulatory framework to create a more enabling environment for the promotion of 
digital financial services and more specifically mobile wallet in the country. 
5.4. MICROFINANCE   
The microfinance sector in Jordan is relatively young (went operational in 1994) though quite  well-
developed, highly competitive and profitable. T, he microfinance sector has registered a remarkable 
growth with a total portfolio of JD  261million at the end of Q3 201850. The sector is comprised of 9 
professiona lly run MFIs (Microfund Fund Women, VITAS, Tamweelcom, National Microfinance Bank, 
Ahli Microfinance Company, Ethmar, UNRWA, FINCA and AL Ameen Microfinance) with a total of 
195 branches nation -wide under the umbrella of Tanmeyah, the Association  of Microfinance  
Institutions  in Jordan. Although MFIs have considerably fewer branches than banks, they are 
relatively more distributed across governorates  - only 34.3% of MFI branches are in Amman,

side, leading the outreach to women, low- income groups, and refugees  representing about 42% of 
the population. The Sector’s Gross Loan Portfolio grew on an average of 15% over the last five years 
(2012- 2017)  
The sector was initially focused primarily on group and business purpose lending but, based on 
demand, has evolved significantly to include individual enabling and supporting loans and products 
such as educational loans, life insurance and business development services c oncentrating on 
productive households and low -income segment quality of living. In terms of DFS, seven (MicroFund 
for Women, Ethmar, Tamweelcom, Ahli Microfinance company, National Microfinance Bank, FINCA, 
and Vitas) of the nine MFIs are currently involve d in DFS (Tablet Loan processing and disbursements 
through mobile wallets), and are equally integrated with eFAWATEERcom  for loan repayment. MFW 
has taken a giant step by piloting a digital economic identities project intended to  help Syrian 
refugees store credit histories, educational certificates, and business information in a blockchain -
based digital identity for use to gain access to credit or employment.  
Some important regulatory constraints placed on MFIs’ activities are the prohibition on deposit -
taking, the lack of access to inexpensive local funding (even though international donors largely TABLE 4: TANMEYAH’S GROSS LOA N PORTFOLIO 2017

to credit for those enterprises too small for banks but too large for MFIs. Many MFIs collaborate 
with international initiatives such as the Mix Market Micro Banking Bulletin and SANABEL Annual Market Survey,  and provide data in accordance to a principle of transparency and accountability. And 
these MFIs are members of Tanmeyah, the industry apex organization which is also helping  through 
LENS  to collect and peer group data on MFIs. Several donors, including the EU, U SAID LENS, and 
IFC (support small businesses, entrepreneurs and women)   are committed to providing capacity 
building and financial support to the microfinance sector as well as helping to evolve its regulatory 
framework .  
5.5. OTHER FINANCIAL SERV ICE INSTITUTIONS  
• Postal Savings fund:  The Jordan Post Company (JPC) has a network of 310 branches 
nationwide and are particularly strong in rural areas where banks and MFIs don’t operate. There 
is a strong focus on using this network to improve access to financial serv ices for the poor and 
excluded groups.  
• Exchange houses  make up largest group of non -bank financial institutions in Jordan. They play a 
central role in domestic (cash -to-cash, cash -in and cash -out services for PSPs,) and cross border 
remittances. There are 140 exchange houses (256 branches) in Jordan licensed by CBJ to practice 
money exchange under the money exchange business law  
• Micro credit institutions: There are about 200 microcredit schemes like organized 
cooperatives on the local level that provide s avings and credit opportunities. Some of them are 
supported by donor funds.  
• Government agencies:  There are other traditional finance houses such as the Agricultural 
Credit Corporation (ACC), the Development and Employment Fund (DEF), the Military Credit 
Fund (MCF), and the Postal Savings Fund (PSF), each of which was initiated or founded by the 
Jordanian government. These institutions tend to offer much lower interest rates than MFIs but 
have relatively slow processing times and sometimes must ration credi t due to funding limitations. 
The ACC has been the principal microcredit provider to agriculture while DEF on the other hand 
provides direct and indirect loans as well as technical assistance to develop and provide financing 
for small businesses.  
5.6. INSURANC E COMPANIES  
There are 24 insurance companies in Jordan. The sector is concentrated at the top but fragmented 
at the bottom, with the top five companies claiming 47.3% of the market share of total premiums 
written in 2015.  Medical insurance is the most profitable segment, with the highest contribution to 
technical profits. However, the segment faces declining margins due to rising costs of medications 
and hospitals coupled with insurance fraud. Around 68% of Jordanians and 55% of the total 
population in Jordan are covered by some form of health insurance, according to the results of the   DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     30 2016 Population and Housing Census  report. Making health insurance compulsory for all would lead 
to strong growth in this segment of the mark et and help boost profitability overall.51  
5.7. PAYMENT SYSTEM  
An open and inclusive digital payments infrastructure significantly boosts financial inclusion and 
economic opportunity. Such infrastructure generally increases levels of usage and economic activity 
in the formal economy. The  payment infrastructure in Jordan is well -placed to support domestic 
payments digitization. There is a high level of interconnectivity between mobile services and the 
broader payments ecosystem, with interoperability between e -money issuers as well as 
interconnectivity with the broader ecosystem (ATM switch, bill payment platform, cards acquirers). 
The Kingdom has a sound infrastructure in place for payments, the most important components of 
which are the real -time gross settlemen t system (RTGS), Automated Clearing House for interbank 
transfers, Electronic Cheques Clearing system, JoNet for bank -to-ATM transactions, JoMoPay for 
mobile payments, and the MEPS and EMPS switches for retail payments facilitating digital and mobile 
metho ds of making payments, although the usage rate remains very low . 
 Jo-PACC currently operates the national mobile payments switch (JoMoPay) and which  facilitates 
interoperability between all mobile payment service providers by connecting end users (through a 
mobile device) to the country’s payment ecosystem . This encourages financial inclusion for many end 
users and offers benefits to the underserved population and refugees. JoMoPay enables a wide range of use  cases, including : P2P and P2B transfers, and bil l payments. Additionally, JoMoPay enables G2P, 
B2B, merchant payments, international remittances, cash -in and cash -out.  
According to the Financial Inclusion Diagnostic Study in Jordan 2017, the rapid increase in internet access and smartphone ownership ha s made internet banking, mobile phone banking, and mobile 
wallet usage more feasible. The rate of mobile phone ownership is 92.1%, with 76.5% of adults owning a smartphone, and 0.7% having internet access either through a computer or mobile phone. 
This has  so far only translated into 1.4% of adults having internet banking and 2.1% having mobile 
banking services, so financial institutions will need to improve the usability and features of their 
platforms in the future.  
5.8. EFAWATEERCOM  
eFAWATEERcom  is the unique bill payment aggregator web service communication module that 
enables banks, Payment Service Provider s (PSP) and billers to send and receive financial requests 
through the eFAWATEERcom  network for the purpose of bills presentment and payment . The 
platform is owned by Jo -PACC and operated by the e -payments Fintech MadfooatCom52, which won 
a tender to build, operate and administer the e -billing system in early 2014. The latest statistics from 
MadfooatCom  reveals that there were 146 billers (24 a ctive) and 313 by the end of September 2018  
                                                
 
 
51 Jordinvest.com.jo/uploads/the -jordanian -insurance-sector.pdf  
52 Madfoot3atCom is a seed investment of Oasis500, the Amman -based ICT start -up accelerator.   
31     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      It handles bills from mostly government organizations and telecom companies in Jordan.  
The eFAWATEERcom  service has experienced very strong growth in transactions, as the  
number of bills paid through the system rose from 478,281 in 2015 to 7.5billion JD  in just the  
first eight months of 2017. The volume of payments through cheques declined in 2016 after m any 
years of growth, indicating that traditional method of payment may be plateauing as new digital 
methods increase in popularity.  
5.9. SUPPORTING PAYMENT I NFRASTRUCTURE  
MasterCard and Visa  are the most effective payment instruments in the Jordanian market us ed in 
merchant points of sales; online and via ATM. PSPs are pairing their wallets with MasterCard to enable their clients to use ATMs for catch -out to overcome the issue of agent scarcity in the market.  
The Emerging Markets Payments Group (EMP)  is a regi onal player active in the sphere of 
electronic payments services (to banks, retailers, governments and consumer finance institutions across the Middle East and Africa). EMP has several notable DFS initiatives in Jordan:  
• Shareholder of Al Hulool (a PSP)  
• Hosting the eFAWATEERcom bill payment system (see above)  
• Shareholder of Visa Jordan Card Services since 2011.  
• Commercializing and managing point -of-sales (POS) terminals.  
Middle East Payment Service (MEPS ) is a regional PSP established in 2009. It is simu ltaneously 
a payment processor, card issuer and merchant acquirer of payment cards in Jordan, Palestine and 
Iraq. Its specific services include the facilitation of credit, debit and prepaid card transactions through 
third-party processing, ATM management, merchant acquiring, e -payment gateway solutions, mobile  
Figure 7: eFAWTEERcom monthly transactions        SOURCE: CBJ    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     32 payments and a range of point -of-sale (POS) services. MEPS have been granted a PSP license and the 
company is in the process of piloting its mobile money product branded “National Pay”.  
5.10.  GOVERNMENT’S IT AND COMMUNICATION  STRATEGY  
Even though there appear to be limited successes with e -payments transactions at the time of this 
report, the government of Jordan has placed a high priority on improving the Kingdom’s information 
and communication sector with  the implementation of the “Jordan National Information and 
Communications Technology Strategy”(2013 -2017) aimed at providing Jordan with a defined strategy 
for addressing areas of specific weakness and opportunity for the purpose of improving the role of 
ICT in the  Kingdom’s economic development. This strategy has culminated to the development of a 
sound and robust IT infrastructure in the Kingdom, alongside the required skillsets. The 
government’s continuous effort to further develop the IT sector and di gitize government services via 
the interoperability amongst DFS ecosystem players is a big pull and pushes to catalyze the DFS 
market including encouraging the CBJ’s to constantly update its DFS regulatory framework so as to 
meet up with the fast ever -changing pace of digital solutions.  
5.11.  JORDAN CREDIT BUREAU  (CRIF)  
Jordan’s private -owned credit bureau has been operational since 2015 to boost lending to small and 
medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). While there is still room for improvement, with some 
stakeholders arguing that a lower threshold for reportable debts is needed if the bureau is to be truly effective, the credit bureau is expected to be  a turning point for lending growth in the 
Kingdom. All the 26 banks and so far 4 MFIs are now affiliated to CRIF. Efforts are underway by the CBJ to ensure all financial sector players , including PSPs in the Kingdom become part of CRIF as 
soon as possible. PSPs could leverage the data from the CRIF to develop digital credit products for their customers.  
5.12.  GIZ DIGI#ANCES PROJECT 
The project is focused on improving access to remittances also includes a component on improving 
financial literacy through information campaigns and training courses tailored to the target groups in 
order to promote the responsible use of digital financial services  (focused on Syrian refugees, low -
income Jordanians and women).  
5.13.  CONSUMER  FINANCIAL EDUCATION  AND PROTECTION  
Jordan has achieved significant improvements in the level of general literacy over the last few years. The country’s li teracy level increased from 93% in 2014 to 98% in 2015 with little differences in 
gender and a relatively high rate among young people. Cognizant of the fact that level of financial 
literacy is a significant driver of effective financial market participati on, and an important sub -goal of 
the 2018- 2020 NFIS, the government plans to increase financial literacy and awareness across all 
sectors to enable citizens to:  
• Understand basic financial and banking principles and concepts,  
• Manage savings and property and make optimal and secure investment decisions.  
• Leverage resources, services, and facilities offered by banks and other financial institutions to 
improve personal finance and to develop business.   
33     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      • Enhance consumer protection methods and means, and build t rust in financial transactions and 
dealings, thus encouraging investment and use of services.  
• Strengthen financial inclusion as well as financial, economic, and social stability in the Kingdom.  
The Central Bank of Jordan along with the Ministry of Educati on has instituted mandatory financial 
literacy programs for students and how to become entrepreneurs in an effort to promote small 
businesses. Money management, saving and other basic financial skills are being taught as part of the 
Financial Education Pro gram, more than 350,000 students from the 7th to the 12th grades in Jordan 
as part of the curricula, and the partnership between the Digi#ances  Project  and financial 
institutions to promote the uptake and usage of digital remittances is also helping to educate 
refugees and the low -income population.   
5.14.  WOMEN AND FINANCIAL SERVICES  
Women make up 47.1% of the Jordanian population but are under -represented in economic activity. 
Just 16.3% of all employed persons were women in 2016, one of lowest ratios in the MENA region. 
Less than one in three women (27% ) has access to a bank account. The low participation in financial 
services by women could also stem the economic changes that increase their suffering due to the 
social roles imposed on them (as they are conside red strangers when it comes to family business or 
money issues) and community networks, traditional beliefs and limitations  from participating in family 
capital management  decisions .   
6. MOBILE SECTOR  
6.1. OVERVIEW  
According to the Jordan’s Telecommunication 
Regulatory commission  (TRC) , three providers 
have almost similar share of the information and 
communications technology market in the 
Kingdom. According to data received from 
several sources , Zain appears to be the leading 
mobile telecommunication network with 37% of 
market share, fol lowed by Orange and Umniah 
with 34% and 29% respectively in terms of 
mobile subscribers. All three operators were 
granted the rights to introduce 4G/Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) services to the market by 2015. The three operators compete in a mobile market, with a majority of their subscribers being prepaid users.  Mobile penetration is very high in Jordan at 
150% with over 13 million active mobile subscribers. The potential for large -scale mobile internet 
penetration due to competition has captured the attenti on of Jordan’s technology start -up 
companies. Many are developing applications to target the higher spending demographic traditionally 
associated with Mobile internet early adopters. There are conflicting figures on the number of 
mobile phone connections ( i.e. using SIM cards) which exceeds the number of the population but at 
the same time, not everyone has mobile phone access. While the World Bank estimated ‘mobile 
access at home’ at  98% in 2015, the GSMA intelligence reported that there were 8.4 M connect ions TABLE 2: GSM PENETRATION

data exchange speed) was introduced in early 2015 and was estim ated to cover 14% of the territory 
in 2016, with forecasts of reaching 70% by 2020. The 2017 IWS report indicated that there were 8,700,000 internet users by Dec/2017 representing 87.8% of the population, with 53% on Facebook
54 
6.2. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MOBILE INDUSTRY IN JORDAN   
•  High population growth due  to influx of refugees from Syria and Iraq, and which is key for 
business growth given the current mobile penetration rate.  
• High percentage of youth among the population, who are early adopters of emerging technologies 
and services  
• Emerging networks, namely LTE, amidst the ongoing adoption of bandwidth demanding services 
(Digital disruption)  
• Emerging services with promising growth, such as NFC, mobile payment applications and cloud based services.  
6.3. CHALLENGES  
• Mobile services in Jordan are currently subject to a fixed 24% tax, as well as the standard 16% 
General Sales Tax (GST), there are plans by the government to increase this tax on from 24% to 
26%, at the same time introducing a new 1% levy on net profits d ubbed the ‘solidarity tax’ that 
will be used to fund scientific research and support for the poor and will collected from all companies  
• Highest tax rate on mobile users in the Kingdom (43.8%).  
• Intense competition and price wars driving voice rates to low l evels.   
6.4. 4-G PENETRATION  
Jordan’s ICT market is undergoing a rapid shift towards data service usage over traditional voice and SMS services, supported by equally swift mobile broadband network expansion, which has had a 
large impact on internet usage since 2014. According to the ITA, estimated internet penetration 
stood at 85% by the end of 2017. The introduction of 4G LTE services has led to a growth in data revenues for the mobile operators and expanding data offerings is now a key focus area. It is 
estima ted that 4G penetration could reach as much as 70% by 2020.The 4G penetration is changing

Orange and Zain investments in fibre-optic network infrastructure are altering the market -share as 
Umniah lags. The fixed broadband network is also growing, and the government has been working 
for some time to deploy its national broadband network.

6.6. MOBILE FINANCIAL SER VICES:  
• Zain offers mobile money as a standalone business while leveraging strong relationships with GSM agent network, stakeholders and its  large customer base. Zain applied and was approved to 
become a PSP in March 2015.  
• Orange expressed concerns about the sustainability of the JoMoPay business model, the approach to interoperability under the DFS regulatory framework and decided to tempora rily halt its 
investments in mobile money to play an observatory role.  
• Umniah is in the consortium with 6 banks, an MFI (MfW) and the Emerging Markets Payments Group (EMP) known as Al Hulool a strategy which allowing them to leverage assets limiting 
individual investments from each of the consortium member. AL Hulool applied to become a PSP 
in November 2014 and was approved in November 2015.  
7. MOBILE FINANCIAL SER VICE PROVIDERS  
7.1. OVERVIEW  
The Mobile Financial Service revolves around JoMoPay, the unique payment s system that facilitates 
cross- platform and platform level interoperability for multiple digital payment instruments in the 
Kingdom. This includes interoperability between the licensed PSPs , as well as interoperability 
between mobile wallets , bank accounts, and prepaid cards. Four of the five PSPs licensed to operate 
in the Kin gdom have launched their services; MEPS is still at the pilot phase.

57 https://www.internetworldstats.com/middle.htm#jo    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     36 Mobile banking appears to be more popular than internet banking, although neither is used widely 
yet. Just 1.4% of adults had internet banking and 2.1% had mobile banking, and usage of these 
services (at least once per year) was even lower at 1.2% and 1.6%  of adults, respectively, according 
to the CBJ / GIZ, Financial Inclusion Diagnostic Study in Jordan (2017). Culture, low financial and 
technological literacy among customers plays a key role in explaining the limited use of these 
services. Pull and Push integration with bank accounts is not commonly used in Jordan. Connecting 
mobile wallets to existing bank account is an important key step to drive usage but most of the PSPs are not aggressive towards this feature as they focus more on the unbanked.  
As of  July 31st, 2018, there were 299,36458  mobile accounts in the Kingdom of which  more than 
80% were inactive. With regards plastic cards and NFC, some MFS providers also link extra 
products and/or gadgets to a mobile wallet account during subscription. An ex ample of what is being 
practiced is the issuing of prepaid MasterCard  with a one time -password to new mobile wallet 
subscribers. The rationale behind such products is for clients that do not have a mobile money agent nearby to conduct cash -out operations t hrough local ATMs. While smaller PSPs prefer a more 
careful individual approach of attracting new clients via face -to-face registrations with authorized 
agents and specific target groups (e.g. working with refugee communities and university level projects which are facilitating public transport payments for students via mobile phones with NFC 
tags), larger PSPs with viable investors deploys a more corporate and bulk business development and 
marketing approach.  Unlike some African and Middle East countries where mobile wallet clients 
must rely on USSD data exchange systems from mobile network operators, PSPs in Jordan appear to 
minimize the role of USSD in MFS transactions given the country’s high smart phone (85%) 
penetration rate and the 100% internet cover age. Mobile applications are the most common form of 
channels used by the highly literate Jordanian society for transactions.  
7.2. PAYMENT SERVICES PRO VIDERS  
As of October 2018, four out of the five PSP companies were active on the market and offering new 
mobile wallet services. Dinarak and Aya are still considered as start -ups that focus on specific 
market niches. For example,  
• Dinarak currently concentrates its activity in the region of Irbid (the third -largest city in the 
country situated along the north- western border with Syria and sheltering many refugees), thanks 
to its exclusive partnership with GIZ to improve awareness of digital financial services and access 
to mobile money services with particular focus on ensuring uptake among female users and to lay  
the groundwork for Syrians and other non -Jordanians to benefit in future from cross -border 
remittances.  
• The two other mobile wallet initiatives are led by significantly larger entities, Zain Cash service 
supported by the Zain mobile network operator, whil e Umniah is part of the Mahfazti 
consortium.  
                                                
 
 
58 CBJ  
37     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      The peculiarity about PSPs in Jordan is that unlike in other countries where MNOs leverage on  
their large subscriber -base and agent network to implement MFS, the shift in Jordan is focused on 
Fintech firms. A major MNO like Orange which is one of the key MFS players on the international 
scene expressed concerns around the sustainability of the JoMoPay business model and the  
approach to interoperability under the current framework and decided to temporarily hal t its 
investments in mobile financial services while concentrating on  its mobile activities. Umniah on its 
part, preferred to join the consortium that makes up AL Hulool in order to minimise investment 
risk. Dinarak and Aya, both privately owned, are faced  with sustainability challenges due to the lack 
of financial capacity and traction.  Surprisingly, Zain is yet to fully leverage on their distribution 
networks ( third party a irtime retailers) to  have a broader coverage and to effectively reach the 
under -banked segment of the population   
7.3. ZAIN CASH  
Zain intend ed to leverage on its strong relationships with mobile distribution network  (which  is still 
not the case) , and clients to offer Zain Cash.   Zain’s license was approved in December 2015 and its 
operations went live in November 2017. Zain offers a range of c onvenient payment services through 
the PS -mPay contemporary mobile payments platform that allows for domestic and cross -border 
remittances for banked and unbanked users including person- to-person, person- to-business and 
person -to-government money transfers , direct credits and point -of-sale payments, mobile bill 
payments, and mobile top -up. Zain Cash has a strategic partnership agreement with MasterCard to 
pair its mobile wallet with prepaid MasterCard to provide subscribers with the advantage of 
obtaining a nd utilizing the card locally and globally through its PoS, where MasterCard cards are 
accepted, as well as the possibility of shopping online and using it on the ATM network. The 
partnership is enabling Zain cash to be deployed through prepaid MasterCard to dispense cash 
benefits to refugees living in camps . TABLE 8: PSPS MARKET -SHARE IN TERMS OF SUBS AND AGENTS

Al-Hulool  is a robust consortium of diversified partners made  up of seven banking institutions 
(Cairo Amman Bank, Bank of Jordan, Arab Jordan Investment Bank, Jordan Ahli Bank, Bank al Etihad, 
Invest Bank, and Housing Bank), one mobile network operator (Umniah) one acquiring network 
system operator -  Networks Intern ational (formerly known as EMP) and one Microfinance 
Institution (Micro -Fund for Woman). The consortium’s approach has resulted in an integrated 
collaborative eco -system which is furnished to serve their clients with the largest reach of agents 
across the Kingdom and a diversified digital financial services portfolio. “Mahfazti” is the mobile 
wallet brand of the consortium, and which currently has 150,000 subscribers from diversified 
customer segments. On average there are about 30,000 monthly transactions with a target of 
150,000 transactions per month as of October 2018. Al -Hulool works with about 150 agents (95 
exchange houses and 55 Umniah sales agents for cash -in, Cash -out and subscriber registration), 230 
ATMs for cashless cash -out, and with over 1,700 ATMs59 for accounts linked to MasterCard. Cash -in 
is equally done through the 190 eFAWATEERcom  touch points in Jordan.

Dinarak  is a Fintech PSP that was founded in 2015 while its mobile wallet service was launched in 
2017. Dinarak uses the Vericash payment platform which is integrated with JoMoPay to guarantee 
interoperability with other players, and eFAWATEERcom the bill payment  system. The platform is 
equally integrated with the prepaid MasterCard system to enable linkage from mobile wallet to prepaid MasterCard. As of October 2018, the company has issued and distributed over 10,000 
prepaid MasterCard holders. 65%
60 of these card s are used on a monthly basis, and there has been a 
demand for cards from youths in rural areas over the last few months. Key products include but not limited to bulk and Salary payments, bill payments and peer to peer transfers, humanitarian CBT and 
corpo rate disbursements, Cardless ATM withdrawals via OTP (One Time Password) . Dinarak is in a 
partnership with GIZ to improve awareness of digital financial services, and access to mobile money services, with focus on ensuring uptake among female users. Dinara k has over 350 agents mostly 
made up of Exchange houses, and a few barber shops, grocery stores and supermarkets, of which 
75% are in Amman. These agents perform remote account opening which is validated by Dinarak’s 
back office.  
7.6. AYA PAY  
Aya is a Fintech PSP with 15 employees. It was created in 2015 and licensed as a PSP in 2016. The 
firm has over 40,000 registered subscribers, though 39,500 are dormant accounts. Its operations are plagued by its limited agent network despite its technical know -how in inno vative product 
development and its platform which was developed in -house. Aya started with an authorization from 
the CBJ to pilot the NFC technology for transportation with buses plying a university a few kilometers  away from Amman. However, due to resistance from bus drivers, the NFC devices 
installed were all damaged. Aya relies on 32 exchange houses as agents due to the lack of financial 
capacity to develop a productive and reliable network of agents. Attempts in the past to grow its 
agent network with o ver 400 agents led to the recruitment of dormant subscribers. In terms of 
products and services, Aya primarily focuses on registration, cash -in and cash -out transactions Most 
of its customers use their mobile wallet for bill payment via eFAWATEERcom. The c ompany has a 
strong appetite for NFC products but laments the fact that the CBJ has left the marketing of NFC services in the hands of acquirers.  
7.7. MEPS  
MEPS  is the fifth PSP and recently licensed by the CBJ. The firm has just signed a partnership 
agreement with Tamweelcom to pilot the disbursement of loans  via its wallet  which is   
branded “National Pay”. MEPs plans to convert its entire network of merchants to agent   
cash-in and cash -out points.

Cairo Amman Bank is active in the market with its University Smart Card, which doubles as a means 
of identification to grant students and staff access to university campus, and a payment card that can be used at points of sale both inside and outside the premises. It also enables holders to pay their 
fees; receive scholarship funds, per diems, salaries or disbursements from the Royal Aid Fund; 
borrow library books; and pay parking and cafeteria fees within the Kingdom. Cairo -Amman bank 
has integrated its AT M network with those of PSPs facilitating cardless withdrawals with over 230 of 
its ATM outlets, while Jordan –Kuwait bank is still the process of establishing connectivity between 
its network and that of PSPs.
 UNHCR in partnership with WFP works with a bank for a OneCard 
system to disburse its own E -Cards and Paper Vouchers to support Syrian  refugees  
7.9. MICROFINANCE INSTITU TIONS  
The MFI sector in Jorad has understood the need to fill the gap between the potential of digital 
technologies an d scalable implementation by MFIs to better serve their clientele through a complete 
long-term institutional transformation . Consequently, Jordan’s licensed  MFIs are all involved in 
different types of digital finance operations with AHLI Microfinance championing the course to become the first financial institution PSP.

61 Vitas believe that SMS confirmation cannot easily be tracked by JoMoP ay if a client refuses to have received 
money in his mobile wallet.  TABLE 9: DFS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE MFI SECTOR  
MFI INSTITUTIONS  DIGITAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES  
AHLI Microfinance  AMC just completed its first DFS project –  The integration of  its core banking system 
with e FAWATEERcom to facilitate loan repayments through digital channels. A Digital 
loan application and disbursement project is being piloted .  Although, AMC is making 
progress in its digitization process, e -KYC has been identifie d as the major hurdle 
slowing down customers’ adaption to e -wallet.  
Microfund for Women  MfW owns 10% shares in the consortium that make up Al Hulool, it is the leading MFI 
in terms of the disbursement of loans via e -wallets with over 1.2 million JD already 
disbursed. MfW established a DFS unit in charge of payments in 2017 while there is an 
IT and Fintech Manager in charge of development and implementation. Tablet based 
solutions are already used for loan origination, approval and disbursement. The 
institution is in the process of developing its own prepaid card and converting some 
of its clients as cash -out agents. Other on -going DFS Projects include Robot Advisory 
chat box, Intelligent credit score card brain and automated branches.  
Ethmar  Ethmar i s a fully digitized operation  with paperless transactions. It interfaces with 
JoMoPay, Dinarak, and efwateercom. About 90% of its clients are currently using e -
wallets and efawateercom for loan repayment while the loan process is digitized with 
loan office rs using tablets on the field for data collection. However, it takes two -three 
days for loan application to be approved and disbursed. The development of the 
online loan application version is in progress.  
National Microfinance Bank  Tablet based solutions  are used from loan origination to approvals, whereas 
disbursement is done via checks and repayment via efawateercom. NMB has 
developed a mobile application for efawateercom bill payment for its customers. The 
use of e -wallets by customers is still at pilo t stage, but there has been an on -going 
partnership with Zain Cash for a year which has culminated to a commercial proposal 
from Zain Cash to how both parties would operate on e -wallet transactions. NMB is 
studying the possibility of providing its clients with plastic cards from Zain Cash but 
fear it might be too costly for its clients.  
FINCA  FINCA Jordan has developed a credit scoring model for existing and new clients and 
which enables the process for loan application, approval and disbursement to happen 
within 24h. Loan officers use tablets for operations. FINCA/Dinarak haves successfully 
completed a pilot on the use of e -wallet for loan repayment in two of FINCAs 
branches. About 100 clients were involved in the pilot.  
Tamweelcom  Digital loan applications are already operational. Loan officers use tablets for 
application and processing (same day loan request and approval). Mobile applications 
are in use. On -line banking is available and customers use ATMs and exchange house 
for cash -out.  Tamwe elcom is setting up GPS to assist its clients in the identification 
and location of bank branches where loans can be cashed out. The institution is 
equally piloting e -wallet transactions with MEPS -  National Pay wallet, with one client 
already on -boarded.  
VITAS  The institution is connected to efawateercom through a middleware server enabling 
loan repayment through the channel. There is a lot of skepticism on the part of Vitas 
management with respect to the disbursement of loan via e -wallets because of 
Jordan’s complex judicial system, they claim.61 The digitization of loan process to 
enable the use of tablets for field operations is expected to go live in mid -November 
this 2018    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     42 7.10.  SUMMARY  
The mobile money product offering in Jordan has developed from mere cash- in, cash -out, P2P 
transfers, disbursements, airtime top -up in 2016 to bill payments, bulk payments, Cardless 
withdrawals, NFC gadgets etc. In order to build greater value and promote customer adoption, PSPs 
need to develop attractive value propositions for subscribers and agents. A joint effort from the CBJ 
and the PSPs is required to create awareness and win consumer confidence. Ensuring that 
consumers are supported and protected every  step of the way is a prerequisite to increase uptake 
and usage, and which is particularly true for new and more complex products. A review of the 
JoMoPay business model taking the plights of PSPs into consideration could go a long to stimulate 
the sector with regards to traction and sustainability.  
Jordan’s commitment to continuously develop its IT infrastructure coupled with on- going efforts to 
enhance legislation on DFS, the high mobile phone and smart phone penetration provide an 
encouraging environmen t for digital financial services and more specifically mob ile financial services 
to excel  
8. DONOR ACTIVITIES  
Key donors promoting digital finance activities and access to finance in the Kingdom include: GIZ, 
Mercy Corps, USAID, WFP, EU and Bill & Melinda Ga tes Foundation. UNHCR /UNICE  distribute 
hundreds of millions of dollars in financial assistance in Jordan. According to the UNHCR Biometric 
Cash Assistance report,62 UNHCR has distributed more than $118.7 million to Syrian refugees 
alone, and since June 2012, UNHCR has been providing Syrian refugees in Jordan with an average of 
$127 per household per month. To more efficiently distribute funds, UNHCR uses iris -scanning 
machines (hardware) and the Refugee Assistance Information System data collection and dissemination platforms (software) and has begun to leverage on the JoMoPay technology. Several 
Bulk Payments pilots via mobile wallets with two major PSPs (Dinarak and AL Hulool) are on -going 
in the Kingdom to pave way for a complete digitization of the proces s but must be accompanied by 
strong efforts to raise financial awareness and literacy.  
8.1.  GIZ  
GIZ has been very supportive to the emerging digital financial sector in Jordan. The organization is in partnership with CBJ in the Digi#ances project aimed at improving access to remittances and other financial services through digital solutions. The project is part of the Special Initiative “Tackling the 
root causes of displacement, reintegrating refugees”, launched in 2014 by the German Federal 
Ministry for Ec onomic Cooperation and Development, which is also funding the project entitled 
‘Closing the Gap: Women Empowerment through Digital Financial Services in the Kingdom’ designed to 
support the development of female agent network aimed at encouraging women financial and 
economic inclusion in Jordan. GIZ’s contribution for the development of DFS in the Kingdom has led 
to the following outcome: The development. More than 60,000 Jordanians and refugees are now

regulations on consumer protection, which was issued in March 2017, and the development of a 
roadmap that is jointly implemented by 13 organizations from the private sector, development and humanitarian organiz ations and government to advance the awareness and literacy about digital 
financial services. On another note, GIZ funds the DFS secretariat and assist in the DFS Council to 
promote DFS policy dialogue.  
8.2. MERCY CORPS   
Mercy Corps is providing loan capital t o community -based organizations to support loans for solar 
water heaters and water efficient technologies in a technical partnership with Dinarak. The project involves the disbursement and repayment of revolving loans through digital financial services in the  
 
 
USAID -funded Water Innovations Technologies (WIT) Program designed to increase public 
awareness with regards to water conservation for the empowerment farmers, households and local 
communities.  While WIT is the provider of  the revolving loans funds under the Dinarak digital 
payment infrastructure, Dinarak has the responsibility of building Community Based Organization 
(CBO)’s agent capacity through a train the trainers’ approach on usage, implem entation of 
transactions through mobile wallets, as well as the capacity building of the local community to use mobile wallets for loan repayment.  
8.3. USAID LENS   
LENS is specifically designed to encourage and support the growth of MSEs by working with  
MSEs a nd promoting a policy environment to enable micro and small firms to produce, transport, 
market, and sell efficiently and at competitive cost. USAID LENS has been playing a pivotal role in 
the digitization of Microfinance operations in the Kingdom. Grants have been provided to MFIs for 
the promotion of digital financial services to owners of small, medium and micro projects who do 
not have bank accounts, to develop mobile applications and integrate them with digital payment 
solution platforms while enhancin g their business operations in the areas of product marketing 
product development and communication by providing technical assistance. The main objectives 
Figure 9:  WIT loan disbursement and repayment model    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     44 behind such projects is to enable the disbursement and repayment of loans through the mobile 
wallets, to transform the entire loan process from application to disbursement from the  
traditional paper -based/Cash to paperless/Cashless, to ensure client out -reach and access to  
finance. Examples include:  
• Supporting Ahli Microfinance Company (AMC) in the creation of an alternative delivery channel 
for its clients by establishing a database connection with eFAWATEERcom, and collaborating  
with the institution in its mobile lender project which reduces time o f loan disbursement from  
3 days to 1.  
• LENS provided technical assistance through by hiring a specialized firm to develop NMB’s marketing strategy, and conduct marketing campaign activities to promote products implementation  
• Assisting MicroFund for Women  to provide its beneficiaries and staff with appropriate financial 
and non- financial skills to succeed in the market, and support to conduct an assessment to 
address three research goals: assess the current youth products in Jordan; evaluate MFW's current youth product offering; and assess MFW’s current capacity to support the introduction of 
newly developed or adapted products  
• LENS has been supporting Ethmar to address the market gap to fulfill the need for Islamic 
microfinance products and services in Jor dan 
• Providing Social marketing support to VITAS Finance on digital marketing channels to support the MFI growth and outreach to new unbanked beneficiaries.  
• LENS has reached an agreement with Tamweelcom to provide innovative digital financial service (DFS) solutions to its current and potential clients  
• The 2016 DFS Forum to discuss how to advance digital financial services to enable more financial inclusion for small business in Jordan.  
8.4. THE BILL AND MELINDA  GATES FOUNDATION  
BMGF has made a $3 million contrib ution with plans to expand to $11 million over the next five 
years in order to scale up mobile services in both governmental and humanitarian cash transfer 
programs.  BMGF investment is aimed at developing well- structured and sustainable Mobile Money 
for Re sistance (MM4R) Unit within the CBJ to coordinate with the private sector, humanitarian 
agencies, NGOs, and relevant government agencies to design, implement, and monitor initiatives with objectives to:  
• Accelerate the development of the DFS ecosystem in a  way that increases financial inclusion and 
resilience of poor Jordanians and refugees  
• Work to facilitate public -private partnerships aimed at improving the quality of life for refugees by 
expanding their access to finance, developing a digital financial s ervice ecosystem, and improving 
the effectiveness of humanitarian cash transfer programs.  
In terms of implementation, there are some on -going Cash Transfer pilots (UNHCR has been 
experimenting with biometric linked / card -based cash transfers for a while)  with the Syrian refugees  
45     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      and low -income Jordanian population by PSPs while the CBJ is busy developing internal procedures 
for governance.  
9. OPPORTUNITIES AND CH ALLENGES FOR DFS  
9.1. OPPORTUNITIES  
Sound Regulation, strong technological Infrastructure penetration and the Sandbox 
initiative : Jordan’s enabling regulatory environment, its sound ICT infrastructure, alongside the 
existence of a regulatory sandbox as a safe space where businesses can test innovative products 
without immediately incurring normal regulato ry consequences, create a huge opportunity for 
innovation and growth in the DFS sector. The sandbox which allows firms to test their ideas is also 
opened to firms from the region to experiment in Jordan for Fintech innovation.  
P2G Payments through eFAWATE ERcom  improves revenue collection : Transactions 
through eFAWATEERcom  have been improving year -on-year. According to MadfooatCom Director 
of Marketing and Business Development, P2G transactions have been improving revenue collection 
and reducing losses for government, banks and MFIs, and merchants. The cost efficiencies and 
commercial growth facilitated by bills through  eFAWATEERcom  via digital finance helps to 
strengthen public sector budgets facilitate more efficient investment and contribut es to a more 
effective state. Government related institutions such as; Jordan Electricity, Social security, Jordan 
Customs, Ministry of Justice, Traffic Tickets, and Amman Municipality are amongst the 10 top billers. 
As of October 2018, P2G payments accounted for about 66% of eFAWATEERcom  transactions.  
Jordanian Digital native population segment remains untapped : Young Jordanians below 
the age 25 could be estimated at about 54% of the population. And there are over 208,000 students 
that can be targeted with DFS products. Turning student’s ID cards into a prepaid smart card with a 
payment application/linked to a wa llet can prompt students to pay their tuition fees using the 
cards/mobile wallets instead of having to use cash. Although Al Hulool and Cairo Amman B ank are 
coming up with such products, there are still business opportunities for other PSPs.  
The influx of Syrian refugees : There is an opportunity to offer adapted products and services 
targeting to the refugee segment as well as l everaging on donor support and mobile money for C ash 
Transfer Program s, which also provides an incentive for the continued investment needed to boost 
the industry’s growth .MfW’,s is taking adavantage of the situation to develop a digital identity project 
using blockchain technology to provide financial services to these refugees  
High rate of smart phone penetration in Jordan:  In most developing countries, a good 
number of errors are made by clients when trying to complete a single financial transaction on feature and basic phones which often lead to distrust. In contrast, smartphones aren’t constrained by 
USSD -based interactions , which require numerous steps and are prone to timeouts, providing the 
potential for more  intuitive, advanced services.  Smart phones provide the opportunity for developing 
innovative products  on improved user interfaces, on -board storage, sophisticated imaging, and 
processing to deliver experiences that make complex financial transactions and concepts as simple 
and accessible as possible. Thus, the high proliferation of smartphones in Jordan stands to enable a transformational opportunity for digital finance in the Kingdom in a safe and reliable manner.  
 
   DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     46 9.2. CHALLENGES  
Current DFS challenges encountered in the Jordanian market has to do with low appetite for the 
service on the consumer side, weak agent network coverage in rural areas, non -completion of 
projects by PSPs, KYC for DFS clients, merchant payment acceptance from mobile wallet account 
holders, and the market structure among others. PSPs spend time compet ing against each other 
rather than finding a common ground on which they can operate.  
Low DFS Adoption:  The Jordanian market is a cash -based and tangible transacting society, and 
which is socially rather than commercially influenced. There is a mentality o f resistance and people 
are reluctant to trust and adopt digital financial services. Even with all the efforts contributed by the 
CBJ, DFS providers and other stakeholders, the market is still not highly aware about the benefits of 
DFS, its available services and the process to use mobile wallets. When these factors are combined, 
it gives an explanation to the relatively low levels of adoption and usage. Since changing any societal 
habits often takes time, swaying consumers to switch from using cash and pap er transactions to e -
payments/cashless is always a challenge. Jordanians trust banks and some even turn to Islamic 
banking but culture beliefs seem to be well implanted in the Kingdom. According to the CEO of 
EMP, most retailers and big stores refuse to pu t point -of-sale machines simply because they seem to 
be more comfortable with cash, and if they don’t see the risk of managing large amount of cash, the trend will continue.  
Transaction fees and limits:  The 1,000JD  assigned as maximum account limit though  enough for 
daily transactions, is far too small for financial activities of a middle -class Jordan ian. Purchasing a car, 
buying an international air -ticket and loan disbursements amounts are way above the limit. The 
eFAWATEERcom  three -way commission split is a major issue to reckon with.  
Agent Network coverage: More than two thirds of the Kingdom’s DFS agents are in the 
country’s capital Amman. Rural areas are mostly served  by nearby ATMs for mobile wallet accounts 
paired or linked to plastic MasterCard, and Fintech companies lack the financial capacity to rollout a massive agent network.  TABLE 8: E -WALLET TR ANSACTION LIMITS

47     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      E-KYC processes are financially economical and save time relative to paper -heavy proces ses KYC. 
Jordanian PSPs have reported that the registration of a new subscriber with the existing paper -based 
KYC could take as long as 45 minutes. Continuous reliance on this model remain one the challenges 
for a DFS rapid subscribers’ uptake. The long aw aited integration of smart identification cards and 
biometrics could go a long way to simply the KYC process.  
10. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNI TIES IN JORDAN  
10.1.  THE NEED FOR AN AGEN T NETWORK MANAGEMENT MODEL THAT CAN  
     ENHANCE OPERATIONS  
Achieving a strong and successf ul ecosystem of digital financial services largely depends on providers’ 
willingness to improve the key operational drivers of customer experience, transaction platform  
and agents that service its customers. Investing in an effective agent network is crit ical because the 
lack of agent network has impacts on user uptake, as agents are often the first point of contact for 
unbanked users to learn about the service, understand how to perform basic transactions, and 
provide the visibility needed to create trust  in the permanence/reliability of the service. In many 
worldwide implementations of digital payments, the investment on creating and maintaining an 
effective agent network is situated somewhere around 30% -40% of total investment. Donor  
support might be ne eded in the area a building a robust and sustainable agent network that covers 
the entire Kingdom.  
10.2.  THE NEED FOR FLEXIBL E CORE BANKING SYSTEMS THAT OFFERS BOTH 
     SECURITY, FLEXIBILITY AND FACILITATES FU LL INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN  
     THE CONNECTED DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER  
With regards to the Microfinance sector, most MFIs are using traditional and obsolete core banking 
systems that are not flexible (no APIs) to enable real -time integration with third parties in the quest 
to rollout digital fina ncial services in their institutions. Some of the MFIs interviewed are in the 
course of migrating from their actual CBS to either an upgraded version that comes with sophisticated functionalities or a completely new CBS adapted to their needs. Although Jor danian 
banks have developed online portals and mobile applications where customers execute transactions 
electronically, some of the functionality and usability of these digital services are substandard.  
A technical assistance program designed to help thes e banks introduce or upgrade their mobile  
and online systems could greatly boost the level of digital financial inclusion through these channels. 
This could be achieved through the creation of model wireframes showing suggested designs  
and functions for various services to assist the banks to upgrade their platforms to  match best 
practice standards.  
10.3.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
DFS provides the opportunity for individuals, businesses, and governments to transact cheaply and 
efficiently. Since mobile phones are gam e changers, there is an opportunity to accelerate inclusive 
without the need for major investment in costly additional infrastructure. Apart from digital infrastructure, the main building block required is a dynamic business environment for the development  of digital finance products that meet the needs of individuals and small businesses in 
ways that are superior to the informal financial tools they use today.  There could be more  
opportunities  in product development  if the CBJ could authorize s e-signature and deposit -taking at 
the level of MFI s, PSPs to develop and use NFC gadgets for transactions , and NANO  credit. At the   DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     48 backend, DFS presents  an opportunity for fina ncial institutions to enhance service  quality through  
the elimination of  paper work.  
10.4.  THE NEED FOR DIGITAL  FINANCE EDUCATION -  
While the CBJ and the Ministry of Education’s financial literacy work in schools continues to expand 
in scope, adult digital literacy programs should be enforced since fear and mistrust of digital solutions 
and payment systems is part of the culture of the older generation and women in Jordan who tend 
to be adherent of cultural beliefs. Financial literacy training efforts in Jordan focuses on credit; this 
should continue to be emphasized, going forward; more at tention should be given to digital financial 
literacy to support the digi#ances rollout and scale up. It is imperative that customers get a clear 
understanding of the value proposition for DFS and are informed and assisted on how to use PINs, ATMs, and the  other basics of the digital payment’s technology.  
11. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS TO DEVELOP THE MARKE T 
Insights and knowledge of DFS paradigms in other markets can help establish a better understanding of the key success factors needed for the optimization of DFS o perations in Jordan. Globally, while 
private sector players such as financial service institutions and telecommunication companies are 
playing a direct role in driving DFS adoption and promoting financial literacy for the unbanked, the 
public sector work r elentlessly to catch up with the fast -changing pace of innovation in terms of 
regulation and infrastructure. Some recommended actions for the public and private sectors may 
include;
 
11.1.  GOVERNMENT AND CBJ ( POLICY & REGULATIONS ) 
1.1.5.  SHORT -TERM MEASURES  
• CBJ should redefine the current business model for PSPs by reviewing the commission split  
on eFAWATEERcom transactions. Capping bill payment fees with a three -way split reduces  
PSP’s margins  
• CBJ could review and increase the caps on cash -out transactions, account l imits and P2G on 
mobile wallets to spur usage and increase uptake.  
• CBJ should Authorize e -KYC and biometric solutions to spur subscriber uptake and usage  
1.1.6.  MEDIUM TERM MEASURES  
• The enforcement of full Interoperability: The minimum requirements for a digital  finance 
ecosystem to be fully effective is interoperability at three levels: (a) between financial institutions, 
and ideally between all financial institutions; (b) between all PSPs; and, (c) between all cash -
in/cash -out facilities. PSPs tend to realize s ignificant benefits of scale when fixed costs become 
relatively small and when there is complete interoperability at providers and at the market level  
• Product innovation: The CBJ should hasten the launch of the Fintech Sandbox initiative so as to 
enable Fintech firms to speed up the development and testing of new products. The customer data supply frequency from partner institutions to CRIF should be reviewed to encouraging  
real-time lending innovative products such as digital credit from PSPs. Digital dat a trail can used 
to transform PSPs understanding of customer needs and inform assessment of credit risk,  
49     |     DIGITAL FINANCE COUN TRY REPORT -  JORDAN      allowing for extension of credit to individuals and businesses whose past transactions suggest  
they are low risk. In Kenya for example, it is estimate d that 27% of Kenyan adults (18+) takes at 
least one digital loan over a period of 90 days, suggesting many active borrowers using Mobile 
Financial Services.   
• CBJ could liberalize bill payments, the main revenue driver in the sector which is exclusively in the hands of eFAWATEERcom.  
• Extend NFC payments to include PSPs  
• The CBJ may want to review its regulatory framework to allow MFIs to take deposits. This action has the potential to provide a major boost to mobile wallet account ownership in the MFI sector  
through wallet -to-bank savings.  
• Reduce the high tax on PSPs  and clearly define its tax regime  
1.1.7.  LONG -TERM MEASURES  
• Given the complexity of the current agent network where cash -in and cash -out transactions are 
mostly in the hands of traditional financial o utlets, CBJ could review the current regulatory 
framework and liberalize bill payments through aggregators who can provide all types of applications and transactions supporting different providers of DFS in Jordan. For instance, when 
M-pesa realized that i t was unable set up an agent network fast enough to keep pace with growth 
in the customer base, it decided to add aggregators in the distribution channel between Vodacom 
and its agents to speed the agent acquisition process. Aggregators were to be responsi ble for 
recruiting new agents and for managing their float. In return, they were to be paid a bonus for each agent recruited and a percentage of commissions earned by that agent going forward.   
• The CBJ could equally set up a national agent training instit ute that can benefit both DFS 
providers as well as agents to build readily available agents capacity to support areas such  
as regulatory compliance, agent management, operational and logistics support, business modelling and customer support. For instance  at Helix Institute of Digital Finance, the curricula 
focuses on DFS Constraints framework, fundamental principles of mass Distribution, managing agent network set -up, agent on -boarding, agent compensation, liquidity Management, DFS  
risk and fraud managem ent, BTL branding & marketing communication, and agent network 
monitoring & Support.  
11.2.    THE PRIVATE SECTOR  
• Setting up an Independent Association of PSPs: An independent association of PSPs and Fintech 
firms could be an enabling forum to identify issues and make meaningful contributions to the CBJ 
on how to address market challenges. Note, this was a recommendation at the DFS Council in November 2018.  
• Customer segmentation: Segmenting customers, profiles and usage patterns and mapping them 
along the mobile mo ney /mobile wallet customer journey may help PSPs to identify priority 
segments where there are opportunities for growing the subscriber base. For instance, taking a 
gendered approach to the traditional mobile money customer journey from registration to mo re 
advanced use may help to identify stages at which women tend to drop off more often than men. 
This can help pinpoint where to focus efforts to assist in reducing the gender gap.    DIGITAL FINAN CE COUNTRY REPORT -  JORDAN |     50 • Digital skills and awareness: Trainings should be provided to customers, so  they understand the 
benefits and opportunities of being online, and have the skills to use the mobile internet and 
applications for financial transactions. The high penetration of Smart phone is not enough to close 
a digital literacy gap with regards to p romoting access to digital financial services in Jordan. A joint 
communication campaign between CBJ and PSPs should be used to create mobile wallet 
awareness to increase buy- in since most Jordanians tend to trust CBJ/government more than the 
private sector /PSPs.  
• Support to PSPs: Jordanian PSPs require financial and technical assistance in the domain of agent 
network development and management, alongside clear and attractive value proposition for 
agents. Start -up PSPs lack the financial and operational capacity to develop a broad marketing and 
communication strategy, management of agent sales force, systems and analytics, rapid product 
development, and financial intermediation which are all key  success factors in the MFS business. 
Since MNOs can reduce costs  and promote growth by leveraging existing customer base and 
distribution networks, Orange and Umniah should be encouraged to work as a standalone.
