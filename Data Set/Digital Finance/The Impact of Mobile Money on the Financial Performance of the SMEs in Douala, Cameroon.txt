Abstract: Often Ô¨Ånancially excluded by the traditional banking system, small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in many developing countries have found in mobile money services (MMS)
a sustainable alternative. Despite its potential in propelling inclusive growth, the use and adoption of
mobile money (MM) by SMEs has generally been low in developing countries, and one of the reasons
has been limited data that supported its impact on Ô¨Ånancial performance. As a result, there was
a need to investigate the impact of the mobile money payment and receipt services on the Ô¨Ånancial
performance of the SMEs in Cameroon. This paper implemented a mixed research paradigm with
data collected through the administration of a survey questionnaire and from one-on-one in-depth
interviews. A sample of 285 SMEs responded to the survey, while 12 owners /managing directors were
purposively selected to participate in the personal interviews. Version 25 of the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to analyse the quantitative data, while the qualitative
data was analysed along themes. The results were, after that, triangulated for credibility reasons.
The concluding Ô¨Åndings indicated that the mobile money payment and receipt services contributed
of the order of 73% of the total variance in the turnover of the SMEs in Douala after they had begun to
use the technology. By conÔ¨Årming the positive relationship between the use of mobile money services
and the Ô¨Ånancial performance of businesses, it is hoped that all the relevant stakeholders will see this
as a possible solution to the Ô¨Ånancial challenges that SMEs face in developing economies.

1. Introduction and Background
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make signiÔ¨Åcant contributions to driving the
economies of a great many countries. They play a crucial role in socio-economic development by
contributing to the creation of wealth, economic growth and employment [ 1,2]. A 2016 census of
enterprises in Cameroon suggested that approximately 99.8% of the enterprises in the country are
SMEs [ 3]. Furthermore, it was revealed that SMEs accounted for 72% of the permanent jobs generated
in Cameroon [ 3]. Although they employ around 72% of the workforce in Cameroon and contribute
approximately 35% of the GDP [ 4,5], very few are considered to be structurally and Ô¨Ånancially stable [ 6].
The SME sector of Cameroon comprises mainly (around 97%) sole proprietorship or family
businesses [ 3]. It was further noted that approximately 85% of the managers of these SMEs were
relatively poorly educated. Because of their structure and the managerial proÔ¨Åle of their managers,
SMEs tend to be highly cash-dependent [ 7‚Äì10]. Consequently, they are usually obliged to transact
business with suppliers, to buy or pay for goods by travelling to their o ces, which can entail
considerable risk of theft or losing money. In the case of SMEs which have bank accounts, apart from
the disadvantages of costs which are incurred by high bank charges, documentation and transport,
owners are frequently required to queue for lengthy periods before they can obtain access to funds,
Sustainability 2020 ,12, 183; doi:10.3390 /su12010183 www.mdpi.com /journal /sustainabilitySustainability 2020 ,12, 183 2 of 17
which makes it very di cult to exploit any unexpected opportunities which may arise for which
funds are required [ 11]. Because the owners of many of the businesses are sole traders who operate in
a very informal manner and the businesses are often sta ed only by their owners and possibly one or
two members of their families [ 12,13], they are often obliged to leave their businesses unattended for
several hours in order to conduct transactions in a bank [ 11]. As a consequence, sales are lost, and their
prospects for survival are severely compromised [14,15].
As it has become abundantly evident that to survive and achieve growth, SMEs in Cameroon
need to streamline their procedures, reduce operating cost and eliminate unnecessary loss of time,
the advent of the phenomenon of mobile money could not have been more fortuitous [ 16]. The system
enables the SMEs to receive payments directly from customers and also to make payments directly to
suppliers through mobile telephones [ 17], without being obliged to leave or close their premises for
lengthy periods. Accordingly, it provides a viable means for people or SMEs who do not have access
to bank accounts to make Ô¨Ånancial transactions with ease, have access to funds when they are needed,
without incurring additional charges such as transport and opportunity cost, and signiÔ¨Åcantly improve
the performance of their businesses as a consequence [18,19].
According to Ngaruiya et al. [ 10], obstacles are inherent in the operations of SMEs. In the case of
Cameroon, SMEs needs concerning Ô¨Ånancial liquidity and banking services are not su ciently met by
commercial banks for several reasons, including a lack of collateral, inadequate bookkeeping systems,
and their often questionable viability in the eyes of Ô¨Ånancial institutions [ 20‚Äì22]. Besides, SMEs bank
accounts are not cost-e ective, owing to high bank charges and the transport costs which are incurred
by travelling to banks to make transactions [ 10,23‚Äì25]. These unwieldy procedures have contributed
to the performance of many SMEs in Cameroon stagnating, with low economic growth being but one
of a host of adverse consequences. As SMEs comprise the majority of the businesses in the country and
in the light of the disastrous e ects which cumbersome banking procedures have on their performance,
a strong case could be made for the use of mobile money as a means of enabling SMEs to streamline
their operations. The platform will improve the mode of receipts and payments, the debt collection
procedures which, in return, will enhance the liquidity and working capital management problems
faced by the SMEs [23].
Although mobile money does not provide a panacea for all of the Ô¨Ånancial problems with which
SMEs are faced, the beneÔ¨Åts far exceed the disadvantages which are associated with adopting the
system. Irrespective of whether the system is used in isolation or conjunction with a bank account,
it stands to increase the sales of SMEs and reduce their operating costs, with both factors making
positive contributions to improving their Ô¨Ånancial performance [10].
Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted concerning the e ects which
mobile money has had upon the performance of SMEs in Africa, particularly in Kenya, the topic has
not been examined in Douala, Cameroon. The studies that delved in this area include Ngange and
Beng [ 19] that studied the impact of mobile phone usage in economic development in Molyko. Covering
a much bigger area, Ojong [ 26] looked at informal mobile remittances and socioeconomic factors in
the North-West Region. MwaÔ¨Åse and Stapleton [ 27] examined the inÔ¨Çuence of social‚Äìtechnical and
institutional factors on the e ective uptake of mobile money electronic payments. Yet, none of the
just-mentioned studies investigated the impact of the mobile money services on the performance of
SMEs in Douala.
More so, this paper focused principally on the payment and receipt services. Consequently,
this study aims to contribute to the mobile money literature on Cameroon by mainly assessing the
impact of the mobile money payment and receipt services on the Ô¨Ånancial performance of the SMEs in
Douala, Cameroon. The paper adopted the mixed research method to record and analyse quantitative
and qualitative data. The individual methods were further triangulated to increase the credibility of
results. In line with similar studies, such as Ngaruiya et al. [ 10], Mararo and Ngahu [ 11], Masocha and
Dzomonda [ 18] and Higgins et al. [ 23], it is hoped that the Ô¨Åndings of this paper will be useful to the
relevant stakeholders in Douala, Cameroon.Sustainability 2020 ,12, 183 3 of 17
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. A review of the literature related to mobile
money, SMEs and the possible opportunities and challenges associated with the platform. After that,
a discussion around the research design methodology, followed by discussions of Ô¨Åndings. Finally,
the conclusions, limitations of the study and recommendations were provided to the relevant
stakeholders. Because of the boundaries of the study, suggestions for future research directions
were pointed out.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Mobile Money and SMEs
Mobile money (MM) is a service which permits customers to obtain access to Ô¨Ånancial services
employing cellular devices [ 28], by dialling Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes.
USSD is a communications protocol for mobile communication technology which is used to send text
between mobile telephones and an application programme in the mobile network, which does not
require users to have access to the internet. Although the technological innovation is now available in
many developing countries, its use is particularly widespread in countries in which it is di cult for
many citizens to open bank accounts and /or access banking services [ 22,29]. It enables users to store,
send and receive money without the transactions entailing the use of bank accounts [30].
Mobile money has disrupted the Ô¨Ånancial sector and the way of transacting. SMEs can now
eciently conduct Ô¨Ånancial transactions, anytime, and anywhere, without necessarily having a bank
account [ 10,24,26,30]. This innovation can help to reach those who do not have access to banking services
and thus improve Ô¨Ånancial inclusion [ 22]. Ngange and Beng [ 19] and Chimaobi and Chizoba [ 31]
demonstrated that mobile commerce facilitates communication between users. The later scholars
went further to show that the platform improves the e ciency of the business operations. Additional
studies conducted respectively by Ngaruiya et al. [ 10], Higgins et al. [ 23] and Mbogo [ 25] proved that
mobile money improves business networking, while Amponsah [ 21], Chimaobi and Chizoba [ 31] and
Ngaruiya et al. [ 10] demonstrated that the technological innovation promotes a cashless economy.
All these beneÔ¨Åts taken concurrently will enhance the productivity, decrease the operating costs and
thus improve the performance of the SMEs [10,18,32,33].
In the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) region, which is heavily
regulated, mobile money is still at an embryonic stage [ 29]. Mobile money services providers are bound
to work with their partner banks to provide their services [ 30]. This seems to be common practice
in many emerging economies, with some exceptions, like in Ghana, where, since 2015, the mobile
network operators (MNOs) can now apply for licenses directly from the Central Bank [ 21]. Mobile
network operators are telecommunication entities that provide services for mobile phone subscribers.
Also, the mobile money services which are provided are limited by comparison with those which
are available in East and West African countries [ 10,11,33]. In Cameroon, for instance, mobile money
is used mainly to make purchases and send and receive money; saving and loan facilities are not
yet provided [34,35].
The study identiÔ¨Åes four signiÔ¨Åcant platforms for mobile money services (MMS) in Cameroon,
namely, MTN Mobile Money, Orange Mobile Money, Express Union Mobile Money and the recently
launched Nexttel Possa. By contrast, there are only two service providers, namely, MTN and Orange
Cameroon, also known as mobile network operators, which dominate the Cameroonian mobile money
market and together account for 5.4 million registered users [ 36]. Orange, which has 2.8 million
registered users, o ers the following services: money deposits, money withdrawals, the sending
and receiving of money transfers, a Visa card facility, the purchasing of insurance-related products,
the transferring of funds between bank accounts and mobile money accounts, the purchasing of airtime
and the payment of bills, university fees, transport tickets and school fees [ 35]. MTN, which has
2.6 million users, o ers a similar range of services, with the exception of the Visa card facility,
the purchasing of insurance-related products and the transferring of funds between bank accounts andSustainability 2020 ,12, 183 4 of 17
mobile money accounts [ 34]. According to FinMark Trust [ 22], the Cameroonian population comprised
more than 14 million people who were 15 years of age or older in 2017. Combined with the Ô¨Ågure of
12% citizens who hold bank accounts [ 29] and the average population growth of 2.7% in Cameroon
between 2014 and 2017 [ 37], it appears that in the region of 1.7 million people held bank accounts,
which amounts to around one-third of the 5.4 million registered users of mobile money during the
same period. As mobile money is a relatively new phenomenon in Cameroon, it is highly signiÔ¨Åcant
that three times more Cameroonians have opened mobile money accounts than hold bank accounts.
Similar Ô¨Åndings were obtained in at least eight countries [38].
According to Rubini [ 39], SMEs are considered to be the backbone of most of the developed and
developing countries across the globe. The term ‚Äúsmall and medium-sized enterprises‚Äù is a broad
one, and the speciÔ¨Åc deÔ¨Åning attributes tend to vary among individual countries. The categorisation
of enterprises with respect to their size on the basis of the numbers of workers which they employ,
their annual turnover or capital assets entails fairly arbitrary assessments, which are often inÔ¨Çuenced
by the prevailing business values of individual countries [ 10]. To cite an internationally accepted
criterion, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development classiÔ¨Åes SMEs as businesses
which do not employ more than 249 employees [ 1]. For practical purposes, having the number of
employees as a deÔ¨Åning criterion provides a useful comparative measure for assessing the sizes of
businesses [ 1]. In Cameroon, the o cial deÔ¨Ånition is derived from the law No 2010 /001 of 13 April,
2010 for the promotion of small- and medium-sized enterprises [ 40]. It holds that any company with
an annual turnover (excluding tax) which does not exceed FCFA 1 billion and employs a permanent
workforce of not more than 100 employees is considered to be an SME [ 41]. The FCFA is denomination
of the common currency of 14 African countries which are members of the Franc Zone. As per
their contribution into the economic and the social well-being across the globe [ 1,39], Cameroonian
SMEs play a crucial role in achieving economic growth by contributing up to 72% of the national
workforce [ 3] and approximately 35% of the GDP [ 4]. Despite their important responsibility, the majority
in emerging countries face many di culties, with the most important being that of Ô¨Ånancing [ 3,4,14,42].
In developing countries such as Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya, credit systems have been developed
by MNOs which are based upon transactional histories of mobile money, which make it possible to
grant microloans to SMEs [ 43]. In Cameroon, it is the State that made an e ort by opening a bank
for the SMEs in July 2015 [ 44]. However, even if the MNOs cannot o er microcredit in Cameroon, it
is perceived by many scholars that the mobile money services facilitate the commercial dealings for
SMEs [ 19,31]. According to Ngaruiya et al. [ 10] and Amponsah [ 21], the rapid di usion of mobile
money transfer is seen as a potentially vital tool for facilitating Ô¨Ånancial transactions. This indicates
that the rapid adoption of mobile money Services is seen as a way to improve the Ô¨Ånancial functionality
and hence the performance of the SMEs. For Pinem and Dwi [ 45], the performance of the SMEs can
be measured by evaluating the sales growth, which remains one of the main determinants of SMEs
performance [ 46]. The signiÔ¨Åcance of the MMS seems to be mitigated in a good number of countries
due to delays in telecommunication infrastructures [ 47]. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by Ngaruiya
et al. [ 10], Masocha and Dzomonda [ 18], Higgins et al. [ 23], Mbogo [ 25],Chale and Mbamba [32]
and Nyaga and Okonga [33] ‚Äîin their respective studies, the platform has improved the Ô¨Ånancial
performance of SMEs after they have begun to use it.
2.2. Opportunities
Apart from the role which the system has played in increasing rates of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion,
businesses which adopt mobile money services beneÔ¨Åt from a wide range of di erent advantages
and opportunities [ 21]. Among the many other advantages which it provides is the ability to transfer
money at a low cost within a branchless bank [ 10,33]. Evidence from studies carried out in Kenya and
Ghana attest to how the use of MM ensures a seamless cash Ô¨Çow, easier and safer Ô¨Ånancial transaction
for SMEs [ 10,21]. The concept of a cashless economy is enthusiastically promoted by many central
banks throughout Africa [ 10,21,31]. Ngaruiya et al. [ 10] point out that the adoption of the systemSustainability 2020 ,12, 183 5 of 17
has facilitated decision-making and the exchange of information, improved the ability of businesses
to network successfully and increased the competitiveness of SMEs. The Ô¨Åndings of a study which
was conducted by Chimaobi and Chizoba [ 31] revealed that SMEs in Nigeria, which traded using
mobile systems, were able to shorten their delivery times signiÔ¨Åcantly. Both Ngange and Beng [ 19] and
Chimaobi and Chizoba [ 31]‚Äîmaintain that using mobile money services facilitates communication
between users and improves relationships between buyers and sellers. E ective communication has
also signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced the e ects of the phenomenon which is known as asymmetric information or
information failure between users, which results from one user in a transaction having signiÔ¨Åcantly
more information on it than the other. Increasing the range of opportunities which are available to
users via the platform would create added value for SMEs and enable them to reduce their operational
expenses and, indirectly, improve their performance and growth [ 18,23,25,32,33]. Despite the immense
opportunities which mobile money services provide to users, groups of factors continue to militate
against their universal adoption.
2.3. Di culties
The principal categories of factors which tend to discourage the universal adoption of mobile money
services are mainly regulatory , infrastructural and those which arise from traditional perceptions [ 24,39,48‚Äì51].
Mobile money remains heavily regulated [ 24,39]. In some instances, stakeholders in the traditional banking
sector tend to perceive the new system as a threat to the hegemony which they have maintained [ 24] and do
not welcome the prospect of their services being superseded or supplanted by innovative contemporary
ones [ 21]. The pressure which commercial banks are placing upon the central banks of their countries leave
them with two possible courses of action: continue with the status quo and retard economic growth as
a consequence of stifling the growth of SME sectors or liberalise and permit newcomers to the financial sectors
of their countries to boost national economies by providing services which significantly increase the financial
performance of SMEs [ 21,24,39,48]. Limited infrastructure has made it impossible to make mobile money
services available to all of the members of the populations of some countries [ 42,47]. As has already been
noted, cellular coverage tends to be low in many developing countries [ 49]. As it is particularly low in rural
areas, many people are effectively denied access to the advantages which cellular technology provides [ 49].
Unstable networks and interrupted transmission oblige some users of mobile money services to travel
to locations in which their networks are functioning normally to make transactions, thereby incurring
additional costs and suffering considerable inconvenience [ 47]. According to Chimaobi and Chizoba [ 31],
the erratic transmissions of energy by the power supplier also affect users of mobile money services adversely .
During blackouts, it is impossible to make transactions (mobile signals blackout), and, in some instances,
cellular devices are damaged beyond repair (electricity blackout). Significant numbers of members of the
populations of developing countries tend not to trust modern technology and prefer to carry cash with
them, owing to the degree of control over their transactions which they perceive that doing so provides [ 47].
For instance, it is not possible to request a refund or to stop a transaction which has already been validated
in a mobile money transaction, while it is easy to do so in the case of cash payment in a supermarket.
Moreover, in Pakistan, no matter the level of education, people still prefer to keep money at home [51].
2.4. Mobile Money Evolution in Cameroon
Mobile money was Ô¨Årst launched in Cameroon in 2011. The Cameroonian subsidiaries of
telecommunication leaders MTN and Orange pioneered the concept and o cially launched it in
2012 [ 52]. The circumstances which prompted its launching were similar to those of most developing
countries, particularly concerning the small numbers of members of the population who held bank
accounts [ 29]. As had been the case in the other countries in which the concept had been launched,
many households and SMEs in Cameroon had been e ectively excluded from the traditional banking
system and without access to funding in the formal sector [3,4,42].
Although the services which mobile money provides in Cameroon do not include Ô¨Ånancing now,
its introduction had signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the Ô¨Ånancial inclusion rate (29%) by 2017 [ 22], from 9%Sustainability 2020 ,12, 183 6 of 17
in 2012 [ 53]. As a direct consequence, many citizens have been able to ply trades and launch startup
enterprises, which have resulted in indirect employment for of the order of 5000 people [ 54]. The mobile
money transactions which have accompanied this surge amount to in the region of FCFA 3500 billion
in 2017, a Ô¨Ågure which represents 17.5% of the GDP of Cameroon [ 53]. This represents an increase of
more than 1000% from the FCFA 300 billion recorded in 2016 [53].
The introduction of mobile money has enabled Cameroonian households to incur reduced costs
by saving and reduce the risk of loss and theft which had accompanied saving in the past [ 21,22,24,48].
As the mobile telephone penetration rate was 71% in 2014 [ 52], and that of holding bank accounts had
been one of the lowest in the world at 12% [ 29], it is abundantly evident that mobile money could not
have arrived in Cameroon at a more promising time. The mobile money service in Cameroon is provided
through a partnership between commercial bank and mobile network operators (MTN Cameroon,
Orange Cameroon, CAMTEL, and Nexttel) because only commercial banks are allowed to issue
electronic money [ 30], and the mobile network operators own the telecommunication infrastructures
and technologies to deploy the platform. This regulating arrangement of convenience is the status
currently prevailing in Cameroon and will surely deter the signiÔ¨Åcance of the MM in the long run.
Although its importance is a ected by factors related to regulation, infrastructures and customs,
Mobile Money appears to be the solution to the multiple problems, namely, liquidity, means of
payments, debt collection, working capital and Ô¨Ånancing faced by SMEs. Its adoption and usage in
their day-to-day activities have had a positive impact on their performance, as shown by many scholars.
3. Research Design and Methodology
This study opted for the pragmatism paradigm. The positivism and interpretivism philosophies
were adopted in order to collect data from SMEs in ‚ÄúMboppi‚Äù and ‚ÄúCentral‚Äù markets. The researcher
elected to make use of both quantitative and qualitative research methods in this study to obtain
as complete an understanding as possible of the research problem and to make e ective use of
any converging information which the quantitative and qualitative studies generated. The strategy
also enabled the researcher to perform a rigorous evaluation of the reliability of the Ô¨Åndings by
using the qualitative Ô¨Åndings to corroborate the results which the survey questionnaire generated
through triangulation.
3.1. Sampling Technique
In this study, the researcher was unable to determine, with an acceptable degree of exactitude,
how many of the SMEs which qualiÔ¨Åed for selection in the two markets were using mobile money
services to make and receive payments. Also, the criteria concerning the periods for which the SMEs
had been operating and the numbers of employees which they had made it even more di cult to
identify and obtain access to potential participants. Using simple random sampling would have
entailed an unacceptable degree of di culty, been excessively time-consuming and entailed expense
which the researcher could not a ord.
Polit and Beck [ 55] explain that sampling is a method of choosing a portion of a target population to
represent the population as a whole in the respects in which particular researchers are interested in the
purposes of their studies. The researcher elected to use nonprobability sampling to select participants
who were readily identiÔ¨Åable as fulÔ¨Ålling the criteria for inclusion in the research sample and drew upon
their knowledge of local SMEs to locate other potential participants through snowball sampling [ 55,56].
Mindful that qualitative phase seeks to understand better the underlying reasons and motivations
rather than to quantify and generalise to a broader population, it is inappropriate to use random
sampling techniques [ 57]. The participants for the in-depth interviews were purposively selected from
among the respondents to the questionnaire based on their sales turnover, to obtain a research sample
whose members represented SMEs whose turnover ranged from the minimum to the maximum levels
and also adequately served those with intermediary levels of turnover. The survey questionnaire wasSustainability 2020 ,12, 183 7 of 17
administrated over 12 weeks, between November 2018 and January 2019; while in-depth interviews
took around six weeks, from February to March 2019.
3.2. Sampling Size
Conscious of many restrictions including time, Ô¨Ånance and limited access and the fact that the
population as a whole is too large to work with, the researcher was not able to collect or analyse data
from the entire population. As Dudovskiy [ 58] maintains that a sample size of twelve is su ciently
large for a qualitative study of a homogeneous population, the researcher selected to conduct twelve
in-depth interviews.
For the quantitative component, the researcher encountered a considerable amount of di culty in
determining an optimal sample size for the administration of the survey questionnaire, in the absence
of ocial statistics concerning the numbers of the SMEs which were making use of mobile money
services in the two markets, and even more di culty in identifying SMEs which had been operating
for two years or more. Consequently, the researcher elected to use the formula which Cochran [ 59]
developed to calculate the size of the research sample for the quantitative study: n0=Z2pq
e2, where n 0
is the sample size, Z2is the abcissa of the normal curve that cuts o an areaat the tails (1 equals
the desired conÔ¨Ådence level, e.g., 95%), e is the margin of error, p is the projected percentage of
a characteristic which is to be found in a population and q is 1  p. The value of Z is found in the
statistical tables which contain the area under the normal curve [60].
Following the application and the computation of the Cochran‚Äôs formula [ 59] at a conÔ¨Ådence
level of 95%, a margin error of 5% and a standard deviation of 50%, the researcher obtained a sample
size of 384 for the quantitative phase of the study. The sample size of 384 was considerably greater
than those who had been used in similar studies which have been conducted in countries in which
the use of mobile money services is widespread. The researcher calculated an average sample size
of 228 by consulting the literature pertaining to the studies which had been conducted by Ngaruiya
et al. [ 10], Mararo and Ngahu [ 11], Higgins et al. [ 23] and Nyaga and Okonga [ 33]. After having
given due consideration to the relatively new status of the mobile money industry in Cameroon,
the relatively limited adoption of money market services in Cameroon by comparison with Kenya,
the relatively short lifespans of many SMEs in Cameroon [ 6] and the constraints which time and
Ô¨Ånancial considerations imposed, the researcher decided upon a sample size of 250 for the quantitative
study. To compensate for any unusable questionnaires and to ensure that the Ô¨Ånal sample size was
as close to 250 as possible, the researcher distributed a total of 300 questionnaires evenly among
potential respondents in both markets. After he had collected and sorted the completed questionnaires,
it emerged that 285 were usable, of which 142 had been completed by respondents in the Central Market
and the remaining 143 by respondents in the Mboppi market. As the 285 completed questionnaires
signiÔ¨Åcantly exceeded the initial target Ô¨Ågure of 250, it was likely that the credibility of the Ô¨Åndings
would be substantially increased.
3.3. Measures Taken to Ensure the Credibility of the Findings
Although it is not possible to eliminate the possibility of the findings of research studies lacking
credibility , researchers need to take all reasonable measures to do so [58]. Credibility refers to the extent to
which accounts which are provided by researchers are plausible and appropriate, particularly concerning
the degree to which their findings accord with the perceptions of the participants in their studies [ 55].
Credibility is predicated upon the criteria of reliability and validity to evaluate the quality of research.
3.3.1. Reliability
According to Dudovskiy [ 58] and Asoba [ 61], reliability refers to the consistency with which
particular research instruments generate data. Consequently, the reliability of the Ô¨Åndings of a study is
assessed in accordance with the likelihood that other researchers would be able to generate similarSustainability 2020 ,12, 183 8 of 17
Ô¨Åndings under the same conditions and using the same research techniques. As such, the reliability of
the Ô¨Åndings of this paper was ensured by pilot testing both the survey questionnaire and the interview
guide and by subsequently corroborating the Ô¨Åndings of the quantitative study with those which were
obtained from the face-to-face in-depth interviews.
3.3.2. Validity
According to Polit and Beck [ 55], validity can be defined as the degree to which a research instrument
measures what it is intended to measure. From a slightly different standpoint, Dudovskiy [ 58] evaluates
the validity of findings as a measure of the degree to which the requirements of a particular scientific
research methodology have been adhered to during the process of generating research findings. In both
instances, it is evident that validity is a measure of accuracy . Creswell [ 62] explains that in mixed methods
research, the findings from quantitative studies are used to validate those of qualitative studies and vice
versa. As this study employed a mixed methods research design, the findings from the administration of
the survey questionnaire were validated against those which the in-depth interviews generated.
4. Findings and Discussions
4.1. Results of the Quantitative Phase
4.1.1. Monthly Levels of Turnover in FCFA Before and After the Adoption of Mobile Money Services
Figure 1 depicts the levels of monthly turnover, which the respondents claimed on behalf of their
SMEs before and after they had elected to make use of mobile money services. The ranges into which their
respective levels of turnover fell are summarised in Table 1. The results in Table 1 denote that the average
turnover of the SMEs in Douala increased by 0.44, almost 12%, after they have begun using mobile money
services. It can be seen in Figure 1 that before they elected to make use of mobile money services, 69 out
of 285 SMEs had achieved monthly turnovers of from FCFA 200,001 to FCFA 500,000, the figures rose
to 75 after they had done so. Also, the numbers of SMEs which achieved monthly turnovers of more
than FCFA 1 million rose from forty , before the adoption of mobile money , to sixty , after having done so,
which represents an increase of 50%. The findings of a study which was conducted by Ngaruiya et al. [ 10]
in Kenya were essentially similar to those of this study in these respects.

majority  (67%)  of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that it was affordable and 
straightforward to register a mobile money account. A similar majority (65%)  either agreed or 
strongly agreed that mobile money transactions were safe, while (54%)  either agreed or strongly 
agreed that mobile money service providers were reliable. By contrast, the majority (130) either 
disagreed or strongly disagreed that using mobile money services to make and receive payments 
had significantly influence d the turnover of their businesses, while ninety -two respondents chose to 
record neutral responses, by comparison with a total of sixty -three who either agreed or strongly

either negative or neutral responses to the statement that their sales had increased after they had 
begun to make and receive payments by means of mobile money, as they accounted for 196 of 285 
responses. The spread of responses to the statemen t that the adoption of mobile money services to 
make and receive payments had improved their cash flow was similar, although an even larger

4.1.3. Evaluation of the Perceived Impact of Mobile Money Payments and Receipts on the Financial 
Performance of SMEs in Douala  
The researcher identified nine variables from the data to form a reliable scale against which to 
assess the influence of Mobile Money and Mobile Money services upon the financial performance of 
the SMEs whose representatives responded to the survey questionnaire.  The researcher  evaluated 
their reliability by using the SPSS  version 25  software to determine a Cronbach alpha score for each 
before commencing with the anal ysis to test the hypotheses in the study. The nine variables, along 
with their respective Cronbach alpha scores, are summarised in Appendix A , Table A1 . As Goforth 
[63] explains, Cronbach‚Äôs alpha ùõº scores need to be at least from 0.65 to 0.8 if they are t o denote 
significance. The alpha coefficient noted in Table 2 is 0.659, which suggests that the items exhibit a 
reasonable degree of internal consistency concerning reliability.  Reliability refers to the consistency 
with which particular research instrumen ts generate data and  is assessed by the likelihood that other 
researchers would be able to generate similar findings under the same conditions and using the 
same research techniques  [58,61] .

4.1.3. Evaluation of the Perceived Impact of Mobile Money Payments and Receipts on the Financial

The researcher identiÔ¨Åed nine variables from the data to form a reliable scale against which to
assess the inÔ¨Çuence of Mobile Money and Mobile Money services upon the Ô¨Ånancial performance of
the SMEs whose representatives responded to the survey questionnaire. The researcher evaluated their

After that, Pearson‚Äôs correlation analysis was conducted. For the purposes of performing the
analysis, the variables have been recoded as follows: YE for years for which the SMEs of the respondents
had been in existence, BA for does your business hold a bank account? AY for number of years since
the adoption of MMS, MMSCETB for MMS are more cost e ective than the services of traditional
banks, MMSIT for using Mobile Money services inÔ¨Çuences turnover, TBA for monthly turnover before
the adoption of MMS, TAA for monthly turnover after the adoption of MMS, NOPDS for number
of Mobile Money payments per day to suppliers, EDU for levels of educational attainment and BS
for business sectors in which the SMEs of the respondents operated. As can be seen in Table 3,
the values of the correlation coe cient (r)for correlations between the variables which were regressed
ranged from 0.149 to 0.834. The values reveal that there were correlations between all variables
and turnover, with the exceptions of BA, EDU, and BS. It can be drawn from Table 2 that there was
a signiÔ¨Åcant and robust correlation at the 1 percent level between monthly turnover before the adoption
of Mobile Money services and afterwards. Although there were correlations with all of the other
signiÔ¨Åcant variables, they were relatively weak. It was meaningful to note that the strong positive
relationship between the variables TBA and MMSCETB‚Äîwhich was reÔ¨Çected in the value of 0.191
at the 1 percent level, dropped sharply after the adoption of Mobile Money services. This Ô¨Ånding
suggests that although many of the respondents may have believed before they started to use Mobile
Money to make and receive payments that the availability of a more cost-e ective system would
increase their turnover, their perceptions changed after they started to use the system. It is also
signiÔ¨Åcant that the strength of correlations increased after the adoption of Mobile Money services for
the variables YE, MMSIT and NOPDS. It is possible to infer from them that as the turnover of the
SMEs increased over time, their increasing numbers of payments to suppliers per day also increased
their turnover, thereby contributing to perceptions of Mobile Money transactions increasing turnover.
This scenario also emerged from the Ô¨Åndings of earlier studies which were conducted by researchers
such as Ngaruiya et al. [10], Higgins et al. [ 23] and Nyaga and Okonga [ 33] -. Once the correlations
had been determined between the independent and dependent variables, the researcher elected to
investigate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent
variables using the regression analysis. The R-square value of 0.733 in the model summary in Table 4
suggests that taken together, the independent variables explained of the order of 73 percent of the total
variance in the turnover of SMEs in Douala after the adoption of Mobile Money services. From thisSustainability 2020 ,12, 183 11 of 17
Ô¨Ånding, it would appear that the independent variables which have been cited collectively constitute
a credible predictor of Ô¨Ånancial performance for SMEs in Douala.

are signiÔ¨Åcant at the 5 percent level. It needs to be emphasised that the Ô¨Åndings suggest that a unit
increase in the monthly turnover of SMEs in Douala before the adoption of Mobile Money to make
and receive payments should result in a 75 percent increase in their Ô¨Ånancial performance after the
adoption of the system, ceteris paribus. They also reveal that unit increases in the numbers of payments
to suppliers per day and the perception that Mobile Money services are more cost-e ective than those
of traditional banks result in an increased coe cient value of 0.243 and a decreased one of  0.154,

4.2. Results of the Qualitative Phase
Has the adoption of Mobile Money Services to make and receive payments improved your
business operations?
The question of whether the adoption of Mobile Money to make and receive payments had
improved the operations of the interviewees drew mixed responses as shown in Figure 3, with 58 percent
perceiving an improvement while the remaining 42 percent did not. In the words of interviewee A:
‚ÄúThere is no change. I am still making more or less around the same turnover. The only advantage
I may acknowledge is that it makes it unnecessary for me to leave my business premises.‚Äù
This response conÔ¨Årmed that convenience was a motivating factor for the adoption of Mobile
Money to make and receive payments. As interviewee D explained,
‚ÄúThe majority of my customers use Mobile Money services, especially those outside of Douala.
Mobile Money services have improved my operation and made it very Ô¨Çuid. Now, people can pay for
goods from wherever they are in Cameroon and receive them.‚Äù
It needs to be emphasised that improved business operations are likely to result in increased sales
turnover, a deÔ¨Ånitive indicator of both growth and Ô¨Ånancial performance. The overall Ô¨Ånding displayed
in Figure 3 was that the acknowledgement of seven of the twelve interviewees that the adoption
of Mobile Money for payments and receipts had improved their business operations represented
an acknowledgement that doing so had improved the Ô¨Ånancial performance of their businesses.

5. Conclusion s and Recommendations  
Over the past decade, Mobile Money has improved financial inclusion in several developing 
countries but has also improved the way of life of many households and the business operations of 
many SMEs. The Mobile Money services merits could be used to address  some of the difficulties 
faced by the SMEs in Douala , Cameroon. Mindful of these advantages and the growing uptake of the 
platform in Douala, the researchers investigated the impact of the mobile money payment and 
receipt services on financial performance . Taken collectively, the independent variables predicted 
73% of the variance in sale turnover of the SMEs that participated in the study after they had begun 
to use Mobile Money services. In line with the literature, it can be concluded that the adoption of 
Mobile Money services exerted a significantly positive influence on the financial performance of the 
SMEs in this study. A finding which could plausibly be generalised at least to the two markets in 
Douala in Cameroon in which the study was conducted.  
Considering the principal sources of difficulty which the participants identified with respect to 
the effective running of their businesses, and the perceived role of SMEs in economic growth, one 
would recommend firstly  that the SMEs in Douala should make f ull use of Mobile Money services 
given its potential to improve financial performance. Secondly , that the government should 
investigate the feasibility of promulgating laws that would make Mobile Money service providers 
licensed financial institutions , as this would significantly reduce their operating costs and enable 
them to make their services more accessible to users. The partnerships which Mobile Money service 
providers have with commercial banks at present entail considerable expense and prevent t hem 
from making their services more affordable. Thirdly , the paper recommends that the government 
should encourage SMEs to make Mobile Money transactions through appropriate tax incentives. 
Finally , the government, through the Ministry of Small  and Medium -sized Enterprises, Social 
Economy, and Handicrafts as one of its chief regulators, should provide support to the SME sector in 
the form of policies that facilitate an environment which is conducive to economic growth. 
Commercial banks must be encouraged to  provide financial assistance to SMEs, even if doing so 
necessitates the government assuming responsibility for loans which are made to SMEs which have 
been assessed as being viable.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations
Over the past decade, Mobile Money has improved Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in several developing
countries but has also improved the way of life of many households and the business operations of
many SMEs. The Mobile Money services merits could be used to address some of the di culties
faced by the SMEs in Douala, Cameroon. Mindful of these advantages and the growing uptake of
the platform in Douala, the researchers investigated the impact of the mobile money payment and
receipt services on Ô¨Ånancial performance. Taken collectively, the independent variables predicted 73%
of the variance in sale turnover of the SMEs that participated in the study after they had begun to use
Mobile Money services. In line with the literature, it can be concluded that the adoption of Mobile
Money services exerted a signiÔ¨Åcantly positive inÔ¨Çuence on the Ô¨Ånancial performance of the SMEs in
this study. A Ô¨Ånding which could plausibly be generalised at least to the two markets in Douala in
Cameroon in which the study was conducted.
Considering the principal sources of di culty which the participants identiÔ¨Åed with respect to the
eective running of their businesses, and the perceived role of SMEs in economic growth, one would
recommend Ô¨Årstly that the SMEs in Douala should make full use of Mobile Money services given its
potential to improve Ô¨Ånancial performance. Secondly, that the government should investigate the
feasibility of promulgating laws that would make Mobile Money service providers licensed Ô¨Ånancial
institutions, as this would signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce their operating costs and enable them to make their
services more accessible to users. The partnerships which Mobile Money service providers have
with commercial banks at present entail considerable expense and prevent them from making their

6. Limitations of the Study and Future Research Directions
One of the principal limitations concerned the researcher being obliged to rely upon the subjective
assessments of the respondents to the survey questionnaire and interviewees on the inÔ¨Çuence of Mobile
Money on their turnover. The accuracy of the Ô¨Åndings would improve signiÔ¨Åcantly if the researcher
had access to informal Ô¨Ånancial records and could observe the levels of turnover from the numbers of
sales which were transacted before and after the adoption of Mobile Money in a longitudinal study.
Also, it needs to be conceded that reducing the initial sample size of 384, which had been calculated
through the formula of Cochran [ 59], to 285 could have altered the Ô¨Åndings. Using growth for turnover
as the sole determinant of the increased Ô¨Ånancial performance of the SMEs without investigating
the inÔ¨Çuence of other factors could have constituted another limitation. The statistical analysis of
the data did not include a normality test, and only signiÔ¨Åcant variables were used in the inferential
analysis. The degree to which the Ô¨Åndings could be generalised to other target populations could also
be limited unless the business practices of the SMEs concerned are very similar to those in the two
markets in Douala.
To enhance the generalisability and credibility of the Ô¨Åndings, further investigations on the topic
in Cameroon should prioritise the use of quantitative methodologies. Additionally, for future research,
turnover should be based upon recorded sales, even if the methods which are used to record sales
are informal. Given that the paper relied on the use of cross-sectional data, further studies should
beneÔ¨Åt from the longitudinal survey. Finally, as the independent variables which were identiÔ¨Åed as
contributing to variance in sales turnover were found to predict of the order of 73% of the variance,
those which could predict the remaining 27% could be investigated in future studies.
