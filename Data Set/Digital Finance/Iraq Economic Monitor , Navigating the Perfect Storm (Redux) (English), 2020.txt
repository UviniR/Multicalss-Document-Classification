Recent Economic and Policy 
Developments
Iraq, once again, is facing a combination of 
acute shocks which the country is ill-prepared to 
manage. The collapse in oil prices has considerably 
reduced budgetary revenues and reversed the fiscal 
surpluses accumulated since 2018 . COVID-19, and the 
lockdown measures needed to contain the pandemic 
have dealt a severe blow to economic activities 
especially the services sectors like transport, trade, 
banking and religious tourism, which constitute around 
half of the non-oil economy  . The growing discontent 
over poor service delivery, rising corruption, and lack 
of jobs persists and is coupled with political impasse 
over the formation of a new government .
Iraq’s pre-existing conditions going into 
this crisis limit its ability to manage and mitigate 
the socio-economic impact. A large dependency 
on oil revenues coupled with built-up budget rigidities 
limit Iraq’s fiscal space to respond to the COVID-19 
outbreak and offer a stimulus package to re-start 
the economy  . An undiversified economy, highly 
dependent on oil outcomes, as well as large presence 
of the state in economic and commercial activities, 
make it hard to create the needed private sector jobs 
for a predominantly young population . Furthermore, 
rampant corruption and weak governance and 
service delivery fueled large scale protests across the country calling for better public service delivery 
and jobs . As a result, all signs indicate that this multi-
faceted crisis will have a protracted impact .
The outlook for Iraq, which was already 
negative prior to the COVID-19 shock, has 
markedly worsened since. Near-term economic 
growth will be subdued by low oil prices, a new OPEC+ 
agreement that has reduced oil production quotas, 
and unfavorable global and domestic conditions 
including disruptions from COVID-19 spread . As a 
result, the economy is projected to contract by 9 .7 
percent in 2020, down from a real GDP growth of 
4 .4 percent in 2019, with both oil and non-oil sectors 
contracting by 13 and 4 .4 percent respectively  .
The unsustainable stimulus package 
introduced since October—including a rising 
public sector employment, lower retirement age, 
and various transfers—coupled with weaker oil 
revenues are expected to have detrimental fiscal 
effects. In case oil prices stabilize in the low-30s and 
no reform measures are taken, the budget deficit 
would exceed 29 percent of GDP in 2020 and gross 
financing needs would reach of US$67 billion (over 39 
percent of GDP) . Under this situation, Iraq may have 
no choice but to resort to a mixture of domestic and 
foreign sources to finance the deficit . Heavy reliance 
on local banks will crowd-out the available liquidity 
for private sector credit, while access to international 
markets may prove to be difficult given global market x IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)conditions and a weak macro-framework for Iraq . 
Closing the gap through local currency bonds will 
weaken CBI’s balance sheet and create pressures on 
the exchange rate and inflation . The accompanying 
current account deficit, estimated at 18 .8 percent of 
GDP in 2020, could also draw-down CBI’s foreign 
currency reserves to below 3 months of imports by 
2022, exacerbating further the vulnerability of the 
country to external shocks .
Amidst this situation, implementing reforms in 
Iraq has become even more crucial for the sustain -
ability of growth and job creation. A comprehensive 
forward-looking economic reform agenda can signal will -
ingness to create the enabling environment for private 
sector led growth, diversification and job creation, and 
center around two focus areas:1
i . Tackling cross-cutting impediments for private-
sector led diversification through:
• Fiscal Sustainability and Economic 
Governance .
• Financial Sector Reforms .
• Business Environment Reforms .
• Improving Human Capital outcomes .
• Social Protection and Labor Systems 
Reforms .
ii . Reforming governance and promoting private 
sector participation in selected productive 
sectors:
• Agriculture and Agri-Industries reforms .
• Electricity Sector Reforms .
• Gas Sector Reform,
Laying the Foundation for a 
New Economy in Iraq: Digital 
Transformation
This special focus on digital economy (DE)  
highlights the importance of digital transformation 
for Iraq and the urgency behind it. Iraq’s economic 
condition was gradually improving following the deep 
economic strains of the last three years . However, the 
recent protests and unrest highlight the continued 
fragility of the country and the high priority of 
improving economic opportunities, particularly for 
youth . Leveraging the DE will help Iraq address some of its citizens’ concerns as well as accelerate the 
achievement of its development objectives .
The benefits of a robust DE are numerous, 
and often unexpected, such as stronger resilience in 
the face of pandemics, as illustrated with COVID-19. 
Innovative digital solutions are being deployed to sterilize 
hospitals, identify and monitor affected populations, 
offer home-based educational and employment 
opportunities among others to facilitate the necessary 
social distancing . A critical element to benefitting from 
these technologies is the underpinnings of a strong 
digital economy that also addresses the digital divide 
between those who have access to digital devices (such 
as computers, mobile phones, tablets) and the Internet, 
and those who do not .
The special focus covers the five foundational 
interconnected elements of a DE. The World Bank 
Group (WBG) defines the DE framework,2 as consisting 
of 1) Digital Infrastructure, 2) Digital Financial Services 
(DFS), 3) Digital Platforms, 4) Digital Skills, and 5) Digital 
Entrepreneurship . Across all five pillars, the paper 
identifies challenges, opportunities, and proposes 
short-to-medium term recommendations .
The priority reform areas in Iraq are governance 
and promoting private sector participation in 
productive sectors (and diversification). This can 
subsequently boost Iraq’s participation in the DE . These 
priority reform areas cut across all five elements of the 
DE framework and are meant to boost accountability, 
transparency, and trust .
Transitioning Iraq towards a resilient and 
inclusive DE will require economic reforms and 
longer-term development priorities along the five 
pillars: ensuring affordable access to high-speed 
internet, achieving widespread adoption of cashless 
payments, delivering digital government services 
and improving access to data, upskilling youth with 
technological know-how, and scaling up the digital 
entrepreneurship ecosystem . The relevance and 
urgency of these reforms are all too visible during the 
ongoing COVID-19 global health crisis .

RECENT ECONOMIC AND 
POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
Introduction
Iraq, once again, is facing a combination of acute 
shocks which the country is ill-prepared to man-
age. Following the twin shock of 2014-[17] where 
Iraq faced both the Islamic State (IS) and the sharp 
collapse of the oil price, the country is once again 
facing another major economic and social crisis com-
bining several large shocks: namely the collapse in 
international oil prices, the spread of COVID-19, as 
well as persistent social and political turmoil . Iraq’s 
pre-existing structural conditions, along with long-
standing economic mismanagement, going into the 
pandemic-related shock severely constrain the coun-
try’s current ability to manage and mitigate its impact . 
Large dependency on oil revenues coupled with 
built-up budget rigidities—such as a budget dominat-
ed by wages and pension payments—constrain fiscal 
space for a resilience package, let alone a stimulus 
one; an undiversified economy and large presence of 
the state in economic activity is making it harder to 
create jobs in the private sector for a predominantly 
young population; rampant corruption and weak gov -
ernance structures prompted large scale protests 
calling for better public service delivery and jobs . As a result, this multi-facetted crisis is expected to have 
protracted impact going forward and reverse some of 
the progress and reforms made through early 2019 .
Even prior to COVID-19, the social and hu-
manitarian conditions were critical in many parts 
of the country. The pandemic has hit Iraq in a time 
where the country is still facing daunting challenges 
to rebuild its infrastructure and provide needed pub-
lic services to its population . It also came when the 
country was facing major development and humani-
tarian challenges . Indeed, Iraq ranks poorly at 120 of 
189 countries in the 2019 Human Development Index 
(HDI) . The poverty rate stood high at 20 percent in 
2018; while the unemployment rate, which was falling 
before the ISIS crisis, had risen beyond the 2012 level 
to 9 .9 percent in 2018 . This also came on the back 
of a very low labor force participation rate, especially 
for women (12 percent),3 and in times where more 
than a fifth of the economically active youth do not 
have a job and are neither in employment nor in 
education or training . Furthermore, the humanitarian 
situation is still precarious with 1  .4 million internally 
3 World Bank staff estimates, MNA, Poverty and Equity 
Global Practice .2 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)displaced persons (IDPs), 4 .5 million returnees and 
over 286,000 refugees (UNHCR 2020) . These popu-
lations are susceptible to food insecurity,4 with poor 
access to quality health care and education .
This situation is currently aggravated with 
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 26th, 
there has been 1,761 confirmed cases in Iraq with 
86 fatalities according to the UNOCHA  . The virus 
spread puts additional strains on the under-invested 
healthcare system and deepens economic downturn 
as the strict containment measures forces closures of 
business . The pandemic is expected to have a larger 
impact on the most vulnerable segments of the popu -
lation especially the displaced (Box 1) .Output and Demand
Oil, agriculture and electricity generation have 
been the drivers of growth in 2019. Real GDP grew 
by 4 .4 percent in 2019, reversing two consecutive years 
of contraction (Figure 1) . The lynchpin was the oil sector 
which grew by 4 .2 percent year-on-year (y/y), while the 
non-oil economy grew by 4 .9 percent (y/y) . Agriculture 
was the largest contributor to growth of all non-oil sectors 
(Figure 3) after it expanded by a staggering 39 percent . 
This performance reflects above-average rainfall and BOX 1 •  COVID-19 Impact on the Humanitarian Response and Support to Vulnerable Displaced 
Populations in Iraq.
There are over 1.4 million people internally displaced people in Iraq, 25.4 percent (or 359,000) of which are residing in one of the 
67 camps. In addition to this, as of end 2019, there were 286,949 refugees in Iraq. 245,810 are Syrians, and 41,139 from other nationalities 
(70% children), with most Syrian refugees living in Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 41% of who are living in the 10 refugee camps in KR-I and the 
rest living in urban areas.
There is currently no strategy at the local, federal, or international level on what to do with these families, who prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
faced protection, (re)radicalization risks inside the camps and now face a startling health risk. With the support of UN agencies and NGOs, 
most camps have COVID-19 preparedness measures in place, training to Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) staff in camps, awareness 
raising and sensitisation messages are being disseminated, masks, soaps and hygiene material distributed and camp sterilisation has 
been carried out. There are currently no reported cases of COVID-19 infection within the camps, however this is expected to change as the 
situation evolves.
In mid-March, to control the COVID-19 outbreak, the GoI and the KRG, imposed extensive measures including significant movement 
restrictions and nationwide curfews. The restriction on movements, the lack of clarity and enforcement, especially at the Governate level is 
now starting to limit the movement of the UN and NGO organizations who are providing essential lifesaving services to displaced communities 
in and outside of camps. Such services include health awareness campaigns, distribution of basic hygiene, Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE), relief, medication to IDPs with chronic diseases; individual case management, counselling, and psychiatric services, support on 
gender-based violence—which will be at a heightened risk due to the “curfew” imposed across the country; establishment or reinforcement 
of health structures in IDPs in camps etc.
UN agencies report that several IDP camp management teams have requested for support to increase preparedness to deal with a 
COVID-19 outbreak within the camp. IDPs, overall, are becoming anxious due to a lack of access to information, rumours, fears of exclusion or 
neglect, lack of clarity in certain cases about what to do should cases be suspected in camps, restrictions on movement in and out of camps.
Based on a survey among 196 NGOs operating in Iraq, 93% of respondents said that their operations were affected by COVID-related 
restrictions on movement. 93% said they had suspended activities all together while 70% cited the inability to reach out-of-camp beneficiaries 
as an obstacle to implementing activities and 63% indicated that their activities have been impacted by a reduction in the ability of national 
staff to move.
Lack of awareness and information on COVID-19, misdiagnosis, poor referral systems or PHCCs in camps not permitted to transfer suspected 
cases out of the camps and the limited capacity of the public health system to receive cases from refugee and/or IDP camps is a serious 
concern. The restrictions of movement that staff are facing will impact their ability to access persons of concern and there is a risk that 
instances of refoulement, deportation and/or rise in discriminatory practices can begin to affect the displaced. Finally, if the banking system 
is affected this can limit their ability to pay staff, implementing partners and suppliers.

6 Source: Central Bank of Iraq; and Middle East Economic 
Survey (MEES) .On the demand side, 2019 was character -
ized by a consumption-led growth due to GoI’s fis -
cal expansion. Private and public consumption picked 
up in 2019 driven by a sizable expansion of public 
spending which included public sector wage bill and 
pension . Such an expansionary fiscal policy coupled 
with a low-inflation environment and a boost in income 
for agriculture sector workers, supported household 4 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)purchasing power and therefore increased private con -
sumption only to be partially offset in the last quarter of 
the year following the protests . Hence, private consump -
tion grew by 2 percent in 2019, from 0 .3 percent in 2018 
(Figure 5) . This also increased imports of goods to about 
43 percent of GDP in 2019, up from 38 percent in 2018 .
Investment remained subdued amidst per -
sistent public investment management constraints 
and an unfavorable business environment. Despite 
an allocation of IQD33 trillion (12 percent of GDP) in 
the 2019 budget law, 74 percent of public investment 
was executed with most attributed to investments in the 
oil sector  . Limited absorptive capacity, inefficiencies in 
public investment management, and weak capacity at 
the governates’ level have contributed to such a poor 
outcome .7 Moreover, an unfavorable business environ -
ment, corruption, cumbersome bureaucracy, and an 
opaque regulatory environment,8 nearly halved foreign 
direct investment (FDI) to only US$2 .9 billion in 2019 
(1 .2 percent of GDP) (Figure 6) . 
Iraq’s (volatile) economy outperformed that 
of regional peers in 2019, but its population dy -
namics requires much higher growth to sustain 
the current level of welfare. Iraq’s growth has out -
performed the Middle East and North Africa’s (MENA) 
average growth of 0 . 1 percent (Figure 1) . With a fertility 
rate of 4 . 1 though, GDP has barely grown in per capita 
terms over the past few years (Figure 2) . For Iraq to 
reap its demographic dividend, it needs to consistently 
grow its non-oil economy at a much faster pace (since the oil economy is not labor intensive) . Only then would 
Iraq be able to close the gap with peers and more im -
portantly maintain a constant level of economic activ -
ity and welfare gains for its growing population .
The protests that started in October 2019 
and subsequent events linked to the COVID-19 
pandemic in early 2020 have dampened economic 
activity especially in the services sectors. Protests 
had a considerable impact on the services sector which 
decelerated by 0 .9 percent in Q4–19 (y/y) . Sectors that 
were mostly impacted were transport, trade, banking 
and tourism . Together they account for a sizeable 48 
percent of non-oil GDP  .9 These benefitted earlier in 
2019 from a stable security situation and a consump -
tion boost given fiscal loosening . The undesirable con -
ditions for services were exacerbated further in early 
2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic reached Iraq and 
strict containment measures were put in place includ -
ing curfews, limitations on inter-governorate move -
ment and closure of borders . One example is religious FIGURE 5 •  Private Consumption P icked U p in

all institutional constraints impeding the fast disbursement

2020 doing business ranking .
9 It also accounts for 17 percent of overall GDP  .5 RECENT  ECONOMIC AND POLICy DEVELOPMENTSsubstitute for declining gas imports from Iran . It also 
reflects growing domestic demand especially on 
subsidized gasoline and kerosene material, a subsidy 
that is not typically pro-poor and does not contribute to 
job creation . The significant turn in global oil demand 
since the start of the COVID-19 is taking a toll though 
on Iraq especially that China, one of the hardest 
hit countries, is the largest importer of Iraqi crude 
(28 percent of oil exports at end-2019) .11 As a result, 
Oil exports declined by over 4 percent in the Q1–
2020 (y/y), down to an average of 306 million barrel, 
compared to over 319 million barrels in 2018 (Figure 7) .
Softer global prices since August 2019 
have also slashed oil revenues. Iraqi crude was 
sold at an average price of US$61  .1 per barrel in 
2019 compared to US$65 .5 per barrel in 2018, 
bringing exports value down by 6 .2 percent (y/y) in 
2019 (Figure 8) . The Saudi-Russian price war over 
the extension of the OPEC+ agreement, as well as 
the outbreak of COVID-19 that weighed down on an 
already soft global demand for oil has exacerbated tourism which is concentrated in the southern governor -
ates and is often reported to be second largest source 
of revenues after oil . According to Najaf’s head of the 
association for hotels and restaurants, the city hosted 
more than 5,000 visitors per day  . Because of protests 
and now the corona virus, 300 of the city’s 350 hotels 
have closed with those who remained open seeing their 
occupancy rate drop to 10 percent .10
Oil and Gas Developments
While Iraq’s oil industry was largely unaffected by 
the demonstrations, the turn in global conditions 
following COVID-19 is taking a toll on production. 
On December 29th, the Ministry of Oil (MoO) confirmed 
that the Nasiriyah field in Dhi Qar province, which 
produces 80,000–85,000 barrel/day had been shut 
down after protesters blocked access to the site . The 
loss in production was compensated, however, by 
Basra fields . Aligned with OPEC+ quotas, Iraq’s oil 
production was up 5 percent (y/y) in 2019 reaching 
4 .8 million barrel per day (mbpd) . Crude oil exports 
remained stable though and reached 3 .5 mbpd (about 
74 percent of total production), up by only 1 percent 
from 2018 . This difference reflects primarily growing 
electricity generation and usage of domestic oil to FIGURE 7 •  The Collapse in Oil Prices

11 Bloomberg, March 2020 .6 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)the situation further  . As a result, Iraq’s crude oil export 
prices crashed to US$28 .4 per barrel in March 2020, 
bringing the average price for Q1–20 to US$47 dollar 
per barrel and slashing revenues by more than half . At 
this price, Iraq will face extreme difficulties in financing 
basic expenditures planned for 2020 .
Iraq continues to develop its oil and gas in-
dustry, despite challenges. With the spread of vio-
lence in early 2020 and later COVID-19, a number of 
foreign workers had left the oilfields and some oil firms 
have been working in less than maximum capacity  . 
This situation prompted once again the MoO to utilize 
spare capacity in other fields to replace lost produc-
tion . Further developments in oil and gas are planned 
though across the country  . This includes a US$203 .5 
million contract awarded to China National Petroleum 
Corporation in March 2020 to build a 155 million cfd 
sour gas treatment facility at Majnoon field,12 as well 
as the installment of an advanced system to detect 
leakages from pipelines carrying petroleum products 
with the objective of limiting smuggling . However, 
boosting oil and gas production requires significantly 
higher investment than the GoI can support with the 
present oil prices . Under these global conditions and 
given that Iraq exports 70 percent of its crude to Asia, 
the Basra Oil Company has proposed that all interna-
tional oil companies cut the budget of developing oil 
fields by 30 percent during the first half of 2020 . 
Public Finance
Iraq’s fiscal position deteriorated substantially as 
the GoI authorized additional non-discretionary 
spending, building further budget rigidities. The 
rapid expansion of the public wage bill, pensions and 
social assistance programs coupled with falling oil 
revenues has shrunk the 11 percent of GDP budget 
surplus in 2018 to 1  .3 percent of GDP in 2019 . MOF 
data shows a substantial 26 .4 percent (y/y) rise 
in recurrent spending following GoI’s decision to 
expand public employment, reduce the retirement’s 
age (see Box 2) and offer numerous cash transfers 
following the demonstrations of October  . As a result, 
the primary fiscal surplus shrunk from 12 percent of 
GDP (IQD32 .6 trillion) in 2018 to 2 .4 percent of GDP 
in 2019 (IQD6 .6 trillion) (Figure 9) .Fiscal loosening prioritized boosting con -
sumption at the expense of public investment and its 
ability to effectively respond to COVID-19 economic 
downturn . Iraq continues to allocate a significant por -
tion of the budget toward non-discretionary spending 
especially the wage bill and transfers . In 2019, recurrent 
spending accounted for over 77 percent of total budget, 
largely due to transfers hike and additional public sec -
tor hiring (Figure 10) . The public wage bill rose by over 
13 percent (y/y) in 2019 and now stands above that of 
the MENA region oil exporters and high income econ -
omies’ average (Figure 11) . Both goods and services, 
and transfers—namely pensions and Public Distribution 
System (PDS)—increased by 127 and 18 percent (y/y), 
respectively  . This leaves a small fraction of funding for 
much-needed public investment in infrastructure and 
human capital programs . It also erodes the fiscal buffers 
available to respond to the expected economic down -
turn in the aftermath of COVID-19 crisis . At this current 
rate, Iraq will require an oil price of US$76 per barrel to 
finance its recurrent spending for 2020 .
Public investment remains below the need-
ed levels to close the infrastructure gap notably 
those for public service delivery in times of cri-
sis like COVID-19. Investment spending increased 
by almost 77 percent (y/y) in 2019 . While this is an 
improvement, it represents only 8 .8 percent of GDP 
and falls short of the infrastructure needs of the coun-
try . Moreover, there is a persistent under-execution of 
the investment budget (Figure 12) with most of capi-
tal spending going towards the oil fields . For public in-
vestment related to non-oil sectors, execution stood at 
30 percent reaching only 2 percent of GDP  . This raise 
concerns over service delivery, rising infrastructure 
gap, and stalled reconstruction program . Such results 
not only put a drag on long-term sustainable growth 
but also increases social vulnerabilities especially in 
times where boosting human capital systems is es-
sential to manage the impact of COVID-19 .
Deteriorating domestic revenue mobiliza -
tion takes away one of the fiscal tools available for 
Iraq to face this unpresented multifaceted crisis. 
The Iraqi budget remains largely dependent on oil-
related receipts as they constitute 92 percent of total 
12 MEES, March 2020 .7 RECENT  ECONOMIC AND POLICy DEVELOPMENTSbudget revenues . The US$4 dollars drop in the aver -
age price of oil exports translated into a US$5 billion 
loss in oil revenues in 2019 . Furthermore, non-oil rev -
enues have been well below budgetary expectations 
and have declined by 24 percent (y/y) over the year  . 
The decline reflects problems in domestic revenues 
mobilization attributed to poor tax compliance and col -
lection efforts, expansion of customs exemptions, and 
low growth affecting income tax . At 3 percent of GDP, 
non-oil tax revenues in Iraq is one of the lowest in the 
world . Expanding domestic revenue mobilization will 
be key to reduce reliance on oil, create a more stable FIGURE 9 •  Fiscal Loosening Has Markedly

The favorable debt dynamics in 2019 
could be short-lived. The fiscal surplus and high 
nominal GDP growth lowered the public debt-to-
GDP-ratio to 44 .6 percent of GDP in 2019, a drop 
of 4 .7 percentage points of GDP (ppt) compared to 
2018 . External debt13 is the largest share of Iraq’s

risks manageable despite the country’s limited debt 
carrying capacity (Figure 14) . Interest payments are 
relatively small at 1  .1 percent of GDP in 2019 . The 
budget surplus of 2019 had helped contain financing 
needs at an estimated US$3 .5 billion (1  .5 percent of 
GDP) . Nevertheless, this improvement could be short-
lived as deteriorating fiscal conditions in 2020 have 
worsened both debt dynamics and financing needs 
(see outlook section for a detailed discussion) . 
External Sector
Less favorable terms of trade coupled with fiscal 
loosening have weakened Iraq’s external position. The current account balance (CAB) is expected to turn 
from a 2 .5 percent of GDP surplus in 2019 to 18 percent 
deficit by end 2020 (Figure 15) . This large swing is at -
tributed to two factors . First, the less favorable terms of 
trade where the collapse in international oil prices have 
already reduced Iraq oil exports value by 26 percent in 
Q1–20 (y/y) (Figure 16) . Second, to a loosening of the 
fiscal stance resulting in a notable rise in imported goods 
and services especially those conducted by the govern -
ment agencies . This weakens Iraq’s external position .
Worsening global and domestic conditions 
reduce external financing options, putting pres-
sure on Central Bank of Iraq’s (CBI) international 
reserves. The unfavorable business environment and 
weak execution of public investment through project BOX 2 •  Pensions and Social Insurance in Iraq
The contributory system in Iraq comprises two pension schemes covering public and private sector employees, both designed as 
pay-as-you-go, defined-benefit schemes. The public scheme is managed by the Ministry of Finance’s National Board of Pensions (NBP) and 
includes civil servants, security forces, and survivors of martyrs. The private scheme is managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs 
Pensions and Social Security Department (PSSD) and covers a small proportion of private sector employees. In addition to the two schemes, 
there are currently almost 1M people still receiving pension benefits from the general budget. They are mostly those who retire before 2006 
(when the current public pension scheme was created) or their beneficiaries. These payments are supposedly phasing-out.
While total spending on pensions is high (approx. 4.2 percent of GDP in 2019), the current scheme covers less than 48 percent of the 
total labor force, most of whom are in the public sector (around 3 million contributors). The private sector scheme has a limited number of 
contributors (only 4 percent of private sectors employees, or around 200,000 people out of the 5 million working in the private sector), and 
there are not yet any social insurance schemes for self-employed, part time or flexible workers.
In addition to low coverage, the system faces a number of financial/fiscal, economic, and social challenges: First, the schemes are financially 
unsustainable, given that revenues from contributions and investment returns will not be sufficient to cover pension spending. In fact, based 
on latest projections run by the World Bank, the public sector scheme is expected to reach deficit in 2025, therefore increasing reliance on the 
general budget and crowding-out resources for other relevant programs. Second, the current system produces considerable inequities, including 
those between private and public sector employees, the last ones being covered by a more generous scheme. The system also produces 
perverse incentives, including incentives for early retirement. Third, the current system does not provide adequate pensions. For instance, the 
pensions amount is not automatically indexed, which exposes beneficiaries to the risk of losing their purchase power due to inflation.
The current system is governed by Law 9/2014, a law that does not respect the good principles of pensions design. With the support of the 
World Bank, the NBP and PSSD worked on a new draft social insurance law, which would have introduced considerable improvements to 
the previous 2014 law. The new draft law was approved by the Iraq Council of Ministers in November 2016. However, the complex political 
economy for such reform hindered the passage of the new draft law, which is still pending approval of the Council of Representatives. 
Instead, the Government of Iraq introduced in November 2019 an amendment to Law 9/14 that would further compromise the financial 
sustainability and fairness of the pension system, as it entails generous increases of some benefits and does not address some of the 
above-referenced key design challenges of the pensions system.
The need to revamp the pension law in Iraq, which would now entail reversing some of the amendments introduced in 2019, is now more 
urgent than ever. Absence of reforms would entail a very large fiscal burden or a sharp cut in benefits in a few years. In addition to the 
existing challenges of the pension system, the current economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related expected 
worsening of labor market outcomes is likely to lead to a further deterioration of the pension system. Therefore, the introduction of short-term 
emergency measures to address the COVID-19 crisis, in combination of course with the adoption of appropriate long-term measures, will be 
critical to make the pension system sustainable as well as social and economic equitable.

finance are behind the poor performance of foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and official investments, 
the two main sources of external financing for Iraq . 
Combined, these inflows have dropped by 15 per -
cent in 2019 (y/y) .14 While the CAB surplus in 2019 
had boosted CBI’s foreign currency (FX) reserves to 
US$68 billion (covering 10 months of imports and 
1 .9 times short-term external debt), the trend has re-
versed in early 2020 as domestic and global condi-
tions rapidly deteriorated (Figure 17) . The weakened 
global demand for oil, the spread of COVID-19 and 
its implication on capital flows for emerging markets, 
the persistence of domestic and political turmoil as a 
push factor for investments, as well as worsening CAB 
already cut those reserves by US$9 billion in the first 
2-months of 2020 (lowering coverage for 5 .9 months 
of imports) (Figure 18) .
Monetary Policy and Prices
Inflation remains muted despite disruptions 
caused by the spread of COVID-19. The fiscal 
stimulus that boosted domestic demand combined 
with increased usage of more expensive private 
operators have put pressure on the prices of servic-
es such as education (up 9 .7 percent), recreation 
(up 5 percent) and health (up 2 .9 percent) in 2019 
(y/y) (Figure 20) . Nevertheless, inflationary pressures remain largely muted due to cheaper consumption 
goods . This follows a continued depreciation of both 
Turkish and Iranian currencies, the two main trading 
partners for Iraq . Items like food prices declined by 
an average of 0 . 1 percent during the year, while con-
sumer goods like “apparels” and “house supplies and 
appliances” prices dropped by an average of respec-
tively 0 .9 and 1 percent over the same period . These 
three items alone constitute on average 41 percent of 
the household’s total consumption basket . While the 
easing in prices was favorable to Iraqi consumers, es-
pecially the poor, calls from the impacted domestic 
producers pushed the GoI to raise tariffs and impose 
import bans on selected food items . Furthermore, the 
GoI seems to have succeeded in cracking down on 
illegal price hikes keeping prices in 2020 subdued de-
spite border closures following COVID-19 containment 
measures . As a result, headline and core inflation reg-
istered only 0 .5 and 1  .1 percent rise in January (y/y, 
latest data) (Figure 19) . 
Money supply increased, but private sec -
tor credit remains tepid. Broad money (M2) ex -
perienced rapid growth of almost 8 percent (y/y) 
in 2019 driven by the pickup in non-oil economic 
14 Latest available data are for 2019 . CBI data also reveals 
a contraction of 6 percent (y/y) for official investment .FIGURE 14 •  Sixty Six Percent of that Stock Is

activity (Figure 21)  . Credit to the private sector, 
on the other hand, remains constrained in part by 
weak banking sector that tend to cater primarily 
to large and inefficient State-Owned Enterprises 
(SOEs), and in other part by increased borrowing 
by the public sector  . Indeed, credit to public sec -
tor was up 6 percent (y/y) in 2019 compared to 3 
percent for that of the private sector (Figure 22)  . 
Credit to the private sector is at 8 percent of GDP, 
well below that of MENA average (57 percent) and 
Upper Middle-Income countries (123 percent)  . This reflects in part deficiencies in financial architecture 
including legal and institutional frameworks and 
credit information  . 
The CBI has taken multiple measures to 
mitigate the impact of the crisis on households 
and businesses, but a larger stimulus package is 
still needed to re-start the economy. To participate 
in the fight against COVID-19, the CBI has hosted 
donation accounts dedicated for healthcare spend-
ing and donated itself IQD30 billion (roughly US$26 
million) . The CBI has also issued instructions on new FIGURE 17 •  The D ecline in O il Prices D ue to

operational modalities for banks to serve clients un-
der the CODID19-imposed curfew and resumed its 
services for all payment systems and the investment 
window on daily basis . The CBI has also decided to re-
sume external transfers functions through the special-
ized window to meet the requests of both citizens and 
GoI as well as appease the financial burden on Iraqis 
stranded abroad after the shut-down of airports . To 
boost liquidity in the market and support households 
and SMEs alike, the CBI has applied a three months 
moratorium on interest and principal repayments for both consumer and SMEs loans, suspended all fines 
imposed on commercial banks, and enhanced banks’ 
cash liquidity by an amount of IQD1 trillion . It also sus-
pended vendors commissions on electronic payment 
tools for a period of six months and reduced reserves 
requirement of banks to 13 percent over the same 
period . While these measures are a step in the right 
direction to soften the impact of some aspects of the 
crisis, a larger stimulus package will be needed to re-
start the economy and allow businesses to resume 
operations .12 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)Iraq continues to face structural challenges, 
and suffers from limited financial intermediation, 
which constrains lending to SMEs. Iraq ranks 
186 out of 190 in terms of ease of getting credit on 
the World Bank’s 2020 Doing Business report . The 
banking system is dominated by under-capitalized 
and under-provisioned state-owned banks (SOBs) 
primarily used for quasi fiscal operations (NPLs stand 
at an estimated 37+ percent) . Most private banks are 
small in size, lack credit risks analysis skills, and rely 
on currency arbitrage as their main revenue source 
as well as limited fee-based exchange services than 
lending . As a result, credit intermediation is at a very 
low level . The non-banking financial sector is also 
at an early stage of development . The number of 
functioning Micro-Financing Institutions (MFIs) has 
declined over the last 3 years, leaving only three MFIs 
operating in the microfinance sector  . Combined these 
MFIs have outstanding portfolio of US$110 million and 
63,530 active borrowers .15 With 7  .36 million poor (22 .5 
percent of population), out of which 2 .5 million are 
economically active (8 percent of population), MFIs 
likely fulfill only a small fraction of potential demand . 
Despite this situation, the CBI has put in place a US$5 
billion line of credit extended to SOBs for on-lending 
to SME’s, agriculture and or infrastructure projects . 
Nevertheless, fewer than 5 percent of SMEs in the 
formal sector have received bank loans .
Business Environment and Private 
Sector Development
Iraq’s unfavorable business environment con -
strains private sector activity. In the World Bank Do -
ing Business 2020, Iraq ranks 172 out of 190 countries, 
one position down from the previous year  . It is also one 
of the lowest ranking amongst the MENA region and 
Upper Middle-Income Countries (UMIC) peers . While 
it ranks relatively favorably on some topics such as 
dealing with construction permits (103) and protecting 
minority investors (111) indicators, it fares particularly 
poorly on getting credit (186), trading across borders 
(181), and resolving insolvency (168) (Figure 23) . No -
table progress has been made on electricity access, 
with improved production, and in making starting a 
business easier by streamlining some procedures .Conflict and limited investment resulted in 
a deteriorating quality of logistics, which is a key 
component to reduce the costs of doing business 
in Iraq.  The World Bank Logistics Performance Index 
(LPI) 2018 shows Iraq lagging the region and other 
UMIC in trade logistics efficiency  . It stands at 147th 
out of 160 countries  . This situation implies high 
operational cost, a colossal deficit in infrastructure, 
and rising pressure on service delivery  . (Figure 24)  .

Outlook
The economic outlook for Iraq has markedly 
worsened especially amidst a collapse in interna-
tional oil prices. Since the last Iraq Economic Moni-
tor published in October 2019, the country has suf-
fered from a protracted social and political turmoil, a 
collapse in international oil prices, and the outbreak 
of COVID-19 . All have tilted the economy’s outlook 
downward . As a result, GDP growth is now projected 
to contract by 9 .7 percent in 2020, making it the coun-
try’s worst annual performance since the fall of the 
Saddam regime in 2003 . Growth is projected to return 
in subsequent years, partly due to a low-base effect, 
to 1 .9 and 7  .3 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively  . 
Under the new OPEC+ agreement reached on April 9; 
Iraq’s oil production is expected to be reduced from 
4 .8 mbpd in 2019 to 4 mbpd in 2020 . As a result, the 
oil sector’s is projected to contract by 13 percent in 
2020 amidst a markedly worsened outlook for in-
ternational oil markets . Both prices and exports are 
expected to be significantly lower given lower global 
demand and a projected recession worldwide as CO-
VID-19 containment measures are extended . Since oil 
represents 67 percent of the overall economy,16 Iraq 
is highly susceptible to its variations . The report es-
timates that every dollar increase in international oil 
prices could bring up to 0 . 14 ppt of additional growth 
in Iraq . As such, any development that increases oil 
prices will improve the growth outlook  .
The non-oil economy is also expected to be 
hit by the multitude of crises. The non-oil economy 
represents slightly more than a third of the Iraqi real 
economy  . The persistence of strict containment 
measures to manage the COVID-19 spread, including 
mandatory lockdown, curfew as well as closure of 
airport and government facilities, will lead to closure 
of businesses and reduced domestic demand as 
household suffer from labor income shock  . As a 
result, the services sectors, such as trade, transport, 
financial sector, religious tourism and others will 
continue to be the hardest hit . Furthermore, the 
precarious fiscal position of Iraq will limit the ability 
of the GoI to introduce a fiscal stimulus package that will weather the shock on the private sector  . It 
will also force the government to scale back public 
investments on key basic services, making the 
situation worse . Overall, this is projected to lead to a 
contraction of non-oil GDP by 4 .4 percent in 2020 . As 
conditions gradually ease over the near-term, and in 
the absence of structural reforms, non-oil economic 
activity is expected to slightly rebound to an average 
of 4 percent over 2021–2022 .
Iraq’s fiscal loosening is unsustainable 
going forward and risks critical funding on public 
investments. Iraq’s build-up of non-discretionary 
spending throughout the past years and the absence 
of measures to boost domestic revenue mobilization 
has increased reliance on oil revenues windfalls, 
leading to an unsustainable fiscal position in 2020 
and beyond . Indeed, the stimulus package that was 
introduced late 2019 coupled with weaker oil prices 
are projected to have detrimental fiscal effects . If oil 
prices remain in the low-US$30s per barrel and in 
the absence of any measures that will curb the public 
wage bill and pensions, the budget deficit for 2020 is 
projected to exceed 29 percent of GDP  . To showcase 
the severity of the fiscal situation, Iraq would need 
at least a US$58/barrel oil price to meet its wage 
and pension obligations alone .17 Unless there is a 
significant reorientation in fiscal policy in the delayed 
2020 budget law to tackle spending rigidities and 
domestic revenue mobilization, there will be limited 
fiscal space to finance COVID-19 response, invest 
in human capital and long-term development as 
well as financing post-war reconstruction . Moreover, 
investments in the development of oil and gas fields 
could also be at risk as government will be forced to 
undertake public investment cuts .
Securing budget financing will be challeng -
ing in the absence of a fiscal consolidation plan. 
Deteriorating fiscal conditions coupled with debt 
amortization, especially the rollover of domestic trea -
sury bills, worsen debt dynamics (Table 1) and signal 
that Iraq’s gross financing needs may reach US$67 
billion (over 39 percent of GDP) in 2020 . External

to the pension law introduced last October  .14 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)BOX 3 • COVId-19 Impact on Poverty in Iraq

government’s transmission control policies are likely to affect Iraqi households’ livelihoods and welfare through multiple channels. First, the 
need to attend sick family members or to recover from the illness and the sharp decline in economic activities will reduce households’ labor 
earnings from wages and self-employment. Second, the economic slowdown will reduce domestic and international remittances, impacting 
households’ non-labor income. In addition, fiscal pressures due to significantly lower oil prices could affect food (Public Distribution System 
– PDS) and public cash transfers. Third, disruption in domestic and international supply chains may increase prices, particularly for food, 
while reduced access to education, healthcare, transport and other services will also significantly impact the welfare of the Iraqis. These 
short and medium-term effects can have lasting impacts on economic growth, intergenerational mobility and the ability to escape poverty 
or remain above it.
We assess impacts of the crises on poverty in Iraq using the 2017–18 Rapid Welfare Monitoring Survey (SWIFT) and micro- simulations. 
The analysis focuses losses in labor income and food price increases as the most likely channels. We assume no change in PDS 
transfers.a
The analysis examines a 20 percent increase in food prices with the value of PDS held constant. We also use the employment status of the 
household head to classify households into five categories: self-employed in rural areas; self-employed in urban areas; public sector; private 
sector; and not working. Under a “moderate-low” scenario, employees in the public sector and self-employed in rural areas are assumed to 
maintain full incomes while employees in all the other sectors are assumed to lose 20 percent of pre-crisis income. The ”moderate-high” 
scenario is same except public sector employees also lose income by 20 percent due fiscal pressures from much lower oil prices. Results are 
presented in Figure a. Under the moderate-low scenario poverty in Iraq would increase by 14.4 percentage points, and by 18.7 points under 
the moderate-high scenario, a near doubling of national poverty. These impacts vary across regions. The impact is highest in northern and 
central Iraq where there are many households living just above the poverty line. In Kurdistan, low initial poverty rates mean fewer vulnerable 
households while in the south higher initial poverty rates mean many vulnerable households are already poor.
This initial analysis assumes only moderate economic impacts. However, employment-related income losses could be significantly higher. At 
the same time, household resilience has been tested by years of conflict and displacement. High numbers of displaced, a lack of economic 
opportunities, political turmoil and fiscal pressures had already left many vulnerable before the start of the current pandemic. Many 
households are may lose all their incomes, especially those in the informal private sector. The longer the crisis continues, the more any 
savings or coping mechanisms will be exhausted. In the absence of a significant government response, it is possible that over half of the 
population could fall into poverty.
a The microsimulation employed is a partial equilibrium analysis and does not account for behavioral responses. A one-to-one income to consumption adjustment is assumed. 
Household expenditure is used as the measure of welfare, in line with national poverty estimates, and household welfare is nowcasted based on macroeconomic outcomes to 
create a current baseline for the simulation.FIGURE A  • Impacts of T win C rises on P overty

from emerging markets . This means global market 
conditions are unfavorable for Eurobond issuances 
or other commercial debt, and project financing 
is expected to decline especially with cuts to pub -
lic investment . As a result, financing is expected to 
be originated from domestic sources primarily  . This 
comes with several risks . Over-reliance on local mar -
kets for financing the budget increases the cost of 
debt service and repayment risks given that domestic 
debt is more expensive and mostly short-term . They 
also increase liquidity risks as they would crowd-out 
private sector credit . The report projects a financing 
gap that could reach up to US$54 billion in 2020 
under the current oil price assumption (US$30 per 
barrel) . In the absence of any adjustment, monetizing 
the deficit through CBI could be the only government 
recourse . Doing so weakens the CBI’s balance sheet 
and creates pressures on the exchange rate and 
inflation . Large financing needs are also projected 
to persist in 2021 and 2022,18 raising sustainability 
questions over the current fiscal policy trend .
Iraq is also expected to face a persistent 
current account deficit driven mainly by lower oil 
prices and rigid imports structure. Amidst a negative 
global outlook for the oil market, the twin deficits in Iraq 
are projected to lead to a protracted current account 
deficit (Table 1  .) . This is expected to be financed 
partially from CBI foreign currency reserves, increasing 
the country vulnerability to external shocks during the 
forecast period as those reserves drop below 3 months 
of imports by 2022 . Iraq could increase oil production 
and not abide by the new OPEC+ agreement, to 
mitigate the widening of the deficit, albeit at the risk of 
further reducing oil prices .
Risks
Prolonging fiscal loosening policies pose signifi-
cant risks . In the absence of consolidation, the fiscal 
and external positions will sharply deteriorate as oper -
ational expenditures remain at an unsustainable pace, 
and uncertainty surrounding oil markets prospects mounts . These imbalances will further constrain fiscal 
space critically needed for non-oil investment, limit the 
government’s ability to use discretionary fiscal policy, 
and if left unaddressed, will raise concerns about 
the sustainability of policies . Further deterioration of 
the fiscal position arising from the revenue shortfalls 
and high fiscal deficit would further crowd out private 
sector credit, push public debt to unsustainable lev -
els, and thus increases the risk of spending arrears 
re-emergence .
Downside risks could worsen macro-
financial dynamics . If oil prices decline further which, 
particularly if combined with further delays in fiscal 
adjustment, Iraq could also be faced with a tradeoff of 
issuing more domestic debt or drawing down external 
buffers at the risk of affecting domestic liquidity and 
reduce investor confidence . This situation could also 
entail pressures on the exchange rate peg, sovereign 
rating downgrades, higher financing costs, and 
thereby hindering growth prospects .
The outlook is also subject to significant 
political and social risks . Lower oil prices may 
force GoI to consider austerity measures, a move 
that could spark more social unrest with already poor 
public services and high unemployment . This would 
subside the non-oil growth prospects and further 
limit long-awaited reforms and negatively affect 
confidence and economic prospects . The country’s 
weak healthcare system and close relations with Iran 
will make Iraq’s ability to respond to COVID-19 crisis 
more challenging .
18 The report projects budget financing needs to reach 
55 and 51 billion respectively in 2021 and 2022 . This is 
equivalent to 26 .7 percent of GDP in each year  .16 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)TABLE 1 • Iraq: Selected Economic and Financial Indicators, 2017–2022

LAYING THE FOUNDATION 
FOR A NEW ECONOMY 
IN IRAQ: DIGITAL 
TRANSFORMATION
Introduction
This special focus of the digital economy (DE) 
highlights and explains the importance of digital 
transformation for Iraq and why this transformation 
needs to happen now. Iraq’s economic condition 
was gradually improving following the deep economic 
strains of the last three years . However, the recent 
unrest highlights the continued fragility of the country 
context and the high priority of improving economic 
opportunities, particularly for youth . Leveraging the 
DE will help Iraq address its citizens’ concerns as well 
as accelerate the achievement of its development 
objectives .
The paper will cover five foundational, 
interconnected elements of a DE as defined by the 
World Bank Group’s (WBG) DE framework,19 which 
are: 1) Digital Infrastructure: The wide availability 
of affordable and quality Internet will be instrumental to bringing more people and businesses online . 
2) Digital Financial Services (DFS): The ability to 
pay, save, borrow, and invest through diverse digital 
financial tools is crucial for financial inclusion, for the 
growth of the e-commerce market, or for the transition 
of Iraq to a cashless economy  . 3) Digital Platforms: 
The presence and use of digital platforms that can 
support greater digital exchange and transactions, 
as well as boost online access to public services 
will simplify civic functions and national ID systems . 
4) Digital Skills: The development of a tech-savvy 
workforce that possesses the digital skills necessary 
for the jobs of the future as firms shift to increased 
technology adoption and innovation . 5) Digital 
Entrepreneurship: Critical to the widening and 
deepening of a digital economic transformation is the 
19  World Bank Digital Economy Diagnostic Framework  .20 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)presence of an ecosystem with high-quality support 
to entrepreneurs, startups and bigger companies to 
generate new products and services that leverage 
new technologies and business models .
The report provides an overview of each 
foundational element, highlighting strengths and 
weaknesses and proposing illustrative policy 
recommendations for the Government of Iraq 
(GOI). It also examines where the country is today and 
sheds light on where it should be, given the imperative 
to catch up with Iraq’s peer countries and the need 
to address structural challenges facing the economy  .
Digital transformation is reshaping the 
global economy, permeating every sector and 
aspect of daily life—changing the way we learn, 
work, trade, socialize, and access information 
and services. In 2016, the global DE was worth some 
$11 .5 trillion—equivalent to 15 .5 percent of the world’s 
overall GDP  . This is expected to reach 25 percent 
in less than a decade, outpacing global economic 
growth . However, countries such as Iraq are capturing 
a mere fraction of this growth and need to invest 
strategically in the foundational elements of their DE 
to keep pace .
There are signs of a nascent DE in Iraq but 
taking these promising developments to the next 
level will require important policy decisions and 
well-developed action and implementation plans. 
The challenges and opportunities presented by the 
DE should be accessible to the general public via 
clear and simple analyses that can be understood by 
a variety of audiences . This special focus is an attempt 
to make the Iraqi public aware of the importance of 
such policies and the role of government in proposing 
and implementing this agenda .
The Importance of the Digital 
Economy
Universal adoption and effective application of 
digital technology is expected to characterize 
economies of the future. It will shape their ability to 
succeed in the global marketplace and offer a better 
quality of life for their citizens . Well-functioning digital 
economies are expected to achieve faster economic 
growth, offer innovative products and services, and create additional job opportunities . Assessing where 
strategic investments and interventions need to be 
made is a critical first step to enabling DE growth .
While digital technologies are spreading, 
digital dividends and inclusion—the broader de-
velopment benefits from using these technolo-
gies, are not. Over 60 percent of the world’s popula-
tion remains offline and cannot participate in the DE . 
Digital divides persist across gender, geography, age, 
and income level . Many advanced economies are fac-
ing polarizing labor markets and rising inequality be-
cause technology augments higher skills while replac-
ing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for 
low-paying jobs .
The development of an enabling DE 
needs to be broader than the creation of an ICT 
strategy. Connectivity for all remains an important 
goal and a tremendous challenge, but attention must 
also be paid to regulations, skills, and governance . 
Digital investments need the support of regulations, 
improved skills, and accountable institutions . Digital 
technologies can, in turn, augment and strengthen 
these complements, and accelerate the pace of 
development .20
In Iraq, building a vibrant DE is a critical 
step on the path to economic diversification and 
sustainable progress. As discussed previously, 
Iraq needs to lessen its oil reliance . Other countries 
in the Gulf and North Africa are moving towards a 
digitally enabled economy, and Iraq runs the risk of 
being “left behind” if the necessary interventions are 
not made, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 
health crisis . Diversification of the economy 
can build on Iraq’s comparative strengths and 
demographics to foster the development of digitally 
enabled sectors and industries, such as connectivity, 
trade-in services, and construction . It can also help 
strengthen the Iraqi government, as an institution, 
by digitizing critical civic functions in order to better 
serve the Iraqi population .
Poor governance has transformed Iraq’s 
strengths—oil wealth and diversity—into twin liabil-
ities of oil dependence and ethnic and sectarian 
20 World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends, 
World Bank  .21 LAyING THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ECONOMy IN IRAQ: DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATIONfragmentation.21 Iraq’s institutions have been se-
verely debilitated by decades of wars, sanctions, and 
conflict . Poor governance has contributed to under -
mining the state’s legitimacy, leading to political and 
sectarian divides resulting in further weakening of an 
already fragile governance system .22 Incorporating 
digital technologies and platforms, coupled with oth-
er measures such as providing public officials with 
incentives to effectively use technology,23 can help 
increase transparency and rebuild trust between the 
GoI and its citizens .
The development of an enabling DE needs 
to be broader than the creation of an ICT strategy. 
Connectivity for all remains an important goal and a 
tremendous challenge, but attention must also be 
paid to regulations, skills, and governance . Digital in-
vestments need the support of regulations, improved 
skills, and accountable institutions . Digital technolo-
gies can, in turn, augment and strengthen these com-
plements, the pace of development .
The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to 
further exacerbate some of the challenges faced 
by Iraq. Unemployment is likely to rise as businesses 
shut down either because of preventive measures 
enforced by the GoI (or because of a loss in demand 
for goods and services . Low-productivity and informal 
workers will be at high risk of falling into deep poverty, 
further complicating Iraq’s reconstruction efforts . It 
is expected that corporations and public offices will 
shift to home-based work and the GoI will need to rely 
on digital technologies to ensure that public services, 
businesses, and individuals are able to withstand 
“social distancing”, ensure business continuity, and prevent service interruptions . Thus, critical DE reforms 
are now a prerequisite for ensuring Iraq’s survival 
during this global health crisis .
Current State of Iraq’s Digital 
Economy
Digital Infrastructure
Digital infrastructure refers to the availability, 
quality, and affordability of high-speed Internet. 
It also serves as the backbone of the DE . Countries 
are unable to realize the full potential of digital 
transformation without reliable and affordable 
connectivity, so the latter is a highly critical prerequisite 
for Iraq’s DE to thrive . Once it is deployed, the five 
foundational elements can benefit from mutual 
synergies . Infrastructure that provides reliable and 
fast Internet access is needed for entrepreneurs to 
create value, students to build their skills, and the 
government to improve service delivery platforms .
High speed connectivity increases output 
and productivity in other sectors and enables 
a more competitive economy overall. Evidence 
from several global studies indicates that broadband 
penetration enhances economic growth, with the

The COVID-19 health crisis further highlights how technology plays an increasingly important role in adapting to the new reality of life 
during a pandemic. In fact, this health crisis proves that broadband is no longer a luxury but a necessity.
Innovative technological solutions are being deployed in (1) telemedicine and health—including for prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, 
(2) accommodating an isolated work environment as the public and private sector shifts to home-based work, (3) managing global 
supply-chains and logistics—especially for hard to reach populations and regions, (4) increasing use of digital financial services and 
decreasing reliance on cash, (5) delivering educational content to primary, secondary, and tertiary students through virtual classrooms, to 
name a few.
In the era of “social distancing”, individuals will increasingly rely on mobile apps, online platforms, and the Internet to receive basic supplies 
and perform other day-to-day transactions such as banking, paying taxes, or even to receive social welfare payments and/or receive stimulus 
payments from the government.22 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)impact estimated to be, on average, around 0 .85 to 
1 .16 percent increase in GDP for every 10 percent 
increase in Internet penetration .24 The impact in 
the Iraqi context could be even greater, since there 
are opportunities for Iraq to adopt “leapfrogging” 
technologies when broadband access is coupled 
with interventions that promote digital skills and 
entrepreneurship . In Iraq, broadband demand has 
long since outstripped its supply, indicating a need 
to improve infrastructure to meet the demands of 
consumers and grow the other elements of the DE . 
As a result, interventions must focus on each of 
these elements, though a fundamental prerequisite is 
infrastructure .
Challenges & Opportunities
Digital infrastructure can accelerate Iraq’s 
economic recovery through several channels:
• Investing in digital infrastructure deployment 
creates immediate opportunities to boost 
employment. Evidence further suggests that 
for every job created in broadband infrastructure 
deployment, between 1  .83 and 3 .42 additional 
jobs are indirectly added or induced in the 
economy—higher than most other infrastructure 
investments .25 Though employment generation 
alone is generally not considered sufficient 
rationale to undertake an infrastructure project, 
such projects can improve quality of life for Iraqis 
in a holistic manner  .
• Access to digital infrastructure augments 
trade and economic diversification . Economic 
diversification away from oil is a key priority for 
Iraq, and there is evidence that improving Internet 
penetration in developing countries will promote 
service industries and increase exports .26
• Increasing Internet penetration is associated 
with higher private-sector productivity, which is 
of immense importance in the context of Iraq. 
Research indicates that firms that adopt digital 
technologies are 26 percent more profitable than 
their competitors who do not . The development of 
digital infrastructure is thus a vital intervention for 
Iraq to strengthen its economic competitiveness .
• Improving and facilitating service delivery, 
including to refugees and host communities. Digital infrastructure enables important services 
such as e-health, e-education, energy payments, 
and financial inclusion, among others .27 These 
avenues also improve transparency and public 
engagement and can help rebuild public trust in 
the government .
Comparison with Other Countries; Iraq’s 
Potential
The difference between the adoption levels of fixed 
and mobile broadband is flagrant in Iraq as much as 
it is in other countries in the MENA region. Lebanon 
and Jordan are leaders in the use and adoption of 
fixed and mobile broadband services, and Iran has a 
comparatively high broadband penetration rate . Yet 
overall, a considerable gap remains in the adoption, 
speed, usage and affordability of fixed broadband 
services between Iraq and the MENA region, as well 
as between Iraq and emerging economies such as 
Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria—countries that compare 
positively in terms of DE development .
Several institutional and regulatory hurdles 
have constrained broadband Internet adoption 
and the DE at large. The telecommunications sector 
falls under the purview of Ministry of Communications 
and the Communications and Media Commission 
(CMC), which have conflicting and insufficiently 
defined roles . This can be traced to the absence of 
a comprehensive telecommunications law  . The CMC 
itself was founded in 2004 by an order of the Coalition 
Provisional Authority (CPA) following the war, and 
subsequent Iraqi governments have not been able to 
pass a thorough telecommunications law since then .
Due to these institutional shortcomings 
and to the damage caused by extended conflict, 
Iraq’s fixed broadband market has not reached its

27 Mashreq 2 .0 .23 LAyING THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ECONOMy IN IRAQ: DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATIONpotential. Fixed broadband penetration stands only 
at 17 .4 percent . As a step in the right direction, the GOI 
has since 2014 prioritized the deployment of fiber-to-
the-home (FTTH) in certain urban centers such as 
Baghdad . However, this initiative is being rolled out 
on a limited, ad hoc basis and has yet to create any 
sweeping impact .28 Moreover, , telecom networks—
especially in the densely populated capital—have 
been under an unusual amount of stress due to violent 
conflict, including competition from illegal operators 
and prevailing signal jammers,29 severely impacting 
the quality of broadband service for Baghdadis .30
Despite these adversities, Iraq’s mobile 
broadband sector is among the most competitive 
in the MENA region. There are three main licensed 
mobile operators in Iraq: Zain Iraq (42 .4 percent 
market share), Asiacell (37  .4 percent market share), 
and Korek Telecom (20 .2 percent market share) .31 
Though mobile penetration is high (near 100 percent, 
indicating that many SIM cards are sold and used), 
mobile broadband penetration is much more modest 
(19 percent of the population) .32 Moreover, all three 
major operators offer only Global System for Mobile 
Communications (GSM) and 3G connectivity  . The only 
provider of 4G services is Fastlink, which operates 
exclusively in the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi 
Kurdistan . Iraq’s mobile market has shown further 
interest from the private sector, and Iraq’s cabinet 
approved plans to relaunch attempts to auction a 
fourth mobile license, after its previous attempt in late 
2015 stalled due to political instability and conflict .
Releasing and allocating 4G frequencies 
is essential for digital services in Iraq to take 
off and meet the aspirations of the citizens and 
effect economic development. Many countries 
worldwide—including Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) nations—are already testing 5G technologies 
that enable faster speeds, better quality, and a whole 
new range of applications that connect devices and 
systems at a large scale . In an effort to “catchup” 
through the allocation of 4G frequencies, mobile 
operators would be able to upgrade their networks 
and provide faster, more reliable, and higher-quality 
mobile broadband services .
There is a gap between basic mobile adoption 
and mobile broadband adoption in Iraq (Figure 25 . Penetration of mobile and mobile broadband services 
(per 100 inhabitants)) . The stark gap between 
basic mobile penetration and mobile broadband 
penetration is a commonality in countries that have 
faced prolonged conflict, such as Djibouti and Syria . 
However, the market in Iraq is competitive and would 
leapfrog much faster than those comparator countries 
if the right policies and reforms were put in place to 
allow mobile operators to invest in new technologies 
in a regulated environment .
Iraq’s location at the crossroads of the 
highest-growth segment of global data connec -
tivity—the Europe-Asia Internet traffic route—of -
fers an opportunity for Iraq to develop a regional 
data hub. International connectivity will link Iraq to the 
worldwide Internet infrastructure . In most countries, in -

percentage provided through terrestrial fiber, micro -

tive routes are rising in importance and demand, since 
any interruption in international connectivity inflicts 
considerable costs on affected countries and the 
world economy at large . The strategic position of Iraq 
stems from its connection to the submarine cables at 
Al Faw at the Persian Sea and its borders with Turkey, 
Syria, Jordan, and Iran, allowing it to provide alterna -
tive terrestrial connectivity from the Persian Sea Ito 
Europe . International connectivity is owned and man -
aged by the Ministry of Communications through the 
Iraq Telecommunications and Post Company (ITPC), 
which has yet to expand international connectivity and 
take full advantage of the competitive edge that Iraq’s 
geographic position entails .
Digital Financial Services (DFS)
A robust cashless payments ecosystem is a 
critical pillar of any DE. DFS refers to transitioning 
to a cashless economy  . DFS is an important avenue 
for the transactions and payments of goods and 
services between users, and between citizens 
and governments . While payments in Iraq are still 
mostly made in cash, the growth of digital payment 
methods has been exceptional . The share of the adult 
population that has made at least one digital payment 
a year nearly quadrupled between 2014 and 2017 and 
reached 19 percent in 2019 . However, growth can only 
be sustained if Iraq supports it with the necessary 
infrastructural investments and regulatory reforms .
The GOI has pledged its support for a 
cashless economy. It committed to establishing a 
conducive regulatory and policy framework for digital 
payments, investing in an interoperable infrastructure, 
and striving towards universal financial access .
Challenges & Opportunities
The Iraqi National Payment System faces multiple 
challenges. Infrastructure—including electricity 
provision and network connectivity—is not always 
reliable, hampering access to digital payments . This 
problem is compounded by a human resources crisis, 
with many qualified Iraqis having immigrated abroad and specialist engineering or analytics vacancies 
remaining unfilled . This gap affects the GoI’s ability 
to implement, manage, and oversee the regulation of 
digital financial transactions . The economy is cash-
based as a result of the most recent conflict, and the 
financial system and its institutions enjoy little trust .
Despite the above, Iraq has in recent years 
made considerable progress toward developing its 
payment systems, but gaps remain. With assistance 
from USAID, as well as strong commitment from the 
CBI and the GoI, the Iraqi National Payment System 
Strategy (NPS),33 discussed below, was developed to 
help Iraq transition toward a cashless system .34
A clear regulatory framework is also criti-
cal to attracting private sector and telco partici-
pation. To that end, the CBI has enhanced the legal, 
regulatory, and oversight framework, but several gaps 
remain, notably the lack of a statutory law that covers 
all payment and settlement systems topics in a holistic 
manner, as well as the lack of an articulated oversight 
framework and the necessary oversight tools . The GoI 
is at the final stages of passing its NPS Act that will 
establish firm legal foundations for payment and set-
tlement systems . Other secondary legislation, specifi-
cally CBI regulations, must also be reviewed to ensure 
compliance with the new law  .
Comparison with Other Countries: Iraq’s 
Potential
Despite efforts by the GoI, Iraq trails its MENA peers 
on most cashless economy indicators. Consequent -
ly, the most important task of all NPS stakeholders is to 
restore trust in the system . Iraqis must feel with certainty 
that money held in their bank accounts is as safe as 
33 The NPS Strategy is intended to guide the CBI in its 
role as regulator, overseer, operator and catalyst of the 
National Payments System .
34 In technical terms, this includes: a real time gross settlement 
(RTGS) system; Cheque enabled Automated Clearing 
House (CACH) for clearing and settlement of cheques in 
truncation mode; the Government Securities Registration 
System (GSRS)—a Central Securities Depository (CSD) 
and Securities Settlement System (SSS) for Central Bank 
and Government securities; and Retail Payments Systems 
Infrastructure (RPSI), an integrated card, mobile payments, 
and electronic funds transfer system .25 LAyING THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ECONOMy IN IRAQ: DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATIONthat stored in banknotes, and that electronic payment 
instruments are as reliable as cash payments . Some of 
the required actions, such as setting up an effective de -
posit insurance scheme, lie beyond the scope of NPS 
regulations and oversight, and should be taken up by 
other parts of the CBI . Nonetheless, there are many 
other improvements that can be affected with relatively 
little cost, such as the establishment of a consumer 
protection framework and improved monitoring of the 
operational reliability of payment systems’ participants .
Iraq has set ambitious targets in its NPS 
Strategy to catch up in the next five years on deb-
it card ownership, cashless transactions, mobile 
money and electronic payments. The NPS Strategy 
for Iraq aims to guide a range of diverse stakeholders 
in their actions and goals to develop payment systems, 
instruments, and regulations . The stakeholders range 
from the CBI to commercial banks, government agen-
cies, non-bank e-money issuers, telecommunications 
and technology companies, as well as the end users 
of payment products: Iraqi citizens and businesses .
A recent positive development is the 
issuance of e-Wallets: the GoI through the CBI has 
licensed two Payment System Providers (PSPs) to 
deliver this service . In addition, as part of its COVID-19 
initiatives, CBI facilitated the process for Iraqi citizens 
to open e-wallets from their homes through a simplified 
e-KYC35 process using only their IDs . The GoI is 
currently running a campaign to promote the usage 
of cashless and contactless payments solutions (i .e . 
e-wallets/ POS/ POC and ATM’s) through the launch 
of the e-wallet scheme, the issuance of a promotional 
public information campaign including video etc .
Digital Platforms
Digital Platforms is a broad category that ex-
plores two main types of platforms: public-sector 
platforms and private-sector platforms. Digital plat-
forms help governments streamline civic functions 
such as filing taxes online and starting a business . For 
domestic firms, platforms provide stronger productiv -
ity and innovation through competition in the global 
digital market . Public-sector digital platforms include 
e-government services such as e-procurement and 
national ID systems that enable citizens to access social services . Private-sector digital platforms in-
cludes DFS and e-commerce .
Digital services also have the potential to 
increase inclusiveness and transparency. The 
automation of business processes and improved 
monitoring can reduce bureaucratic discretion and 
opportunities for petty corruption . Frontier technologies 
such as blockchain for e-governance can also be 
deployed to improve accessibility to critical services 
such as digitally enabled healthcare and education to 
improve social welfare outcomes .
The use of technology in governments 
tends to be successful when it addresses straight-
forward information and monitoring problems. 
For more demanding challenges, such as better man-
agement of providers or giving citizens greater voice, 
technology helps only when governments are already 
responsive . Closing the gap between evolving tech-
nology and bureaucratic institutions requires initia-
tives that strengthen the transparency and account-
ability of governments .36
In the context of Iraq, critical digital 
platforms include:
• An e-Government platform that simplifies 
administrative processes while eliminating 
administrative corruption and red tape . This 
includes online business registration with an 
online payments function . Iraq currently ranks 
172 out of 190 overall on the 2020 Doing Business 
Ranking and 154 for starting a business .
• Digital ID systems to enable Iraqis to exercise 
their rights and access services . It also helps 
the country realize the transformational potential 
of inclusive, robust, and responsible digital 
identification systems . Including tangible benefits 
across a range of areas, such as financial 
inclusion, health services, social protection for the 
poorest and most vulnerable, and empowerment 
of women and girls .
35 This stands for Know Your Customer/Client guidelines . 
Financial services require that professionals make an 
effort to verify the identity, suitability, and risks involved 
with maintaining a business relationship .
36 Cited in the World Development Report 2016: Digital 
Dividends ., p . 24 .26 IRAQ ECONOMIC MONITOR: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM (REDUX)• Public Digital Transactions refers to digital in-
frastructure and processes critical to public ad-
ministration such as revenue collection, budget 
management, treasury, civil service payroll, and 
Human Resource Management Information Sys-
tem (HRMIS) at all governmental levels (central, 
local, and municipal) .
• Cybersecurity: as economies become more 
dependent on digital technologies, they also 
become more vulnerable to network attacks . The 
most serious cybersecurity risks are those that 
threaten the functioning of critical information 
infrastructures, such as those dedicated to 
financial services, control systems for power, 
gas, drinking water, and other utilities; airport 
and air traffic control systems; logistics systems; 
and government services . A robust cybersecurity 
framework as per international best practices 
must be co-developed and implemented 
alongside any digital platform .
• Data Protection or the process of safeguarding 
important information from corruption, 
compromise, or loss . The importance of data 
protection increases as the amount of data created 
and stored continues to grow at unprecedented 
rates . The implementation of a successful Digital 
ID system also hinges on a robust data protection 
framework  .
• E-commerce can unlock significant downstream 
employment in novel areas, such as digital 
advertising, as well as in traditional areas such 
as logistics, warehousing, and shipping . Chinese 
e-commerce giant Alibaba, while directly employing 
just over 85,000 employees, created 14 million 
jobs for sellers on its platforms in 2017, and a 
further 22 million downstream jobs in areas such 
as R&D, design, manufacturing and logistics .37 
These benefits are particularly important in Iraq’s 
context, where labor force participation is amongst 
the lowest in the world, at 48 .7 percent .38
Challenges & Opportunities
Iraq is still in the early phases of building various 
digital platforms. Public-sector platforms such as 
e-government services, including online business 
registration, are still in early phases, and private-sector 
platforms such as e-commerce are still nascent in Iraq .A critical, forthcoming public platform is 
the digitization of the Public Distribution System 
(PDS). The PDS is Iraq’s biggest social safety net, 
providing food entitlements to almost the entire 
population, supported by the UN’s World Food 
Program . This digitized system will ensure citizens’ 
data is safely encrypted and stored, and the security 
is enhanced using fingerprints or iris scans . These 
safeguards will allow the GoI to identify and remove 
duplicate records as well as to conduct biometric 
verification at the time of food collection . The new 
system will replace the current paper-based system . A 
complementary mobile application, myPDS, will also 
be developed to help Iraqis collect their benefits and 
update their family information about births, deaths 
and marriages—using personal smartphones .
To increase the formal participation of firms 
in the Iraqi economy, the Global Entrepreneurship 
Registration (GER) project,39 will soon be 
launching an eRegistration software system. This 
will allow the GoI to build online databases of formally 
registered firms and digitize the firm registration 
process in Iraq by creating an online single window 
for business registration . This system allows 
entrepreneurs to see their current registrations, apply 
for licenses, update their data, and make declarations 
and payments—either to link a bank account or 
mobile money system . The eRegistration system will 
also deploy an innovative donor funding model for 
private sector development by funding entrepreneurs 
directly, versus through the government: the user’s 
administrative account can receive money from the 
government (in the form of subsidies, tax credits or 
refunds, etc .) or a national development institution 
(e .g . a foundation), or an international aid agency  . The 
system is anticipated to launch in Spring 2020 .40

40 Source: Global Entrepreneurship Network Global Team .27 LAyING THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ECONOMy IN IRAQ: DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATIONCurrently, the uptake of private-sector 
platforms is low. E-commerce could improve the 
standard of living in Iraq, enabling Iraqi citizens to 
compare goods in order to find the best prices, 
stirring an influx of foreign goods and commodities, 
and creating a more transparent market . Although 
e-commerce is the easiest digital opportunity that 
startups can seize in nascent ecosystems . it has 
been slow growing in Iraq for several reasons, 
mainly low Internet and banking penetration, and 
preference of consumers for cash . Another major 
problem contributing to slow adoption of e-commerce 
is the low level of literacy among Iraqis, especially 
the inability to read and write English—the primary 
language of trade and e-commerce globally  . In this 
context, the most popular platforms are emerging Iraqi 
and MENA-focused e-commerce websites, such as 
Miswag,Dakakkena, ShopYoBrand, and Opensooq .
Magnitt, a digital platform that has gained 
traction in the MENA region, was launched by 
Iraqi expats based in Dubai (UAE). Magnitt has 
developed a data platform for investors, and currently 
hosts 5,500 startups and over 12,000 users including 
over 300 individual investors and over 150 funding 
institutions .41 Unfortunately, Magnitt cannot monitor 
and produce data related to entrepreneurial activity 
in Iraq yet .
Comparison with Other Countries: Iraq’s 
Potential
Iraq has made considerable progress in the mobile 
market, but, as discussed above, its broadband access 
indicators remain weak  . Since digital infrastructure is the basic enabler of digital platforms, low broadband 
access will hinder the implementation and adoption 
of digital platforms in Iraq . Across all government 
platforms indicators, Iraq is 34 percent below the 
MENA average and 97 percent below the MENA 
average for private-sector platforms .42
Digital Skills
Digital skills are essential to prepare for the jobs 
of the future, which will be anchored in the DE. 
This in turn promotes economic growth, job creation, 
and poverty reduction . Investments in digital skills 
create new opportunities through the creation of new 
markets and innovative solutions . Digital skills also 
constitute a key element for social inclusion . As the 
world moves towards heightened use of technologies, 
for work or social life, those who do not have the skills 
to adapt are likely to feel an even bigger sense of 
isolation .
Digital skills are increasingly important for 
promoting digital employment opportunities for 
young Iraqis, especially when job opportunities for 
youth are very limited. Skills upgrading is critical to 
prepare young Iraqis for possible digital employment 
jobs such as online freelancing, microwork, outsourcing, 
etc . Beyond digital employment, given that the future 
of work depends on a certain level of digital literacy 
and an aptitude to advance digital skills for higher BOX 5 • Sri Lanka’s nCoV Surveillance System to Monitor COVID-19 Outbreaks
Example of government implementing a digital platform to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks among its population
The Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka developed a web-based District Health Information Software (DHIS2) solution to capture information on 
high risk passengers entering the country from at-risk countries for active COVID-19 surveillance.
The nCoV Surveillance System captures demographics, immigration, symptoms of COVID-19 disease, and possible contacts at all ports of 
entry, for local public health officers, based on their geographic area. From 0–14 days, it captures potential symptoms of COVID-19 disease 
and any action taken. After 14 days, it captures symptoms of COVID-19 disease and any action taken at the end of the surveillance period.
The Government of Korea has also implemented a similar surveillance system as part of “Special Entry Procedures” for travelers arriving 
from China that went into effect on February 4, 2020. Other governments, such as Nigeria, have also implemented similar monitoring 
systems.

basic occupations further emphasizes the importance 
of upgrading their skills for the future of their work  .
Challenges & Opportunities
The ICT sector in Iraq is small and the little 
employment it creates (3–5 percent) does not 
cater to youth . In fact, only 20 percent of the jobs 
in the ICT sector are occupied by youth . This is 
surprising given that the younger age group is familiar 
with the use of Internet and technologies (25 percent 
of the population aged 15–24 years) much more than 
the older generation (less than 15 percent among the 
population aged more than 40 years) .
A key challenge is the poor labor market 
outcomes, especially among youth. Out of the ap -
proximately seven million youth aged 15–24, around 48 
percent are Not in Employment, Education, or Training 
(NEET) . Compared to the national unemployment rate of 
16 percent, youth unemployment is about 36 percent .43 
Among youth, the unemployment rate is higher for wom -
en (65 percent) . There are also high levels of under -
employment, affecting 32 .4 percent of youth between 
the ages of 15 and 24 . Most youth who have jobs are 
employed in low quality jobs either as low-productivity 
self-employment or as informal sector wage employees .
Conflict and instability have further 
exacerbated the situation and resulted in high 
youth unemployment. Iraq’s fast-growing youth 
population,44 means high labor force growth and 
accelerated demand for youth employment . The 
dominance of public sector employment (represents 
42 percent of jobs) and youth’s preference for public 
sector jobs causes significant labor market distortions . 
The private sector is undiversified, under-developed 
and uncompetitive and, therefore, does not create 
sufficient quality jobs . In the absence of relevant 
education and training systems, skills mismatches 
remain a significant challenge, with individuals not 
having the right skills to match the requirements of 
available job openings, or of limited opportunities 
to access high quality pre-employment or skills 
upgrading training programs .
The skills mismatch gap remains largely in 
the education system’s failure to equip youth with 
jobs-relevant skills in general, and digital skills, in particular. In fact, public sector training providers, 
including universities, are not well prepared to 
support the development of digital skills in Iraq . They 
are constrained by traditional academic curricula that 
were tailored for public sector jobs and do not meet 
the requirements of the DE . For example, the Ministry 
of Communications has its own training institution, the 
Higher Institute for Communications and Post,45 and 
employs many of its own graduates in its workforce of 
approximately 13,000 .46
The annual skills supply to the ICT sector 
from formal Technical and Vocational Education 
Training (TVET) institutions at all levels amounts 
to more than 11,000 graduates. The largest 
proportion (over 3,000) is low-level computer repair 
graduates from the Ministry of Education (MOED) 
schools and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs’ 
vocational training centers . Electronics programs 
produce the second largest cohort of graduates 
(over 2,000) for the sector  . Computer systems and 
information technology programs produce more than 
1,000 graduates each . Less than 1,000 students 
graduate each year for networks, databases, software, 
and media occupations though there is evidence of 
sector demand for these specific services .
However, formal qualifications do not seem 
to be highly valued by employers, and qualifications 
are not a high-ranking selection criterion for 
employment, suggesting a disconnect between 
TVET institutions and employers. Additionally, 77 
percent of ICT employers offered training to their 
employees, presumably in areas where graduates 
lack skills, suggesting that formal training institutions 
should bridge the gap with employers to (1) improve 
the curricula and ensure they meet market needs, and 
(2) facilitate job placement for graduates .

Examples of private-sector and public-sector initiatives to facilitate digital skills acquisition
(1) 1337 via École 42 in Morocco: Example of a private-sector initiative facilitating digital skills acquisition
1337 is a coding school established in 2018 by Paris-based École 42 in Khouribga, Morocco. The training covers programming languages 
such as JavaScript, HTML, or CSS, is completely free of charge. 1337 offers 300 workstations (including the best bandwidth in the 
market) and staff is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Impact: With no attendance fees, widespread accessibility, and top-ranked training, 1337 allows social as well as economic mobility.
1337 School is part of the larger 42 Network, which was established in Paris in 2013 by the famous serial entrepreneur Xavier Neil. With 
20 partner campuses worldwide, the 42 network represents an international community for digital learning. In 2017 , the 42 Network was 
ranked as the best computer science training program by the CodeinGame computer programming platform.
(2) India’s National Skills Development Cooperation: Example of government-driven initiative facilitating digital skills acquisition
The National Skills Development Cooperation (NSDC) was established as a PPP company with the mandate of catalyzing the skills landscape 
in India. Its objectives are to upgrade the skills of 150 million people to international standards and to develop frameworks for curriculum 
and quality assurance. NSDC focuses on industry involvement (operational and financial), supports private sector initiatives, and plays the 
role of a “market-maker”.
Impact: To date, NSDC has trained over 5.2 million students, built 235 private sector partnerships, and introduced vocational training in 
10 states, covering over 2,400 schools and benefitting over 2.5 million students. To ensure alignment of education standards, NSDC is 
working with 21 universities and community colleges and assures National Occupational Standards and certifications. Relatedly, NSDC 
approved 38 Sector Skill Councils to issue certificates to entities complying with standards and frameworks. Furthermore, it developed and 
maintains a Skill Development Management System with 1,400 training partners, over 28,000 training centers, 16.000 training, 20 job 
portals, and 77 assessment agencies.
To address gaps in existing curricula, 
digital training activities have emerged in the Iraqi 
ecosystem. Donors and international organizations 
have launched tech-related events and digital skilling 
activities that target the youth, students, refugees, and 
women, with the aim of equipping them with technical 
skills such as coding, and maker skills, and soft skills, 
including leadership and entrepreneurship . These 
activities are emerging across the country, including 
in Baghdad, Erbil, Mosul, and Sulaymaniyah .
However, corporate and public involvement 
in digital skills development initiatives remains 
weak. The potential of corporate involvement remains 
important and should be mobilized through digital 
transformation seminars that involve government and 
banking, oil and gas, and agriculture sectors .
Comparison with Other Countries; Iraq’s 
Potential47
Iraq is not currently ranked on the World Eco -
nomic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index,48 
which, among many things, measures digital and 
other skills needed to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . Top ranked economies for the MENA 
region are the United Arab Emirates (27) and Qatar 
(30) . Moving forward, Iraq should address the exist -
ing skills gaps to allow youth to reach their potential, 
and leverage partnerships with the private sector to 
both grow the digital sector and absorb more digi -
tally skilled labor  .
Digital Entrepreneurship
Innovative technology entrepreneurs and start-
ups also provide employment and instill an en-
terprising mindset. This is especially crucial in the 
context of Iraq where labor force participation is one 
of the lowest in the world (48 .7 percent), especially

Through competitive wages, flexible work hours, and 
a focus on technical skills, many digital industries in 
other contexts have improved female participation in 
the work force . In Egypt for example, a smartphone 
factory created by SICO in Assiut, Upper Egypt, em-
ploys over 200 women, who are paid above average 
wages higher than average for the area .50 Innovations 
such as mobile ride-hailing services are also pro-
viding flexible work for women,51 and a female-only 
ride-hailing startup has been launched as well was 
recently launched .52
In August 2019, the acceptance of the 
first Iraqi startup, Lezzoo, into the Silicon-Valley-
based, Y Combinator (YC) accelerator program 
signaled Iraq’s developing entrepreneurial eco-
system. YC is considered the world’s most presti-
gious acceleration program, with an acceptance rate 
of 1 .5 percent . Lezzoo was selected based on its scal-
ability, market traction, and potential for international 
expansion .
Challenges & Opportunities
Due to an unfavorable investment climate, Iraq’s 
high entrepreneurship potential remains largely untapped. Digital entrepreneurship is beginning 
to thrive, and there is an opportunity for a comple -
mentary venture capital ecosystem to fund Iraqi 
entrepreneurs .
While Iraq’s start-up ecosystem is still na-
scent, it has shown promising signs and has at 
its disposal, an important domestic market of 
40 million consumers. In April 2019, startup hubs 
in Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Erbil, and Sulaymaniyah 
hosted the Iraq Innovation Hackathon, where over 
700 young tech entrepreneurs competed for prizes BOX 7 • Startups on the Rise: Spotlight on Two High-Growth Iraqi Digital Startups

torship .53 Though there is still a long way to go—in 
2018, Iraq created only 1 tech startup per million 
Iraqis, which is 12 times less than in Egypt—the hack -
athon networks indicate that Iraq has the potential to 
engage young entrepreneurs . This is especially im-
portant in the context of Iraq, where 42% of all jobs 
are in the public sector  . The DE can help shift this sta-
tus quo of seeking public sector employment toward 
increased employment in start-ups .
Despite the growing number of entrepre-
neurship initiatives, the ecosystem still lacks ma-
turity and depth. These manifests itself in the quality 
and number of services provided by business devel-
opment support (BDS) organizations such as incuba-
tors and accelerators, and in the dearth of early-stage 
investors that provide much needed startup capital to 
emerging entrepreneurs .
Comparison with Other Countries: Iraq’s 
Potential
Due to political instability and fragility, Iraq is not 
currently ranked on leading global entrepreneur -
ship indexes, including the Global Entrepreneurship 
Index (GEI) developed by the Global Entrepreneurship 
and Development Institute (GEDI), Startup Genome’s 
Global Startup Ecosystem Report, and the Seedstars 
Index . However, Iraq’s emerging ecosystem could 
soon be benchmarked against comparable countries . 
A strong signal is Seedstar’s recent Investor Master -
class54 conducted in Baghdad in August 2019, spon-
sored by the CBI .
In the MENA region, the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) is considered the most advanced 
entrepreneurship ecosystem due to its enabling 
business environment, regional prowess as a lead -
ing financial center, and the proliferation of entre -
preneurship support organizations BDS providers 
that cover the entire value chain of entrepreneurship 
support ranging from pre-incubation to accelera -
tion programming . As demonstrated in other WBG-
supported regional entrepreneurship activities,55 Iraq 
should increase linkages with mature ecosystems to 
1) showcase local startups to leading investors, cor -
porates, and the media; and 2) attract private-sector 
actors into its national market . Programs such as 
Iraqpreneurs are already establishing these types of linkages, but similar efforts could be further ampli -
fied by the GoI .
Conclusion
The WBG and the GoI have jointly identified priority 
reform areas that have the strongest potential for 
achieving the objectives of 1) private-sector-led 
diversification and 2) reforming governance and 
promoting private-sector participation in selected 
productive sectors that can subsequently boost 
Iraq’s participation in the DE. These priority reform 
areas cut across all five elements of the DE framework 
and are meant to boost accountability, transparency, 
and trust .
Transitioning Iraq towards a resilient and 
inclusive DE will require economic reforms and 
longer-term development priorities along the five 
DE pillars: ensuring affordable access to high-speed 
Internet, achieving widespread adoption of cashless 
payments, delivering digital government services and 
improving access to data, upskilling young Iraqis with 
technological know-how, and scaling up the digital 
entrepreneurship ecosystem .
The proposed short- and medium-term 
improvements below are prioritized by promoting 
actions with the highest potential to keep Iraq 
on track with its commitment to boosting its DE 
across the five pillars. These eighteen (18) critical 
recommendations are also included in the Strategic 
Note on Priority Reform Areas (aka “Iraq White Paper”):
