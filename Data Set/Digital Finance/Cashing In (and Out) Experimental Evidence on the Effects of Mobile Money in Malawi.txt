Mobile Money in Malawi †
By Shilpa Aggarwal, Valentina Brailovskaya, and Jonathan Robinson*
Mobile money has spread rapidly across 
Africa since it was first introduced in Kenya 
in 2007 and has been extensively studied in 
recent years. However, identification is chal-
lenging because mobile money is typically rap-
idly adopted, making it difficult to preserve a 
control group. The seminal studies on mobile 
money are the  difference-in-difference studies 
by William Jack and Tavneet Suri (Jack and Suri 
2014, Suri and Jack 2016), which are identified 
from plausibly exogenous regional differences 
in mobile money rollout and find that mobile 
money reduced vulnerability to shocks as well 
as overall poverty.1
However, to date there have only been a few 
RCTs about basic access to mobile  money.2 
These include Batista and Vicente (2018), which 
randomizes mobile money access at the com-
munity level; Lee et al. (forthcoming), which 
offers mobile banking to  rural-urban migrants 
in Bangladesh (to both the urban migrant and 
the sending rural household); and Wieser et al. 
1 Munyegara and Matsumoto (2016) replicates this 
design in Uganda. 
2 There have been a number of interventions that layer 
other financial interventions on top of basic mobile money, 
but we do not discuss them in detail here due to space con-
straints. See Suri (2017) for an overview, as well as our 
companion paper Aggarwal, Brailovskaya, and Robinson 
(2020).(2019), which randomizes the  rollout of mobile 
money agents in rural Northern Uganda.3
In this paper, we add to this literature with 
an RCT conducted among microentrepreneurs 
in urban Malawi in  2017–2018, where usage of 
mobile money was still modest4 even though a 
nascent mobile money agent network existed. 
Treatment was  three-pronged: assistance in 
opening a mobile money account, training on 
how to perform basic transactions, and a with-
drawal fee waiver.
We find that the majority of people opened 
accounts and used them extensively. We find 
strong evidence that treated respondents real-
located labor from business to agriculture, and 
we find mixed evidence of an increase in expen-
ditures.5 In contrast to the existing literature, 
effects appear to be driven by using the accounts 
to save rather than to make transfers.
I. The Experiment
A. Context and Sampling
Our experiment took place with 480 
 small-scale entrepreneurs in the city of Blantyre, 
Malawi.6 After a census of small businesses in 
3 Given the growing interest in mobile money, there are 
likely other evaluations currently ongoing. 
4 Twenty percent of people in Malawi had a mobile 
money account in the 2017 Findex.
5 In our companion paper Aggarwal, Brailovskaya, and 
Robinson (2019), we also find evidence of effects on other 
outcomes but do not discuss those results in detail here and 
instead focus on primary outcomes.
6 The mobile money treatment is part of a larger experi-
ment with 801 microentrepreneurs. In addition to the mobile 
money treatment, the experiment also provided lockboxes 
and varied the number of accounts given to respondents. 
The results of the combined experiment are described in 
Aggarwal, Brailovskaya, and Robinson (2020). For the 
purposes of this paper, we pool treatment groups given 
one and multiple mobile money accounts. Take-up of mul-
tiple mobile money accounts was modest due to logistical MAY 2020600

the area, we sampled those businesses that met 
inclusion conditions related to firm size and 
involvement in  day-to-day business activities.7 
We stratified treatment by financial access 
(mobile money or bank account ownership) and 
a dummy for above- or below-median distance 
to the nearest mobile money agent.  Two-thirds 
of the sample received a mobile money account, 
and  one-third served as control.8
B. Study Design
In July 2017, treatment respondents received 
mobile money accounts with Airtel Malawi. 
Those who already had an account had an 
option of opening a new account or keeping 
their existing one. Since many people already 
had mobile money accounts9 and mobile 
money was widely available, it may seem sur -
prising that our treatment would change behav-
ior. However, there are three channels through 
which we could have induced more usage than 
in the status quo.
First, to minimize transaction costs associ-
ated with usage, we reimbursed withdrawal fees 
for the duration of the project.10 The average 
withdrawal fee would have been about 5 per-
cent in the absence of this waiver.11 Second, in 
 challenges in using multiple SIM cards for mobile money 
on a single phone. 
7 We excluded businesses with more than 2 employees 
(6 percent), businesses in which the owner worked less than 
5 days a week (9 percent), and businesses that planned to 
shut down within 6 months (16 percent). We also excluded 
any business that was also a mobile money agent (3 per -
cent). Finally, we excluded illiterate business owner (20 per -
cent) and owners who could not read written text due to poor 
eyesight (10 percent).
8 Online Appendix Table  A1 shows that the treatment 
and control groups were largely balanced on covariates at 
baseline.
9 Many respondents already had mobile money (56 per -
cent had an account, and 32 percent reported using it to 
save)—see online Appendix Table 1. However, the average 
balance in mobile money was only about $5 (out of $120 
in total cash savings). The rate of mobile money usage is 
higher than the Malawi average in the 2017 Findex, suggest-
ing that microentrepreneurs are positively selected relative 
to the average Malawian.
10 It was not technologically possible to waive these fees 
directly; instead, we received the set of transactions at the 
end of the week and reimbursed respondents the following 
week. 
11 The schedule of withdrawal fees is included as online 
Appendix Table  A2. The average fee for transactions 
observed in our sample would have been about 5 percent. pilot work we found that respondents had lim-
ited knowledge of the basic features and fees 
of mobile money. Therefore, we developed 
and administered training modules at the time 
of  account opening (note that such a training is 
supposed to be provided by agents, but this has 
not been common practice). Third, we encour -
aged the treatment group to set goals for their 
accounts and to use the accounts to save. While 
we view each of these interventions as relatively 
 light-touch actions that could easily be imple-
mented by the telco absent our involvement, it is 
nevertheless the case that our treatment differed 
from  as-is mobile money.
While most respondents (94 percent) already 
had a cell phone, many of these phones were in 
poor condition, so we gave out feature phones 
(worth $12) to all respondents, making it possi-
ble to conduct phone surveys.
C. Data
In addition to a baseline survey and a short 
intake survey, we fielded three surveys. First, 
for half the sample, we conducted two rounds of 
 high-frequency phone surveys (which we call the 
HFPS). The first round occurred in  September–
October 2017 (with  twice-per-week surveys) 
and the second in  February–March 2018 (with 
 once-per-week surveys). The HFPS measured 
business outcomes, labor supply, expenditures, 
transfers, savings, credit, and shocks (at the 
daily or weekly level, depending on the out-
come). Second, for the entire sample, we col-
lected two rounds of “monitoring surveys” in 
January and March 2018 (also via phone), mea-
suring outcomes over a longer recall period (up 
to three months for some variables).12
Finally, we have access to Airtel’s admin-
istrative data on all transactions from account 
opening until August 2019 ( about two years 
later) . Online Appendix Figure A1 presents a 
timeline.
Withdrawal fees are determined using a step function: the 
fee for the maximum allowable withdrawal within a range 
would be about 4 percent, while the fee for a withdrawal at 
the bottom of the range can be as high as 10 percent (and 
even higher for very small withdrawals).

II. Results
A.  Take-up and Usage
The majority of people who were offered an 
account used it: 99 percent opened an account 
(or continued to use their own account), 73 per -
cent made at least 1 deposit over the first 10 
months, and 53 percent made at least 5 depos-
its (see Table 1). The average respondent made 
11 deposits amounting to $90, a substantial sum 
in this context in which daily profits average 
about $2.50.  Fifty-two percent of people used 
the accounts to make transfers, and the aver -
age (unconditional) value of transfers sent and 
received over the study period was $11 and $9.50 respectively, compared to deposits worth 
$90.13
In online Appendix Table  A3, we examine 
predictors of usage and find that people who 
live farther away from the agent use accounts 
less frequently. The magnitude is large and 
significant at 10 percent: a standard deviation 
increase in distance (0.2 hours) lowers deposits 
by approximately $15.50 (on a mean of $88). 
While distance is not exogenous, we take it as 
suggestive evidence of the importance of trans-
actions costs.
Table 2 shows the first stage, that is, the effect 
of the accounts on total mobile money activity. 
Perhaps surprisingly, even though accounts were 
commercially available and 56 percent already 
13 Online Appendix Figure A2 shows the distribution 
of amounts deposited—while a minority never used the 
account, a sizable fraction of respondents deposited large 
sums.Table 1—Take-up and Usage during Study Period

had them, we find a strong first stage—the 
likelihood of making any deposit went up by 
 55–80 percent and the value of daily deposits 
increased by 67–83 percent, depending on the 
survey.
B. Effects on Downstream Outcomes
Table 3 shows effects on key downstream out-
comes, specifically labor supply, expenditures, 
and  interpersonal transfers.14 We find that treat-
ment respondents worked less in their primary 
business15 and more on their farm. (We also 
find some evidence of an increase in hours in 
other occupations in our companion paper.) We 
also find a marginally significant effect on total 
expenditures.
A possible explanation for the labor supply 
result is that farm labor has a higher expected 
marginal return, but the delay in realizing these 
returns (until after harvest) or the risk of shocks 
(such as bad rain) induces people to instead work 
in their primary business, in which returns are 
more immediate and/or more certain. The pro-
vision of mobile money may allow households a 
tool to overcome these constraints. This result is 
related to several recent papers including Fink, 
Jack, and Masiye (2018), which finds that pro-
viding credit to smallholder farmers decreases 
 off-farm labor and increases  own-farm labor, 
and Callen et al. (2019), which finds that  deposit 
collection allowed Sri Lankan households to 
transition from  self-employment to  wage work.
Why was mobile money effective? The two 
most likely candidate explanations are that 
mobile money allowed people to save or that it 
facilitated interpersonal transfers.16 To explore 
this, in Table 3, columns  8–9, we show effects on 
the value of transfers. In the HFPS, coefficients 
14 Online Appendix Table  A4 shows mixed effects on 
our primary measure of savings (deposits). We therefore 
rely on the downstream effects as our primary evidence. 
Aggarwal, Brailovskaya, and Robinson (2019) includes a 
fuller discussion. 
15 We also find a reduction in business profits, but the 
coefficient is omitted for space. See Aggarwal, Brailovskaya, 
and Robinson (2019) for more detail. 
16 A third possible channel is that mobile money facili-
tated other transactions such as remote bill paying or mer -
chant purchases. Table  1 shows that the average value of 
transactions was less than $8 on average (and of this, $3.25 
was for airtime  top ups—result not shown). We view it as 
unlikely that reducing the transaction costs of such payments 
was a primary driver of downstream effects.are small and insignificant; in the monitoring 
surveys, we find a marginally significant increase 
in values of transfers given but a negative effect 
on the value of transfers received.17
Debriefing surveys conducted at end-
line (online Appendix Table  A6) support the 
notion that people used the accounts to save. 
 Eighty-three percent of respondents reported 
that they used the accounts for  long-term sav-
ings and 12 percent for storing money for a short 
period of time.
III. Conclusion
This paper represents one of the first RCTs 
of access to mobile money. We find that peo-
ple actively used mobile money accounts 
and that mobile money had several important 
downstream effects, including on labor sup-
ply. However, unlike much of the literature on 
mobile money, results appear to be driven by 
people using the accounts to save rather than 
to lower the cost of interpersonal transfers. The 
relatively modest effect on transfers is likely 
because our experiment was at the individual 
level, providing mobile money to individuals 
and not to whole communities, so the interven-
tion would have had a minimal effect on the 
 risk-sharing networks of treated respondents.
Why do we find such robust demand for 
mobile money as a savings vehicle? One pos-
sibility may be that the withdrawal fee waiver 
played a large role. However, in online Appendix 
Figure A3, we document substantial usage even 
after the waiver was removed. We take this 
as evidence that, at least once people started 
using the accounts, the fee may not have been 
the determining factor. However, it is possible 
that an introductory fee waiver was effective in 
encouraging initial usage. We leave this question 
for future research to explore.
Our results may also be unique to Malawi, 
a country where banking access is particu-
larly limited, or to the fact that our sample is 
composed of microentrepreneurs, who have 
high cash turnover and may have greater 
value for safe and easy ways to store money. 
Nevertheless, the results grant credence to the 
17 In online Appendix Table  A5, we look at the results 
in somewhat more detail and find an effect on the extensive 
margin for giving transfers but no effect on receiving.VOL. 110603

notion that mobile money can be used as a 
vehicle for facilitating savings and not just as a 
method of transferring money or making trans-
actions. This insight can be particularly useful 
as mobile money evolves from simply being a 
safe and cheap means to send and store money 
toward providing access to more sophisticated 
financial products.
