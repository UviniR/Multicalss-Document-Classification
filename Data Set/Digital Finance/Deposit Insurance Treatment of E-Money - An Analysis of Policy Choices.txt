INTRODUCTION
EMERGING MARKETS AND 
developing economies (EMDEs) are experiencing 
rapid financial-sector innovation marked by a 
growing number and variety of digital financial services, 
providers, and delivery channels. Transaction accounts 
(see definitions in Table 1) have been at the center of 
innovations, and an e-money account is often the first type 
of transaction account accessed by previously unserved 
and underserved consumers in EMDEs. In fact, e-money 
accounts are more prevalent than bank accounts in at least 
10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region where 21 
percent of adults have a mobile money account (e-money 
account operated via mobile phones) offered by nonbank 
e-money issuers (EMIs) (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).  
The expansion of e-money accounts in financial inclusion 
contexts raises several policy concerns, including whether 
and how e-money should be insured as part of a country’s 
deposit insurance system. Deposit insurance aims to 
protect customers against the loss of their money in case 
the institution holding it fails and is unable to meet its 
obligations to its customers. It also contributes to financial 
stability by limiting contagion and systemic risks. Some 
EMDEs may support applying deposit insurance to 
e-money because many e-money customers are low-income 
individuals with little capacity to assess the risks of EMIs 
and to absorb losses. If some customers lose their funds, 
other current and potential customers could lose confidence 
in e-money, limiting its potential to advance financial 
inclusion. Some EMDEs also believe deposit insurance 
could encourage underserved segments to adopt e-money.
However, in most EMDEs, deposit insurance for traditional 
bank deposits is a recent development. Extending insurance coverage to e-money could divert authorities’ attention 
and resources from financial institutions engaged in a wide 
range of activities that could pose considerable systemic risk 
(e.g., intermediating deposits by offering credit) to EMIs 
engaged in a narrow set of activities that, in most cases, pose 
limited or no systemic risk (e.g., limited value storage and 
money transfers).
Furthermore, for deposit insurance regimes to be effective, 
there first needs to be strong prudential regulation 
and supervision that focuses on having safe and sound 
institutions that are less likely to fail—what we call the 
first line of defense. Regarding e-money, it is thus essential 
to first set up a sound, risk-based prudential regulatory 
and supervisory framework that emphasizes effective 
implementation of fund safeguarding rules with ring-
fencing and segregation requirements, which reduces the 
probability and magnitude of customer losses in case an 
EMI fails. Combined with prudential supervision of the 
deposit-taking institutions (DTIs) holding float accounts, 
such a framework may result in a very low residual risk of 
failure that would not justify extending deposit insurance 
coverage to e-money. 
Many EMDEs may lack an effective regulatory and 
supervisory framework for EMIs and DTIs holding 
float accounts, which impacts the level of residual risk. 
For instance, EMIs may not be subject to appropriate 
segregation and ring-fencing requirements, leaving 
authorities unable to reimburse customers if an EMI fails. 
Situations in which authorities are not prepared to deal 
with the failure of EMIs (Crisis Scenario 1 in this Note) 
or DTIs holding the float accounts (Crisis Scenario 2) may 
lead e-money customers to lose money and may even spur 2
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYTABLE 1.  Key definitions
Types of accounts Types of providersTransaction accounts
Accounts held with banks or other authorized and/or regulated institutions, which can be used to  
make and receive payments and to store value (CPMI and World Bank Group 2016)a
Deposit accountDeposit:  Redeemable funds stored in deposit 
accounts, which are often covered by deposit 
insurance systems. 
Deposit account:  A transaction account that 
can provide a range of services (e.g., savings, 
checking, overdraft) depending on the type of 
license held by the provider.Deposit-taking institutions (DTIs):  DTIs 
include conventional banks and nonbank 
institutions authorized to receive deposits from 
the public, such as deposit-taking microfinance 
institutions, financial cooperatives, etc.E-money accountE-moneyb: Monetary value electronically stored 
on a system or device that can be used for 
making payments and transfers to entities and 
persons other than the e-money issuer. For this 
Note, e-money is not considered a deposit (it is 
a type of “deposit-like product”).
E-money may be called other names such as 
“stored value facility” and “mobile money.” 
E-money account:  A transaction account that 
is not a deposit account, which usually offers 
basic services without necessarily involving 
deposit accounts, and through any type of 
electronic channel (e.g., internet, cards, mobile 
phones). E-money accounts have the same 
functions and offer the same basic services 
regardless of the type of issuer.Nonbank e-money issuer (nonbank EMI):  
Nonbank institution authorized and dedicated to 
issue e-money against the collection of customer 
funds, offering e-money accounts and related 
payment and storage services only. Nonbank 
EMIs are often prohibited from engaging in credit 
operations; i.e., they cannot intermediate the 
funds collected from e-money customers. They 
cannot offer interest-bearing accounts, but they 
may be allowed to distribute interest earnings to 
their customers (e.g., as in Ghana).
Bank e-money issuerc: Banks usually can offer 
e-money accounts in addition to their deposit 
accounts (e.g., savings and checking accounts). 
Banks include full-fledged, conventional banks or 
payment banks such as India’s payments banks 
and Nigeria’s payment service banks.

b  This definition aligns with the European Union’s Directive 2009/110/EC and the definition of “digital deposit-like stored value” in IADI (2014) and GPFI (2016).
c  The regulatory treatment of e-money issued by banks vary, but in this Note, “e-money account” means only accounts that are not classified as deposits 
in bank books. They are registered as a different type of liability. There are many jurisdictions where banks can issue e-money, e.g., Brazil, the European 
Union, Ghana, India, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Myanmar, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, the United States, and member countries of the West African 
Economic and Monetary Union. 3 Introduct Ioncontagious runs on e-money balances. Identifying and 
measuring residual risks associated with different crisis 
scenarios will help authorities prioritize policy measures in 
their specific country context.
This Note does not advocate for extending deposit insurance 
to e-money as a rule, rather it analyzes when doing so may 
or may not address potential residual risks—how deposit 
insurance could act as the last line of defense for e-money 
customers. It analyzes how the first line of defense may 
protect e-money customers in two crisis scenarios and 
looks at implementation issues that authorities may face 
when covering e-money accounts with deposit insurance to 
address residual risks. 
It discusses two deposit insurance approaches: the direct 
approach, whereby each e-money account is considered an 
eligible deposit, and the pass-through approach, whereby 
deposit insurance coverage passes through from the float 
account (held at a DTI member of the deposit insurance 
system) to reach each e-money account.1 While the direct 
approach aims to address residual risks from the failure of 
an EMI, the pass-through approach is aimed at residual 
risks from the failure of a DTI holding a float account. The 
Note draws from CGAP’s global experience, desk research, 
and in-depth analysis of eight countries: Colombia, Jamaica, 
Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, and the 
United States.
1 See Izaguirre et al. (2016), who also identified the exclusion approach, whereby e-money accounts are explicitly excluded from any deposit insurance. 
A first line of defense for e-money customers in this case is described in Section 3 (e.g., Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Paraguay, 
Peru, the Philippines, and Singapore). CGAP initially introduced these approaches at the 2014 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion and the Fi -
nancial Stability Institute Second Conference on Standard-Setting Bodies and Financial Inclusion. At the International Association of Deposit Insurers’ 
48th Executive Council meetings in May 2016, CGAP launched a consultation process of a draft working paper that eventually evolved into this Note. 
In both cases, standard-setting bodies and policy makers supported the framework and started using it in their own work.This Note does not endorse any approach. Because these 
approaches are recent developments, there are several 
unanswered questions about their implementation and 
cost effectiveness. Once a country opts to extend deposit 
insurance to e-money, the choice of an approach will depend 
on country-specific factors, including legal framework, 
current deposit insurance regime, the maturity of the 
e-money market, and relevant business models. In any case, 
policy makers and financial authorities must assess expected 
costs and benefits of insuring e-money and must not see 
deposit insurance as a substitute for effective regulation and 
supervision. It is, rather, only the last line of defense.
There are relevant aspects outside the scope of this Note. For 
instance, there is no evidence based on consumer research 
on whether and how e-money customers value deposit 
insurance, their level of knowledge and understanding 
about customer funds protection, and whether these impact 
adoption of e-money products. There are also technical 
issues related to deposit insurance applied to e-money and 
the workings of trust or other types of custodial accounts, 
highlighted in this Note, that require further research to 
adequately support policy decisions. Finally, it would be 
relevant to monitor implementation issues in the EMDEs 
where deposit insurance coverage has already been extended 
to e-money, in particular when they are put to test by actual 
crises or through crisis simulations. Exploring these issues 
requires coordination among financial-sector authorities and 
industry players.4

5 IADI’s Financial Inclusion and Innovation Technical Committee is exploring inclusive products and providers that could be covered by deposit insur -
ance. See IADI (2013). THE FINANCIAL SAFETY NET  
AND HOW IT RELATES TO E-MONEY
THE FINANCIAL SAFETY NET IS A 
broad framework that aims to reduce the 
probability of DTI failures and their impact on 
individual depositors, other DTIs, and the entire financial 
system. It includes prudential regulation and supervision 
and the functions of resolution, lender of last resort, and 
deposit insurance (IADI 2014, p. 9). These functions 
intend to provide emergency funds to healthy institutions 
that are facing temporary liquidity shortages, and because 
effective prudential regulation and supervision do not 
guarantee zero failure of regulated institutions, they also 
provide a framework for resolving failing institutions 
and insuring small individual depositors. Resolution and 
deposit insurance intend to address the risks of disorderly 
winding down of complex institutions, such as banks, that 
intermediate retail deposits.
Basic protections for customers and markets are embedded 
in e-money regulations, starting with prudential and 
business conduct regulation and supervision of the DTIs 
that hold float accounts and of the EMIs themselves. 
Another layer of protection is the prohibition from 
lending and engaging in other banking activities, which 
substantially limits the risk of nonbank EMIs and payment banks (conventional banks can engage in the full range of 
banking activities). Another central protection is the fund 
safeguarding requirements that oblige nonbank EMIs to 
set aside—in separate accounts called float accounts, which 
are held at DTIs or invested in safe assets—sufficient liquid 
funds to back the e-money issued.2 
While regulation and supervision of EMIs have been 
discussed in the literature,3 and their resolution is a topic 
that is still largely unexplored, there is growing interest 
and emerging experience in extending deposit insurance to 
e-money in EMDEs, especially in the context of financial 
inclusion efforts. However, many EMDEs are new to 
deposit insurance, having only recently set up their deposit 
insurance systems (see Box 1) and are still working to 
implement the International Association of Deposit Insurers 
(IADI) Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance 
Systems,4 which is further complicated by the existence 
of a variety of DTIs other than banks, such as financial 
cooperatives and microfinance institutions. Still, the Core 
Principles require staying abreast of financial inclusion 
innovation, which has led some EMDE policy makers to 
consider whether and how e-money should be insured.5 5 the f Inanc Ial safety net and how I t relates to e-money E-money poses conceptual and practical challenges to 
existing deposit insurance systems because these have been 
set up for traditional products, such as deposit accounts, and 
institutions, such as conventional banks. From a product 
perspective, e-money is not considered a deposit in most legal 
frameworks, hence e-money accounts are not usually covered 
by deposit insurance, even if offered by banks. From an 
institutional perspective, deposit insurance systems have costs 
and rules for membership and operation that are suited to the 
size and complexity of conventional banks and may not easily 
accommodate nonbank EMIs or payment banks with their 
particular risk profile and limited complexity. Considering both the product and the institutional 
perspectives, this Note analyzes implementation issues 
in extending deposit insurance to e-money, as the last 
line of defense to e-money customers facing one of two 
crisis scenarios: the failure of the EMI or the failure of a 
DTI holding the float account. The next section analyzes 
how fund safeguarding requirements impact the level of 
protection in these two crises scenarios and the potential 
residual risks that would be addressed by deposit insurance. Box 1. A primer on deposit insurance systems
Deposit insurance is the protection provided by a deposit 
insurance agency—the deposit insurer—to ensure that 
deposits up to a certain amount (the coverage limit) are 
reimbursed to depositors in the event that a DTI fails 
and thus is unable to meet its obligations to depositors. 
The deposit insurer is the legal entity responsible for 
managing the deposit insurance fund, among other roles, 
with responsibilities and powers established in its official 
mandate. The deposit insurer sets a target fund size that is 
sufficient to meet expected future obligations and to cover 
the deposit insurer’s running costs.
A deposit insurance system  encompasses the deposit 
insurer and its relationships with member institutions and 
the financial safety-net participants that support deposit 
insurance functions and resolution processes (e.g., the 
banking supervisory authority, the resolution authority, and 
other authorities).
A member institution  participates in the deposit 
insurance system. Its eligible deposits can benefit from 
deposit insurance up to the coverage limit. Eligible 
deposits are those that fall within the scope of deposit 
insurance coverage according to their characteristics (type 
of deposit or depositor). The typical deposit insurance system covers only natural persons (individuals) and not 
legal persons (e.g., companies). Insured deposits are the 
eligible deposit amounts that are within the coverage limit. 
The coverage limit is the maximum amount that each 
depositor can claim from the deposit insurance fund in the 
event of failure of a member institution. Most countries set 
it “per depositor per institution,” but some countries set it 
as “per depositor” so that the limit applies to the sum of 
deposits of the same depositor in all member institutions 
or “per account,” when the limit applies to each individual 
account of a depositor at each member institution 
(Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2014). 
A member institution must pay a premium to the deposit 
insurer on a regular basis. Premium systems can be flat 
rate when there is a uniform rate for all member institutions, 
typically calculated based on their total deposits, insured 
deposits, or eligible deposits. Premium systems can also be 
differential, when the premiums are calculated on the basis 
of the risk profile of each member institution.

insurance, see IADI’s Glossary ( http://www.iadi.org/en/

DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYSECTION 3
6 Kerse and Staschen (2018) discuss fund safeguarding requirements in detail.
7 Fund safeguarding requirements are intended to protect consumers if an EMI fails, while other requirements, such as capital requirements, are intended 
to reduce the probability of failure of an EMI (in the case of capital, by providing a cushion against losses).THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE  
AND TWO CRISIS SCENARIOS
3.1  The First Line of Defense: 
e-Money Regulation  
and Supervision
The first line of defense for e-money customers is the 
effective implementation of e-money regulations (and their 
enforcement through supervision), which contain, for 
instance, prudential and business conduct requirements for 
EMIs, such as risk management and transparency rules and 
licensing criteria (e.g., minimum capital and fit-and-proper 
standards). One typical provision is limits on the scope of 
activities—for example, that they cannot lend—permitted 
to nonbank EMIs and payment banks, which dramatically 
curbs their risk profile compared to conventional banks.
Another measure with enormous impact is fund 
safeguarding requirements. These mandate EMIs to set 
aside liquid funds to back a minimum percentage of the 
total of e-money issued—called the e-float—so that EMIs 
are able to meet all customer demands for funds at all 
times. A high level of protection is given by combining 
two types of fund safeguarding requirements: segregation 
and ring-fencing.6The segregation requirement asks for the e-float to be 
kept separate from (not comingled with) other funds, 
including the EMI’s own funds. This segregation may 
be done in one or more separate float accounts held at 
DTIs. An additional layer of protection is given by the 
ring-fencing requirement, which mandates that the 
segregated float account be a special type of account, such 
as a trust account or custodial account, that ring-fences 
it from creditors of the EMI and segregates the e-float 
from other assets of the trustee or custodian (a third party 
managing the trust or custodial account on behalf of 
e-money customers). Fund safeguarding requirements are 
applicable to nonbank EMIs and payment banks in India 
and Nigeria, but most regulations are silent as to whether 
banks must set up float accounts for e-money, and if so, 
whether these must be trust accounts.
Despite reducing risks substantially, the implementation 
of the above requirements and their enforcement through 
effective supervision do not intend to guarantee that EMIs 
will not go bankrupt.7 Also, it is possible that a DTI 
holding float accounts can go bankrupt. 7 the f Irst l Ine of defense and two cr IsIs scenar Ios 3.2  Crisis Scenario 1:  
Failure of the EMI
In preparing for the failure of an EMI, the first question 
to ask is whether the EMI is required to implement 
fund safeguarding requirements. This will determine the 
availability of funds to pay back customers according to the 
current balances in their e-money accounts.
3.2.1   IF THE EMI IS NOT SUBJECT TO FUND  
SAFEGUARDING REQUIREMENTS
If an EMI that is not subject to fund safeguarding 
requirements goes bankrupt, e-money customers are likely 
to be lined up with all other unsecured creditors of the 
EMI. As such, they will have lower priority than secured 
creditors and others specified in the country’s bankruptcy 
regime to get their money back through ordinary 
bankruptcy procedures, which are usually lengthy and do 
not guarantee that there be assets designated specifically to 
reimburse e-money customers. This could be an especially 
hard blow to the previously underserved or unserved 
customers who are not able to deal with the losses. This risk 
exists even if the regulation requires the EMI to keep high 
levels of liquidity (e.g., in the form of government securities 
or demand deposits). Without segregation and ring-fencing, 
such liquidity may not ultimately benefit customers.
3.2.2   IF THE EMI IS SUBJECT TO FUND  
SAFEGUARDING REQUIREMENTS
When an EMI is required to maintain at least one float 
account to back its e-money liabilities—separate from 
other funds managed by the EMI—the funds exist 
specifically to protect customer balances. However, the 
ability to reimburse customers promptly when the EMI 
goes bankrupt will depend on the legal nature of the float 
account. Trust accounts, as opposed to regular deposit 
accounts, ring-fence the e-float from claims by creditors 
8 European Union’s  Directive 2015/2366  on payment services in the internal market. See also Greenacre and Buckley (2014) on the use of trusts to protect 
customer funds.
9 Who can act as a trustee of float accounts varies and depends on the country. For instance, in some countries the DTI holding the float account or even 
the EMI can double as trustees, while in others, such as in Kenya, this is prohibited. Further research is needed to explore whether this variation impacts 
the protection granted to e-money customers in crisis scenarios.
10 See the Superintendence of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Funds of Peru’s Resolution SBS No. 465-2017  on operations with e-money.of the EMI—that is, only the e-money customers can 
claim the balances in the trust accounts. For example, the 
European Union requires that the e-float not be comingled 
with other assets and be held in an account that protects 
against creditor claims.8 
Trust accounts may effectively protect e-money customers 
when an EMI fails only when the law provides for 
undisputable ring-fencing and segregation through the 
following features:
• Trust accounts are managed by a trustee, separate from 
other assets of the trustee, on behalf and for the benefit of 
e-money customers.9
• The e-money customers are recognized as the ultimate and 
only beneficiaries (beneficial owners) of the trust account. 
This means that, legally, e-money customers have ownership 
of and a beneficial interest in the funds.
• The trustee has limited rights to the funds in the trust 
account.
• The funds in the trust account are protected against creditor 
claims during insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings of the 
EMI. As long as the trust is legally valid, customers’ funds 
will not be considered assets of the EMI.
Civil law jurisdictions usually lack a legal framework for 
trusts, and the legal concept of trust is usually absent 
(see Box 2). In the context of e-money, some of these 
jurisdictions have used other instruments, such as fiduciary 
(Peru and most Latin American countries that have 
e-money regulation),10 custodial, or escrow accounts, to 
set up alternative mechanisms with features and benefits 
similar to those provided by trust accounts. Some 
jurisdictions, for example, Turkey and the Philippines, that 
lack legal concepts such as trust and fiduciary accounts 
have incorporated provisions in the e-money regulation to 
emulate the benefits of trusts. One example is a provision 
stating that the e-float can be used only to compensate 
e-money customers in the event of the liquidation of the 8
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYEMI. However, these mechanisms seem to offer a lower 
level of protection than trusts, and their effectiveness in a 
crisis situation has not yet been put to test (Oliveros and 
Pacheco 2016).
11 These issues are discussed in Kerse and Staschen (2018).
12 Examples include Brazil, Colombia, the European Union, Kenya (for large nonbank EMIs), Mexico, Peru, and members of the Western African Eco -
nomic and Monetary Union.
13 In the European Union’s Directive 2015/2366  allows EMIs not to safeguard part of the e-float if it is protected by private insurance.3.3  Crisis Scenario 2:  
Failure of the DTI Holding  
the Float Account
Since float accounts are held at DTIs, the failure of the DTI 
could potentially impact e-money customers, such as by 
limiting the EMI’s access to the float account or by exposing 
it to creditors of the DTI. As counter-measures against 
these risks, some jurisdictions require the EMI to spread 
the e-float across several DTIs, establish that only DTIs 
that are financially healthy can hold float accounts, and/
or limit how much e-float can be placed on a single DTI.11 
Other jurisdictions impose a minimum ongoing capital 
requirement on the EMI (e.g., a ratio of the e-float) to act as 
a cushion against any unexpected losses, including the ones 
due to DTI insolvency.12 Private insurance covering the 
safeguarded e-float could also protect against loss of funds 
in the float account due to failure of the DTI; however, this 
is not usually a requirement in e-money regulations.13
A question remains as to whether and how placing the 
e-float in trust accounts or alternative mechanisms as 
described in Section 3.2 can mitigate the risks involved in a 
DTI failure. Further research is required into the laws and 
regulations around trusts for this scenario. It may be, for 
instance, that trust accounts are granted special treatment 
during bankruptcy or insolvency processes, guaranteeing the 
availability of the funds to the trustee. Since bankruptcy and 
insolvency are lengthy procedures, the protection availed by 
the trust is not a good substitute for the other measures.Box 2. Legal systems
Common law and civil law are the two main types of 
legal systems around the world. Countries following a 
common law system are typically former British colonies 
or protectorates. In a common law system, judicial 
decisions are binding, and there is extensive freedom 
of contract, since few contractual provisions are implied 
by law. A common law system is less prescriptive than 
a civil law system. Countries following a civil law system 
are typically former French, Dutch, German, Spanish, 
or Portuguese colonies or protectorates, in addition to 
most Central and Eastern European and East Asian 
countries. A civil law system features codes (e.g., civil 
code, codes covering corporate, administrative, tax, 
and constitutional law) and the fact that only legislative 
enactments are binding for all. There is less freedom 
of contract because many contractual provisions are 
implied by law and cannot be contracted out.

14 See Ramos et al. (2015). An example of a challenge is a custodial account law that requires custodians (DTIs) to issue legal instructions for all trans -
actions, making it difficult for float accounts that back high volumes of e-money transactions to operate. Some jurisdictions are addressing this by 
requiring additional funds to be kept in a separate settlement account where e-money transactions can be carried out without immediately triggering a 
transaction in the float account.THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE:  
COVERING E-MONEY  
WITH DEPOSIT INSURANCE
4.1  Residual Risk and the Role  
of Deposit Insurance
Even when there is an e-money regulatory and supervisory 
framework that includes fund safeguarding requirements 
(the first line of defense), e-money customers may remain 
exposed to some level of risk of losing money in case of 
failure of an EMI or a DTI holding float accounts. This 
is what we call residual risk. The level of this residual risk 
and how it can be addressed have utmost importance 
in a financial inclusion context because many e-money 
customers are low-income, are not familiar with financial 
products and services, and have little capacity to weather 
financial losses. Also, when some customers experience 
the loss of their e-money balances due to failures, other 
current and prospective consumers might lose their trust 
in the e-money industry and potentially other financial 
institutions, which could reverse progress achieved in 
promoting financial inclusion in many EMDEs. 
The regulatory and supervisory framework for EMIs and 
DTIs of a country and its effectiveness impact the level of residual risk. Effective fund safeguarding rules combined 
with appropriate segregation and ring-fencing requirements 
provide a high level of protection to e-money customers on 
an ongoing basis and reduce the residual risk to a minimum 
in the event the EMI goes bankrupt. (The risk of financial 
authorities not being able to access funds in a timely way 
would remain, though.) Other measures provide a cushion 
to protect the EMI and its customers against potential losses 
due to the failure of the DTI holding the float account. 
However, the combination of a solid regulatory framework 
and its enforcement through effective supervision is 
likely to be absent in many EMDEs. Not all EMIs are 
subject to fund safeguarding requirements based on trust 
accounts. The alternatives used in civil-law jurisdictions 
usually offer a lower level of protection than trusts, and 
there could be practical challenges to the application of 
these alternatives to float accounts.14 The limited ability 
and capacity of the supervisor and the deposit insurer to 
deal with the crisis scenarios (e.g., established resolution 
and crises preparedness frameworks) could also negatively 
impact the outcome for e-money customers. Accessing 10
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYthe safeguarded e-float to pay out to e-money customers 
or transferring it to another EMI or another DTI, in a 
timely manner, may not be possible because of unexpected 
operational, administrative, and legal challenges.
The existence of such residual risk and the desire to foster 
financial inclusion have been fueling discussions about 
adding a last line of defense in the form of deposit insurance 
coverage. The following sections analyze two approaches to 
do so: direct and pass-through.
4.2 The Direct Approach
The direct approach to deposit insurance is intended 
to provide the last line of defense against the failure of 
the EMI (the first crisis scenario), because the deposit 
insurance directly covers the e-money accounts offered 
by the EMI. This approach entails two steps: establishing 
that the e-money accounts, including those issued by 
banks, are eligible deposits for deposit insurance purposes 
(see Box 1 ) and requiring nonbank EMIs and/or payment 
banks to become members of a deposit insurance system. 
The main advantage of the direct approach is that it is 
clear how much each and every customer would receive 
from the deposit insurance.
4.2.1   RECOGNIZING E-MONEY   
AS ELIGIBLE DEPOSIT
The definition of eligible deposits is usually limited to 
deposit liabilities owed to natural persons by banks and 
other DTI members of the deposit insurance system. 
E-money, as defined in this Note, is not a deposit liability, 
so an e-money account is often not covered by deposit 
insurance from the outset, even when offered by banks 
that are members of existing deposit insurance systems. 
Therefore, it will be necessary to modify the definition of 
eligible deposits in the law and/or regulations pertaining 
to deposit insurance to include balances held in e-money 
accounts offered by banks and nonbanks and establish their 
insurability. If a jurisdiction is still designing its deposit 
insurance system and aims to apply the direct approach, 
it would be easier to include e-money liabilities in the 
definition of eligible deposits from the start.To date, there is no country example of directly applying 
deposit insurance to e-money accounts (as defined in 
Table 1). Although it does not fit the definition of e-money 
accounts and EMIs used in this Note, the case of “electronic 
deposits” in Colombia (Box 3) is, nevertheless, illustrative 
of how a country has extended deposit insurance to deposits 
of nonbank institutions. Colombia defined in the law a new 
type of deposit product that is eligible for deposit insurance 
coverage, and it also created a new type of regulated 
nonbank institution (Sociedad Especializada en Depósitos y 
Pagos Electrónicos [SEDPEs]), which is similar to EMIs. As 
a result, SEDPEs have been incorporated as members of the 
existing deposit insurance system (Fondo de Garantías de 
Instituciones Financieras [Fogafín]). Colombia’s approach 
Box 3.  SEDPEs and “electronic deposits”  
in Colombia
Colombia has taken significant strides toward financial 
inclusion, but it has not issued an e-money regulation. 
Instead, in 2011 it passed a law (Decree 4687/2011) 
that created a new type of deposit product called 
an “electronic deposit.” In 2012 the funds held in 
electronic deposit accounts were categorized as eligible 
deposits for deposit insurance purposes, on par with 
regular bank deposits (Resolution Fogafín 4/2012). The 
coverage limit applicable to all eligible deposits is COP 
50 million (US$15,900) per depositor, per institution 
(Resolution Fogafín 1/2018). 
A 2014 legal reform (Law 1735/2014) created a new 
licensing category for Entities Specialized in Electronic 
Deposits and Payments (SEDPEs in Spanish). SEDPEs 
are nonbanks, licensed and supervised by the Financial 
Superintendence. They have a range of permitted 
activities that make them very similar to EMIs. SEDPEs 
are subject to fund safeguarding requirements such as 
keeping a float account at the central bank or with DTIs, 
with funds equivalent to the totality of their electronic 
deposit liabilities, even though these are directly covered 
by deposit insurance. Because electronic deposits are, 
from the start, eligible deposits, SEDPEs must become 
members of the deposit insurance system.11 the last l Ine of defense: c over Ing e-money w Ith depos It Insurance  supports the view that deposit insurance is a last-resort 
measure, since the coverage has not substituted for the 
typical fund safeguarding requirements.
4.2.2   REQUIRING NONBANK EMIS 
TO BE MEMBERS OF DEPOSIT 
INSURANCE SYSTEMS
Requiring nonbank EMIs and payment banks to become 
members of an existing deposit insurance system that has 
been set up for conventional banks requires considering how 
their membership will affect existing members. The deposit 
insurer needs to set up an appropriate premium system to 
reach its target fund size (see Box 1). With the addition of 
new members, the deposit insurer has to evaluate whether 
the premium levels of existing members need to be adjusted, 
and what the premium levels for new members shall be.15 
Depending on how the premiums are assessed (e.g., based 
on total, insured, or eligible deposits; flat rate or differential), 
the premiums of existing members may need to be revised. 
If no adjustments are made, the funds available to existing 
members could be affected. Moreover, the addition of new 
members could strain the deposit insurer’s resources if it also 
has supervisory responsibilities.
Another consideration is whether to set up a separate 
fund for nonbank EMIs and payment banks, to avoid the 
complexity of mixing fundamentally different types of 
institutions with different risk profiles. A separate fund 
could provide greater flexibility for the deposit insurer to 
set a customized target fund size and premium system. 
To date, there is no country example of a separate fund 
for nonbank EMIs and/or payment banks, although 
some countries have set up separate funds for nonbank 
institutions, most notably credit unions and cooperatives. 
These may be government run (e.g., Fondo de Garantías 
de Entidades Cooperativas in Colombia, the National 
Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in the United States) 
15 See IADI Core Principle 9, Essential Criterion 5 (IADI 2014, p. 29). 
16 Further research is needed to gauge whether the direct approach could provide any protection if a DTI holding the float account fails—for instance, 
whether the DTI insolvency, by eroding the e-float or restricting its access by the EMI, could be an event that triggers reimbursement or other type of 
deposit insurance intervention in the direct approach.
17 Further research is needed into whether deposit insurance systems have specialized eligibility and operational rules for trusts compared to conventional 
bank deposits.or privately run (e.g., Fondo de Garantía de Ahorros 
Confía in Costa Rica).
4.3 The Pass- Through Approach
While the direct approach provides insurance for customers 
of an EMI by recognizing their e-money accounts as eligible 
deposits (hence, protecting customers when the EMI fails), 
it generally does not provide protection when the DTI 
holding the float account fails.16 The pass-through approach 
is more relevant for this crisis scenario. 
The pass-through approach does not require the EMI to 
become a member institution. It relies on the requirement 
that the float account be held as a deposit liability at a DTI 
that is already a member of the deposit insurance system, 
and it requires that the float account be set up in a manner 
that allows the deposit insurer to identify each individual 
e-money customer.17 This approach is intended to overcome 
some fundamental barriers to insure the beneficiaries of 
float accounts—the e-money customers. The first barrier is 
that the typical deposit insurance system covers only natural 
persons, but the float account is operated by a legal person 
(either the EMI or a third-party trustee). Further, even if the 
deposit insurance covers legal persons, the coverage limit is 
usually much lower than the balance in float accounts. The 
pass-through approach solves these problems by granting 
a special treatment to the float accounts for purposes of 
deposit insurance. Instead of considering the legal person 
as the depositor and applying the coverage limit to the float 
account as a single deposit account, the insurance coverage 
“passes through” the float account to reach each individual 
e-money customer—that is, the insurance is applied to the 
beneficiaries of the float account.
This approach is largely based on the regulatory framework 
of the United States for prepaid instruments (including 
e-money) and has not been tested in EMDEs. Nigeria  12
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEY(Box 4), Kenya (Box 5), Jamaica,18 and Rwanda19 are among 
the first adopters of this approach among EMDEs.
The pass-through approach does not require the EMI to 
become a member of a deposit insurance system, but it 
requires the DTI holding the float account to be a member 
of an existing deposit insurance system. It also most likely 
18 See Deposit Insurance Act (including 2011 amendments)  and Joint, T rust and Nominee Accounts Regulations of 2014 .
19 See National Bank of Rwanda’s Regulation No 001/2016 concerning Operations of the Deposit Guarantee Fund for Banks and Microfinance Institutions .
20 See FDIC (2016) for examples of implementation challenges with the pass-through approach in the United States, some of which also could be relevant 
to the direct approach (e.g., inaccurate or incomplete records that do not identify beneficial owners). For a discussion on implementation challenges and 
potential implications for customers, see Izaguirre, McGuire, and Grace (2016).requires the float account to be a trust or an alternative 
mechanism that benefits from the protective features listed in 
Section 3.2.2. Further country-specific research and analysis 
are needed to identify the additional legal requirements and 
formalities needed for civil law jurisdictions to implement the 
pass-through approach with alternative mechanisms based on 
custodial, fiduciary, or other similar accounts.
The formalities needed to ensure e-money customers 
are effectively protected as beneficiaries of the float 
account—hence, rightful claimants of deposit insurance 
payouts—may vary across countries and may impact 
EMIs differently. They may include clear identification of 
the trust or custodial nature of the float account, a trust 
or custodial agreement that formally recognizes the key 
features mentioned in Section 3.2.2, and detailed record 
keeping that identifies beneficiaries. For instance, in the 
United States, the EMI and the trustee must maintain 
records that identify the individual e-money customers and 
how much of the trust account balance each customer is 
entitled to ( pro rata  or a discrete amount) (Seward & Kissel 
2011; FDIC 2010). Such requirements can be challenging 
to implement.20
When an EMI spreads the e-float across several float accounts 
at different DTIs, customers could face different risks related 
to the failure of different DTIs (when they are “mapped” to 
specific banks). The potential payout of insurance to only 
part of the e-money customers (the ones “mapped” to a 
failed DTI) and not to other customers may cause confusion 
and lead to reduced trust in EMIs. A potential solution 
would be for all customers of an EMI to be mapped to all 
float accounts. This means that the trust relationships and 
therefore the exposure to DTI failure risk would be equal 
across all e-money customers; it would not vary according to 
each DTI holding different float accounts. However, it is not 
clear that this would be a legally valid option.
Alternatively, deposit insurers using a pass-through 
approach to insuring e-money may consider reimbursement 
options other than paying directly to e-money customers. Box 4. Pass-through approach in Nigeria
In Nigeria, the existing deposit insurance system for 
bank deposits would insure float accounts up to the 
existing coverage limit of about US$2,500, which is much 
lower than their expected balances. This would leave a 
potentially large part of e-money balances uncovered if 
the bank holding the float account failed. In light of these 
issues, the Central Bank of Nigeria has coordinated with 
the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) to 
create a more adequate framework for e-money issued 
by nonbank entities known as mobile money operators.
NDIC has chosen the pass-through approach, which 
requires float accounts to be trust accounts opened at 
banks for the benefit of e-money customers. If the bank 
fails, the deposit insurance would cover each e-money 
customer up to the coverage limit of US$2,500. 
This limit, however, applies over all deposits of each 
customer in the bank, including regular bank accounts, 
in addition to the e-money account. In practice this 
requires that each e-money customer be mapped to 
a specific float account in a specific bank (in case the 
mobile money operator has float accounts in more than 
one bank). To be entitled to pass-through coverage, the 
float account must be designated as a trust account in 
the records of the bank holding the account.
Note: See NDIC’s Framework for the Establishment of 
Pass-Through Deposit Insurance for Subscribers of Mobile 
Money Operators in Nigeria (2015), and NDIC’s Deposit 
Insurance Guidelines on Mobile Payments System (2016).13 the last l Ine of defense: c over Ing e-money w Ith depos It Insurance  Assuming that only the DTI—but not the EMI—fails, 
paying out insurance claims directly to e-money customers 
could deteriorate customer trust and lead to a run on 
e-money balances that could affect the viability of the 
EMI and potentially impact other EMIs. Deposit insurers 
could consider other mechanisms for reimbursing e-money 
customers, such as transferring the equivalent amount into 
another float account at a solvent DTI or paying it out to 
the trustee as in the case of Kenya (see Box 5), without 
disruption to e-money customers.21
4.4  A Few Practical  
Considerations Relevant  
to Both Approaches
Applying deposit insurance to e-money is a complex policy 
issue. An effective implementation requires policy makers 
to consider potential challenges of applying an approach 
from the outset and then decide the specific features of their 
approach. They also should analyze their current level of 
effectiveness in implementing the first line of defense and 
whether the residual risk stemming from their regulatory and 
supervisory framework makes deposit insurance a priority.
4.4.1  DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE LIMIT
What is the appropriate deposit insurance coverage limit 
for e-money? Should e-money balances be covered in their 
totality? Generally, deposit insurance should not cover the 
totality of deposits to avoid moral hazard among member 
institutions (IADI 2014, p. 11). However, in EMDEs a 
large contingent of e-money customers may be low-income 
and with little financial capability and capacity to weather 
losses, while using e-money accounts as a substitute to 
bank deposits. In such instances, there might be a case for 
prioritizing protection over moral hazard concerns and insure 
e-money accounts in their totality. The case is reinforced 
by the fact that e-money accounts are often subject to low 
maximum balance limits, by regulation, and may present an 
average balance lower than such limits. 
21 This situation and the respective power of the deposit insurer to transfer funds could be recognized in the deposit insurance legal/regulatory framework 
and in trust agreements through the concept of “protector” or third party responsible for monitoring the actions of the trustee and preserving the integ -
rity of the trust. The deposit insurer could be the protector.Should the coverage limit for e-money differ from that 
of other eligible deposits?  The coverage limit set for bank 
deposits is typically set at a high enough level to protect the 
large majority of retail bank depositors across all member 
institutions. This level could be significantly higher than Box 5. Pass-through approach in Kenya
The increase in the number of customers of nonbank 
EMIs (from 21,000 in March 2007 to 16 million in June 
2011) raised concerns among Kenyan policy makers 
about the risk of loss of funds in the event of the failure 
of a bank holding large float accounts and the impact 
this could have on the financial system. As a result 
of this concern, the 2014 National Payment Systems 
Regulations of Kenya required nonbank EMIs to set up 
multiple float accounts in the form of trusts operated by 
trustees, at highly rated prudentially regulated banks. 
Also, the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC) 
adopted the pass-through deposit insurance approach 
for such float accounts. Section 29 of the Kenya 
Deposit Insurance Act of 2012 allowed for the deposit 
insurer to cover the trust accounts held at member 
institutions by a trustee on behalf of its beneficiaries (the 
e-money customers) as “separate from a deposit of that 
beneficiary with the institution on his own behalf and 
(…) separate from any deposit held in trust by another 
trustee for the beneficiary in the institution.” Thus, in case 
of failure of a DTI holding float account, KDIC would 
cover the funds that an e-money customer has in each 
float account separately and up to the coverage limit 
of KES 100,000 (US$870). If the same customer also 
has a deposit account in the same DTI, this account 
would be covered separately and up to the limit, without 
impacting the coverage of float accounts benefitting from 
the pass-through approach. The trustee is required to 
maintain detailed records and to submit such records 
to the DTI. KDIC has also adopted a plan to pay out the 
insured funds to the trustee rather than the customers. 
So far Kenya’s approach has not yet been put to test.14
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYthe average balances held in e-money accounts. Setting a 
lower coverage limit for e-money accounts that considers 
such low average balances would avoid inefficiencies and 
costs of over-insuring e-money. The downside is that, if 
e-money accounts are not capped by regulation, a low 
coverage limit could leave some e-money customers partially 
uninsured, particularly when they are not able to spread 
their funds across multiple EMIs. Reduced transparency is 
another disadvantage of having different coverage limits in a 
country—consumers may be confused as to which coverage 
limit applies to them.
To which balance(s) should the e-money coverage limit 
apply?  Should it apply to the aggregate sum of a customer’s 
balances in all accounts held in the same institution (e.g., 
Nigeria, Rwanda), directly or indirectly through float 
accounts, or should it apply separately to an e-money 
account irrespectively of other accounts held by a customer 
in the same institution (e.g., Jamaica, Kenya)? Aggregating 
all customer balances in one DTI to apply a single coverage 
limit increases complexity and may not be the best option 
for the pass-through approach when a single DTI holds float 
accounts of several EMIs. 
4.4.2   IMPACT OF ADDING E-MONEY   
TO AN EXISTING DEPOSIT   
INSURANCE SYSTEM
Insuring e-money also leads to the question of whether the 
existing deposit insurance fund and the deposit insurer’s 
target fund size would need to be adjusted to account for 
greater responsibilities and potential liabilities. This is 
particularly important for countries where e-money has 
reached a significant scale and the deposit insurance system 
has been established only recently because e-money could 
lead to a sudden substantial additional coverage. Adjusting 
the deposit insurance fund may require a plan that, for 
instance, raises premiums or puts in place a special premium 
assessment for e-money. These measures could affect the 
impact of costs on existing member institutions and may 
require legal reforms.22 Alternatively, the direct approach to 
deposit insurance may enable the creation of a separate fund 
22 For example, the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation Charter, Section 6, establishes the assessment rate it may charge insured banks, thereby 
limiting the option for an increase or differentiation in rates without a legal reform. 
23 See IADI Core Principle 15, Essential Criterion 4 (IADI 2014, p. 39).for nonbank EMIs and payment banks, with customized 
rules (see Section 4.2.2). In any case, adequate technical 
capacity will be needed for deposit insurers to estimate 
probabilities of failures, correlation of failures, exposure at 
failures, loss rates per failure, and other factors to determine 
the adequacy of the target fund size.
4.4.3   CRISIS MANAGEMENT   
AND RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK
It is not enough to establish deposit insurance coverage in the 
law and regulations. Regardless of the approach to deposit 
insurance, there needs to be a clear framework for dealing 
with the two crisis scenarios. Deposit insurers and other 
relevant authorities such as the supervisors of EMIs need to 
envision, in a coordinated manner, effective mechanisms for 
immediate insurance payout when needed. Simulations of 
crises, liquidation and resolution procedures, and insurance 
payouts may be useful exercises to identify potential 
operational challenges and envision mitigation measures.
4.4.4   ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT METHODS  
AND TOOLS  
Reimbursement of insured funds should not be limited 
to paying out directly to customers, particularly for the 
pass-through approach. The deposit insurer should have 
powers to, for instance, transfer the funds from a float 
account at a failing DTI to another DTI and pay insurance 
directly from the deposit insurance fund to a viable EMI 
or to the trustee. The deposit insurer should also have the 
power and ability to quickly gain access to accurate, up-to-
date e-money account and transaction records in both 
approaches.23 This may require establishing requirements for 
record keeping and information sharing for EMIs, trustees, 
and DTIs, which may lead to investments in IT systems by 
all parties. 15 conclus IonsSECTION 5
CONCLUSIONS
IN EMDES E-MONEY PLAYS A KEY 
financial inclusion role and serves a large number of 
customers who may be unable to weather the loss of 
their e-money balances. However, e-money is not covered 
by deposit insurance in most jurisdictions. Typically, 
prudential regulation and supervision is the financial 
safety net component that is prioritized. Examples include 
minimum initial and ongoing capital requirements on 
the EMI that would act as a cushion against the losses 
associated with the failure of the DTI, among other losses, 
and fund safeguarding requirements that aim to ensure 
that EMIs have set aside sufficient liquid funds to cover 
all e-money liabilities at all times. Even more important 
are fund segregation and ring-fencing requirements that 
aim to ensure that the e-float be held in a special type of 
account that isolates it from claims by creditors of the EMI 
and keeps it separate from other assets of the EMI and 
the trustee or custodian of the float account. If such rules 
are enforced through supervision, and if DTIs holding 
float accounts are also supervised and healthy, the residual 
risks for customers if an EMI fails would be very low. 
Thus, regulation and supervision, not deposit insurance, 
constitute the first and main line of defense in protecting 
e-money customers.
The level of residual risks in a country would depend 
on the effectiveness of its regulatory and supervisory 
framework for EMIs and DTIs. For example, the risk of 
authorities not being able to access e-money customer 
funds in a timely way if an EMI fails may remain. Deposit 
insurance may be considered to be a last line of defense to 
protect e-money customers from residual risks. This Note 
provides an initial analysis of the two potential approaches 
to extending deposit insurance to e-money, as an aid to policy makers that have decided or are considering taking 
such a step. Neither approach has been tested in EMDEs. 
Both involve complex policy choices and present important 
implementation challenges that may, depending on the 
country context, outweigh the potential benefits. Also, it is 
worth considering whether a combination of the direct and 
the indirect approaches is possible and desirable.
The direct approach aims at addressing residual risks 
stemming from the failure of the EMI and requires that 
e-money accounts be defined as eligible deposits and that 
EMIs become members of a deposit insurance system. Its 
main advantage is that its effectiveness does not depend on 
how the float accounts are structured or the risk of failure 
of a DTI holding float accounts. The main disadvantage 
is that it does not protect against the failure of such 
DTIs. In a context where fund safeguarding is effectively 
implemented and enforced, there is no apparent reason to 
insure e-money accounts in this manner, as the safety of 
customer funds depends on the risk of the DTI, not the 
nonbank EMI or payment bank. The costs of setting up 
deposit insurance could impact EMIs and their ability 
to reach low-income customers, thus outweighing the 
potential benefits of insurance.
The pass-through approach aims at protecting against 
the risk of loss if a DTI holding a float account fails. Its 
effectiveness depends on whether the legal framework 
allows for trust or similar types of accounts with key 
features that ensure the protection of each float account 
held at each DTI. The application of this approach may 
lead to consumer confusion or distrust if the failure of a 
DTI leads to only a subset of customers of an EMI being 
paid out and others not being affected at all. The framework 16
DEPOSIT INSURANCE TREATMENT OF E-MONEYcould be adapted in different ways to address such problem 
(e.g., having all customers “mapped” to all float accounts, 
allowing insurance payout to the trustee). There are legal 
and operational challenges involved in this approach whose 
cost and complexity could outweigh the potential benefits 
of insurance. Also, in this approach the failure of a single 
DTI holding several float accounts would trigger insurance 
procedures for customers of various EMIs at the same time, 
thus increasing complexity of crisis resolution procedures. 
Several areas around the protection of e-money customer 
funds would benefit from in-depth country-level research. 
They include research on the legal and regulatory 
framework on trusts and how they may protect customers 
if a DTI fails, additional civil law legal requirements 
and formalities needed to implement the pass-through 
approach with alternative types of custodial accounts, and 
implementation challenges in the use of trust or other types 
of custodial accounts to segregate and ring-fence the e-float. 
It will also be insightful to carry out and share findings 
on crisis simulation exercises or real-life case studies from 
EMDE deposit insurers that have extended and tested 
coverage to e-money, and consumer research on e-money 
customers’ understanding of and value given to deposit 
insurance and fund safeguarding measures. These areas of 
research would help policy makers be more aware and better 
informed of relevant challenges of and potential solutions 
for implementing first and last lines of defense to protect 
e-money customers.17 referencesREFERENCES
