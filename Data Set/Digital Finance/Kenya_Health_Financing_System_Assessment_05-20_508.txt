EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Introduction  
This report asses ses the Kenyan health financing system in light of ongoing reforms and the 
Government of Kenya’s (GOK’s) ambitious commitments to achieve universal health coverage 
(UHC) through multiple initiatives. International experience s uggests that effective health 
financing reforms can advance UHC by mobilizing sufficient resources to provide the services 
necessary for good health and by ensuring that these resources are pooled and spent equitably, 
protecting citizens from financial bur den when seeking healthcare. W hether Kenya succeeds in this 
endeavor will depend on congruent actions across national and county governments. These joint 
goals include increasing insurance coverage, strengthening the financing of primary care, 
increasing d omestic spending for essential  programs, and improving the efficiency of budget 
allocation, while engaging the private sector to enhance supply and choice. Current trends suggest 
that the health sector has built on an evolving maturity of political and fis cal devolution that began 
in 2012, with the county governments consolidating resources in county -level funding pools and 
increasingly spending on efforts to improve access and quality. However, there is still considerable 
inequality across counties in heal th resources and policy effect iveness. Across levels of government, 
there is emerging consensus on an eventual move toward single -payer health insurance evolving 
from the current National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), though in this regard the actions of  
counties and the national gov ernment will need to harmonize better, since the insurance system as 
a whole requires major improvements in process and performance to drive population -level 
coverage of essential interventions. There is a need to pick a path in terms of the overall 
mechan ism that will yield UHC. Currently, Kenya is experimenting with removal of user fees at a 
large scale, married to new supply -side spending to reimburse facilities and improve access to 
services. These are the basis of recent c ounty -level Afya Care pilots  and the county -led 
MakueniCare scheme , hinged on tax -funded and input -based financing of healthcare. The links 
from current user fee removal efforts and a long -term vision of an insurance -led model of 
guaranteeing and purchasing an essential package of serv ices nee d to be better forged. Overall, 
Kenya shows a willingness for policy experimentation and is also a source of private market digital 
and financial innovation which, if harnessed, can accelerate key future health system solutions.  
Executive Summary  
8 Government Vision for UHC and Health Financing Reform  
The GOK has committed to achieving UHC by 2022, as part of the current administration’s “Big 
Four” development agenda. While Kenya has made significant progress toward UHC across the 
usual dimensions, this ambitious goal  still r equires considerable additional resources and effort. In 
line with this, the Roadmap Towards Universal Health Coverage (2018 –2022) details key 
objectives for advancing UHC in the next four years. Further, the government is strengthening the 
health financin g system to underpin these UHC efforts, as articulated in the draft Kenya Health 
Financing Strategy 2016 –2030 (KHFS).  As stated in these critical policy documents, expanding 
health insurance through NHIF is central to the UHC strategy. NHIF is at i ts core a social health 
insurance (SHI) institution, financing health insurance coverage for formal sector employees 
through payroll deductions. Kenya envisions expanding from this foundation and achieving 
universal insurance coverage across formal and inf ormal se ctors, with formal sector employers and 
employees sharing in the contribution amounts. In this vision, different levels of government will 
participate in subsidizing membership for the poor and vulnerable.  Achieving high insurance 
coverage alone, h owever, will not be sufficient for UHC in Kenya. Covered benefits need to be more 
clearly defined, meet emerging population needs given Kenya’s epidemiological transition, and be 
purchased more efficiently and equitably than they are currently. Kenya has m ade majo r 
investments in its  public health workforce, supplies, and infrastructure, as well as removing user 
fees for primary care, and these continue to be primarily resourced through tax -based funds. The 
country will increasingly need to ask if these ini tiatives  in the health system are fit -for-purpose, 
given how the health financing structure will evolve and health needs will shift.  
Main Focus of This Assessment  
This report is based on work conducted by the Health Policy Plus project, funded by the U.S. 
Agency for International Development. It assesses the current health financing system with a view 
toward informing future reforms. It especially takes stock of recent NHIF performance and trends 
in public financing of healthcare, given the growing role of county governments under the devolved 
system. F our key themes are explored throughout the report:  
The impact of devolution on health financing trends and prospects  
The evolving role of NHIF and its readiness to lead expansion toward universal health 
insur ance  
The expanding role of the private sector in service provision  
Transition away from external  financing and the basis for increased government spending 
on health  
Findings  
Kenya’s health outcomes have improved significantly, though some health areas lag 
behind. Kenya’s Vision 2030 development agenda sets ambitious targets toward UHC in terms of 
financial protection, health service utilization, health service availability, and ultimately, health 
impact. Kenya has made significant progress in improving heal th outco mes. Overall, its 2015 UHC 
“service coverage index” was 57, based on a composite of different service delivery indicators 
analyzed by the World Health Organization. This is relatively high for the region. Under -five 
mortality in 2014, for example, was 30 p ercent lower than in 2008. Infant mortality fell 25 percent 
over the same period. However, Kenya is still far from its targets. Under -five mortality, for 
example, decreased by nearly half from the 1990 baseline of 98 deaths per 1,000 births to 52 i n Executive Summary  
 
 9 2014, but this is still well above the target of 32 deaths per 1,000 births. These numbers also mask 
geographic disparities. The under -five mortality rate is 82 in Nyanza Province and 72 in Nairobi. 
North Eastern and Central Provinces, on the other hand,  have un der-five mortality rates of 44 and 
42, respectively.  
Kenya has made significant progress in expanding health access, but disparities 
continue. Access to essential services has improved. The longstanding Kenya Essential Package 
for Health (KEPH) is  a packa ge of key services defined along six health areas and was not 
previously guaranteed through financing reforms. Since 2018, a process to define an explicit 
benefits package to be covered under NHIF, drawing from KEPH, has garnered support. A 
guarant eed pack age may be more feasible than before, since between 2013 and 2016, there was an 
increase of 14 percentage points in the mean availability index of all KEPH services. Despite this 
overall improvement, the availability of services varies significantl y across  health area and 
geography. In 2016, for example, two-thirds of the facilities provided the full scope of essential 
health services, while no facilities offered the full range of services, including emergency and 
trauma services and services for al l noncom municable conditions. There are also wide inter -county 
variations . For example, about half of the 47 counties report health utilization rates above the 
national average (2.5 per capita per year), while nine counties report utilization rates of 30 p ercent 
or more below the national average.  
Kenya has taken individual policy actions toward financial protection that need to be 
integrated in a broader vision. Kenya’s recent history of deliberate pro -poor user fee policies 
has helped to improve use of h ealth se rvices among the poor to some extent, though the long -term 
vision for continuing these should be weighed against plans to expand health insurance coverage as 
a mechanism for financial protection. Two policies have been central to this effort. Linda  Mama 
provides free maternal healthcare for mothers and children through the first year of life. A second 
policy abolished user fees for primary healthcare at public facilities. Despite evidence of the impact 
of these policies, persistent disparities in ut ilizatio n continue across socioeconomic status and 
utilization, which suggests that removal of user fees without other investments in the availability 
and quality of services may not be sufficient. “Afya Care” in four counties from 2018 to 2020 
expands fre e servic es to the secondary care sector and provides additional reimbursements and 
investments into healthcare inputs to compensate facilities and plan for increased utilization.  
The ability to mobilize resources for health is continually increasing, with  improve d 
government revenue raising and prioritization of health, but limits to growth are on 
the horizon.  Expanded insurance contributions from the entire formal sector and the able -to-pay 
portion of the informal sector will contribute to a growing pool of resou rces in time that will cross -
subsidize care for the poor if NHIF is reformed and a single payer and pool formed. It is necessary 
to realize this vision with milestones. The other perennial pool of resources for healthcare is 
general taxation, which  will be  needed for some time since the GOK will continue to invest in the 
availability, quality, and affordability of primary and secondary care. Kenya’s current 
macroeconomic trend suggests that the government’s capacity to mobilize resources and transfe r 
them t o counties will increase. The Kenyan economy has grown rapidly in recent years and is 
projected to continue to grow in the medium term. The national government’s tax collection and 
the tax compliance rate are improving. Mobilizing sufficient resour ces for health will require 
continued effort for all levels of government. As in other sub -Saharan countries, the level of public 
debt continues to grow very rapidly, approaching 60 percent of the gross domestic product. 
Kenya’s need to control public debt  will re strain growth in social sector spending, especially with 
continuing security threats. Notionally, growth in government revenue mobilization has a ceiling 
imposed by structural factors such as the country’s limited natural resource and commodity exp ort 
base , significant and increasing informality in the economy, and limited manufacturing and 
modern services sectors. Counties have limited revenue -raising authority, and local tax capacity Executive Summary  
 
 10 and efforts vary widely. County revenues are highly dependent on  nationa l resource transfers. Few 
counties have a significant local tax base or collection capability, so the availability of resources for 
health will continue to depend largely on levels of national government resource mobilization and 
development partne r spendi ng. However, county spending on health is also a reflection of county 
government priorities. Overall, county spending on health is increasing; health was 25 percent of 
total county budgets in 2016/17, compared to 13 percent following devolution (20 13/14). 
Nonetheless, national averages mask considerable inter -county disparities. Nyeri, for example, 
spent 39 percent of total county government expenditures on health in 2014/15, whereas Tharaka 
Nithi spent 9.7 percent.  
Processes allocating and executin g resour ces for health have improved. Increasing 
government revenue mobilization and budgetary allocation will not guarantee predictable 
resources for health unless funds are released and executed, on time and as per plan. Under 
devolution, public funds fo r health  are mobilized at both the national and county levels. Total 
government budget allocations to health have increased in absolute terms but stagnated between 7 
percent and 8 percent of total budget across levels for the last six years. Since devoluti on, Mini stry 
of Health (MOH) expenditures have declined in absolute terms,  reflecting the reduced role of the 
MOH in terms of retained functions. At the same time, the MOH’s budget execution capacity has 
also declined; only 68 percent of the total budget w as spent  in 2015/16.  
General trends in total health expenditure suggest a continuing role for out -of-pocket 
(OOP) spending . The amount of total health expenditure pooled through insurance has 
increased, but over half of health expenditure is still financed  by hous eholds and external funders. 
Household spending is dominated by expenditures at the point of care, creating financial barriers 
and threatening the financial security of households. Despite policies like Linda Mama and free 
primary healthcare and ef forts to  increase prepayment through the NHIF, only a fraction of 
household spending on health is pooled. OOP spending accounts for almost one -third of total 
health expenditure. The continued health system and political relevance of OOP spending has 
motiva ted key national schemes and policy action.  
Health funds are increasingly pooled at the local level and contain resource transfers 
for new user fee removal schemes. Devolution fundamentally changed the way resources flow 
through the health system, giving f ar great er control and discretion for health spending to county 
governments. Counties have autonomy in managing their finances, and all resources from the 
national level must flow through county revenue funds  (CRFs). All federal funds, including those 
admi nistered  by the County MOH and some through NHIF, are allocated through the CR F. There 
are resources that flow into CR Fs as conditional grants, earmarked for certain purposes. Prior to 
the Afya Care or “UHC pilots” in four counties beginning in 2018, these  conditi onal funds primarily 
concerned funding the both free primary healthcare and Linda Mama user fee schemes. Free 
primary health services are reimbursed directly from CR Fs to public primary health facilities. 
Linda Mama has been administered as a reimb ursement  model through NHIF since 2016. NHIF 
receives funds from the national government to largely pass through  the CR F to reimburse public 
facilities, as well as contracted private facilities, for a benefits package of antenatal, delivery, 
postnatal, and  newborn  care.  
Current insurance coverage is low, though there are challenges to measurement. 
According to data from the recent Kenya Household Health Expenditure and Utilisation Survey 
(KHHEUS), approximately 20 percent of individual Kenyans reported havi ng some form of 
insurance coverage; 89 percent of those insured were covered under NHIF (MOH, 2018). These 
coverage rates vary significantly across geography and socioeconomic status. For example, 
approximately 41 percent of Kenyans in Nairobi reported hav ing insu rance coverage, while in Nyeri 
and Embu, about 32 percent were covered. In contrast, Wajir, West Pokot, Marsabit, Mander, and Executive Summary  
 
 11 Garissa all have coverage below 3 percent.  Insurance coverage is also significantly higher among 
the wealthy. Only 2.9 per cent of the lowest quintile report health insurance coverage, compared to 
42 percent of the wealthiest. There are discrepancies, however, between KHHEUS coverage 
estimates, which are driven by individual responses, and NHIF -reported coverage data. In 2018,  
NHIF re ported that based on primary membership of 7.66 million, it insures about 25 million 
Kenyans, or about 49 percent of the population. There are many possible explanations for the 
difference in coverage estimates. In dual -income households, for examp le, both  earners contribute 
from their payroll. These families may be overcounted by NHIF estimation methods that multiply 
primary members by household size. This report explores these issues in more detail, but reliable 
data on true coverage rates will be  critica l for Kenya to develop and implement effective targets and 
scale -up strategies.  
The shared roles of enhanced insurance coverage alongside tax -based h ealth 
spending need further clarity. As NHIF coverage increases, inherently public health function s 
will continue to require public financing at both the national and county levels. The GOK will need 
to mobilize greater resources for health based on the as sumption 
of continuing increased tax collection and compliance and better 
budget execution, as wel l as through public -private partnerships. 
County governments will need to finance their increasing 
responsibility for reaching and enrolling informal sector 
members in NHIF, including subsidizing premiums for the poor 
and vulnerable. This is particularly i mportant given ambitious 
NHIF scale -up targets. As articulated in the Roadmap Towards 
Universal Health Coverage , Kenya intends to achieve universal 
coverage of mandatory SHI by 2022. Expanding outwards from 
inherently social health insurance is a possible mechanism for 
advancing UHC, as discussed in the conclusion of this 
assessment, and a current four -county Afya Care pilot program is 
valuable for learning. As of December 1, 2018, citizens in Isiolo, 
Kisumu, Machakos, and Nyeri could access a defined packa ge of 
services at public facilities free of charge. True universal 
coverage, however, will require considerably  more effort; current 
NHIF coverage by one measurement standard is less than one -
fifth of the population. Therefore, there is a role for the 
expa nding private insurance sector.  The roadmap notes that 
voluntary insurance, like private or community -based sch emes, can supplement services and 
benefits, particularly while the benefits package is still being defined and expanded. Through the 
MOH, the gov ernment can improve regulations, and coordination with the private market 
complements NHIF expansion and provid es high -quality services.   
GOK targets for growth in insurance coverage are extremely ambitious and may need 
rationalization . NHIF is approachin g near -saturation in formal sector enrollment, and future 
expansion will depend on its ability to reach and ret ain informal sector members. Membership is 
compulsory for the formal sector, and contributions are reliably deducted from their payroll by 
their employers; participation is voluntary for informal sector workers. Enrolling informal sector 
members with the a bility to pay for insurance is difficult, and demand creation can be costly and of 
variable efficacy. It can also be more challenging to collect premiums from informal sector workers. 
Voluntary informal sector members are more likely to join when they are in need of services and to 
stop contributing when they are well, contributing to adverse selection. Kenya is employing a range 
of tactics to incr ease enrollment of the harder -to-reach informal sector. Cellphone -enabled 
platforms like the NHIF Mobile App, f or example, are making it easier for informal sector As NHIF coverage 
increases, inherently public 
health functions will 
continue to require public 
financing at both the 
national and county levels. 
The GOK will need to 
mobiliz e greater resources 
for health based on t he 
assumption of continuing 
increased tax collection 
and compliance and better 
budget execution, as well 
as through public -private 
partnerships.  
 Executive Summary  
 
 12 participants to save for and make contributions using M -PESA, the ubiquitous mobile money 
standard in Kenya. There are also significant county -level efforts to drive enrollment. Under the 
ongoing NHIF en rollment drives, for example, each county is responsible for targeting and 
enrolling a certain number of informal sector workers. The GOK is also  targeting poor and 
vulnerable groups, subsidizing their enrollment. This includes Kenyans over the age of 70 a nd not 
receiving pensions, as well as individuals with severe disabilities. In addition, the GOK intends to 
target public secondary school studen ts and continue enrollment of poor households.  
Familiar challenges in enrolling and retaining informal sector m embers in insurance 
exist, as do Kenyan innovations to address them.  The common challenges in enrolling the 
informal sector in Kenya, as seen els ewhere, go beyond enrollment and include raising 
contributions that allow high -quality services by mobilizing a ppropriate levels of revenue. 
Alongside efforts by county governments and nongovernment partners, NHIF is aiming at success 
in reaching the infor mal sector, much of which has some ability to pay, though re -enrollment and 
premium collectability are addition al challenges. Utilizing mobile -based financial services and 
payments, which are universal in Kenya, NHIF and other financial services offerors c an minimize 
barriers to re -enrollment and consistent contributions. While previous small micro -insurance 
provid ers using mobile technology have struggled to become financially sustainable, a few of these 
platforms have generated promise in introducing info rmal sector households to saving for future 
healthcare needs, and through a tie -up, act as a gateway for member ship in NHIF. PharmAccess -
supported M -TIBA, for example, is a mobile health wallet app which had enrolled 1.4 million users 
and paid out US$4.6 m illion (KSh 476 million) in health benefits through late 2018. Through M -
TIBA’s NHIF Bora promotion, participan ts in the scheme can make contributions toward NHIF 
monthly premiums. Innovations such as the M -TIBA app may benefit future contributory system 
expansion, as they allow health -related contributions from both the individual as well as a sponsor, 
such as an employer, in both the general m -health wallet as well as in the NHIF promotion.  
There is a need to rationally expand and deepen benefits under e xisting health 
insurance and create fiscal space to afford an increase in subsequent utilization.  As 
NHIF works  to expand coverage across these populations, it is also working to expand the services 
it offers its members. It initially included covered inpa tient services, primarily “hotel costs” of care, 
such as fees for hospital stays. Benefits have grown over time , with the most significant expansion 
following the increase in contribution rates in 2015. The primary national benefits package, 
SupaCover, now  covers an inclusive list of inpatient, outpatient, and ambulatory services, including 
for certain noncommunica ble diseases, but actual provision and stated availability of these services 
at providers for clients bearing SupaCover continue to be below expe ctation. An expert panel was 
constituted in 2018 to recommend a revised benefits package for reaching UHC, and it made its 
recommendations. The GOK will need to consider repeated cost and actuarial analyses around 
guaranteeing such a package; initial cost estimates appear to suggest that it will be expensive. It 
will be critical for NHIF to define the appropriate m echanisms to pay for any expansion of its 
guaranteed benefits, designing and implementing effective contracting mechanisms and 
determining approp riate reimbursement mechanisms to compensate providers, ensure quality, 
offer financial protection to members, and control costs. NHIF’s estimates of affording the 
expanded benefit package at an average cost per capita should be generated. Kenya will also need 
to work toward integrating the various schemes to reduce fragmentation and more effectively pool 
risk, whi ch will require harmonizing the services covered under each scheme. N ational and county 
governments will also have to continue to invest in addre ssing the supply -side constraints to 
providing high -quality health services.  
A transition in external support to the health sector is gathering speed, and the GOK 
has responded adequately . External funding is declining as a percentage of total health 
expe nditure, though with a continuing role in financing key vertical programs. Much of external Executive Summary  
 
 13 spending on health is off -budget; for example, 73 percent of external funds were off -budget in 
2015/16. This funding is increasingly targeted toward disease -specifi c programs such as HIV, 
tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal health. Off -budget support is more challenging for health 
sector strategic planning, as it is not captured in government budgets and may not easily adapt to 
shifting priorities at the county level . It may also not lead to local accountability by aligning better 
to government’s setting of priorities, whethe r these are epidemiologically and programmatically 
correct or not. In light of these trends, it is promising that government spending on health n ow 
exceeds external funding. Domestic resource mobilization will be critical both to reducing the 
burden of OOP  expenditure and closing the gaps left by declining donor funds. Further, even 
though off -budget support remains high, it is declining as a propo rtion of overall external 
resources. This offers the opportunity for increased government ownership and better coordination 
across domestic and external funders.  
Contracting levels with the private sector to expand access and choice do not 
sufficiently re flect where citizens prefer to receive services or the opportunity to 
reduce service loads at public health fac ilities.  The GOK is the primary provider and 
purchaser of health services, followed by NHIF. These purchasers do not sufficiently leverage a 
private health sector, which is playing a large role. The number of private facilities has been 
growing across all ownership types for providers, and together private health spending had a 
sixfold increase between 2009/10 and 2015/16. The extent to which Kenya ns seek and access care 
from private providers varies across health domains. Family planning, for example, is n early 
universally available at private clinics, and clients often prefer these providers due to perceived 
higher quality, faster service, geograp hical proximity, or greater privacy. HIV services, on the other 
hand, are less available in the private sector,  likely because private for -profit providers cannot 
access subsidized HIV commodities or do not have the proper equipment or training. The 
govern ment can increase access and choice by promoting an enabling environment, effective 
regulation, and strategic p urchasing mechanisms that incentivize higher affordability, quality, and 
scale of private sector services.  
There are openings to expand the priv ate sector’s role in delivery of essential 
services, though well -designed purchasing systems are required.  The NHIF has been 
contracting with an increasing number of private providers for some of its schemes. With such 
providers, the right contracting and purchasing mechanisms can create incentives to increase 
availability of high -quality, low -cost se rvices. They can also avoid unanticipated effects. For 
example, when the Marie Stopes Kenya’s Amua network of providers was contracted with NHIF, 
capitation pa yments reduced incentives for providers to offer family planning services. Without 
better structu red payments, family planning was seen as an additional cost, and provider -initiated 
family planning counseling declined. Similarly, without appropriate incent ives and oversight, there 
is opportunity for fraud. The balance between necessary oversight and t imely payments has led to 
tension between the NHIF and private providers. Strategies for tailored claims and medical 
information systems and rapid verification  could assist in scaling key services through the private 
sector in partnership with the NHIF.  
Health financing reforms, as designed, currently do not sufficiently incentivize 
expansion in broader private health market activity.  There is opportunity for g rowth in the 
private pharmaceutical and medical device sectors in Kenya, but current market condi tions and 
regulations are not supporting this growth. Over half of pharmaceuticals are procured through the 
public sector Kenya Medical Supplies Authority or t hrough Mission for Essential Drugs and 
Supplies, a faith -based nonprofit system. For many commodi ties of public health importance, these 
mechanisms rely on external funds and are required to purchase from accredited manufacturers —
and only one out of 34 Ken yan manufacturers is qualified. A major GOK policy to lease major 
medical equipment from internat ional medical device manufacturers requires further evaluation to Executive Summary  
 
 14 understand its impact on service availability and cost efficiency. Government reforms that 
gradually favor local production, including investment in manufacturing capacity toward 
internation al standards, will allow the government to procure high -quality, locally manufactured 
pharmaceuticals and for Kenya to become a competitor in the regional phar maceutical market. 
Further, there is an opportunity for increased public -private partnerships to leverage private sector 
resources and capacity for health. Current public -private partnership mechanisms are limited 
primarily to build -and-operate models that  do not take full advantage of opportunities to 
incentivize efficient, high -quality service deliv ery. New partnerships are needed that can engage 
multiple stakeholders across the health sector to collaboratively develop and implement new 
models.  
The NHIF expansion framework has pro -equity dimensions; however, resources for 
subsidizing coverage for a significant share of the poor and vulnerable must still be 
found.  Many countries planning for an SHI base to expand UHC have adopted “progressive 
universalism, ” i.e., first prioritizing coverage of the poor and vulnerable. Currently, civil servants 
and for mal sector workers, both of whom typically belong to higher wealth quintiles in Kenya, 
enjoy benefits packages that are superior to sponsored programs for need ier members. The 
financial protection principles inherent in Kenya’s Afya Care/UHC pilots of 2018 –2019 , as well as 
county -led initiatives such as MakueniCare , removing user fees around more services  and the 
parallel drives to enroll more poor and vulnerabl e households in NHIF, are laudable, though not 
easily mutually reinforcing. The GOK should follow NHIF enrollment growth with a long -term plan 
for harmo nization of benefits across the segments and required investment in the supply side of the 
health system  to allow effectively equal access to health services. The total resources to pay a fair 
premium for these subsidized groups in the future, sufficient t o sustain payments to providers of 
possibly expanded benefits as well as utilization, will require a fin ancial commitment from the 
national treasury, as well as a plan for partial contribution from county governments.  
Deepening of benefits and expansion of  coverage may lead to challenges in the 
sustainability of NHIF . Given recently revised provider payment rates and alongside any 
expanded benefits package, there may be increased stress on NHIF’s financial sustainability. These 
issues, particularly from adv erse selection in initial waves of voluntary members, as seen in other 
countries (e.g., Indonesia), can be managed if Kenya learns from best practices elsewhere when 
following an SHI -led model of insurance expansion. Efficiency improvements in its revenue 
collection, payments, and other processes are one necessary step. Here, the NHIF can also look to 
other country examples in improving quality assurance, claims management, and patient -oriented 
accountability, and in reducing voluntary members’ attrition th rough improved collection efforts. 
These challenges have been addressed in other schemes by first implem enting a more robust social 
security governance structure that allows thoughtful and multi -sectoral stewardship of the 
expanded insurance scheme. In Ken ya, as NHIF increases enrollment overall, especially in areas 
now implementing enrollment drives, these process and governance reforms need to be 
accelerated.  
Kenya’s plan for a consolidated, single -payer insurance model, building from the 
current NHIF sch emes, can be a viable model of insurance expansion if challenges 
are addressed. Success will depend on a  consolidated scheme’s ability to pool resources from a 
large and diverse enrolled population with varying levels of contribution, as well as on tax rev enue 
injected by the government. At present, this process must contend with the following key 
challenges :  
 Multiple, fragmented pools formed by separated insurance schemes limit cross -subsidy and 
risk adjustment; these need to be consolidated, which faces resistance from existing 
members.  Executive Summary  
 
 15  The NHIF has limited ability to increase its revenue given the feasibi lity of premium and 
contribution reform.  
 Benefits offered in terms of the package of interventions and limits are not harmonized 
across schemes.  
 Several user fee removal and provider reimbursement schemes exist, like Linda Mama, the 
management of which ha s been added to NHIF’s mandate, fragmenting its operations and 
the overall policy vision for financial protection.  
 Despite county governm ent efforts, there is continuing difficulty in sufficiently enrolling and 
retaining the subset of the informal sector w ith the ability to pay, and in targeting and 
increasing healthcare utilization of subsidized members (i.e., poor households, the elderly) . 
 Due to a lack of prioritization, provider payment processes and strategic purchasing 
orientation remain weak.  
Conclu sion 
There is skepticism that countries can truly advance UHC by scaling up to universal levels of 
insurance coverage through a “top -down ” approach that began, as it has in Kenya, with mandatory 
enrollment and better benefits for wealthier socioeconomic gr oups. However, with pragmatic 
incrementalism and fiscal planning, Kenya’s approach can succeed, as it has in a few countries, and 
may be feasible. The health system will very likely proceed through several phases, which are also 
suggested in the Roadmap To wards Universal Health Coverage (2018 –2022 ). These are 
highlighted in Annex B. In the immediate phase, resources for subsidizing healthca re and NHIF 
membership for a large portion of the poor and vulnerable must be allocated and effectively 
targeted. The c urrently proposed essential benefits package for UHC, or UHC -EBP, needs to be 
subjected to repeated financial sustainability analysis, fu rther prioritized according to Kenya’s 
disease burden, and made universally available to all beneficiaries if it is to attract more voluntary 
enrollment. In this transitional, interim phase up to the effective formation of SHIF —i.e., until 
universal insura nce-based benefits are defined and purchased from a broad mix of providers for 
most of the population —public, tax -funde d, free and subsidized healthcare will be critical in 
protecting against the costs of ill health and in continuing the progress in improv ed health 
outcomes. A focus on NHIF expansion does not obviate the need for strong public spending on 
primary healthcar e across levels of government, especially for strengthening health system 
resources for commodities, equipment, and the workforce. Other countries that have achieved high 
insurance coverage, as well as financial protection and improved health outcomes, hav e first 
prioritized these investments, and Kenya should accelerate its progress in the same manner.

1. INTRODUCTION  
The Government of Kenya (GOK) is committed to achieving universal health 
coverage (UHC) by 2022. The 2010 Co nstitution provides for the right to health and aims to 
ensure that all Kenyans have access to quality, equitable healthcare without suffering finan cial 
hardship. This commitment is reflected in Kenya Vision 2030 , the long -term national development 
bluepri nt, which states the country’s goal to create an efficient, high -quality healthcare system to 
improve the well -being of all Kenyans (GOK, 2007). Mos t recently, the GOK has committed to 
achieving UHC by 2022. Improved health for the population is one of the  government’s “big four” 
development priorities, which are affordable housing, economic growth, food security, and 
universal access to affordable he althcare. From 2018, the government has launched pilot 
mechanisms that work through devolved levels of gover nment and aim to reduce out -of-pocket 
(OOP) spending for health among households, and it has finalized a financing strategy for raising 
health insur ance coverage. The government’s Roadmap Towards Universal Health Coverage 
(2018 –2022) , details nine key obje ctives for achieving UHC over the next four years (see Box 1) 
(GOK, 2018).  
This report, based on work conducted by the Health Policy Plus project an d funded 
by the U.S. Agency for International Development, assesses the state of the country’s 
health financ ing system in the context of this ambitious commitment to achieve UHC 
by 2022, as well as given devolution and ongoing health financing reforms. Since the 
2010 Constitution wrote devolution into law and related implementation began after the 2013 
elections , the Kenyan health system has evolved to incorporate the role of county governments and 
new national initiatives removing user fees, with both bene fits and challenges for health service 
delivery. At the same time, the GOK is strengthening the institutions  that can deliver UHC, and 
these goals are articulated in the KHFS  (MOH, forthcoming). The proposed reforms to health 
financing arrangements, as sta ted in the KHFS, are intended to better mobilize and pool funds for 
healthcare, and as a part of this proces s, to raise insurance coverage —with the result that better 
access to health services will be achieved, utilization of health services will rise, and  financial 
protection from the costs of ill health for vulnerable families will be provided.  
Introduction  
 
 17  
As of Novemb er 2018, both the roadmap  and the KHFS identify the creation and 
expansion of the single -payer Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) as a  key health 
financing reform. Both documents envision the existing National Hospital Insurance Fund 
(NHIF), which until n ow has acted primarily as a social health insurance institution, as evolving 
into the SHIF by achieving high coverage in both formal an d informal employment sectors, with 
different levels of government subsidizing membership for the poor and vulnerable (MO H, 
forthcoming). Annex A suggests the roles of different actors in this long -term development. 
Achieving high insurance coverage will n ot be sufficient for UHC in itself if the covered benefits 
package is inappropriate or inadequate for Kenya’s disease bur den, and if resources for the public 
health workforce, supplies, and infrastructure, which continue to be primarily resourced through 
tax-based funds, remain insufficient or poorly allocated. In 2018, the GOK began the process of 
defining a benefits packag e aligned with the roles of NHIF and county governments. It also began 
“UHC pilots,” termed Afya Care, in four counties.1 This report p rovides a summary of all these 
actions against the backdrop of the recent trends in financing healthcare through the publ ic health 
system and the recent performance of NHIF. The chapters in this report summarize and discuss 
key aspects of the health financ ing system, with a view toward the potential of current reforms to 
advance UHC.  
Health financing reforms can advance UHC  by mobilizing sufficient resources to 
provide the necessary services for good health and by pooling and distributing those 
resources i n an equitable manner that ensures that everyone can access care without 
financial burden. This relationship of health se ctor reform to UHC goals can be viewed through 
the lens of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) UHC cube showing the three dimension s of 
population coverage (breadth), quality and adequacy of the package of services provided (depth), 
and level of financ ial protection (height). The health financing system should not only be able to 
                                                        
1 Beginning in  December 1, 2018, citizens in four  counties are able to  access a defined package of services at public 
facilities free of charge  with some funds flow ing through the  NHIF. Th e Afya Care pilots are intended to test the system’s 
ability to handle provision of the expanded  package and inform national expansion of such a program. The pilots are 
described further in Chapter 5 of this report . They are separat e from wholly count y-led efforts, such as the MakueniCare 
scheme in Makueni County. MakueniCare is also discussed in Chapter 5.  Box 1 . Key objectives for advancing UHC outlined in the Roadmap Towards Universal 
Health Coverage (2018 –2022)  
1. Universal coverage of health insurance  
2. Universal access to an explicit unified progressive health benefits package  
3. Increased availability and coverage of quality essential interventions  
4. Financial risk protection for all Kenyans, particularly poor and vu lnerable populations  
5. Mobilizing adequate resources for delivery of health services  
6. Efficiency in allocation and use of existing resources  
7. Equity in distribution of services and resources   
8. Effective regulation and collaboration with private medical insura nce companies 
focused on UHC

 Introduction  
 
 18 mobilize adequate resources to fill as much as possible  of this cube, but it should also manage 
funds in a manner that creates the largest pools possible, yielding the benefits  of cross -subsidy 
across the poor and the rich, the healthy and the sick, as well as greater efficiency in procurement. 
Institutions in  the system should use these pooled funds to purchase services from a diversity of 
providers in a way that ensures equity , efficiency in allocations, and technical efficiency. Health 
financing reforms can directly impact the dimensions of the cube by chang ing the extent of 
financial protection in terms of the share of healthcare costs incurred at the point of consuming 
care that is covered by a health financing scheme, especially schemes offering prepayment and 
subsidies for the poor, and the extent of the population covered and the health services included 
under health financing schemes, such as insurance or free tax -funded public provision. The way 
resources are raised for paying for healthcare matters, much depends on the ability of the public 
taxation sy stem to mobilize revenue, as well as the underlying growth in the population’s average 
incomes and ability to pay for som e proportion of its own healthcare. This report will assess the 
trends in Kenya on these fronts.  
Government -directed health financing r eforms to raise health insurance coverage 
are critical to achieve UHC, but they are insufficient on their own. Box 1 sugg ests the 
magnitude of the changes desired by the GOK for UHC in Kenya. It is clear that health financing 
reforms focused on the NHIF an d on national -level policies related to user fees for health at public 
facilities must be complemented by other measures to strengthen the overall health system, such as 
ensuring an adequate health workforce and infrastructure and involving the private sec tor in health 
service delivery and financing (GOK, 2018). Achieving UHC would also require raising awareness 
among citize ns of their health -related rights, the available health financing options and, more 
generally, on behaviors that promote better health.  These issues related to health communication 
and behavior change are outside the main scope of this report. However, thi s report does look 
beyond the currently highlighted health insurance reforms and includes discussion of trends in 
financing public heal th systems from tax -based sources and the evolving role of different levels of 
government in Kenya after devolution.  
In a ssessing how far the country has to go, Kenya has made significant progress in 
improving the health outcomes of its citizens and advancing on all three dimensions 
of the UHC cube, but progress remains incomplete and inconsistent . In an example of 
overall o utcomes, Kenya reduced under -five mortality in 2014 by 30 percent from its 2008 level. 
Infant mortality fell by nearly 25 percent  in the same period (KNBS et al., 2014). These values for 
the indicators are above the Millennium Development Goal targets for Kenya for 2015 (see Chapter 
3). The country’s UHC service coverage index, computed by WHO, was 57, which was relatively 
high in t he context of sub -Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2017). The health system still faces 
significant supply -side constraints to meeti ng overall health outcome goals, particularly with 
insufficient and unequally distributed human resources and health facilities t hat limit the country’s 
ability to expand service coverage. The GOK has responded with investment in facility equipment, 
and th e health sector workforce has grown, accompanied by the financial pressures resulting from 
paying for wages. Financing roles in t his context of supply -side needs have shifted since devolution 
toward county governments. Later chapters in this report will pr ovide further assessment of the 
trends in these areas. In a devolved system, national and county governments will have to act 
together to resolve significant disparities in access and health outcomes persisting across counties 
and household income levels.  
Though declining, the Kenyan health system continues to feature a high share of OOP 
expenditure in health spending, which has im plications for healthcare access and 
financial protection . Since financial year 2009/10, OOP expenditure has consistently accou nted 
for at least 25 percent of the total national health expenditure in periodic national health account 
analyses (MOH, forthcom ing). In 2015/16, this share was higher than resources from external Introduction  
 
 19 funders (i.e., development partners), which also signifies  an overall transition. Such OOP spending 
places a significant burden on poor and vulnerable households and acts as a barrier to care; in 
2018, one -fifth (19.4 percent) of households cited high cost as a primary reason for not accessing 
health services at a facility, a figure relatively unchanged from a previous measurement in 2013 
(MOH, 2018). These statistics worsen for poor house holds, reflected in lower per capita healthcare 
utilization rates, lower service access, and higher likelihood of foregoing fac ility-based healthcare. 
Further, the continued trend for OOP spending threatens the poorest Kenyan households with 
catastrophic h ealth expenditure (CHE).  Incidence of CHE, measured as OOP spending exceeding 
40 percent of total non -food expenditure, decline d between 2013 and 2018, though at 4.9 percent it 
is still higher than the regional estimate of 3.3 percent for Africa in 2010 (B arasa et al., 2017; MOH, 
2018). Strategies the GOK is currently exploring are to expand prepayment scheme coverage and 
target g overnment subsidies to vulnerable populations.   
The current macroeconomic and fiscal environment suggests opportunities for the 
Kenyan government to invest more in health, though this sector must compete with 
others for budgetary allocations. Gross domest ic product (GDP) has been growing between 5 
and 6 percent a year since 2014 and is forecasted to continue to grow at 6 percent to  6.5 percent 
annually in the medium term (The National Treasury, 2017). Tax reforms in recent history 
increased government reve nue, particularly through direct taxes, though recently revenues have 
underperformed compared to targets. In comparison, governme nt expenditures, both at the 
national and county levels, are increasing, and overall, the public sector remains heavily indebte d 
with a significant ratio of interest payments to total non -grant revenue. The opportunities 
presented by overall economic growt h and stable tax revenues, however, will not necessarily 
translate into increased health spending without a desire to allocate to the sector at all levels.  In 
this report, we consider the nature of devolved responsibilities for the social sector, especiall y 
health, and how county governments must allocate more from their share of a growing national 
revenue.  
Kenya is now fiscally devolved, and primary responsibility for delivering primary 
and secondary health services falls to the counties. Post -devolution,  most funds for 
primary and secondary healthcare, along with those for other needs under county jurisdiction, 
must be derived f rom the pool represented by the county revenue funds  (CRFs), which in turn 
operationalize the concept of county revenue funds. Th ese accounts receive general transfers from 
the national treasury, locally generated tax revenues, and for health, conditional grants as transfers 
from the national level for special programs such as those for user fee removal, and NHIF 
payments to county -operated facilities. These mechanisms, which were established under the 
Public Financial Management Act of 2012 (revised 2015),  force pooling through the CR Fs. This 
gives counties greater control over funding their annual development plans, but it may or m ay not 
lead to prioritization of health spending. Recent trends in county -level allocations to health are 
discussed in Chapter 4 of this report. Inefficiencies remain, and funds flowing into the CR F, i.e., 
from development partners and national government sources, are sometimes not spent as 
intended. The amount allocated to health is a question of county priorities. National insti tutions 
and their partners will have to consider what support counties need to allocate resources to health 
appropriately, such a s further institutionalization of program -based budgeting at the county level.  
The KHFS  articulates a pathway toward Kenya’s a mbitious goals for universal health 
insurance that is also outlined in the roadmap. The draft KHFS attempts to align key 
features  of Kenya’s health financing system around recently stated UHC objectives, such as 
ensuring access to quality services for the whole population without financial hardship. Although 
its centerpiece is the reformulation of NHIF as a single -payer system in th e eventual form of the 
SHIF, this strategy has to contend with the existing effectiveness of NHIF in mobilizing revenue as 
a social health insurer, purchasing services from public and private providers enrolling members Introduction  
 
 20 and serving their healthcare needs. In the last few years, NHIF has undertaken considerable 
reforms and made a major effort to appeal to potential voluntary enroll ees in the informal sector. 
Still, the prospect of major growth in NHIF’s mandate will also require the GOK to assign a benefits 
package appropriate for SHIF, and for NHIF to anticipate the financing requirements to effectively 
cover those benefits. The la tter will also involve addressing systemic weaknesses and inefficiencies, 
including reforms to NHIF governance and internal proce sses across purchasing, claims 
management, quality assurance, and other key areas (Barasa et al., 2018; MOH, forthcoming).  
Over all, this report assesses the current health financing system with an eye toward 
future reforms in support of Kenya’s progress to ward UHC. It first presents a brief 
assessment of Kenya’s progress toward UHC on key indicators, with particular attention to 
indicators of equity across counties and wealth quintiles (Chapter 3). It then assesses government 
resources for health at both th e national and county levels, with consideration of the current 
macroeconomic and fiscal context (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 present s the current state of insurance 
schemes in Kenya, including government -supported social health insurance and private schemes. 
The report then discusses other sources of financing for health, namely external and OOP 
spending, and how these sources of funds  are evolving (Chapter 6). The report also highlights 
opportunities for sustainability and efficiency in the health financing sys tem through new, 
innovative practices, and the role of the private health sector (Chapters 7 and 8).  
The analysis concludes wi th discussion of prospects of health financing reform for 
advancing UHC, given Kenya’s current landscape and goals . This discussi on includes four 
key themes, explored throughout the report:  
 The impact of devolution on health financing trends and prospects  
 The evolving role of NHIF and its readiness to lead expansion toward universal health 
insurance  
 The expanding role of the private sector in service provision  
 Transition in external financing and the basis for increased government spending on health

2. METHODOLOGY  
This assessment builds upon current and past approaches to health financing system 
assessments to provide a comprehensive, forward -looking assessment of the 
system’s role in advancing progress toward UHC. The core methods for health financing 
system assessments have evolved in recent years, along with the purpose of such analyses. Health 
financing was one of the six health system modules in the Health System Assessment Appr oach 
developed with su pport from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2008 –
2012 (Health Systems 20/20, 2012). The World Bank has also proposed a new approach, which 
emphasizes similar areas: country context, health and UHC outcomes, hea lth financing function s, 
and the health system in general (Health Financing Global Solutions Group, 2016). Current 
thinking suggests that assessments in the domain of health financing must go beyond focusing only 
on insurance or public financial management  issues and instead co mprehensively identify where 
the strengths and weaknesses lie in the context of a country’s overall efforts to achieve UHC (see, 
for example, Cavanaugh et al., 2015).  
This assessment aims to gather all the available data on the status  and functioning of 
health financing mechanisms as a basis for designing and assessing health financing 
reforms to advance progress toward UHC in Kenya. It examines the challenges and the 
opportunities to advance UHC within this context, particularly throu gh the expansion of Ke nya’s 
NHIF, given the central importance of this institution in the KHFS. This document serves as a 
companion to proposed reforms, including those in the KHFS, and for understanding their 
potential for success in advancing UHC.  
Data C ollection  
Data were collected around key modules to capture a comprehensive picture of both 
the health financing and broader health system context in Kenya. These modules guided 
the process of defining the scope of this health financing systems assessment,  as well a s to target 
the data collection process. Table 1 provides an overview of the key areas of data collection for this 
assessment. It does not reflect the ultimate organization of the report, but rather the overall 
approach to the assessment, in line  with evol ving approaches to assessing health finance systems. 
The four key themes listed in the introductory chapter informed the interpretation of the data 
collected and summarized in this report.

For this national -level systematic assessment, the study team conducted a synthesis 
of existing studies and analysis of secondary data on the Kenyan health sector (Table 
1), using a wide range of data sources.  The MOH, Ministry of Finance, Kenya National 
Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), NHIF, and Kenya Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) data were 
reviewed. The datasets included macroeconomic indicators, demographic data, health expendit ure 
and utilization, and the results of various recent household surveys, including the 2014 Kenya 
Demographic and Health Survey. Both the report of the 2015 Kenya Integrated Household Budget 
Survey (KIHBS) and the report f or the 2018 Kenya Household Healt h Expenditure and Utilisation 
Survey (KHHEUS) were used, as raw datasets for these surveys are not yet available, which 
prevented further customized analysis of key indicators. The assessment also comprised review of 
data a nd findings from peer -reviewed li terature, as well as publications from the GOK and 
international organizations involved in the health financing and public financing systems of Kenya, 
such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and WHO. As a ppropriate, to ensure 
that the mo st recent and accurate data were used, the assessment team referenced results of Methodology  
 
 23 surveys and analyses on which the USAID -funded Health Policy Plus project is currently 
collaborating with the GOK (e.g., the Kenya National He alth Accounts 2015/16  [MOH, 2017b ], and 
the 2015/16 to 2017/18 National and County Health Budget Analyses). For market -based data, 
news articles and press releases from various private companies were reviewed.

3. MONITORING PROGRESS  ON UNIVERSAL 
HEALTH COVERAGE IN KENYA  
Kenya’s health financing system will play a critical role in moving the country toward 
UHC.  Its progress on key health and UHC indicators can signal the extent to which the health 
financing system has advanced this goal thus far (see Table 2). Thi s chapter examines Kenya’s 
recent improvements in key health outcomes and the availabilit y, coverage, and utilization of 
health services. While Kenya has made significant progress toward UHC, the progress is 
incomplete against national goals, and inequitie s across counties and among wealth quintiles 
remain. Balancing investments into resolving  supply -side barriers to access and demand -side 
financial barriers to utilization will be key on Kenya’s journey toward UHC, with a role for both 
national and county g overnments.  
The GOK is committed to achieving UHC . The 2010 constitution commits to provi ding 
equitable, affordable, and high -quality healthcare to all Kenyans. This commitment is reflected in 
Kenya Vision 2030 , a long -term national development framework, as well as the Kenya Health 
Sector Strategic Development Plan (KHSSP) 2014 –2018,  which s ets medium -term targets for key 
health indicators, “accelerating progress towards UHC” (MOH, 2014c). Kenya’s goals for achieving 
UHC are in line with its commitment to  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular 
Goal 3, to “ensure healthy lives  and promote well -being for all at all ages.” More recently, UHC is a 
pillar of the government’s “Big Four” development agenda; through this agenda, the government 
has pledged to reach UHC by 2022. The Roadmap Towards Achieving Universal Health Coverage 
(2018–2022) outlines how Kenya intends to reach these commitments and to ultimately improve 
health outcomes across disease areas, geography, and socioeconomic status.  
Kenya’s 2030 development agenda sets ambitious targets for key indicators 
measuring progre ss toward UHC in terms of financial protection, health service 
utilization, health service availability and, ultimately, impact . Although there is no single 
formal UHC  framework, these targets are included throughout several key national policy and 
health strategy documents. The National Health Policy 2014 –2030, for example, has clear impact -
level indicators related to essential healthcare (MOH, 2014a). The KHSSP mid -term targets include 
reducing infant, neonatal, and maternal mortality by at least half and  reducing CHE by 30 percent 
(WHO, 2015). The Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) 
Monitoring Progress  
 
 25 Investment Framework  pushes Kenya  toward attainme nt of the SDGs by setting ambitious goals 
for RMNCAH service coverage, including increasing skilled deliveries to 87 percent and the 
contraceptive prevalence rate to 73 percent by 2020 (MOH, 2016b). The KHFS  has set clear goals 
toward susta inable health fi nancing and financial protection (MOH, forthcoming). These policies 
set 2030 goals for dimensions of UHC, including financial protection, health service utilization, 
health service availability and, ultimately, impact, such as reducing mate rnal mortality t o 113 per 
100,000 live births, under -five mortality to 24 per 1,000, and HIV incidence by 80 percent (MOH, 
2014a; NASCOP and NACC, 2014).  
The GOK has enacted several policies dedicating government resources to advance 
progress in these key health areas. In 2013, for example, the government instituted free 
maternal healthcare and abolished user fees for primary healthcare at public facilities (see Box 2). 
These policies are intended to advance UHC by lowering financial barriers and promoting 
increased use of  key services, particularly while Kenya works to expand health insurance coverage. 
Following their implementation, both policies have shown initial indications of improving Table 2 . Kenya’s progress toward key UHC -related targets

 26 utilization. However, initial implementation faced challenges in ti mely disbursemen t of funds, lack 
of clarity around what and whom the policies covered, and supply -side constraints (Maina and 
Kirigia, 2015). Further assessment is also needed to understand their ability to serve poorer, 
marginalized populations and their implications for  equity. Box 2 discusses these policies in more 
detail.  
 Box 2. User fee removal policies initiated in 2013  
Abolishing User Fees at the Primary Healthcare Level  
▪ Services covered: Primary healthcare  
▪ Facilities included: Public primary healthcare fa cilities, including public dispensaries and 
health centers  
▪ Cost reimbursed: Historical value of user fees, adjusted annually for expected increases 
in use of services  
Kenya removed most user fees at public facilities in 2004, except fo r a registration fee of either 
KSh 10 or KSh 20. Commonly referred to as the 10/20 Policy, this was intended to reduce 
barriers to healthcare for the poor and vulnerable. In reality, adherence was mixed, and facilities 
continued to charge more for services  (Onsomu et al., 2014 ). In 2013, the government 
responded by completely abolishing fees in public dispensaries and health centers. The 
2013/14 budget allocated a budget of KSh 700 million to compensate facilities for the loss of 
revenue from user fees with  funds transferred th rough the Health Sector Service Fund (HSSF) 
(Maina and Kirigia, 2015).  
Initial analysis two years after implementation indicates that the policy did, in fact, increase 
utilization of health services. Total outpatient services for child ren under five, for e xample, 
increased by 25 percent. The same study implied some pro -poor benefits, such as an increase in 
the use of public facilities by lowest quintile patients, but further study is required to determine 
the equity impacts more conclus ively (Maina and Kiri gia, 2015).  
The policy’s initial rollout faced challenges in implementation and funding. There was a lack of 
clarity around who was covered by the policy and for what services (Maina and Kirigia, 2015). 
Further, the funds administered through the HSSF ofte n saw delays in disbursement, and 
interviews conducted shortly after the implementation of the policy suggested that facilities 
found the compensation insufficient (Onsomu et al., 2014; Maina and Kirigia, 2015). Under the 
devolved syst em, funds now flow di rectly through county revenue accounts to health facilities, 
with the intention of increasing efficiency and county ownership. This is discussed further in 
Chapter 4.  
Free Maternal Health care (Linda Mama)  
▪ Services covered: Package of benefits for women an d newborns through the first year, 
including antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care  
▪ Facilities included: Contracted public and private facilities  
▪ Costs reimbursed: Capitation payment for outpatient services (KSh 1200); fee -for-service 
for deliveries and inpatient services  Monitoring Progress  
 
 27  
Comparing current health indicators to national targets suggests that Kenya has 
more work to do to reach its ambitious targets. There are gaps between the current status 
and 2030 targets for seve ral indicators, including for government health spending, acc ess to care, 
financial protection, and the maternal mortality ratio (Table 3). Meeting these targets will require 
improved health financing combined with reorganization of service delivery, as we ll as efforts to 
increase demand and utilization of health se rvices. Health -seeking behavior, stigma against certain 
populations, and other demand -side barriers will also need to be addressed.  
Kenya made considerable progress toward the health -related targ ets of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but it still faces significant gaps. Overall, 
Kenya’s 2015 UHC “service coverage index” was 57, based on a composite of different service 
delivery indicators analyzed by WHO (WHO, 2017). This is relatively hi gh for its region. For 
example, the 2014 Kenya Demographic an d Health Survey (KDHS) reports that nearly 90 percent 
of children are fully immunized against measles, and 95.5 percent of women receive at least one 
antenatal care visit (KNBS et al., 2014). Oth er indicators, however, fall further from their targets. In 2013, the Kenyan government implemented a policy of free maternity health services in all 
public health facilities. Similar to removing user fees, the intention was to remove financial 
barriers to accessing he alth services. The go vernment hoped to increase utilization of maternal 
health services and, as a result, improve health outcomes. The government committed KSh 3.8 
billion in the first fiscal year, transferred through the HSSF, to compensate facilities for  free 
services provid ed under the policy. This fund was intended to reimburse the full cost of these 
services (unlike the KSh 700 million allocated in 2013/14 to compensate solely for the loss of 
user fee revenue).  
Evidence suggests that this policy has ha d success. In the fir st month after it was implemented, 
the Kenyan Director of Public Health and Sanitation estimated a 10 percent increase in 
institutional visits (PSI Impact Blog, 2013). An initial study evaluating the impact of the policy 
indicated that  the mean number of d eliveries increased by 64 percent at Kakamega County 
Referral Hospital and confirmed a significant increase in national utilization of delivery services 
(Asule et al., 2017).  
Initially, however, the policy faced many implementation cha llenges, including fu nding and 
supply -side resource constraints. One hospital reported, for example, that it previously charged 
KSh 5,000 per normal delivery and KSh 10,000 per caesarean. The policy had a flat 
reimbursement rate of KSh 5,000, creating a si gnificant financial g ap (Bourbonnais, 2013). 
Further, like the user fee reimbursement, these funds were administered through the HSSF, 
which saw frequent delays.  
The government relaunched the program in 2017 under the name Linda Mama. Under the new 
progra m, reimbursement is m anaged by the NHIF (MOH, 2016d). These reimbursement 
mechanisms are discussed further in Chapter 4. Service delivery points were also expanded to 
include 2,700 private sector and faith -based facilities. It now also offers a broader ben efits 
package includi ng outpatient and inpatient services for mothers and newborns (Munge et al., 
2017; Star Reporter, 2018). These reforms are intended to more efficiently and rationally 
reimburse facilities to improve sustainability and further expand ac cess to free services . While 
the package of services covered by the scheme has expanded, however, the actual provision of 
services beyond deliveries is still being implemented. As insurance coverage expands, Linda 
Mama is expected to play a growing role as  a bridge to cover, a nd ultimately enroll, uninsured 
women in the national NHIF scheme (GOK, 2018).   Monitoring Progress  
 
 28 For example, maternal mortality remains high. Over the 2007 –2014 survey period, it was 362 
deaths per 100,000 live births, against the MDG target of 147 (although well below the 1990 
baseline of 590 deaths) (KNBS et al., 2014; Ministry of Devolution and Planni ng, 2014). Under -five 
mortality nearly halved from the 1990 baseline of 98 deaths per 1,000 births to 52, but it is still 
well above the target of 32 (KNBS et al., 2014; Ministry of Devolution an d Planning, 2014). These 
numbers also mask geographic dispari ties. The under -five mortality rate in Nyanza Province is 82, 
and in Nairobi it is 72. North Eastern and Central Provinces, in contrast, have under -five mortality 
rates of 44 and 42, respectively  (KNBS et al., 2014).

Access to UHC -related Tracer Primary Healthcare Indicators  
Closing the gaps in progress toward Kenya’s healt h goals will require expanding 
access to key interventions, particularly around RMNCAH and infectious diseases.  
The WHO and World Bank UHC monitoring framework includes key health service coverage 
indicators (WHO, 2015). Distinct from MDG health outcome in dicators, this framework includes  a 
broad set of intervention indicators for preventive and promotive services across different levels of 
the health system. Figure 1 shows Kenya’s progress in providing these services, relative to a group 
of economic peer c ountries in sub -Saharan Africa. K enya shows strong performance across key 
tracer indicators and generally has higher levels of coverage than its peers. However, low coverage 
of certain services such as antimalarial treatment among children under five (27 p ercent) indicates 
that Kenya face s some remaining challenges in reaching the population with comprehensive basic 
health services (Figure 1).  Monitoring Progress

Availability of Essential Services  
The Kenya Essenti al Package for Health (KEPH) has  formed the basis of a newly 
defined package of key benefits in line with the country’s long -term health goals, as 
well as goals for financing and essential service availability. The original KEPH was 
aligned with six object ives: to eliminate communicable diseases, combat the rising burden of 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), reduce the burden of violence and injuries, provide essential 
services, minimize exposure to risk factors, and strengthen collaboration among health -related 
sectors (MOH, 2013b). In 201 2, the KHSSP defined the services to be included in the KEPH, but 
these services were never formally procured or guaranteed by the GOK and actual coverage has 
been variable. The Roadmap Towards Universal Health Coverage (201 8–2022) notes, however, 
that the  KEPH was the basis for the UHC -Essential Benefit s Package (UHC -EBP) determined by an 
advisory panel formed in June 2018, where the UHC -EBP is the package to which all Kenyans will 
be guaranteed access under UHC -oriented sch emes. This package was not forma lly released and 
was subjected to an initial costing. The UHC pilots/Afya Care program, described in Chapter 5, is 
being used to test the provision of such a package in four counties representative of varying 
populations and  disease burdens. The four count ies—Nyeri, Kisumu, Machako, and Isiolo —have 
high proportions of NCDs, infectious diseases, injuries, and nomadic populations, respectively. 0 20 40 60 80 100

 30 This basic package is intended to expand progressively over time and ultimately to b e purchased by 
NHIF (see Chapter  5) (GOK, 2018). The ability of the system to deliver the UHC -EBP will likely 
follow similar recent trends seen in Kenya’s ability to deliver the KEPH.  
Expanding coverage of key interventions requires that health facilities be equipped 
to provide an adequa te package of essential services. The services included in the KEPH 
were well defined by the KHSSP in 2012, but the extent to which they were actually being delivered 
was less clear. To measure the extent to which facilities  were delivering KEPH services, the 2013 
Service Availability and Readiness Assessment Mapping (SARAM) assessed the availability of 
services along a set of tracer indicators on the availability of inputs and the readiness of health 
facilities to provide de fined interventions at all facil ities and management units (MOH, 2013b). 
More recently, the 2016 Service and Readiness Assessment (SARA) assessed a regionally and 
nationally representative sample of facilities across the same indicators to measure progress  
(MOH, 2016e).  
Overall, the two assessments showed improvement in coverage of KEPH 
interventions. Figures 2a and 2b show that between 2013 and 2016, there was a 14 percentage -
point increase in the mean availability index of the full KEPH (from 41 percent t o 55 percent). 
Health facilities  providing the full range of essential services improved from 27 percent to 67 
percent, and services for the elimination of communicable conditions rose from 2 percent to 23 
percent. Additional specific services linked to ke y health programs improved signi ficantly. The 
number of health facilities providing immunization services increased by 21 percentage points, and 
the number of facilities offering maternity services doubled. Two -thirds of facilities were screening 
for NCDs in 2016, compared to 28 percent in 2013. Integrated maternal and family planning 
services rose by 20 percentage points (MOH, 2013b, 2016e).    
While there have been overall improvements, availability of services varies 
significantly across health areas.  For example, in 2016, services addr essing communicable 
disease elimination were the most available (71 percent), while services aimed at reducing violence 
and injuries were the least available (48 percent). More than two -thirds of the facilities had the full 
scope of services aimed at provi ding essential health services, while no facilities had the full range 
of services linked to violence and injuries, noncommunicable conditions, or exposure to risk factors 
(MOH, 2016e).  
The availability of some essential me dicines has improved since 2013, but Kenya still 
struggles to insure availability across facilities and conditions. The availability of 
medicines is considered one of the most important elements of quality by healthcare  users, and the 
absence or stock -out of medicines is a key factor in the underutilization of public health services. At 
the time of the SARA survey in 2016, 69 percent of the facilities had some essential medicines 
available, but only 16 percent had all of  them. Availability of different trac er essential medicines 
varies across condition types. Essential medicines for acute conditions were more available across 
facilities (more than 70 percent), compared with those of chronic conditions (30 percent to 68 
percent) (MOH, 2016e). Amoxicillin was available in 69 percent of facilities in 2013 and 89 percent 
in 2016 (MOH, 2013b, 2016e). In 2016, the mean availability for tracer maternal health medicines 
was 64 percent for all facilities. However, availability of m etronidazole (28 percent) and calcium  
gluconate injectable (41 percent) was low (MOH, 2016e).  Monitoring Progress

There are also substantial differences in service availability at the county level.  
Although the more recent SARA, conducted with a nationally representative sample of facilities, 
does not report service av ailability by county, the 2013 SARAM shows these data (MOH, 2013b, 
2016e). Table 4 highlights counties with the highest and lowest availability of select key services at 
primary care facilities. Mombasa and Nairobi, for example, reported the lowest availab ility for 
services related to immuniz ation, child health, antenatal care, and prevention of mother -to-child 
transmission of HIV, whereas Kisii, Nyamira, and Isiolo reported the highest availability of these 
services (MOH, 2013b).  54

Geographic Distribution of Health Infrastructure and Workforce  
National estimates obscure 
significant int er-county disparities 
for key indicators of supply -side 
availability.  The bed -to-population ratio 
provides a key infrastructure indicator of 
the capacity of health facilities to 
accommodate and provide services to the 
patients. The national average is 14 
inpatient beds per 10,000, which is 
unchanged since 2013. There are la rge 
disparities across counties, with bed 
population ratios as low as five inpatient 
beds per 10,000 population in Turkana and 
as high as 25 inpatient beds per 10,000 in 
Kericho (Figure 3 ).  
Similar disparities are evident in the 
distribution of health fac ilities. The 
2017 master facility list identified a total of 
8,854 health facilities, approximately two 
per 10,000 people nationally. At the county 
level, the average facility density is 
approximately 2.13 per 10,000 (MOH, 
2013b). Figure 4 highlights the d isparity in 
distribution across counties. Eight counties 
have an average facility ratio of more than 
40 percent above the average. Twelve have 
an average facility ratio more than 25 perce nt below the national average. Wajir has the lowest 
facility density,  at just over 1.1 facilities per 10,000. Nyeri and Nyandarua both have more than four 
facilities per 10,000.  Figure 3.  Beds per 10,000 people, select

 33 Disparities also exist in the density of health workers across counties.2 In 2013, the 
SARAM reported a national average number of doctors (exclud ing dentists and clinical officers) of 
5.1 per 100,000 people. That number has improved over the last few years, to almost 5.3 in 2016. 
Despite progress, there is considerable variation a cross counties, as seen in Figure 5. Turkana and 
Marena, for example,  have less than one doctor per 100,000; Kisumu, Nairobi, Nyandarua, Embu, 
and Garissa all have more than 10 (GOK, 2018).3

Facility staffing gaps in Kenya remain high . Figure 6 shows significant gaps in staffing 
between the actual and required levels set by the 2014 guidelines for human resources for health 
norms and standards for the KHSSP. These staffing levels were estimated based on prioritization of 
a minimum number of health work ers in each facility, based on expected services to be delivered as 
defined in the KEPH.  These data , however, may not reflect recent improvements. In -country 
stakeholders note that since devolution, counties have made significant efforts to fill these gaps . 
More recent data are necessary to assess whether these efforts have been successful in closing 
human resource gaps.  
Geographic accessibility has significant implications for utilization, and the 2014 
KDHS indicates that this has improved.  For example, 8 9 percent fewer respondents reported 
distance to health facilities as a reason for not seeking care  in 2013 than in 2003 (KNBS et al., 
2014). However, the 2018 KHHEUS found that the percentage of people who reported distance to 
health facilities as a reaso n for not seeking care increased from 1.8 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 
2018, though this was sti ll an 80 percent decline from 15.1 percent in 2003. In addition, according 
to the 2013 KHHEUS, the average time taken to reach a health facility for outpatie nt services was 
46 minutes (East Central and Southern Africa Health Community, n.d.; MOH, 2013a).  
                                                        
2 Data disaggregated by county and type of health worker other than doctors (medical officers) are not available.  
3 County -level  population data came from the Kenya National Bure au of Statistics 2015 County Statistical Abstracts . 
These are projections based on 2009 census data. Since there are not county -level population data available for each of 
the relevant years for facility an d human resource data, county densities may not be  exact but still provide a useful 
illustration of the relative availability of health resources across counties.

Healthcare utilizatio n rates have general ly increased over the last 10 years. According 
to the KHHEUS 2018, the volume of outpatient services increased by 90 percent, from 4.8 million 
to 9.1 million from 2003 to 2018. The average number of visits per person increased from 1.9 to 3.1 
from 2003 to 2015, but it fell t o 2.5 in 201 8. Simultaneously, the share of respondents who 
reported a si ckness but did not seek care increased (Figure 7). While there has not been rigorous 
analysis to e xplain this decline, the 2018 KHHEUS report posits that it could be the result of a 
healt h workers’ strike that took place before the survey was conducted, on the one hand, and on the 
other, an increase in self-medic ation, which incre ased from 30.7 percent in 2013 to 45.2 percent in 
2018 as a reported reason for not seeking care (MOH, 2018). 
Figure 7. Trends in  healthcare-seeking behavior in Kenya, 2003 –2018 
Despite overall progress, wide inter -county variations in per capita utilization  and

36 Equity of Access across Socioeconomic Strata 
Overall, availability of and access to services have increased over the last 10 years,  
but inequities remain a challenge when considering socioeconomic groups. Figure 1 0 
shows that coverage of key tracer interventions varies significantly across wealth quintiles. The 
lowest wealth quintile had significantly less access to four out of six ke y interventions when 
compared to the top quintile, with gaps in intervention cover age ranging from 60.5 percent to 80.4 
percent between 2014 and 2015 (KNBS et al., 2014).  
Figure 10. Access to healthcare by wealth quintile, 2014

Deliberate pro -poor policies have increased the use of health services among the 
poor, but they nonetheless lag behind higher -income groups. KHHEUS 2013 data 
showed an overall increase in outpatient utilization rates betwee n 2003 and 2013, with rates 
incre asing more quickly among the poor; the three lowest quintiles increased 64 percent on 
average, compared to 48 percent on average for non -poor populations (Figure 11) (MOH, 2013a). 
However, KHHEUS 2018 data showed that outpa tient utilization rates have fall en since 2013; the 
three lowest quintiles decreased by 21 percent on average, compared to a decrease of 16 percent on 
average for non -poor populations. The government is the largest provider of outpatient and 
inpatient serv ices, and this is especially true  for the poor. Public health facilities accounted for 59 
percent of all outpatient visits; among the poorest quintile, public facilities accounted for 63 
percent of admissions, compared to 37.2 percent for the wealthiest (M OH, 2013a, 2018).  
According to th e KHHEUS 2013, unmet healthcare needs decreased by 44 percent 
between 2003 and 2013, reflecting improvements in access to healthcare.  However, 
according to the KHHEUS 2018, unmet healthcare needs are now above 2007 levels, having 
increased by 120 percent b etween 2013 and 2018 (MOH 2013a, 2018). The survey defines unmet 
need as the proportion of individuals who reported illness in the four weeks preceding the survey 
but did not seek healthcare. Unmet need fell from 22.8 perce nt to 12.7 percent from 2003 to 2 013, 
but it rose to 28 percent in 2018. Like the decrease in the utilization rate from 2013 to 2018, 
possible explanations for this increase in unmet need include a national health worker strike that 
took place prior to the  survey and an increase in self -medication. However, significant variations 
exist across counties, with rates as high as 40 percent above the national average. This suggests 
that underlying economic, social, and cultural conditions affect access to care. I n 2013, Tana River, 
Samburu, Tran s Nzoia, Nakuru, and Kericho all reported high levels of unmet need (28 percent, 40 020406080100

these counties (except Samburu) had a faci lity density below the estimated national average, and 
three out of five had a medical personnel density below the national average.

Financial Protection against the Costs of I ll Health  
Kenya has made progres s in reducing OOP healthcare costs, but more progress is 
needed to ensure financial protection for households against the costs of seeking 
healthcare. The KHFS aims to improve financial protection, reducing the burden of OO P health 
expenditures on househol ds (MOH, forthcoming). OOP trends and patterns can be used as a 
measure of the level of financial protection provided to citizens by the health system. OOP health 
expenses place households at higher risk of incurring catast rophic expenditures, directly aff ecting 
living standards and sometimes pushing individuals below the poverty line. According to the 
preliminary results of the Kenya National Health Accounts 2015 –2016, household OOP as a 
percent of total health expenditure  decreased by 5 percent, from 25 percent to 24 percent, between 
2010 and 2016. More progress is needed; however, the country is progressing toward its target of 
15 percent of total health expenditure  (MOH, forthcoming).   
Financial access to health service s remains a barrier to use of car e despite 
noteworthy improvements between 2003 and 2018, indicating a need for greater 
effort from the government to increase financial protection.  The KHHEUS 2018 data 
show that the percentage of households declaring high cost of healthcare as the main re ason for not 
accessing health services fell from 36.3 percent to 19.4 percent (MOH, 2018). Although this is a 47 
percent decrease, it still indicates that a significant demand -side barrier remains.  
The poorest households, w ho have greater health needs, are  less likely to seek care, 
and they spend significantly less on health. The highest burden of poverty is in rural areas. 
Among rural households, self -reported illness is 3.2 times higher for the bottom two wealth 
quintiles compared with households in the t op two quintiles  (MOH, 2018). This same part of the 
population, however, is also the least likely to seek care. Also, among rural households, the poorest 
two quintiles are 44 percent as likely not to seek care compared with  their wealthier counterparts 
(MO H, 2018). Despite the higher disease burden, the average annual total per capita spending on 
outpatient and inpatient care is 2.29 times less among individuals in the bottom two wealth 
quintiles compared to the top two.  1.72.32.7

 38 Catastrophic health expenditure pushes more than half a million Kenyans annually 
into poverty. Data from the 2007 KHHEUS show that 16 percent of households incurred OOP 
payments at the threshold of 10 percent of household budget. The poorest households wer e 66 
percent more likely to incur catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) compared to the richest 
households (Chuma and Maina , 2012). 
Based on this threshold, there has been a 
steady decline in the proportion of 
households assessed as facing such CHE 
(Figure  12) from 2007 to 2018, the year of 
the most recent survey. However, trends 
across socioeconomic groups suggest 
underlying inequity in these outcomes. A 
recent multivariate analysis by Barasa et 
al. in 2017, based on data from the 2013 
KHHEUS, found that t hat among 
households in the poorest quintile, 
households were 6.53 times more likely to 
incur CHE compared to the richest 
households when using a different 
threshold for CHE (OOP health spending 
exceeding 40 percent of total household 
non-food expenditures ). The differences 
were also stark comparing rural, under -
resourced counties such as Turkana, 
compared to others such as Makueni and Lamu. When looking at the impoverishment effect of 
CHE, the study found that nearly 620,000 Kenyans in 2013 were pushed int o poverty by OOP 
payments for healthcare (Barasa et al., 2017). There is also significant regional variation, with the 
likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure 80 percent higher in rural areas than in urban ones.  
Discussion  
Kenya has made significant  progress in improving access to healthcare and health 
outcomes in recent years . The use of outpatient services increased by 32 percent between 2003 
and 2018 (MOH 2013a, 2018). Mean availability of services increased across health areas over the 
same perio d, and Kenya outperformed its peers in several key UHC indicators, including 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, contraceptive prevalence rate, and skilled birth attendance.   
Progress, however, is still incomplete against national goals, and there are persistent 
disparities across geography and socioeconomic status. For example, in Kenya, maternal 
and under -five mortality, for example, have fallen nearly 40 and 50 percent, respectively, from 
1990 baseline levels. Yet, they still remain well above the co untry’s 2015 MDG targets. Access to 
health services varies by county, as seen in the range of facility and human resource densities 
presented above, further reflected in the wide range of healthcare utilization rates. Poor Kenyans 
are also far less likely to access health services than their wealthier counterparts, in part a reflection 
of the high burden of OOP expenditures.  
Kenya will have to continue to invest public funds to improve the availability, quality, 
and distribution of health system resources,  but structural inflexibility in health 
spending may be a constraint. The investment needs in health are highlighted in the Roadmap 
Towards Universal Health Coverage (2018 –2022) , with a particular focus on investing in quality 
primary healthcare services, facilities, and equipment, as well as in human resources (GOK, 2018). 
If Kenya is to ultimately guarantee universal access to an expanding package of basic services, Figure 12. Trend in incidence of  household -level

 39 counties must be able to invest in underlying health infrastructure, service preparedness,  and 
improved health worker competence. Under devolution, counties are responsible for the majority 
of direct service delivery. Counties receive the majority of their revenue from the national Treasury 
and have discretion over how to spend it. Much health spending is recurrent, and at least 71 
percent in total at the county level is focused on wages. Improving the availability of services and 
health outcomes will require that counties raise sufficient overall revenue for the sector, prioritize 
health, and t arget their specific supply -side barriers to care, including what is lacking in capital 
infrastructure and essential commodities. However, investing in public facilities is only one 
modality to affect access to services. Counties can also explore contracti ng out or otherwise 
purchasing services from private providers, which is currently infrequently done.   
Kenya wants to advance an ambitious UHC agenda under fiscal constraint, which 
requires it to simultaneously balance resolving demand - and supply -side bar riers 
affecting healthcare utilization of the poor. Effective health insurance coverage can help 
reduce financial and other demand -side barriers to care and may raise healthcare utilization 
among the poor. The success here is depe ndent on NHIF’s ability to  enroll and subsidize the poor 
and vulnerable. Anticipating increases in insurance coverage, government resources will be critical 
to preparing public health facilities to meet any future expansion in utilization of services, whic h 
may have recently platea ued or even declined. It is unclear if private for -profit and not -for-profit 
facilities will be similarly incentivized to make the investments for service improvement, even if 
this improvement is made a prerequisite to contracting  under an expanded insuran ce scheme. 
County governments, with increasing responsibility for health under the devolved system, will have 
to shoulder most of this infrastructure and health system input -related financial obligation for 
public facilities. The ongoing Afya Care pilot pr ograms for UHC in a few counties  (intended to 
expand nationally ), is one modality to push new resources through county systems and enhance 
service availability at public facilities  (Afya Care is described further in Chapter 5 ). The pilots may 
provide valua ble insight in county governments’ ability to successfully use such new incremental 
per-capita financial flows to expand access and quality. However, beyond understanding if the 
county hospital system can cope with rising demand, it is unclear how the pilo ts’ lessons will 
inform a future where reducing financial barriers and purchasing of care are driven more through 
an insurance model. In this context, Chapter 4 discusses the financial flows for health between the 
national and cou nty levels in more detail.  Chapter 5 presents NHIF plans for scale -up, including 
efforts to expand coverage of poorer populations.  Government Resources

4. MOBILIZING AND DEPLO YING 
GOVERNM ENT RESOURCES FOR HE ALTH  
Current and future mac roeconomic and fiscal conditions in Kenya have important 
implications for the government’s role in advancing UHC. They directly affect the 
government’s ability to mobilize and pool resources for health. This c hapter examines the 
macroeconomic and fiscal co ntext, its implication for resource mobilization for health, and how 
these resources currently flow through the devolved system.   
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Context  
The current economic forecast suggests that t he Kenyan economy will expand in the 
medium ter m, spurred by government investment in infrastructure, consumer 
demand, and private investment (Kiringai and Kristensen, 2016). After a period of poor 
economic performance in 2008 –2009, Kenya has registered st rong economic growth since 2010. 
While growth h as not consistently hit targets (projected growth rates for 2010, 2011, and 2012 were 
6.2 percent, 8.3 percent, and 9.1 percent, respectively with actual rates of 3.3 percent, 8.4 percent, 
and 6.1 percent, res pectively), the economy has continued to grow  (GOK, 2012). Under a newly 
elected government in 2013, the Kenyan economy recorded significant growth despite a general 
global economic slowdown (5.7 percent in 2016 compared to 4.3 percent in 2013).4 This compares 
well with other countries in the region (F igure 13) (IMF, 2016).  
The economy is projected to further expand by 6.1 percent in 2017 and approximately 
6.5 annually over the next four years (The National Treasury, 2017). This is supported by 
strong private consumption and output in agriculture with a  stable weather outlook, as well as 
                                                        
4 Kenya revised its GDP computation methodology (rebasing) by using 2009 as the base year in place of 2001. The 
rebasing resulted in an upward revision of the nominal GDP by 25 percent from USD 44.1 billion to USD 55.2 billion. 
After the country’s GDP was rebased, the growth rate for 2013 was revised upwards to 7.2 percent from 4.3 percent.  
Government Resou rces 
 41 completion of key public projects in roads, 
rail, and energy generation. Consumer 
demand, private sector investment, and a 
generally stable macroeconomic 
environment will help reinforce the 
projected growth. Other key m acroeconomic 
indicators have remained  stable for the last 
10 years. For instance, the annual average 
inflation has been contained by the Central 
Bank of Kenya at below seven percent for 
the last 10 years. While the economic 
outlook is favorable, the Kenyan  economy 
does remain vulnerable to ri sks such as 
potential security threats, drought 
conditions, and global market volatility 
(IMF, 2014).   
From 2010 –2016, the GOK’s total 
revenue averaged 25 percent of GDP. 
After rebasing the GDP in 2014, the ratio of 
revenue to GDP fell from 25 to 19 perce nt 
due to the increase in measured GDP. Total 
revenue, however, increased from KSh 651 
billion (US$7.75 billion) in 2010/11 to KSh 
1.24 trillion in 2015/16 (US$12.4 billion).  
Tax revenue increased from 20 percent of 
GDP  in 2010/11 to about 27 percent in 
2015/16. When compared with other low - to 
middle -income economies whose tax 
revenue to GDP ratios are between 8.5 
percent and 35 percent, Kenya performs 
notably well (Figure 14). Income and value -
added taxes have contribu ted revenue of at 
least 12 percent of  the GDP since 2000/01. 
The country’s positive revenue performance 
provides a fiscal environment conducive 
both in short - and long -term growth 
objectives (Ministry of Devolution and 
Planning, 2013).  
Recent significant t ax reforms have increased tax revenue s, particularly from income 
taxes. The increase in total tax revenue is largely attributed to significant increases in income tax 
revenue, which increased from KSh 272 billion in 2010/11 to KSh 570 billion in 2015/16 (T he 
National Treasury, 2017). From 201 0 to 2016, taxes contributed about 91 percent of total revenue 
(KNBS, 2015, 2016, 2017). The improved performance of income taxes is largely attributed to 
higher tax compliance. The Kenya Budget Statement of 2016/17 ann ounced tax amnesty, which is 
intended  to increase foreign income declared in Kenya (KPMG, 2017). Coupled with the use of 
personal identification numbers for tax assessment, income tax revenue is expected to increase 
further in the future. Tax revenues are projected to expand to about KSh 1.83  trillion 2019/20 (The 
National Treasury, 2017).  Figure 13. East African Community country

 42 Despite increasing trends in tax 
collection, the GOK has not met its 
revenue targets. For instance, by the end 
of March 2017, Kenya’s total revenues 
amounted to KSh 984. 6 billion against a 
target of KSh 1.05 trillion, falling below the 
target by 7 percent (Anyanzwa, 2017). As the 
country moves toward UHC and also aims to 
support implementation of capital -intensive 
development projects in a bid to achieve 
middle -income sta tus, Kenya needs to 
strengthen its capacity to raise reve nue. 
Mobilization is limited by structural factors 
such as low per capita income, a large 
informal sector, and small manufacturing 
and modern services sectors. Kenya’s tax 
revenue is also largely dep endent on income 
taxes, which accounted for approximately  
half of total tax revenue in 2015/16 (Figure 
15). The IMF, however, noted significant 
improvements in the first quarter of 2016/17 
in revenue collection from value -added tax 
(VAT) and excise taxes f rom improvements 
in the i-Tax and Excise Goods Management  
Systems, as well as VAT withholding (IMF, 
2017).  
Growth in government expenditures 
has outpaced growth in revenue, 
contributing to a need for deficit 
financing with debt. Total government 
expenditur e increased from KSh 1.5 trillion 
in fiscal year ( FY) 2013/14 to KSh 2.5 trillion 
in FY 2016/17. This was largely driven by 
ongoing infrastructure investment in roads 
and energy, security expenditure, and a 
rising civil servant wage bill (KNBS, 2017). 
In absolute terms, both recurrent and 
development expenditure s have increased at 
the national level, but recurrent expenditure 
has declined as a percentage of total 
expenditure (Figure 16). The aggregate fiscal 
envelope has increased over the last 10 
years, an d public expenditure now stands at 
about 27 percent of GD P in 2016. The 
current level of government expenditure as a 
share of GDP puts Kenya on par with or 
above other countries in the region (Figure 
17). Between 2010 and 2016, revenue 
growth rates fell 1. 4 percentage points down 
from 19.8 percent of GDP to 18.4  percent. Figure 15. Average composition of tax revenue,

 43 Expenditures increased by 5.8 percent points during the same period, which pushed the 
government to borrow to finance the budget deficit (KNBS, 2015, 2016; The National Treasury, 
2016).  
Ken ya’s public debt has increased in the past six years. At the end of financial year 
2015/16, total public debt amounted to KSh 3.62 trillion compared to KSh 1.49 trillion in 2010/11, 
a twofold increase when accounting for exchange rate fluctuations (Figure 18). As a percentage of 
GDP, total public debt increas ed from 43 percent in 2010/11 to 58 percent in 2017/18 (IMF, 2018). 
Trends suggest that it may continue to increase to 63 percent by FY 2019, thereafter declining if the 
GOK takes adjustment actions. Do mestic debt increased from KSh 764.2 billion in 2010/1 1 to KSh 
1.95 trillion in 2015/16. On the other hand, external debt increased from KSh 723 billion in 2010/11 
to KSh 1.80 trillion in 2015/16 (KNBS, 2015, 2016, 2017; The National Treasury, 2016). With no 
change in government fiscal policies, public debt i s, however, expected to stabilize at around 66 
percent of GDP in 2020/21 and gradually decline thereafter (The National Treasury, 2017; IMF, 
2018). Half of Kenya’s public debt is owed to external credit ors (The National Treasury, 2016, 
2017). Reducing the fiscal deficit over the medium term is essential to limit and eventually reverse 
the rise in public debt ratio.  
Figure 18. Government revenues, expenditures, deficit, and public debt as percentage of GD P 
 
The central government has increased spending on e conomic affairs,5 general public 
services, and debt repayments, while reducing the proportion of spending on social 
services.6 The proportion of spending on economic affairs increased from 16 percent of  total 
government spending in 2013/14 to 25 percent in  2015/16. Spending on functions like public debt, 
transfers between levels of governments, grants, and general public services were significant, 
although spending has been decreasing. Spending on educat ion fell from 17 percent of total 
spending in 2013/14 to 14 percent in 2015/16. Health sector spending has remained almost the 
same at 2.6 percent since 2013/14 (Figure 19). By economic classification, national government 
spending has concentrated on compe nsation of employees (20.3 percent in 2016), grants (2 2.3 
percent), public debt redemption (11 percent), capital grants to state owned enterprises (10.8 
percent), and interest on both domestic and external loans (10.6 percent).

Kenya is now fiscally devolved, and counties have significant responsibility for public 
service delivery. Counties and the national level subdivide discretiona ry budget expenditures.7 
In line with the 2010 Constitution, the national government provides resources and support to 
counties to ensure effective delivery of public goods and services. In time, the national government 
expenditure was expected to decline as county governments took over certain public services. 
However, this has yet to be the case. As Figure 20 shows, national -level transfers to counties in 
form of sharable revenue equaled about 3.9 percent of GDP in 2013/14, 4.1 percent in 2014/15, and 
3.9 percent in 2015/16. In absolute terms, in 2013 /14, county governments were allocated KSh 
236.3 billion as part of the sharable revenue (World Bank, 2014a). This amount increased to KSh 
361.5 billion in 2016/17, an increase of about 53 percent (Figure 21).  The total allocations to county 
governments co nsisted of sharable revenue,8 conditional grants, and locally generated revenues. 
Sharable revenues accounted for an average of 82 percent of the total allocations, conditional 
grants (5 percent), and annual l ocal revenues (13 percent). Most counties have limited capacity to 
locally generate revenues, which have been low. In 2013, for example, county governments targeted 
collecting about 1.2 percent of GDP as locally generated resources but only collected 0.5 p ercent 
(World Bank, 2014a).9   
7 The national budget includes Consolida ted Fund Services, which covers servicing the national debt, pensions, and 
international commitments. This is nondiscretionary spending. Discretionary spending “is comprised of the spending on 
national -level insti tutions (like the Executive branch), the Pa rliamentary Service Commission, the Judiciary, the total 
transfers to counties, and the smaller amounts allocated to the Contingency Fund and Equalization Fund ” (Dutta and 
Maina, 2014).  
8 Shareable revenue is anti cipated national revenue collected from inc ome taxes, VAT, excise and import duties, and 
other revenues. It is shared among counties based according to a formula that considers factors like population, land 
share, and poverty.  
9 Article 209 (3) of the Cons titution empowers the county governments to impose two types of taxes: property rates and 
entertainment taxes. The county governments can also impose charges for any services they provide, in accordance with 
the stipulated laws.  16.222.818.023.514.214.717.618.88.27.36.25.9

With increased revenue , primarily from the national level, county expenditures have 
been increasing, especially on recurring expenditures. In the first year of devolution 
(2013/14), counties spent around KSh 161.4 billion from all sources (about 5.4 percen t of the GDP). 
County expenditure grew by 96 percent to stand at KSh 317 billion in 2015/16. Total county 
expenditures are expected to grow by 14 percent to KSh 370 billion in 2016/17 (KNBS, 2015, 2016). 
In 2015/16, county spending was equivalent to 4.8 pe rcent of the GDP, an i ncrease from 3.2 
percent of the GDP in 2013/14. County recurrent expenditures are significantly greater than 
development expenditures, reflecting to some extent the start -up costs associated with establishing 
new administrative struct ures. This difference has been declining, however, and development 
expenditure is expected to increase to 
about 39 percent of total county spending 
in 2016/17, although there are significant 
variations across counties (Table 5). The 
composition of expendit ure by economic 
classi fication shows that the majority of 
expenditure is consumed by wages and 
salaries, 40 percent in both 2014/15 and 
2015/16 financial years. As a percentage of 
total recurrent expenditures, wages and 
salaries accounted for about 60 perc ent 
during the three f inancial years under 
review. Further, as discussed in greater 
detail below, this may actually 
underestimate the true proportion of 
spending on wages; grants to semi -

of employee wages.  
Trends in Public Health Expenditure  
Under devolution, the national government (through the MOH) and county 
governments split t he provision and manag ement of healthcare.  Counties are now 
responsible for the majority of service delivery, while the national government maintains 
responsibility for overall governance and policy, as well management of national referral hospitals 
and ce rtain vertical program s such as HIV. Once resources have been distributed between the two 
levels, each makes allocations to the health sector through a planning and budgeting process 
stipulated by the Public Financial Management Act, 2012. Any analysis of public financing of 
healthcare must be done at both the national and county levels.      
Government budgetary spending on health (both national and county) has increased 
in absolute terms from before to after devolution, but it has stagnated as a 
percentag e of total approved go vernment budgets . Figure 22 shows the government’s 
actual budgetary spending on health in absolute values, as well as a percentage of total approved 
government budgets across both levels. Budget allocations are revised and re -revised before being 
reported in the following year in terms of actual spending, which is often considerably lower than 
the target due to absorption and budget execution issues. In 2010/11, health, which was then an 
entirely national function, accounted for about 5.9 percent of total g overnment budgets. This 
proportion peaked in 2011/12, but it has since remained stagnant between 7 percent to 8 percent 
for the last six years. Health as a percentage of the government budget has remained below the 15 
percent target s et by Africa heads of states in Abuja in 2000, of which Kenya is signatory. As an 
average for the period between 2010 and 2015, the Kenya government general health expenditure 
of 1.78 percent, as a percentage of GDP, was third lowest in a peer group of sub -Saharan African 
count ries (Figure 23) (World Bank, 2010 –2016). However, such international comparison as 
indicative of actual public sector commitment to health must be interpreted with caution, as many 
of the countries that have returned impressive rates  receive large amounts  of on -budget donor 
funding which is considered as part of government spending. The net effect is to inflate the role of 
government in financing health. Overall, Kenya’s total general health expenditure as a share of 
GDP has remained below 2 percent in the  last decade, which is low compared to the targets of 
closer to 5 percent set by WHO and other bodies (Figure 23).  
Since devolution, total MOH budgets and expenditures have declined in absolute 
terms. Devolution transferred significant functions and resou rces to the county governments, and 
the decline is in part a reflection of the reduced role of the MOH in terms of functions retained. The 
decline in recurrent spending after devolution was particularly  significant, with a decline of about 
60 percent from KSh 56 billion in 2012/13 to KSh 24 billion in 2013/14. The development budget 
has declined significantly, but actual expenditures have increased slightly (Figure 24).  Government Resou rces

 48 The MOH’s budget execution capacity 
has declined in recent years, as seen 
in the decreasing development 
expenditure. The MOH spent about 87 
percent of the resources it was allocated by 
the national government in 2012/13. 
Interestingly, as Figure 25 shows, after 
devolution, the budget execution rate, also 
called the absorpti on rate, dropped to 69 
percent in 2015/16. The trend is even more 
pronounced for development expenditure, 
with the MOH spending only 52 percent of 
the allocated funds in 2015/16. Recurren t 
spending, on the other hand declined to only 
about 86 percent in 20 15/16 (from 100 
percent in 2012/13). Some of this may be a 
result of increased fragmentation in health 
spending; there is weak coordination of 
external funding (discussed further in 
Chapt er 6) and an increasing number of 
separate conditional grants for hea lth that 
flow to counties (GOK, 2018).  
After implementation of the two -tier 
government structure, grants and 
transfers replaced employee 
compensation as the highest MOH 
expenditure. With devolution, functions 
previously managed by the MOH are now 
under cou nty governments, including paying 
salaries for county -level service delivery. 
Grants and transfers to semi -autonomous 
agencies now consume the largest share of 
MOH resources, followed by operations and 
maintenance.10 Allocation to semi -
autonomous agencies i ncreased from KSh 19 
billion in 2012/13 to KSh 27 billion in 
2015/16. A significant share of the resources 
allocated to semi -autonomous agencies is 
spent paying the employees of these 
institutions. These salary and wage expenses are not captured under the economic classification for 
personnel expenses. Thus, as noted above, economic classifications actually underestimate the 
proportion of MOH resources spent on salaries and wages (MOH, 201 6a). 
National -level spending on health is dominated by curative servi ces. This is inconsistent 
with the stated MOH policy of shifting more resources to preventive and promotive health services. 
In FY 2013/14, curative services accounted for about 52 percen t of the MOH’s total spending, with 
preventive and promotive services  accounting for 32 percent (see Figure 26) . MOH spending on

 49 preventive and promotive programming has fallen to about 10 percent from 15 percent in 2014/15,

Devolved Resources for Health  
Devolution fundamentally changed the way resources flow through the health 
system, giving far greater control and discretion for health spending to county 
governments. Prior to devolution, national health funds bypassed county treasuries. Some 
national re sources flowed directly to county health departments. Others flowed through the Health 
Sector Service Fund and Hospital Management Services Fund, which transferred funds directly to 
hospitals and lower -level facilities, including reimbursement for the free  primary healthcare and 
maternal healthcare programs. Box 3 discusses the government financing of these two programs in 
more detail. Following devolution, counties have autonomy in managing their finances and, in line 
with the 2012 Public Financial Managem ent Act, all resources from the national level must flow 
through CR Fs. All federal funds, including those administered through the County MOH and 
NHIF, are allocated through the CR F (see Figure 27 for illustrations of funding flows). There is 
wide variatio n in the prioritization of health needs (Figure 28), though the overall trend, 
comparing FY 2015/16 to FY 2016/17 is upward in terms of the share allocated to health.

Unde r this system, counties have discretionary power on how to distribute resources 
between sectors, and the amount of resources for he alth depend on whether the 
sector is a priority. County department development plans are consolidated into the Annual 
Development Plan. The latter articulates county priorities, forming the basis of the budgeting 
process. The County Budget Outlook Paper an d the County Fiscal Strategy Paper outline the 
resources available and how they will be allocated to reach the priority sectors. The resources 
available are dependent on allocations from national government plus locally generated revenues. 
In many counties , however, fiscal space is limited by the scope for generating loca l revenues, and 
the majority of resources come from federal allocations.  Box 3. Financing free pr imary healthcare and free maternity care (Linda Mama)  
As discussed in Chapter 3, in 2013, the Kenyan government abolished user fees at public 
primary healthcare facilities and introduced free maternal health services in all public facilities. 
In the first year of the policies, the government allocated KSh 700 million and KSh 3.8 billion, 
respectively, to compensate facilities for the loss of user fee revenue and the cost of the 
maternal health services. Table 6 shows allocations for the two policies in Keny an shillings 
(and the value in US dollars based on historical exchange rates).

These funds initially flowed through the Health Sector Service Fund and the Hospital 
Management Services Fund. As noted in Chapter 3, however, this posed challenges in terms of 
efficiency and timeliness of disbursement of funds. Under the devolved system, free primary 
health se rvices are now reimbursed directly from the CR F to public primary health facilities , 
including health facilities and dispensaries. Funds flow from the National Treasury as a 
conditional grant to the CR Fs, where they are then disbursed to the facility level  (Figure 27).  
The government relaunched the free maternity healthcare program unde r the name Linda 
Mama as a reimbursement model administered by the NHIF in 2016 (MOH, 2016d).  The NHIF 
will reimburse both public facilities and hospitals, as well as contra cted private facilities for a 
benefits package of antenatal, delivery, postnatal, a nd newborn care (through the first year). 
The NHIF receives funds from the national government to finance the reimbursements as 
conditional grants flowing through the CR F (Figure 27). Reimbursement is based on quantity of 
services provided, determined thro ugh a combination of capitation and fee -for-service 
arrangements (MOH, 2016d) . Outpatient services are paid through capitation and rates 
pegged to the NHIF’s national scheme , currently KSh 1,200 per beneficiary (MOH, 2016d) . 
Delivery reimbursement rates ar e currently KSh 2,500 and 5,000 for public facilities and 
hospitals, respectively. Private facilities are reimbursed at a negotiated rate between KSh 
3,500 and KSh 6,500. Al l other inpatient services are reimbursed based on NHIF rates (MOH, 
2016d) .   Government Resou rces 
52 County allocations to health have been increasing since devolution. Immediately after 
devolution, county budget all ocations to health were insufficient relative to the counties’ new 
responsibilities. A review of devolved functions estimated that health accounted for 36 percent of 
the functions newly under county control (World Bank, 2014a). However, total county alloca tions 
to health only amounted to KSh 42 billion, or 13 percent of t otal county budgets. Since then, 
counties have steadily increased allocations to the health sector (Figure 29).  County governments’ 
health allocation more than doubled from KSh 42 billion r eported in 2013/14 to about KSh 92 
billion in 2016/17. County healt h budgets in 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 were approximately 22 
percent, 23 percent, and 25 percent of total county budgets, respectively. There are, however, huge 
county variations in bud get allocations to the health sector. Nyeri, for example, spent 39 percent of 
total county government expenditures on health in 2014/15, while Tharaka Nithi spent 9.7 percent 
(Nyeri County Health Services, 2016; Tharaka Nithi County Health Services, 2016).  
County health sectors have inherited the national -level spending p attern in which the 
budget for recurrent expenditures far exceeds development. On average, three -quarters 
of the county budget is allocated to cover recurrent expenditures (Figure 30). The increase in 
health budget for this is driven by the expanding budge t for wages and salaries, which crowds out 
other recurrent inputs critical to achieving technical and operational efficiency in service delivery.  
Between 2014 and 2017, personnel emoluments  received the largest share of counties’ recurrent 
health budget, a t around 70 percent. On average, drugs have received about 9 percent of the 
recurrent budget while operations and maintenance has received about 12 percent (Figure 31). 
Slowly, the developm ent budget allocation is increasing, with investments in facility c onstruction 
and rehabilitation. As Figure 32 shows, these two items consumed about half of the development 
budget since financial year 2013/14 and increased to 57 percent by 2016/17, reflec ting counties 
investment in health infrastructure.

Discussion 
Kenya’s current macroeconomic forecast suggests the government’s a bility to 
mobilize resources for health will continue to grow, subject to an ability to manage 
competing priorities and the need to control total public debt . The Kenyan economy has 
grown rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to grow in the medium term. The 
national government’s tax collection and the tax compliance rate are improving. Mobilizing 
sufficient resources for health will require continued effort for all levels of government. As in other 
sub-Saharan countries, the level of public debt continues to grow very rapidly, approaching 60 
percent of GDP, and may grow further if not checked by prudent fiscal policies. Kenya’s need to 
control public debt has the potential to restrain growth in social sector spending, especially with 
continuing security threats. Still, growing public sector revenue presents an opportunity for the 
GOK to spend more on key social sectors to meet development and political demands, and this 
includes health at both the national and county levels. Nominal spending for health across both 
levels of government has indeed increased. It has not increased, however, as a proportion of the 
total government budget. Although the overall macroeconomic climate is promising for the health 
financing system, it will not necessarily translate into gains for the sector without continued effort 
and prioritization of health in the face of critical competing priorities and fiscal pressures.  
Devolution has given far more health financing control directly to county decision 
makers, yet their actions may be constrained due to a high share of wages and 
salaries in their health spending. The new financial flow structures pool resources for 
counties in the CRFs, giving counties decision-making power over how to use them. This 
decentralized health financing system is intended to allow counties to disburse and administer 
funds more efficiently and to be more responsive to population health needs. This also means that 
county-level spending on health reflects county priorities, not just available resources; there are 
wide disparities among the counties in terms of proportional budget allocations to health. Further, Government Resou rces 
 54 as discussed above, not all counties have dedicated sufficient resources to health to meet the 
totality of the ir responsibilities under d evolved government functions. Increasing the potential for 
government revenue is not guaranteed to translate into increased county -level health spending. 
Much health spending is recurrent, and at least 71 percent in total at the county level is focused on 
wages. There has, however, been an increase in conditional grants to counties over the last three 
years. Unlike national resources allocated to counties under their formula -based share, conditional 
grants can be marked for specia l purposes. This growth is in part a reflection of increasing health 
expenditures through Linda Mama and the free primary healthcare programs. This trend will likely 
continue as the GOK continues to expand financial protection in health through user fee re moval 
programs implemented at the county level.  
Overall, county revenues are highly dependent on national resources devolved based 
on the formula. There is limited capacity from county governments to mobilize locally generated 
revenues, through county -level taxes or other mechanisms , which is unlikely to change in the 
immediate future. Therefore, even though the majority of direct health spending now takes place at 
the county level, the availability of resources for health will continue to depend largely on  national 
resource mobiliza tion driven primarily by national tax revenues.  
County government resources will play a critical role in the future successful scale -
up of NHIF coverage. As discussed further in Chapter 5, county governments will have 
increasing  responsibility for reachin g and enrolling informal sector members in NHIF. Under the 
ongoing enrollment drives for NHIF, for example, many counties have a target enrollment number 
to reach. Enrollment drives require resources, as will any long -term future  role in subsidizing the 
membership of the poor and vulnerable in their borders. County governments will also have to 
allocate sufficient resources to support premium subsidies for the poor, which they currently do 
only at a relatively small scale (see Cha pter 5).  
Particularly in l ight of declining external financing for health, Kenya will need to 
mobilize more domestic resources for health to finance its ambitious health agenda 
but also spend them efficiently. As Chapter 6 discusses in more detail, extern al health 
financing is in l ong-term decline in Kenya. Public resources will be critical to ensuring 
improvements in service delivery, meeting the challenge of rising noncommunicable diseases, as 
well preventing an increased burden of OOP health expenditure s for the poor and vulnerab le. In 
the long term, as NHIF coverage increases and can more adequately mobilize funds from 
contributor segments, both mandatory and voluntary, inherently public health functions will 
become the main focus of public tax -based he alth financing. In the shor t to medium term, the GOK 
faces the challenge of balancing a need to mobilize greater resources for a variety of health needs, 
which it can only do through a limited set of mechanisms, including from tax revenue, with a need 
to restrain overall government spending to control the public debt. Maximizing efficient targeting 
and full execution of health resources is the minimum requirement; in addition, as average per 
capita incomes rise, finding equitable, progressive ways to raise health -related resources fr om 
middle - and upper -class Kenyans is needed. However, current efforts to remove user fees for an 
increasing share of health services for an increasing share of the population suggest that such 
targeting is still a plan for the f uture.  Government Resources

5. CURRENT STATE OF HEA LTH INSURANCE 
SCHEMES  
Expanding health insurance coverage through a social health insurance model is 
central to Kenya’s strategy for achieving UHC targets. As articulated in  the Roadmap 
Towards Universal Health Coverage ( 2018 –2022) , Kenya intends to achieve universal coverage 
through a Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) as single -payer by 2022. Although current NHIF 
coverage is a promising base from which to expand purchasin g of a guaranteed benefits package, 
and while cu rrent plans to raise enrollment are important, this target is ambitious. Current NHIF 
coverage by most measures is less than one -fifth of the population. Achieving universal insurance 
coverage will require co nsiderable effort to scale up enrollment, partic ularly of informal workers 
and the poor, as well as to strengthen the NHIF systems and purchasing mechanisms. This chapter 
assesses the current state of health insurance coverage, including NHIF and private s chemes, in 
light of these ambitious plans for sc ale-up and for using NHIF as a vehicle to advance UHC.   
Health insurance coverage in Kenya is increasing and compares favorably to its 
neighbors, but overall coverage is hard to confirm due to differences ac ross survey 
and administrative data. According t o recent KHHEUS data, 19.9 percent of individuals 
surveyed in mid -2018 had some form of health insurance,11 an increase from 17 percent in the 2013 
KHHE US data (MOH, 2018) (Figure 33).  This is also broadly in agr eement with the findings of the 
KIHBS 2015 (KNBS, 2018). As a point of comparison, in FY 2016/17, the National Health 
Insurance Fund in Tanzania covered approximately 6 percent of the population (L ee, 2018).12 In 
                                                        
11 The KHHE US survey question is, “Is there any member of the household who is co vered by any form of health 
insurance?” The enumerators are then expected to probe and list the household members covered and the forms of 
health insurance held by each person. Household members may be covered by more than one form of insurance. In the 
KIH BS survey, the question asks,  “In the last 12 months was [NAME] covered by any health insurance?” Each household 
member is to be listed, and the enumerator further records the source of insurance for each.  
12 An ineffectively implemented community health i nsurance scheme, the Communit y Health Fund, could claim about 2.1 
million households, or about 12.6 million total beneficiaries, representing 23 percent of the population (Lee, 2018).  
Health Insurance  
 56 Ethiopia, social health insurance is still 
nascent, but about 16 percent of the 
population had access to community -based 
health insurance at the end of 2017 
(McGaugh, 2018). While there has been 
some growth in private insurance, NHIF 
covers the vast majori ty of insured Kenyans; 
in the KHHEUS 2018, 89.4 percent of 
respondents with insurance were covered by 
NHIF, marginally up from the 88.4 percent 
reported in the 2013 KHHEUS (KNBS, 
2018). In comparison to these statistics from 
the KHHEUS, the KIHBS 2015 repo rted that 
94 percent of all the insured wer e covered by 
NHIF (KNBS, 2018). Therefore, there is 
variability in the role of the insurer across 
surveys. In sharp contrast, the recent NHIF 
Strategic Plan 2018 –2022  states that based on its principal membership count of 7.66 million 
Kenyans at the end of  FY 2017/18, it had an overall membership, including dependents, of 27.2 
million (Table 7) (NHIF, 2018b). This would imply coverage of over 50 percent of the population. 
Hence, there appears to be a large discrepa ncy with the survey data cited above, which  may be 
rooted in interpretation of the survey data and on specific assumptions; this is discussed in Box 4.  
 Box 4. Proportion of the population covered by NHIF  
Discordance  in estimates. The KHHEUS 2018 suggests that 17.8 percent of Kenyans are 
insured by NHIF (about 89 percent of the 20 percent with any insurance), which translates to 
about 8.8 million individuals (MOH, 2018). In contrast, NHIF stated in 2018 tha t based on its 
membership of 7.66 million at the end of FY 2017/18, it insures about 25 million Kenyans, or 
about 49 percent of the population. Which is correct?  
Based on the principle of family enrollment, NHIF’s coverage estimate is plausible as a 
theore tical ceili ng of coverage . NHIF membership covers a nuclear household, and in Kenya, the 
average household size in urban areas is 3.4 and in rural areas 4.6 (as averages of estimates 
from KHHEUS 2018 [MOH, 2018] and KIHBS 2015 [KNBS, 2018]). NHIF’s stated population -
level coverage for 2017/18 suggests that it uses a household size of 3.3. This lower figure may 
account for the presence of some factors that cause coverage to be overstated, but it is not 
clear if it does so sufficiently. For example, NHIF’s to tal members hip (principal plus dependents) 
would be overstated if:  
1. Some households in the formal sector are dual -income, where both earners contribute 
on their payroll; therefore, membership in the formal sector cannot accurately be 
multiplied by household  size witho ut accounting for such families —the estimate for 
which is unknown.  
2. NHIF members who have died or stopped paying their dues are not removed from the 
rolls in time for the estimates. This is also unknown.  
3. There may be families whose principal memb er failed t o register all children on the NHIF 
enrollment form, which is also unknown.  Figure 33. Individuals reporting some form of

  Survey -based estimates of insurance coverage may require further analysis . The questions in 
the KIHBS and KHHEUS surveys are oriented toward the detection of household m embers with  
insurance, followed by identification of the type of insurance each individual carries. However, 
the enumerators’ probing of the insurance status of individuals beyond the household head was 
not clear and requires clarification. The following a re illustra tive reasons why NHIF coverage may 
be underreported:  
1. If the household head being interviewed is not aware of the nature of their benefits and 
the derivative insurance status of children, the children’s insurances status may not be 
reported.  
2. Som e aspects o f the adolescent children’s status may connote that they do not have 
access to insurance under their parent’s coverage, e.g., in the common scenario where 
they attend secondary school away from home.

Note on  family enrollment:  
▪ NHIF membership can extend from the primary member and their  declared immediate 
nuclear family (all children, up to 10 in total, can be registered on a single form). In the 
formal sector, a family may have more than one contributing mem ber registered 
separately. There is no provision to register parents or other re latives (siblings) as 
dependents on the form.  
▪ Since there is no additional cost to doing so, informal sector members can also register 
their immediate family (spouse and child ren) for the same flat rate of KSh 500, which is 
likely being done.  
▪ In the Healt h Insurance Subsidy Program, entire vulnerable households, such as those 
in the GOK Cash Transfer Program for orphans and vulnerable children, are registered.  
Given that NHIF d oes not provide statistics showing why its coverage may be overestimated, the 
2018 estimate of nearly 50 percent of the population covered should be taken only as a 
theoretical maximum .   Health Insurance  
 58 There are geographic disparities in health insurance coverage. Health insurance 
coverage is higher among urban Kenyans.  Nearly 30 percent of pe ople in urban areas have some 
form of health insurance, while coverage is only about 14 percent in rural areas (KNBS, 2018). This 
may be a reflection of the higher levels of informal sector employment in rural areas and less 
awareness of insurance options.  One study using 2014 KDHS data suggests that these differences 
are explained by socioeconomic status, with higher poverty rates in rural areas and poorer 
individuals less likely to be insured, especially through private insurance (Kazungu and Barasa, 
2017 ). According to KHHEUS data, there is also marked variation in coverage across counties 
(Figure 34) (MOH, 2018). Approximately 41 percent of Kenyans in Nairobi reported having 
insurance coverage, about 32 percent were covered in Nyeri and Embu, and in Waji r, less than 1 
percent of the respondents were covered; West Pokot, Marsabit, Mander, and Garissa all had 
coverage below 3 percent (MOH, 2018).

Insurance coverage is significantly higher among the wealthy across all types of 
health insurance. According to the KHHEUS 2018, only 2.9 percent  of the lowest quintile has 
health insurance, compared to 42 percent of the wealthiest. The vast majority of al l quintiles are 
covered through NHIF, but NHIF coverage is highest among the poor (as a proportion of those 
insured). Private insurance coverage increases with wealth quintile. Private coverage is virtually 
nonexistent among the poorest members of the popu lation but reaches 7 percent among the 
wealthiest  (Figure 35) . Community -based health insurance coverage, on the other hand, is highest 
among the  poor. Kazungu and Barasa (2017) found similar differentials in their study; individuals 
from wealthy household s were 12 times more likely to be covered by health insurance than the poor 
(Kazungu and Barasa, 2017). While the uninsured can access free prima ry and maternal healthcare 
services through the government -financed user -fee removal schemes like Linda Mama, t hey are not 
protected against the financial impact of hospital costs, leaving them vulnerable to CHE.  Health Insurance

The overall proportion of total health expenditure from health insurance has been 
relatively stable in recent years (Figure 36). Since 2009, total health expenditure (THE) 
pooled through NHIF ( social health insurance schemes) has remained constant at aroun d 5 
percent, although it has increased in absolute terms from about KSh 9 billion in 2009/10 to KSh 
15.1 billion in 2015/16 (MOH, 2017b). Enterprise financing schemes (i.e., employer -provided 
healthcare or insurance) across the same time points accounted f or a constant amount of THE, 
around KSh 10 billion, but it declined from 6 percent to 3 percent as a proportion of overall health 
expenditures (MOH, 2017b). Voluntary health insurance schemes, including private and 
community -based schemes, have increased s ignificantly from 7 to 11 percent of THE, accounting 
for KSh 35 billion in 2015/16 (from 13 billion in 2009/10). Despite representing a larger share of 
the total health funding, however, volunt ary health insurance schemes cover a relatively small 
share of the population, at less than five percent (MOH, 2017b).

 60 National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF)  
NHIF is the p rimary provider of health insurance in Kenya and the primary vehicle 
through which Kenya intends to expand insurance coverage. It was established through 
the National Hospital Insurance Act of 1966 to provide insurance coverage for formal sect or 
employees,  but the populations covered, the number and types of schemes available, and 
contribution rates have evolved since then (Figure 37). In the formal sector, only employees make 
contributions, with no employer share, which is unlike other contrib utory mechani sms for social 
health insurance in middle -income countries. Until the rates were revised in 2015, they had 
remained unchanged for decades. They ranged from KSh 30 to KSh 160 per month, according to 
income, while informal sector members paid a flat rate of KSh 160. Low rates limited the package 
of inpatient benefits NHIF could cover, and in 2015, it significantly increased contribution rates for 
the first time (Deloitte, 2011; Ongiri, 2015). Rates now range from KSh 150 to KSh 1,700, with 
inform al sector mem bers contributing a flat rate of KSh 500 (Box 5) (NHIF, 2017b). Membership is 
compulsory for formal sector employees, and contributions are deducted by their employers; 
participation is voluntary for informal sector workers. Further increases to the payrol l-based 
contribution rates have been deemed unfeasible in the short -term due to popular opposition to 
higher premiums.

Box 5. Understanding NHIF contribution rates  
In the formal sector, NHIF contributi ons are paid by the 
employee only, in contrast to the shared burden with 
employers in most other contributory social health insurance 
schemes. For example, in Indonesia, the total payroll 
contribution for the National Health Insurance Scheme is 5 
percent, with a cap on the maximum taxable monthly income. 
In Kenya, the average contribution rate across salary bands is 
closer to 3 percent (Table 8). Of the 5 percent in Indonesia, 
public sector employers are responsible for 3 percent and 
employees pay 2 percent . In the private formal sector, 
employers pay more —4 percent. For NHIF, the proportional 
contribu tion pattern is also regressive. As seen in Figure 38, 
lower -income earners pay more as a share of their wages. 
Even a flat proportional rate would be more pro gressive. In 
April 2018, the Kenyan parliament considered an amendment 
to the NHIF Act of 1998 th at would require employers to 
contribute. However, as of late 2018, this was yet to become 
law, and it faces significant opposition from employer groups.

NHIF membership has expanded over the last five years, with a higher informal 
sector growth rate than among the formal sector.  According to the KNBS Economic 
Surveys, NHIF membership, including both the formal and informal sectors, which may include 
indigent sponsored members and other smaller groups, grew by 79 percent between 2012/13 and 
2016/17, increasing by an average of 15 percent annually over the period since 2010/11 (KNBS, 
2011, 2013, 2017). Total membership in the employed sectors increased from 6.1 to 6.8 million 
between 2015/16 and 2016/17. The formal sector’s share in primary membership across the two 
sectors has been dropping and accounted for 57 percent in 2016/17, down from 76 percent in 
2010/11. Informal sector membership growth annually outpaced formal sector enrollment growth Table 8. Employee

 62 throughout the period, but it has slowed since its peak in 2013/14. Informal sector membership 
grew 17 percent in 2016/17, compared with 7 percent growth  in the formal sector. Figure 39 shows 
total NHIF membership by employment group, whi le Figure 40 shows NHIF membership as a 
percentage of the total estimated size of the informal sector workforce. NHIF and other partners 
are making concerted efforts to in crease informal sector enrollment beyond these levels (KNBS, 
2017). Different enrollm ent drives are currently being conducted, including with the assistance of 
county governments and employing the organization Amref Health Africa, which was conducting 
door -to-door recruitment using community health volunteers in several counties in late 20 18. The 
ongoing NHIF enrollment drives are also focused on informal sector membership, with some 
county governments taking on responsibility for hitting certain membership  targets.

The GOK has set ambitious scale -up targets in the Roadmap Towards Universal 
Health Coverage (2018 –2022) to achieve universal coverage of health insurance by 
2022. By 2020, it intends to triple the number of primary NHIF m embers from the informal 
sector as of the end of FY 2017/18, which would require also tripling the recent rate of enrollment 
growth from this sector. The targets from the roadmap , which are also repeated in the NHIF 
Strategic Plan 2018 –22, are shown in Fig ure 41. They include ambitious targets to enroll 
secondary students and the elderly. Overall, these targets for new members would represent a steep 
acceleration to the past rate of growth, as shown in Figure 42. Though there is substantial 
disagreement and  confusion about the share of the overall population these NHIF membership 
targets may represent, as a theoretical maximum, we estimate that meeting these targets would get 
the country close to high or near -universal insurance coverage, but t he overlap bet ween some of 
the segments in the targets, e.g., for secondary school students as independent members versus 
dependents, has not been resolved (GOK, 2018; NHIF, 2018b).  2.2 2.4 2.7 3.0 3.23.6 3.90.70.91.11.52.02.52.9

Kenya is employing a range of potentia l tactics to s cale coverage of the harder -to-
reach informal sector in NHIF. In 2017, for example, it first partnered with mobile wallet 
platform M -TIBA, which is a partnership of PharmAccess Foundation, CarePay, and mobile 
network operators, to enroll 2,00 0 households f rom informal settlements into NHIF, as well as 
4,600 workers of the horticulture company Oserian (Macharia, 2017). M -TIBA has since grown 
independently, and its tie -up with NHIF through the NHIF Bora promotion is driving individual as 
well as  employer -driven enrollment into SupaCover. NHIF  has also created the NHIF Mobile app 
that allows users to deposit small amounts of money as they are able, until they reach the KSh 500 
informal sector premium. This is intended to make it easier for inform al sector memb ers to both 
save for and actually pay their contributions ( Daily Nation , 2017). The roadmap also outlines 
broader, country -wide efforts to drive this enrollment. Some of the responsibility for these 
strategies lies with county governments, which are expect ed to devise targeted strategies for their 
populations. Currently, four c ounties are implementing Afya Care pilot programs to further 4 4 4 4 4357912

government is also proposing incentivizing county enrollment and premium collection throu gh

commission, and community health workers, including those organized through its par tnership 
with Amref, to drive informal sector enrollment (GOK, 2018).  
 Box 6. MakueniCare: Example of county -led innovation or further fragmentation in 
health financing?  
Makueni is a mainly rural county in southeast Kenya, with a population of approximately 1 
million (2018 estimate). From May to September 2016, the County Government of Makueni 
initiated a pilot program under the title MakueniCare. The focus of MakueniCare was senior 
citizens over 65 years of age for whom it reimbursed expenses incurred for care at county 
hospitals. Since 2018, the County Go vernment of Makueni expanded this to cover all residents 
and has adopted a plan target of spending 30 percent of its bu dget on health, which allows for 
financing the scheme. Allocations increased from KSh 200 million in FY 2016/17 to KSh 300 
million in FY 2018/19 (Kibwana, 2018). MakueniCare has the stated objective to address 
financial barriers to access to services. Unde r this model, the county government guarantees 
and provides a set of essential curative, promotive, and rehabilitative healthcare service s within 
county facilities, free of charge at the point of care. Residents must register as a principal 
beneficiary or as a spouse or dependent (below 18 years, except if school -going, then up to 24 
years), and pay KSh 500 per household annually as a “regi stration fee.”

By August 2018, MakueniCare had 45,000 households enrolled (approximately 18 percent of 
the population). As per a report from a single facility (Muasya, 2018), inpatient utilization 
increased by 70 percent and outpatien t by 40 percent. A larger evaluation of the model is under 
way, led by HP+. Critical questions remain: How will the scheme harmonize with the larger 
vision to expand NHIF across counties? How does the scheme currently manage any overlap in 
benefits with NH IF for households? Will MakueniCare m erge into a local expansion of NHIF and 
adopt the larger benefits package NHIF currently offers? Will Makueni residents be willing to 
pay the charges as SupaCover requires? County schemes such as Makueni’s offer importa nt 
lessons and show the willingness o f county governments to invest in financial protection. 
However, the scheme raises questions of appropriate targeting of public resources and long -
term sustainability.  Health Insurance  
 65  Box 7. Afya Care: A four -county pilot program to remove user fees for an expanded 
package of health services and test the system’s response  
As a step toward its commitment to reach UHC by 2022, the Kenyan Government launched Afya 
Care pilots in four counties on December 1, 2018, covering 7 percent of the  Kenyan population. 
Key objectives  are to test the ability to scale up population coverage of an expanded benefits 
package, especially covering services at county level 4 and 5 facilities (former district and 
provincial hospitals). It is also a key attempt  to learn what works to reduce OOP  spending and 
increase utilization of services and financial protection, all using government supply -side 
financing. Participants in the scheme will be attached to a specific public health facility and 
receive special Afya  Care cards that will entitle them  to free services at public facilities, paid for 
through NHIF.  
Each of the four counties is representative of a different specific population or epidemiological 
profile, intended to test the appropriateness of the initiat ive and proposed benefits in diffe rent 
contexts. The pilot is being financed through a KSh 3.2 billion (US$31.6 million) conditional 
grant from the national government divided across the four counties (Table 1 0). Funding will 
flow from the national Treasur y to the national MOH and then be disbursed to county UHC fund 
accounts, except for the funds that will flow to KEMSA.

Counties will allocate the funds across four areas (Figure 43):  
1. Public health services: resources allocated to County Hea lth Management Teams for 
public health functions such as services quality control, data collection, and 
surveillance.  
2. Community health services: funds to be used for community health worker training  and 
supplies.  
3. Basic and specialized services: 70 percen t of these funds will flow through KEMSA for 
drugs and other supplies; the remaining 30 percent will be used for health facility 
operations and maintenance (levels 4 and 5).    
4. Health system strength ening: 30 percent of these funds will used for medical 
equipment in health facilities; the remainder will be used for general health system 
strengthening activities, including human resources and monitoring and evaluation. At 
least 5 percent must be used f or performance -based financing at the facility level.   Health Insurance  
 66  
Expanded coverage will also target specific vulnerable population groups with 
subsidized premiums. For any Kenyans over the age of 70 not receiving pensions, the national 
governme nt will subsidize health insurance coverage. The targets shown in Figure 41  include 
significant estimates of growth for this segment. Along with the elderly, the national government 
will also pay for coverage for individuals with severe disabilities. In ad dition, the GOK intends to 
target public secondary school students and contin ue the enrollment of poor (indigent) 
households, scaling this target to 1.5 million households by 2022. The Roadmap Towards 
Universal Health Coverage (2018 –2022) identifies  a budg etary need of KSh 6.3 billion for 
enrolling targets from these three sponsore d segments in FY 2018/19, for which resources have not 
yet been identified or allocated. The Linda Mama program, which covers pregnant women (see 
Chapters 3 and 4), will also be u sed as a mechanism to ensure universal coverage, covering 
approximately 1.3 m illion additional women each year. Any pregnant women not covered by other 
insurance will be enrolled in Linda Mama whenever they make contact with the health system, 
covering the m with basic maternal and neonatal services through the first year of life (G OK, 2018). 
This is an intermediary step, however, and intended ultimately to be integrated into the broader 
NHIF membership growth strategy.  
NHIF currently operates three, separa tely pooled schemes covering different subsets 
of the population. The general , national NHIF scheme, or SupaCover, includes the mandatory 
contributing population from the formal sector, voluntary informal membership, and government -
sponsored insurance for the elderly and for individuals with severe disabilities (MOH, 
forthcoming). The Civil Servants and Disciplined Services Scheme and County Public Servant 
Scheme are more comprehensive packages paid for through contributions from civil servants and 
members of uniformed services (MOH, forthcoming). The Health Insurance Subsidy Progra m is a The intention of the pilot is to use specific national “top -up” funds over and above regular 
county spending, to enable entirely free services up to level 5 facilities. The ability of the system 
to me et the enhanced demand will be a key learning objective.  
An additional fund will be established to pay for specialized care from tertiary facilities and 
national teaching hospitals outside the county boundaries. Managed by NHIF, the fund will pay 
for the poor from each of the pilot counties to access services at  such referral hospitals. 
Counties are expected to match this money with their own resources.

increase healthcare utilization among the poor (NHIF, 2016a). Table 11 summarizes these scheme

NHIF’s benefits package has expanded to include a comprehensive package of 
inpat ient and outpatient services.  It initially included only inpatient services, primarily 
covering “hotel costs” of care such as fees for overnight hospital stays. These benefits have grown 
over time, with t he most significant expansion following the increase  in contribution rates in 2015 
(Githinji, 2016). NHIF now covers an inclusive list of inpatient, outpatient, and ambulatory 
services, including certain NCDs. It expanded the number of services covered but  also increased 
the amount of expenses covered and r eimbursement rates paid to providers for certain services, 
including deliveries and Caesarians (MyGov, 2016).  
NHIF accredits and contracts public as well as private nonprofit and for -profit 
facilities. It requires accreditation before contracting with faci lities. Accreditation covers the 
range of health services provided by the facility, the number and type of health personnel, bed 
capacity, infrastructure, and equipment (NHIF, 2005).  
After accreditation, facilities are contracted as one of three categories —A, B, or C —
depending on the type of facility . Category A includes government hospitals where all services, 
including maternity services and surgery, are fully paid by NHIF. At Category B facilities (priv ate 
and mission hospitals, generally in rural or und erserved areas), members also receive a full range 
of covered services but may have to pay a co -pay for surgical services (NHIF, 2017a). Members are 
also limited to KSh 432,000 at Category B facilities an nually (Ndung'u, 2015). Category C includes 
private hospitals, where NHIF covers only a specified daily rebate (NHIF, 2017a).  
NHIF employs a variety of provider payment mechanisms, including fixed 
reimbursement, capitation, and fee -for-service payments, de pending on the services 
provided. Inpatient services are paid for through fixed reimbursement, while outpatient services 
are covered under capitation. Deliveries (both vaginal and caesarean) are paid for on a fee -for-
service basis, as is NCD treatment like  dialysis and chemotherapy. The am ounts paid depend on 
the type of facility and the service provided. Private providers, for example, are paid slightly higher 
capitation rates for outpatient services than public facilities (MOH, forthcoming). The same is t rue Health Insurance  
 70 for inpatient reimbursement ra tes, all of which increased in 2016 (Koech, 2016); Category A 
facilities receive KSh 1,200, Category B facilities receive KSh 3,500, and the rate for Category C 
hospitals is KSh 4,000.  
NHIF has also increased coverage for  services paid on a fee -for-servic e basis. The rate 
for normal deliveries is now KSh 10,000 (increased from KSh 6,000), and caesarian rates have 
increased from KSh 18,000 to 30,000. Kidney dialysis is paid up to KSh 10,000 per session, up 
from KSh 2,500, a nd transplants are covered up to K Sh 500,000 (an increase from KSh 200,000). 
Expanded services covered by fee -for-service also include chemotherapy (KSh 25,000 per session) 
and radiology (KSh 18,000 per session) (Koech, 2016).  
While the contracting process  and payment mechanisms are clear,  the execution of 
these agreements is more challenging. Contracts between NHIF as the purchaser and service 
provider define the provider’s obligations and the reimbursement rates to be paid for services. The 
objective of t he various purchasing mechanisms i s to incentivize quality, reduce wastage, and allow 
patients to choose their provider. The extent to which these agreements are enforced —including 
monitoring performance of health facilities, quality of services, and legit imacy of claims —is less 
clear. The re are no mechanisms to monitor quality, and NHIF reimburses facilities based on 
compliance with minimum quality standards at the time of empanelment. There is no link between 
payment and service quality to incentivize hig her standards (MOH, forthcoming). Cases of NHIF 
clients being unable to access necessary services and medicines from accredited facilities have been 
documented, and investigating and curbing fraud have been challenging (Chuma and Okungu, 
2011; Murage, 2017 ; Oketch 2017b; Otieno, 2017a  ).  
In particular, there have been disagreements between NHIF and contracted facilities, 
especially private facilities, over the need for a balance between issuing timely 
payments and performing the checks necessary to prevent  fraud.  In reaction to late 
NHIF r eimbursements, some hospitals have threatened to refuse NHIF cards or to require patients 
to pay cash up front. From the perspective of NHIF, however, delays in payment have been a result 
of the additional scrutiny require d to weed out the growing number o f fraudulent claims (Oketch, 
2017b). NHIF has taken measures to combat fraud, including freezing reimbursements for 
diagnostic services at certain private hospitals in September 2017 (Otuki, 2017a). Shortly 
thereafter, NHI F implemented a new policy that re quires pre -authorization for specialized services 
like MRIs and CT scans (Oketch, 2017a). As NHIF expands service coverage through a growing 
number of contracted facilities, it will need to refine payment mechanisms to lim it fraud while 
meeting the needs o f providers and patients.  
As Kenya uses NHIF to expand universal coverage of social health insurance, it is 
working to articulate a guaranteed package of health essential health services, the 
UHC -Essential Benefits Packag e (UHC -EBP). Functionally, NHIF’s current package for 
most of its membership is defined by the SupaCover benefits (see Table 11). The benefits are 
expressed in terms of an overall list that is very generally defined, with few specifics on levels or 
limits to care available. However, the GO K intends to more clearly define what is and is not covered 
under NHIF to improve accountability for providing these services. Therefore, the UHC -EBP 
package will be defined for progressive expansion —first covering the mos t essential services and 
then expa nding to cover all major disease areas in line with KEPH. Once this package is 
established, the GOK also intends to have a technical review committee regularly evaluate and 
revise it, as needed, based on the current epidem iological burden and available hea lth technologies 
and services (GOK, 2018). As the GOK defines these services, it will also be critical for NHIF to 
define the appropriate mechanisms to pay for them. There are ongoing policy discussions in Kenya 
on how bes t to reform the current purchasing  and payment mechanism in place.  Health Insurance

As NHIF increases contribution rates and expands its benefits package, it must strike 
a balance between revenues, claims, and administrative expenses to ensure financial 
sustainability.  Total membership contributions doubled between 2014/15 and 2015/16 —from 
KSh 15.8 billion to KSh 32 billion —largely due to the revised contribution rates, as well as to an 
increase in membership (N HIF, 2016b; KNBS, 2017). Benefit e xpenses  also increased in absolute 
terms, from KSh 5.8 to KSh 10.3 billion.13 The payout ratio  declined in the first year after the rise in 
contributions, but it has since increased from approximately 44 percent to 71 perce nt (Figure 44) 
(KNBS, 2017).14 Preliminary, unaudited results for 2017/18 suggest that the payout (claims) ratio 
climbed to 78 percent (NHIF, 2018a).

Revenue Benefits Payout ratioHealth Insurance  
 72 A well -functioning insurance scheme should spend a large share of contributions on 
benefits, but until recently, NHIF has struggled to do this  (Lakin and Magero, 2012). The 
scheme has seen improvements, however. I n 2005, the payout ratio was only 22 percent; by 
2009/10, the payout ratio had increased to 52 percent, and in 2011/12, it had reached 63 percent 
(Lakin and Magero, 2012; KNBS, 2017). As Figure 44 shows, the payout ratio has fl uctuated since 
2015/16. Overa ll, NHIF has enjoyed annual operating surpluses for several years, for example, 
amounting to KSh 2.35 billion (US$23 million) in 2016/17 based on its audited results (NHIF, 
2016a). The recently expanded benefits package and inc reased reimbursement rates, h owever, 
should improve this ratio in the future. Among the other NHIF -administered schemes, the 
elderly/disabled and Health Insurance Subsidy Program schemes have recent payout ratios of 50 
percent and 45 percent, respectively,  in 2016/17, which is a decli ne from 2015/16 (NHIF, 2016a, 
2016b). The County Public Servant Scheme payout ratio, on the other hand, was only 23 percent in 
2015/16, down from 52 percent the previous year (NHIF, 2016a). These declines in payout ratios 
are p roblematic and could be attri buted to utilization concerns, given the fact that the schemes are 
still in stages of development and expansion and that new members may have issues with 
communication and comprehension of benefits.  
One of the challenges to ac hieving a higher payout ratio  is NHIF’s relatively high 
administrative costs. NHIF has previously come under criticism for spending a persistently 
high proportion of revenues on administrative expenses (Munge et al., 2017). In 2005, 
administrative costs co nsumed over half of the fund’ s revenues (Lakin and Magero, 2012). This 
improved over time, but administrative costs still accounted for approximately one -third of 
revenues from 2012 –2014 (Munge et al., 2017). According to NHIF’s 2016/17 Audited  Financial 
Statement, however, this propo rtion fell considerably to about 22 percent; this is still considered 
high by international standards, with a proportion of  5 percent to 10 percent considered more 
feasible (NHIF, 2016b). This drop is also partially a function  of the large increase in rev enues; in 
absolute terms, administrative expenses continued to increase from KSh 3.76 billion in 2013/14 to 
KSh 8.3 billion in 2016/17 (NHIF, 2014, 2016b). NHIF will have to contain operating costs under 
the new revenue collect ion scheme in order to sustai n this positive trend in the proportion of 
revenue spent on administration and to support a higher payout ratio for beneficiaries.  
Private Health Insurance  
The private health insurance market in Kenya has grown over the last 2 0 years . In 
2016, approximate ly 1.5 million Kenyans were covered by private health insurance, up from 
600,000 in 2009 (Barnes et al., 2009). Private health insurance is also accounting for an 
increasing proportion of THE, growing from 7 to 11 percent betwe en 2009/10 and 2015/16 (see 
Figure 25). The private insurance sector is still relatively small, however, covering only about 3 
percent of the population, with 9.4 percent of the insured covered by private insurance and more 
than 88 percent covered through NHIF. Micro health insurance and mobile health wallets such as 
M-TIBA are discussed separately in Chapter 8.  
Private insurance is provided through two vehicles —medical insurance providers 
and insurance companies.  Medical insurance providers are equivalent to managed care 
organizations , while insurance companies providing health insurance are general insurance 
companies authorized to underwrite medical insurance. Both are regulated by the Insurance 
Regulatory Authority (IRA). According to the IRA, as of Febr uary 2017, there were 29 medi cal 
insurance providers and 11 insurance companies offering health insurance products (IRA, 2017a, 
2017b).

 73 Private premium revenues have been steadily increasing, but profits have been fairly 
minimal. Gross premium revenue was  over KSh 38 billion in 2016,  more than quadrupling from 
KSh 9 billion in 2011 and outpacing the growth of the general insurance market (Insurance 
Regulatory Authority, 2018). Benefit expenses have also increased, implying that the industry 
claims ratio ha s increased (Figure 45). Desp ite the high premium revenues, profits are low. In 
2016, the average loss ratio was nearly 75 percent, and the entire industry (medical insurance 
providers and insurance companies) recorded profits of only KSh 350 million (IRA,  2016).

Gross Premiums Incurred Claims
Most private plans target formal sector workers and wealthier socioeconomic 
groups, with varying levels of service coverage. Private insurance is commonly offered to 
formal sector employees and their dependents, largely in urban areas (Munge et al., 2016). Plans 
vary significantly in terms of premium, benefits, and claim limits. Most benefits packages are 
divided into inpatient and outpatient services (which can be purchased together or separately) and 
“top -up” packages like dental (Munge et al., 2016). Pri vate insurance benefits packages all have 
financial caps per member (inpatient caps are typically lower than outpatient), as well as waiting 
periods for coverage, such as a 10-month waiting period for maternity coverage under some 
schemes (Munge et al., 20 16). 
There is no industry-wide standard for accreditation, contracting, and quality 
assurance mechanisms, making administration costly and reimbursement rates and 
quality variable . There are no explicit regulations governing whom private insurers can contract 
to provide services, including public, private, and international providers. Insurers negotiate 
reimbursement rates with providers based on average historical costs, and reimbursement is 
typically on a fee- for-service basis. Inpatient reimbursements are paid at a rate less than NHIF 
reimbursements. There may also be co- payment requirements, to limit beneficiaries’ use of more 
expensive providers (Munge et al., 2016). Quality monitoring is generally minimal, except in 
response to specific complaints, as insurers are more concerned with monitoring costs. Access, 
quality, and quantity of health services for Kenyans with private health insurance coverage are 
most often influenced by the type of scheme, premium, location of the member, and in many cases, 
the medical budget of their employer. There is, however, evidence to suggest that stronger 
regulation through bodies like the IRA can improve the quality and accountability of providers 
through private insurers (Munge et al., 2016). 
 Health Insurance  
 74 As Kenya attempts to expand coverage of insurance through NHIF, there is a 
continued role for the expanding private insurance sector. The Roadmap Towards 
Univers al Health Coverage (2018 –2022) notes that voluntary insurance, like private or 
community -based schemes, can supplement the services and levels of benefits covered by the UHC -
BBP. The ability of the private insurance market to co -exist alongside national or  social health 
insurance schemes as complementary or supplementary coverage is documented in ma ny 
countries. This offers additional choice for those who, through their own resources or employment, 
have the ability to pay for additional services, pharmaceut icals including branded drugs, and higher 
hospital inpatient care levels. It is the role of the  GOK, through the MOH, to improve regulations 
and coordination with the private market to ensure that private insurance complements or 
supplements the UHC -EBP or  even the current NHIF benefits and expansion path, offers viable 
products, and provides member s with high -quality services.  
Discussion  
Previous chapters have already discussed general points related to expanding insurance coverage 
alongside a need to con tinue public sector, tax -based financing for key health needs for the 
medium term. The followin g points relate specifically to NHIF and its future expansion and reform.  
Kenya has made significant progress in expanding 
coverage under NHIF. Overall membersh ip has been 
increasing, and targeted efforts to increase enrollment among 
the informal sector and the poor have shown promise. NHIF 
is also making progress in expanding t he benefits package to 
attract and meet the needs of its members. As the GOK 
considers  the NHIF reform agenda with the recently formed 
Task Force (Box 8), it needs to contend with some key trends 
and re -evaluate the sustainability of the scheme in light of  the 
ambition.  
Effective targets and scale -up strategies for NHIF 
will require reliab le data on true current coverage 
rates. As discussed above, there are considerable 
discrepancies between survey -based and NHIF membership 
estimates. Reliable data on popu lation coverage are critical to 
targeting enrollment strategies and also to tracking p rogress 
toward universal coverage. NHIF will have to improve record 
keeping and information systems. Members who have died, 
for example, should be promptly removed from m embership. 
It must also accurately count families with two formal sector 
employees, bo th of whom are counted as primary members; it 
cannot multiply both of these members by the average family 
size. There must also be communication across enrollment 
pathway s to ensure that members are not double counted, such as secondary students who might 
already be claimed as dependents under NHIF. If NHIF is to be the vehicle for UHC, it must first 
accurately count the number of Kenyans that it covers.   
It is clear, how ever, that NHIF is approaching near saturation of formal sector 
enrollment and that fu ture expansion will depend on its ability to reach and retain 
informal sector members. As discussed above, it is more challenging to enroll and collect 
premiums from info rmal sector workers without regular paychecks from which to deduct 
contributions. Beca use enrollment is voluntary, informal sector members are more likely to join Box 8. 2019 GOK NHIF

 75 when they are in need of services and to stop paying when they are well, contributing to adve rse 
selection. Brief waiting periods, such as the two months that informal sector memb ers must 
currently wait to use NHIF benefits after enrolling, can help deter this. NHIF will also need to 
continue its efforts to make contributing easier for informal se ctor households through platforms 
like NHIF Mobile and M -TIBA. Promising examples of t hese kinds of platforms are discussed 
further in Chapter 8.  
As NHIF continues to expand in terms of both population coverage and the benefits 
package, it must carefully consider both equity and financial sustainability in 
establishing appropriate premium rates. The government will need to subsidize premiums 
for the poor and vulnerable, requiring continued investment of public resources, as discussed in 
Chapter 4. For memb ers with the ability to pay, in both the formal and informal sector, premiums 
should b e progressive and actuarially determined to pay for the current benefits package. 
SupaCover includes a comprehensive package of services that NHIF will have to ensure tha t it can 
sustainably pay for, including offering sufficient compensation to providers to incentivize quality as 
well as to incentivize private providers to contract with NHIF. While increasing premium rates may 
be politically challenging, if actuarially ne cessary, NHIF will have better success if it can 
demonstrate the value to members in t erms of the range, quality, and accessibility of services 
covered.  
The proposed NHIF expansion framework has pro -equity dimensions; however, 
resources for subsidizing cov erage for a significant share of the poor and vulnerable 
must still be found . Currentl y, civil servants and formal sector workers, both of whom typically 
belong to higher wealth quintiles in Kenya, enjoy superior benefits packages to sponsored 
programs for  needier members. The GOK should follow NHIF enrollment growth with a long -term 
plan f or harmonization of benefits across the segments and required investment in the supply side 
of the health system to allow effectively equal access to health services. The  total resources to pay a 
fair premium for these subsidized groups in the future, suff icient to sustain payments to providers 
of possibly expanded benefits and utilization, will require a financial commitment from the 
national Treasury, as well as a plan f or partial contribution from county governments.  
Achieving universal health coverage ( UHC) through expanded health insurance 
membership, driven by a model based on NHIF, will also require considerable effort 
to strengthen the systems necessary to effective ly purchase health services. As it 
expands coverage of different populations, Kenya sh ould work toward integrating the various 
schemes to reduce fragmentation and more effectively pool risk. Covering this broader population 
will also require clearer defini tion of the services to be purchased. Further defining and adopting 
the UHC -EPB will b e an important step, and adoption must consider cost as well as quality and 
equity of services. The Afya Care pilots will provide valuable information on the ability of t he 
system to respond to increased demand for secondary care, which can inform future p repayment 
reforms. NHIF must also continue its efforts to strengthen and reform purchasing and provider 
payment mechanisms to ensure that it is paying for services effici ently, with sufficient incentives 
for quality.  Government Resources

6. OTHER HEALTH FINANCING SOU RCES AND 
THEIR ROLE  
Over half of health expenditures in Kenya are financed by households and external 
funders, which has importan t implications for long -term sustainability and financial 
protection.  External funders are a significant so urce of resources for health, particularly for key 
health programs like HIV. Further, as discussed in Chapter 3, households account for a substantial  
portion of total health spending, nearly all of which is OOP. Particularly as external funds are likely 
to decline, health financing reforms must consider how to mobilize sufficient domestic resources 
for health while protecting households from the burden  of OOP expenditures.  
Trends in External Resources  
External funding from donor governments and multilatera l organizations has been 
an important resource for health financing in sub -Saharan Africa, particularly for 
specific, priority interventions and disease areas, including HIV, tuberculosis, 
malaria, and reproductive health.  From 2002 to 2010, external funds  for health increased 
each year, especially in the second half of the decade, reflecting the scale -up of large global health 
initiatives like the Global Fund and the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR). Since the beginning of the curre nt decade, however, this rapid growth in external 
resources for health has started to decline (Wexler et al., 2013). External r esources in Kenya have 
followed a similar trend.   
In Kenya, external resources are declining as a percentage of THE, but they co ntinue 
to play a significant role in financing healthcare.  In 2009/10, external funds from 
development partners accounted for 3 2 percent of THE. By 2015/16, this had declined by 10 
percentage points to 22 percent of THE. As a percentage of GDP, development  partners’ funding 
for health declined from 1.8 percent to 1.1 percent. Over the same period, the government 
Other Financing Sources  
 77 contribution to TH E increased from 27 to 34 percent, surpassing external funds as a share of THE 
(Figure 46). External funding has also fallen in a bsolute terms since 2012/14, from KSh 64.1 billion 
to KSh 53.2 billion in 2015/16 (MOH, 2017b).

External financing as a share of total resources for key health programs is also 
declining in Kenya . The shares of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria programming funded by 
external sources all fell between 2012/13 and 2015/16, from 72 percent, 37 percent, and 39 percent 
to 62 percent, 28 percent, and 27 percent, respectively (Table 12). NCDs are the only health area to 
be more heavily externally funded than in 2013, increasing slightly from 17.1 percent to 19.5 
percent of total resources (MOH, 2017b). This is reflective of increasing attention to NCDs among 
donor governments and multilateral organizations as the disease burden in low- and middle-
income countries grows (Table 12) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2017).   
A significant share of external spending on health is off-budget, which can pose 
challenges to domestic strategic planning for health. In 2009/10, 83 percent of donor 
funding was off-budget, equivalent to 27 percent of total health expenditure. The share of off-
budget resources declined but remains the bulk of external funding; 73 percent of external funds 
were off-budget in 2015/16. Off-budget support has fallen further as a percentage of THE, to 16.4 
percent, but is still a significant share of health expenditures (see Figure 47) (MOH, 2017b). Off-
budget support is mainly earmarked as project support specific to disease or intervention and is 
channeled through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). These resources play an important 
role in financing healthcare but are not captured in government budgets and may not necessarily 
align with country or county health priorities.

All of these trends, in terms of the share of total resources and off -budget support, 
can be seen  in the HIV response. The bulk of HIV expenditures are financed through external 
sources, largely through PEPFAR and Global Fund, although this proportion has declined in recent 
years. In 2012/13, 73 percent of total spending on HIV was financed through of f-budget external 
sources; off -budget external sources accounted for 62 percent in 2015/16 (Figure 48). In absolute 
terms, however, off -budget funding has incr eased from approximately KSh 34.8 billion to KSh 42.6 
billion over the same period. These resourc es do not include on -budget external support spent 
through the government budget. Much of Global Fund support, for example, is spent directly 
through the MOH. Thus, the actual share of HIV financing from the government is even less 
relative to external fun ds. In 2015/16, the government financed 22 percent of HIV spending, but 
this figure captures some external resources (MOH, 2017b). This domestic share for HIV and 
tuberculosis (TB) is likely to continue to increase (Figure 49) , although reliable estimates of true 
domestic, government tax -financed spending on programs across all uses are not available.

Trends in Household Spending on Health  
Households are a significant source of health spending i n Kenya, and the vast 
majority of this spending continues to come from OOP expenditures at the point of 
care, placing households at risk of incurring CHE. Having to pay for healthcare OOP 
creates financial barriers to care and threatens the financial secur ity of households. OOP spending 
can be used as a measure of financial protection provided by the health sy stem, a key dimension of 
UHC (see Chapter 3 for further discussion of OOP and financial protection).  
Including both OOP expenditures and 
insurance premiums, household 
spending has consistently accounted 
for nearly one -third of THE since 
2001/02. Househol ds accounted for 32 
percent of health expenditures in 2012/13 
and 33 percent in 2015/16 (MOH, 2017b).  
Nearly all household spending is OOP; 
only a marginal amount is pooled 
through prepayment schemes (Figure 
50). Prepayment schemes, such as NHIF 
and privat e or community -based health 
insurance schemes, accounted for only 6 
percent of household spending in 20 15/16, a 
decline from 15 percent in 2009/10. (MOH, 
2017b). Prepayment allows households to 
pay for health in a predictable way, 
protecting from financial  burden. Low 
enrollment in these schemes places 
households at greater risk of CHE.  31% 31% 33% 34%13%15%55%38% 37%13% 10%13%

 80 Overall, private hea lth expenditure in Kenya is dominated by OOP household 
spending . Private health expenditures predominately come from two sources —private firms (i.e., 
through purchasing insurance or operating health facilities for employees) and household OOP 
payments. Ove r the last five years, on average, OOP expenditure has accounted for nearly three -
quarters of private health expenditure (MOH, 2017b). It has declined, t hough, as a share of private 
spending since 2001 (Figure 51), in part reflecting the increase in privat e insurance coverage (see 
Chapter 5 for discussion of insurance coverage). Comparatively, however, Kenya has consistently 
had a significantly higher prop ortion of private health expenditure from OOP than its neighbors 
(Figure 52).

Discussion  
External resources were significa nt for health in Kenya but are likely to continue 
declining in the future. Kenya is progressing on its journey to self -reliance, but it needs to do 
more to increase long -term sustainability, particularly for key disease areas and for related health 
system strengthening. External financing accounts for over a fifth of THE and is largely off -budget 
and target ed toward disease -specific responses. Historically, external financing has been a prime 
source of scale -up and health system strengthening spending for H IV, TB, and malaria, as well as a 83%74%68.1% 71.4%69.9%17%26%31.9% 38.6%30.1%

 81 few other key programs, and has had a profound impact on health facil ities and community -based 
programs. However, the burden for some of these diseases or health needs is more concentrated in 
certain counties. As these fun ds reduce, the county governments in question will need to step up, 
using diverse domestic sources. A f uture with lower levels of external financing more acutely 
focused on the highest -burden counties bodes complex sustainability issues for counties across  
spectrums of disease burden, devolved national resources per capita, and local financing capability. 
Counties previously receiving higher amounts of external funding may have both accrued health 
system benefits not available to other counties, as well as higher dependency, which in the future 
may contribute to inter -county health disparities.  
Despite these challenges, it is promising 
that government spending on health has 
surpassed external funds, and at the same 
time, off -budget support is declining as a 
proportion of overall external funding. 
Increased domestic resources for health will be 
critical to addressing the burden of OOP and the 
dependency on external funds.  The increased 
proportion of on -budget support also indicates 
opportunity for increased GOK ownership and 
better coordination across domestic and external 
funds, allowing for bette r long -term strategic 
planning. The current macroeconomic climate 
(discussed in Chapter 4) suggests that the GOK will 
have the capacity to raise additional funds fo r 
health, with some constraints. The extent to which 
these resources are channeled to health , however, 
is a question of prioritization. For key vertical 
programs, the additional challenge to maintain 
prioritization from the Treasury is to execute the 
alloc ated funds within each fiscal year to meet the 
next budgetary cycle (see Box 9 for the HIV c ase). 
Both levels of government will have to ensure 
efficient and well -utilized investments in health.  
The high proportion of OOP spending poses 
a key equity chall enge for the health 
financing system in Kenya. Despite policy 
efforts to reduce financial ba rriers to care, like Linda Mama and the free primary healthcare 
program, and the increase in prepayment scheme coverage through NHIF, OOP spending has 
consistently accounted for nearly 30 percent of THE. Only a fraction of household health spending 
is pool ed. As discussed in Chapter 3, OOP expenditures leave the bottom two quintiles of Kenyans 
vulnerable. The current user fee removal programs, including Afya Care pil ots, are critical 
experiments in increasing financial protection, but they do not cover all services nor all of the 
population. In the long term, against an SHIF vision, Kenya aims to increase its efforts to enroll 
Kenyans under NHIF as the main prepayment  mechanism, allowing households to plan for the 
costs of healthcare. The GOK will also need to work on NHIF reform to adopt the UHC -EBP 
sustainably and design reimbursement mechanisms that sufficiently cover the costs of service 
provision for providers so that they do not have incentives to charge informal or illegal payment.  
To successfully address the twin challenges posed by high OOP expenditures and 
declining external resources, integration of vertical programs into the emerging Box 9. Successes and challenges in

 82 health financing reform  vision is necessary. As external resources decline , public spending 
will have to fill the gaps and ensure that that key health programs like HIV, TB, and malaria are 
both sustained and scaled. County governments, with responsibility over primary and secon dary 
care, are required to step up, but many may fa ce a challenge in doing so. This then requires 
attention to where and how external funding flows are changing —geographically and across health 
system needs —so that additional national resources can be prop erly targeted. There is also risk that 
declining ex ternal resources will increase the financial burden on certain types of households, 
especially if pressure on facilities or community programs increases; GOK efforts via various 
schemes will be needed to m itigate this. In the long term, if widespread enrol lment in NHIF and 
other prepayment schemes is a desired outcome, subsidized membership for the poor and 
vulnerable will be corollary, and at least some element of programs previously dependent on 
external resources should be integrated into these schemes.Government Resources

7. EVOLVING ROLE OF THE  PRIVATE HEALTH 
SECTOR  
From service provision to pharmaceutical manufacturing to raising capital investible 
in the health sector, Kenya’s health financing system  both impacts and is impacted by 
trends in the private health sector. Kenya has a vibrant private health sector that i s taking up 
a larger share of THE. Ensuring an enabling environment, regulations, and strategic purchasing 
mechanisms that increase afford ability and quality of private sector services and products will 
harness the sector to achieve the country’s UHC goals . While a comprehensive review of the 
emerging trends in the private sector is beyond the scope of this chapter, the chapter does focus on  
the most pertinent issues connected to financing private healthcare, especially as it relates to the 
issues around re ducing OOP expenditures, addressing the challenges and opportunities in 
decentralization, and the intersection of private providers with N HIF. This chapter is grouped by 
the key sector components: (1) providers, (2) pharmaceuticals, and (3) a new framework  for private 
sector engagement to realize public sector goals. The private health sector includes not only the 
faith -based organizations ( FBOs) and NGOs that have been providing healthcare to Kenyans for 
decades, but also the private commercial sector that  is progressively becoming more organized to 
provide efficient, profit -making, high -quality services and products to the Kenyan population  as 
well as to medical tourists. The Kenya pharmaceutical market is perceived as one of the most 
investible markets in  sub-Saharan Africa, and private investment is expected to continue to grow. 
For the Kenyan government to achieve its national goals more efficiently, it needs to effectively 
leverage private sector human resources, infrastructure, and capital.  
Private Sec tor Service Delivery Capacity and Demand  
Private sector facilities are increasingly significant in terms of available health 
infrastructur e and THE. The private sector across for -profit and FBO/NGO subsectors operates 
almost half of the health facilities i n the country. The private sector, especially the for -profit or 
commercial sector, has grown significantly (Figures 53 and 54), potentiall y in response to the needs 
Private Sector  
 84 and demands of the population. In parallel, 
the proportion of THE represented by 
private providers has grown over the years 
(Figure 55). As THE has grown by 63 
percent, the health expenditure channeled 
through private providers has grown at 
more than 150 percent every three years. 
Most notably, private clinics saw a more 
than sixfold increase in their share of THE 
between 2009/10 and 2015/16.  
Private providers often provide 
services that match or surpass those 
offered within the public sector. A 2017 
study  sampling public and private facilities 
across six counties found that across seven 
essential outpatient services, private and 
public sector providers often offered similar 
sets of services (Chakraborty et al., 2017). 
Family plan ning services were almost 
universally offered at all facilities, regardless 
of type. In the case of post -abortion care, 
private non -FBO providers were most likely 
to offer the service (58 percent) compared to 
public facilities (32 percent) or FBO facilitie s 
(18 percent).   
That said,  the lack of key 
commodities, specialized skills, and 
incentives can limit access to certain 
services through the private sector. 
Predominantly, HIV care and treatment 
services were less likely to be available 
through the private  sector, especially within 
the independent commercial sector. It is 
likely that these private providers were not 
able to access HIV tests and treatment 
commodities and drugs at an affordable 
rate, and/or access training to provide these 
services. Access to  maternal and child health 
services was also inconsistent; compared to 
92 percent of the public facilities offering 
these services, only 65 percent of the FBOs 
and 77 percent of private providers that 
were part of social franchises offered the 
service. On the other hand, 96 percent of 
commercial private providers offered this 
service. This discrepancy may highlight the 
difference in response by private 
commercial providers to perceived client 
demand for this service, compared to social Figure 53. Number of primary health cl inics, by

original franchise operator.   
As demand for essential reproductive and maternal health services has grown, the 
preference for private sector services has increased. Modern contracep tive prevalence in 
Kenya ha s recently increased from 39 percent in 2008/09 to 53.2 percent in 2014, while the share 
of facility -based births increased from 43 percent to 61 percent over the same period, based on the 
KDHS. As a proportion of all live births , births at a private secto r facility increased from 10.3 
percent in 2008/09 to 15.2 percent by 2014. Delivery in a private sector facility is more common 
for women of higher socioeconomic status. The 2014 KDHS estimated that 34 percent of modern 
methods o f contraception were suppli ed by the private sector, similar to the level from the 
2008/09 KDHS (36 percent). In addition to condoms and pills, which usually have high access 
through the private sector, a significant number of users of intrauterine devices  (IUDs) (35 
percent) and in jectables (36 percent) accessed their services from private providers in 2014 (KNBS 
et al., 2014).  
Whether clients seek services from the private sector varies significantly across 
health areas. In 2013, 52 percent of the urban p opulation visited a private  provider (across 
nonprofits, for -profits, pharmacies, and retail shops) for their outpatient visit, as did 32 percent in 
the rural areas, where ability to pay is lower (MOH, 2016a). Clients also often preferred the private 
secto r for family planning (Chak raborty et al., 2017). However, for treatment of children under -five 
with fever, the public sector was the dominant point of call. Preliminary results from 2015/16 
Kenya National Health Accounts indicate that expenditures for gen eral outpatient curative se rvices 
tend to skew slightly toward the public sector, but private sector (especially the nonprofit sector) 
provides the lion’s share of specialized care, such as optometry and dentistry, long -term care, or 
preventative services (MOH, 2017b).  
After initial ly contracting only public facilities under Linda Mama, NHIF now 
contracts both public and private facilities to provide free maternal healthcare, but 
the impact on use of private sector services is still unclear. Initially, both  the free primary 
and mater nal healthcare policies applied only to public facilities. Evidence from KDHS analysis 
after this initial, public -facility -based policy rollout suggested that the policy reduced deliveries in 
private facilities. There was a gener al increase in the proporti on of public facility births. Some of 
this came from a decline in home births, but in rural settings, there was a greater shift away from 
private facilities (Obare et al., 2016). DHIS analysis also found a decline in both faith -based and 
for-profit facilit ies, representing a net shift to public facilities; the same analysis also found a 
reversal in the previous overall trend toward private deliveries (Wang and Dutta, forthcoming). 
Since 2016, however, NHIF has expanded free matern al health services to inclu de both nonprofit, 
faith -based, and for -profit private facilities. These analyses do not include any data after the 
inclusion of private facilities, and the trends identified may not hold as more private facilities are 
contracted  by NHIF.  
Private health se ctor services outside of essential primary healthcare that are 
affordable to the poor remain a distant vision, unless prepayment schemes scale up 
significantly and contract these providers. While there are many private service se condary 
and tertiary facili ties across the country, most services remain out of reach for poor and rural 
populations (Figure 56). NHIF partnership with some of the premier tertiary private hospitals has 
reduced the burden on specialized treatments such as cardiac surgery and chemoth erapy from the 
public sector’s Kenyatta Hospital (Otuki, 2017b, 2017c). Compared to 2016, NHIF notes that 
patients waiting for cardiac treatment have decreased by 262 patients to 1,173 in 2017 (Otieno, 
2017b). However, the lack o f specialists remains a bot tleneck for both the public and private sectors 
to expand more complex care (MOH, 2015). Many facilities lack the medical equipment for NCDs, Private Sector  
 86 such as electro cardiography machines 
(Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, 
2014 ). Where they are available, NCD 
services such as dialysis, renal transplant, 
and heart surgery remain cost -prohibitive 
for most populations to access through the 
private sector (MOH, 2 016c). NHIF 
reimbursements do not fully cover the cost 
of care. The NHI F benefits package limits 
cardiac surgery reimbursement to KSh 
500,000, while typical private hospitals 
charge KSh 1.2 million for cardiac surgery, 
including stays in intensive care pos t-
surgery (Otuki, 2017c). Despite increasing 
demand, there has not been  significant 
investment in scaling up such service 
offerings in peri -urban areas or even 
increasing availability in Nairobi and 
Mombasa. Several public sector facilities 
have benefited from the GOK Managed 
Equipment Services (MES) project 
(discussed furthe r in Chapter 8), which has 
installed specialized equipment such as for 
radiology and specialized surgery. However, 
there are few such partnerships benefitting 
private hospital operators .  
Kenya should explore the expansion of the private sector to provide key services in 
order to supplement overburdened public health facilities. Services such as ART for HIV 
that could be provided by general practitioners in private clinics, with additional training, are an 
example where public -private partnerships are neede d. A recent study on HIV services provided 
through the private commercial sector showed that it already provides an equal share of HIV 
testing and counseling as the public secto r (MOH, 2017a). The study also found that the primary 
barrier to providing high -quality HIV care and treatment through the private sector was lack of 
access to affordable antiretrovirals (ARVs). Due to limited options for ARVs available through the 
private  market (i.e., private importers and distributors), private providers were like wise limited in 
their ability to offer appropriate treatment for patients. If such barriers for private providers to 
access affordable, quality -assured ARVs were reduced and pro viders aligned with national 
treatment guidelines, these providers could offer paid services for patients with the ability to pay 
and a desire for personalized ART services which they perceive as more discreet. This can help 
reduce the strain on public sec tor financial and human resources. Based on a recent survey, private 
sector pro viders were willing to expand such treatment services to clients whom they diagnose as 
HIV positive (MOH, 2017a).   
Homegrown social franchises that organize private providers an d ensure high -
quality services and products could be an entry point for the gov ernment to expand 
access to essential health services for lower -income populations through the private 
sector. Marie Stopes International and PSI, for example, have established global social franchise 
networks in recent years. Local professional associatio ns followed these models and have 
successfully built local social franchises with strong brand recognition and the reputation for high -
quality products. For example, PharmNet ph armaceutical chain, established by the Kenya Figure 56. Density of private commercial 
hospitals, per 10,000 population  
 
Source: MOH, 2017c  
Private Sector  
 87 Pharmaceutical Association, built a membership of more than 300 pharmacists as part of the 
franchise and was self -funded by 2016 (PSP4H, 2016b). The LabNet social franchise, which built 
off of the experiences of  PharmNet, quickly scaled up and is now expanding beyond Kenya. In 
addition, Do cNet, a network of consulting physicians, is expected to be launched soon. These 
networks have become cost -efficient by using economies of scale in procurement and maintaining 
high quality (PSP4H, 2016b). The focus on quality is inherent in the process of building the social 
franchise brand, with the technical assistance of the franchisor —in the case of these networks, 
professional associations which already have internal capabil ities around regulatory functions and 
training. For these reasons, and because these networks unite the fragmented private sector to 
make it easier for the public sector to regulate and partner with them, the trend toward franchising 
can be a positive step  toward expanding health services through NHIF (see Chapter 8 for a 
discussion of the experience of the Amua franchise in NHIF empanelment).  
Payment schemes such as NHIF can increase availability of high -quality, low -cost 
services and products across the private sector by offering right incentives. Issues 
related to accessing high -quality, low -cost commodities are further addressed in the sections 
below. In the case of services, empanelment with NHIF can be a motivator or a deterrent to 
providing services depending on the structure of the payment mechanisms. For example, under 
Marie Stopes Kenya’s Amua network, providers were empaneled with  NHIF (see Chapter 8). The 
capitation payment scheme, however, reduced the incentive for the providers to offer family  
planning services. Since there were no additional case -based payments associat ed with family 
planning, this service was merely seen as a cost, and thus provider -initiated family planning family 
planning counseling decreased (Mackay, 2017). NHIF is current ly reviewing whether case -based 
payments should be made for primary care outpat ient clinics for family planning. Similarly, 
without appropriate incentives and oversight, fraud such as upcoding and claims for services never 
provided may proliferate. Already , these cases have led to contention between NHIF and the 
contracted private pr oviders (Otuki, 2017a). Given that private providers are keenly sensitive to 
payment rates and to what is included in the benefits package, strategies such as better health 
information systems and rapid verification systems aided by information technologie s could assist 
with continued scale -up of key services through the private sector, in partnership with NHIF.  
As another alternative to reaching the fragmented informal sector, NHIF could 
incentivize uptake of insurance by empaneling private sector provide rs known to 
target this population.  The Marie Stopes Amua social franchise program, for example, includes 
420 mid -level providers offering reproductive health services throughou t Kenya. Most of these 
providers have not worked with NHIF and perceive NHIF ra tes to be low. Recently, Amua has been 
working with NHIF and its franchisee clinics to contract with around 150 clinics as primary care 
providers, which are paid through capitat ion payments by NHIF. These clinics were selected based 
on provider motivation,  level of quality of care (assessed using the SafeCare model), and 
geographical fit in reaching populations further away from public sector clinics (Mackay, 2017). 
The initial r ollout has seen some challenges, such as the length of time it takes for contra cting, the 
cost required to improve the facility to meet quality standards, and the lack of capacity for the 
clinics to manage costs within the capitation payment (Mackay, 2017) . It has also, however, shown 
promise in supporting scale -up of NHIF coverage. Large, organized provider networks enable more 
strategic purchasing. Further, providers must promote their services to attract potential clients 
and, as more clients choose the clinic as care provider, more clients are exposed to and reached by 
NHIF. There  are also new opportunities being tested whereby the Amua facilities are partnering 
with community health volunteers to sign up community members for NHIF and be part of the 
capitation group served by the health facility, further expanding NHIF’s reach (Ma ckay, 2017).  Private Sector  
 88 Expansion of the Pharmaceutical Sector in Response to Health 
Financing Shifts  
The pharmaceutical manufacturing and sales sectors have seen robust growth as 
demand for healthcare grows . In 2016, the pharmaceutical sector reached approximately KSh 
81 billion (Marcopolis, 2016) and was projected to grow to KSh 122 billion by 2020 (International 
Trade Administration, 2016). The majority of the drugs are procured through the public sector’s 
Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) or through the Mi ssion for Essential Drugs and 
Supplies (MEDS), the faith -based drug procurement system. According to the most recent National 
Health Accounts data, as much as 53 percent of the pharmaceuticals are procured through these 
two mechanisms (MOH, 2017b). Althoug h there is a significant number of private for -profit service 
providers who also procure drugs and commodities, due to the fragmentation of this market there 
have been no  specific mechanisms created to serve it, nor is this subsector of the pharmaceutical 
market able to achieve competitiveness and efficiency (Chakraborty et al., 2017). Accordingly, the 
purchasing power is significantly consolidated by the government (throu gh KEMSA) and MEDS. 
While the drug procurement budget has shifted toward the county th rough devolution, 
procurement guidelines specify that the counties should primarily procure drugs through KEMSA. 
Thus, the majority of pharmaceutical manufacturers focus on responding to procurements from 
these two large clients and do not invest significa ntly in marketing and sales for private for -profit 
providers. This means that the selection of drugs is limited within the commercial market, and 
prices are often high du e to lack of competition and buying power among the private providers 
(PSP4H, 2014a). Ultimately, this leads to lower -quality and high -cost services for the patients in 
the private sector. MEDS is starting to allow private commercial providers who serve th e lower -
income population to access their commodities; similarly, consolidation and or ganization of the 
private sector could reverse this trend.  
Current purchasing preferences of KEMSA and MEDS do not necessarily encourage 
growth in local pharmaceutical m anufacturing, and they result in lower -quality 
drugs being pushed to lower -income rura l markets . KEMSA and MEDS, both significantly 
reliant on donor funding to procure drugs, are often required to purchase from WHO -certified 
manufacturers. Of the 34 local manufacturers in Kenya, only one has successfully received WHO 
certification for Good Manufacturing Practices (Marcopolis, 2016). Thus, most local manufacturers 
are excluded from KEMSA and MEDS procurement, and they operate only within the fragmented 
priva te market, where it is costly to market and distribute the drugs. Indeed, local manufa cturers 
enjoy only 28 percent of the total share of pharmaceutical revenues (UNIDO, 2010). At the same, 
due to poor regulation and limited post -market surveillance, low -quality drugs are able to enter the 
market. While penetration of low -quality drugs can be a problem throughout public and private 
sectors (Wafula et al., 2016), the highly fragmented retail sector has a higher risk of being flooded 
by cheaper and lower -qual ity drugs. The rural markets are often served by informal pharmaceutical 
retailers wit h several layers of middlemen along the way; as price is the primary competitive factor, 
this poorer, rural segment of the population is disproportionately at risk of acc essing lower -quality 
drugs (PSP4H, 2014a).  
Despite local market dynamics, there is the  expectation of growth for Kenyan 
pharmaceutical manufacturers by serving the region, and this scale could benefit the 
Kenyan market by increasing quality while reducing cost . Notably, the Public 
Procurement and Asset Disposal Act of 2015 should give prefe rence to local manufacturers if they 
are able to meet quality standards. Should local manufacturing firms meet WHO certification 
requirements, there will be significant m arket opportunity within the public procurement system. 
In addition, investors are see ing both domestic and international opportunities, as Kenya is a hub 
in the East African region, with free -trade agreements being established across the Common Private Sector  
 89 Market for  Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). Already, Kenya is a major net exporter with 
their East African continent partners, exporting US$254 million worth of chemicals and related 
substances, while importing only US$5.1 million from the region (COMESA, 2016) . The size of the 
South African pharmaceutical exports to the region shows the potenti al growth that Kenyan 
manufacturers could gain, and investors acknowledge that Kenya is geographically better placed 
than South Africa to serve this market. That said, at  least for the near future, these local 
pharmaceutical manufacturing firms must import  the raw ingredients necessary to produce the 
final products. The Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act of 2014 added inputs or raw materials for 
pharmaceutical products to the  exemption list, thereby benefitting local manufacturing firms. 
However, imports of fi nished pharmaceutical products have always been on the exemption list, 
countering the benefits of the amendment. Local manufacturing will, in the long run, achieve lower 
cost and improved efficiency in the health system. Government reform in its path towar d UHC will 
require the cyclical approach of gradually shifting regulations to further favor local production and 
facilitate investments in local manufacturing capacity; i n this way, the government will be able to 
progressively procure high -quality, locally  manufactured pharmaceuticals.  
Partnerships to Harness the Private Sector  
The regulatory environment in Kenya has not 
fully shifted toward leveraging the resources and 
capacity that the private sector could bring to the 
table. Current public -private part nership procurement 
mechanisms have been limited primarily to “build and 
operate” projects, both in health and other sectors. In 
2014, there were four potential health public -private 
partnership projects in incubation (Box 10) (The 
National Treas ury, 2014) . The Public Private Partnership 
Act established a public -private partnership mechanism 
that is only used to procure tangible services. None of 
the projects aimed to make payment on a performance 
basis, leaving behind an opportunity to incentiviz e 
efficien t and high -quality service delivery. Currently, 
only one equipment lease and infrastructure 
development project (the Managed Equipment Services 
project) is up and running (discussed further in Chapter 
8). This is a public -private partnership stru cture wher e 
the public sector is buying a service from the private 
sector, and there is minimal “leveraging” of private 
sector resources. That said, for a cash -strapped public 
sector, reducing upfront costs while increasing valuable, 
high -end equipment is a good str ategy. Opportunities 2 
and 4 from Box 11, which are “build and operate” 
projects, could have a higher potential to mobilize 
resources in that private investors could provide up -
front capital to upgrade and set up a system, with a small 
incrementa l cost to the public sector.  
New economic and trade policies could further 
incentivize private sector capital to enter the 
Kenyan healthcare market, especially in the Box 10. Public -private

local content law h ighlighted in the previous 
section, the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act of 
2015 is an opportunity for multinational 
companies interested in entering the growing 
Kenyan and East African market. The act puts tax 
incentives into place, provides preferential customs 
and excise tax arrangements, and puts no 
restrictions on foreign direct investments into the 
companies based in these zones. This is seen as a 
prime opportunity for medical device 
manufacturers, as currently there are no local 
manufacturers of medi cal equipment (Task Force 
Health Care and the Kenya Healthcare Federation, 
2016).  
Public -private partnerships of the future 
should look at ho w multiple stakeholders 
across the health sector and beyond can 
bring together their resources and 
capabilities to collaboratively develop and 
implement a solution. In the last five years, 
multi -stakeholder partnerships to address specific 
health issues ha ve emerged (Box 11) (WEF, 2016b). 
The model piloted by Novo Nordisk with support 
from the World Economic Forum in 2 013 is 
gaining traction —in September 2017, Safaricom, 
Huawei, Philips, MSD/Merck, Unilever, and Glaxo 
Smith Klein contributed to the Every Wo man 
Every Child initiative by supporting various 
complementary efforts to improve maternal health 
in six counties ( Koigi, 2017). This new way of 
building partnerships across public and private 
sectors, both local and international, ensures 
alignment of obj ectives across all players. At the 
same time that the consumer or payer is able to get 
access to cheap but high -quality products and 
service providers are able to adequately serve their patients because of readily available drugs, the 
private commercial se ctor is able to grow its revenue by expanding its target market to the “base of 
the pyramid.”  
Discussion  
Kenya’s pr ivate health sector, especially the private provider and pharmaceutical 
manufacturing sector, is growing in proportion to the population’s demand for 
health services. The number of providers is increasing, and the types of services being offered 
are becomi ng more robust and competitive with the public sector. Often, Kenyans prefer to access 
private providers due to perceived higher quality, increased privacy, and faster or more convenient 
service. Even in poorer segments of the population or more rural area s, private providers 
(including FBOs and NGOs) are often the first point of call for illness. The general tendency for the Box 11. Multi -stakeholder

Novo Nord isk and Diabetes  
Novo Nordisk, a multinational 
pharmaceutical company, is working with 
public and NGO partners to improve 
diabetes care in the lower -income 
population. By working with providers 
that serve this population (public sector, 
Christian Health As sociation of Kenya, 
and the Kenya Conference of Catholic 
Bishops), Novo Nordisk supported a full 
review of the diabetes medication 
distribution chain to ide ntify and address 
bottlenecks and set up a monitoring 
system to ensure that an appropriate 
supply of  diabetes medication is cost -
effectively distributed to the necessary 
health facility. Through this streamlined 
process, the program was able to reduce 
the price of insulin from US$17 to US$5 
between 2013 and 2015.  
e-Health Initiative by Safaricom and 
Huaw ei  
The telecom giant Safaricom and 
electronics manufacturer Huawei are 
using their information technology and 
mobile technology platform to design and 
test digital health solutions to connect 
primary clinics with referral hospitals, 
especially to reduce m aternal mortality 
and morbidity.  
 Private Sector  
 91 private sector to pay higher salaries for healthcare providers makes the sector more capable of 
responding to client demand s compared  to the public sector, which more frequently has staff 
turnover and strikes. Pharmaceutical sales have also grown, primarily through increased purchases 
through KEMSA and MEDS. Increasing numbers of multinational pharmaceutical and medical 
equipm ent compan ies, especially from India and China, are flocking to serve these two purchasers, 
thereby increasing healthy competition and choice for the two purchasers.  
However, gaps in geographic coverage and availability of services still exist, and 
access  to high -quality, affordable medicines through the private providers and 
pharmacies are still inconsistent. Services that do not require specialized skills or equipment 
are often available through the private sector. Specialized services and medical produc ts, especi ally 
to address NCDs, are still not accessible to most of the population. The strengthened procurement 
practices and increased budget allocation by the GOK for pharmaceutical products, combined with 
local content laws that prefer local manufactur ing, could  fuel further investment and growth in the 
pharmaceutical sector. However, there is a lack of regulation and quality assurance for the private 
pharmaceutical distribution subsector, which will continue to limit quality of care at lower -level 
private health  facilities.  
Scale -up of NHIF and expansion of the benefits package will likely continue to drive 
growth in the private sector. The progressive empanelment of private providers to NHIF for 
outpatient and inpatient care is improving access. Furth ermore, NH IF is attempting to deepen  its 
benefits package and is starting to get large private providers to the table to offer more complex 
services at a lower price. While there has yet to be an analysis of private providers’ motivations and 
the business case to jo in NHIF, it is likely that the scheme is finally reaching some level of scale 
with sufficient numbers of members and government financing support to make joining 
worthwhile. While the payment rates may be significantly lower than what is typicall y charged for 
clients paying OOP or through private health insurance, the volume achieved through NHIF may 
compensate for the lower margin.  
A more streamlined process for claims processing and validation, along with 
cont inued frank dialogue between the public and p rivate sectors, is necessary to 
ensure that affordable, high -quality services expand through the private sector . For 
every positive expansion of coverage by NHIF to the private sector, there are also persistent reports 
of fraudulent claims by the private s ector and unnecessary withholding of reimbursements by 
NHIF. This challenge places patients at risk of inconsistent healthcare coverage as NHIF -covered 
services are halted, and of CHE as patients attempt to brid ge care. An improved claims process, for 
exam ple, linked with a more robust health information system, could speed up the verification 
process, improving NHIF’s ability to find fraudulent claims, while reducing wait time for 
reimbursements. Understanding t hat such systems and regulations require buy -in across public 
and private sectors, the stakeholders must engage in frank dialogue to collaboratively address these 
issues. Government Resources

8. PROMISING PRACTICES  
As Kenya implements ongoing health financing reforms, it is facing challenge s 
common across countries in similar situations of enrolling the informal sector in 
prepayment schemes, ensuring quality, and mobilizing domestic resources for 
priority health areas . Insurance coverag e, especially through NHIF, is increasing, but reaching 
and enrolling members of the informal sector who have the ability to pay into these schemes is 
difficult. Further, as NHIF scales up, covering more members and providing more benefits, the 
scheme will  need mechanisms to pay for performance to ensure suffic ient availability of quality 
services. At the same time, even as prepayment coverage increases, the government must continue 
to mobilize resources for key health programs like maternal and child healt h and HIV. This chapter 
highlights promising, innovative  practices and initiatives that present opportunities to address 
these challenges, as well as preliminary lessons that can be built upon for more sustainable 
financing of healthcare in Kenya.  
Reaching  the Informal Sector with Digital Financial Services in Health 
Financing  
A sizable share of the informal sector in Kenya may have the ability to pay NHIF’s 
SupaCover charges, and successful scale -up will require convincing them to pay (see 
Chapter 5 for di scussion of NHIF coverage). The informal sector is highl y fragmented, meaning 
that there are no single unified messaging strategies to capture their attention. They lack strong ties 
to public services and expect an attractive package of services at the cos t they are willing to pay. 
This combination of traits, n eeds, and constraints makes providing healthcare access through 
traditional methods less effective. At the same time, this working poor population has some ability 
to pay for healthcare, though it is limited. Disposable income among this population is esti mated at 
approximately KSh 100 per day for the rural population and KSh 300 per day for the urban one. 
Average OOP health expenditure of approximately KSh 50 per day fits within their budget 
(SupaCove r is KSh 500 monthly), but the challenge of tapping into  and collecting these resources 
remains (PSP4H, 2014b). Emerging innovations are targeting this population and aiming to attract 
Promising Practices  
 93 them with digital financial services in health, allowing for predictabl e prepayment, among other 
benefits, which can protect th e population from the burden of paying at the point of care.   
Over the last decade, numerous mobile health insurance and health savings account 
products have emerged, promoting the ability to reach t he unbanked informal sector . 
With near -universal adoptio n of M -PESA in Kenya (Suri,  2015), mobile money —and by extension 
any digital financial services with health payments tie -in leveraging mobile money —can lower 
transaction costs, increase the ease of s aving for health and paying for insurance, and improve 
equity in healthcare access by providing affordable access to healthcare to the poor and near -poor 
(BCTA, 2016). Table 13 captures some better -known digital financial services platforms in health in 
Kenya and their characteristics, while excluding the NHIF Mobile app. Collectively, these five 
platforms active in Kenya cover approximately 1.5 million people, primarily from the informal 
sector. KNBS recorded 13.3 million informal, non -agricultural workers  in 2016 (83 percent of the 
non-agricultural workforce) (KNBS, 2017), which means that there is still significant room for 
growth in this sector. Between its inception in September 2016 to late 2018, the market leader, M -
TIBA, had paid out KSh 476 million for 273,282 clinical visits (M -TIBA, 2018).

Mobile -based digital financial services for health show promise in expanding 
prepayment coverage, particularly among near -poor informal populations, but many 
fail to become financially viable. Providing low -cost services at massive scale is typically not 
viable for traditional private insurance providers, which skews their offerings toward more 
expensive products. Mobile platforms ostensibly reduce the  per-user costs of marketing, collecting 
contributions and disbursing cash -based payments , therefore increasing the spectrum of 
financially viable products (BCTA, 2016). While there have not been many rigorous evaluations of 
mobile insurance and health sav ings digital financial services platforms in Kenya, the cases in 
Table 13 suggest their p otential. A series of case studies of mobile money platforms by Business 
Call to Action (BCTA), for example, found that they can increase access to health services and  
insurance, as well as savings for health among “bottom -of-the-pyramid” populations, or t hose 
living on less than US$8.4 per day (BCTA, 2016). The same study also indicated that they could be 
more efficient and rapid payment mechanisms for providers, resul ting in less leakage. Despite 
these benefits, however, operational costs are still signif icant, the market is competitive, and it is 
challenging to profitably serve and pool resources and risk in a crowded market in which clients 
have low incomes and a lac k of credit history. Some of the cases in Table 13 are currently defunct. 
An older exampl e not in the table is that of Changamaka Micro -Insurance Limited, which in 2012 
partnered with British American Insurance Kenya (Britam) and Safaricom to offer Linda J amii, a 
low-cost mobile insurance product. It originally targeted individuals, but in 201 5 shifted its 
approach to groups, i.e., religious organizations and cooperatives, among other groups, in an 
attempt to broaden the risk pool and counter adverse select ion. Yet, the product was discontinued 
two months later. While it had been useful for its  22,000 clients, it was not financially sustainable 
for the implementing companies (BCTA, 2016). In comparison, M -TIBA, which is backed by the 
PharmAccess Foundation, has continued to grow (Table 13).  
The successes and challenges facing mobile insurance an d savings providers offer 
lessons for the potential of scaling up coverage through these platforms in the future. 
Despite growing pains, more of these platforms continue to emerge. Experience has shown  that 
successful mobile platforms offer diverse, custom izable products. They also partner with a range of 
organizations to combine resources, information, and infrastructure (BCTA, 2016). Most mobile -
based digital health payment or microinsurance services in Kenya did not scale up significantly, 
though M -TIBA may be breaking this trend. BCTA, for example, notes that there are opportunities 
to increase collaboration and information sharing across service providers, including with NHIF, to 
reduce information asymmetry and expand the client base of risk pooling. M arket segmentation 
and offering adaptable, hybrid products will help yield more desirable products, again increasing 
the potential client base. There are also opportunities to expand the capabilities o f mobile Promising Practices  
 95 platforms to include the full range of claims and reimbursement, increasing their value and 
attractiveness to healthcare providers (BCTA, 2016).    
Paying for Performance  
In Kenya, efficient resource allocation through vouchers and other demand -side 
interventions has helped shift the provider mindse t and facility operations and is 
relevant for NHIF learning. In Kenya, the 
Reproductive Health Voucher Program implemented 
from  2006 supported over 500,000 women to deliver at a 
qualified health facility (Box 12) (Bellows, 2012). The 
scheme helped train th e providers to work within the 
structure of a claims -based, fixed -price scheme, where 
they have to manage their service costs t o stay within the 
reimbursement rate while also meeting the quality -of-
care standards set by the scheme. The voucher program 
was progressively transferred to the government 
beginning in 2011. In Kenya, there was effort to build 
financing, financial managem ent, and quality assurance 
within the government’s Program Management Unit 
(Grainger et al., 2014). Vouchers are part of Kenya’s 
Vision 2030 and have informed the rollout of the Linda 
Mama policy. Administering the voucher schemes 
requires capacity for acc reditation, quality assurance, 
claims and reimbursement processing, and engaging the 
private sector (Janisch et al., 2010). They served as a useful intermediary step toward increased 
coverage of pre -payment schemes like NHIF, by strengthening the underlyin g systems, 
mechanisms, and attitudes necessary for scale.  
Performance -based financing schemes were piloted in several counties in  Kenya and 
may inform purchasing of higher -quality services, particularly in poorly performing 
or low -access areas. A performance -based financing scheme was initially piloted by the Health 
Results Innovation Trust Fund under the World Bank in 2011 –2012 in Samburu County. Under 
this scheme, health facilities that met pre -determined, measurable service targets received 
addi tional compensation for health worker bonuses and facility improvements. Essential services 
like family planning, antenatal visits, and im munization showed significant improvements among 
the target population because of increased incentives to provide thes e services. In the year 
following implementation, for example, vaccination rates increased by 28 percent (RBFHealth, 
2012). Based on the s uccess of performance -based financing in Samburu County, the Health 
Results Innovation Trust Fund scaled up the scheme  to 21 arid and semi -arid counties with US$25 
million from the World Bank’s International Development Association (World Bank, 2013). Scal e-
up began in January 2016 with a KSh 508 million disbursement to CR Fs. This required creating a 
national framework fo r the transfer of conditional grants, which requires a ring -fenced special -
purpose account for the performance -based financing funds. Unde r the scheme, county 
departments of health that met agreed -upon performance targets for the maternal and child health 
services received additional funds. These funds were then disbursed to contracted facilities that 
provide these services. These funds coul d be used for either facility improvements (40 percent) or 
health worker compensation (60 percent) (MOH, 2014b).  
Thro ugh other performance -based financing initiatives, development partners are 
further incentivizing public sector programs to improve qualit y as well as encourage 
greater domestic resources for health . This is the premise of the World Bank -supported Box 12. Characteristics of

 96 Transfor ming Health Systems for Universal Care Project. Its overall goal is to increase the use of 
quality primary healthcare services at the coun ty level with a focus on reproductive, maternal, 
neonatal, child, and adolescent health, particularly among vulnerable  populations. This includes 
increasing access and demand for services through, for example, facility improvements and 
demand creation. Fur ther, it aims to improve institutional capacity to ensure high -quality services, 
including support for inspections, li censure, quality assurance, monitoring, evaluation, and 
reporting (MOH, 2016f). The project will approve grant funding allocation beyond t he first year 
based on counties’ achievement of health systems, service delivery, and quality metrics. In this way, 
these performance -based financing initiatives can strengthen the inherent government structures 
and health systems to achieve long -term outc omes.  
Mobilizing Resources for Priority Health Areas  
Along with incentivizing quality, external funders for health are  using new financing 
mechanisms to promote greater domestic resource allocations for key health 
programs. The US$191 million Transforming Health Systems for Universal Care Project, for 
example, is funded by a US$40 million grant from the Global Financing F acility of the World Bank. 
Another US$150 million is coming from a World Bank International Development Association 
credit —a long -term, lo w-interest concessional loan. The Global Financing Facility uses relatively 
small grants to leverage larger investment s in country -led maternal, child, and adolescent health, 
in this case in the form of International Development Association credit for coun ty expenditures 
(World Bank, 2016). Another example, the Challenge Initiative, administered by the Bill & Melinda 
Gate s Institute for Population and Reproductive Health at Johns Hopkins University, funds 
innovative approaches to reaching the urban poor wit h reproductive health services, contingent on 
local government first committing their own resources. In Kericho County , the government has 
committed US$130,000 to improving family planning access; the Challenge Initiative is meeting 
that commitment with US $130,000, as well as access to technical assistance and support in 
implementation (Mbugua, 2017).  
HIV funding earmarke d in infrastructure projects is an innovative way Kenya is 
exploring to mobilize resources for priority health areas. Some health issues, like HIV, 
have a particularly high burden among the productive, working -age population, resulting in a 
double burden t o society in terms of healthcare costs and lost productivity. Certain sectors and 
professions expose individuals to a higher risk of HIV. The GOK recognizes, for example, that 
working in road transport professions can be a major risk factor for the spread of HIV, both for 
construction workers building roads as well as truckers and transport professionals using them. 
HIV can be regarded as an  occupational health issue, and thus, road construction and 
rehabilitation contracts can include provisions for HIV ca re and treatment of the workers and local 
community. A 2017 study by the National AIDS Control Council (pending publication) showed that 
a sample of 32 road projects by the Kenyan National Highway Authority and the Kenyan Rural 
Roads Authority had allocate d a total of KSh 387 billion for HIV. On average, approximately 0.44 
percent of total budgets was allocated to HIV programming, although t his varied significantly 
across projects. The allocation of HIV funds, however, was not determined in consultation wit h 
HIV experts, and so may or may not have been used for high -priority or high -impact investments. 
There can be significant resource mobili zation in these types of earmarks through infrastructure 
and other sector projects. Better cross -sector and cross -mini stry communication and collaboration 
could help maximize the impact of these resources.  Promising Practices  
 97 The Managed Equipment Service (MES) project 
offe rs an example of mobilizing resources for 
secondary healthcare improvement through 
partnership with the private sector . Initially, the 
vision was that leasing rather than outright purchase 
would be a more efficient use of existing resources.  Under 
MES, the  GOK has partnered with General Electric, which 
provides specialized medical equipm ent (i.e., radiology 
and surgical equipment) on a pay -for-service plan that 
covers both use of the equipment as well as training and 
maintenance (Patolawala and World Bank, 2017). While 
this allows the government to upgrade facilities and 
expand specialize d services beyond referral hospitals 
without requiring large up -front capital investment, 
without an increase in trained health workers and client 
utilization, the investmen t may need more time to provide 
value (Box 13). At the same time, the arrangement i s 
designed to increase the likelihood that the equipment 
continues to function and that there will eventually be 
trained staff to use it. According to the manufacturer, the 
project initially reduced radiology referrals by 30 percent 
and reduced the cost of  scans by 30 percent by making 
services more accessible across facilities (GE, 2017). 
When operating as per its design, the model should allow 
the government to budget its c apital expenditure over a 
longer period of time and, through pay -for-service 
contra cts, get more value for its money.  
Discussion  
This chapter presents promising approaches to solving some of the key challenges 
Kenya faces in advancing UHC, particularly e nrolling the informal sector in NHIF, 
ensuring the provision of high -quality services, and mobilizing domestic resources 
for health . These practices are not silver bullets for any of the challenges, nor have they all been 
scaled to a national level. Their successes and failures, however, can provide useful insight and 
potential policy options to inform futures reforms and policies mov ing toward UHC. The GOK, 
along with NHIF and private sector actors, should consider and explore how innovative approaches 
to financing health fit into broader national strategies.  
As discussed in Chapter 5, NHIF has a major task ahead to enroll and retain  the 
informal sector, in line with the experiences of many countries when trying to 
expand coverage through a social health i nsurance model. Mobile platforms offer a 
valuable tool to reach these populations. Many informal sector workers have some ability t o pay 
into health insurance, but given that they are without a regular paycheck, collecting premiums is 
more difficult and mo re costly to the insurer. Further, reliance on voluntary contributions can 
contribute to adverse selection, as members pay for prem iums only when they know they will need 
services. Mobile -based payment and saving is becoming near universal in Kenya and has  the 
potential to minimize barriers to enrolling in and paying for insurance. This should be NHIF’s 
objective for the informal sect or—it should be as easy as possible for informal sector members to 
regularly contribute. While individual mobile insurance pr oviders have struggled to be financially 
sustainable, these platforms show promise in terms of enrolling members, as well as reduci ng the Box 13. Summary of GOK

 98 transaction costs of collecting premiums. They also have the ability to meet clients according to 
their ability to pay  by allowing, for example, small, ongoing deposits contributing toward a monthly 
premium. NHIF has already entered into promising p artnerships with these kinds of providers. M -
TIBA, for example, has reached significant scale and has a partnership with NHIF , and NHIF’s own 
mobile app allows informal sector members to make incremental mobile contributions toward 
their premium of KSh 500 . It should continue to integrate these kinds of platforms and approaches 
even more into its scale -up strategies. The health saving accounts on mobile devices and other 
innovations increasingly introduce the concept of prepayment for healthcare and can mak e paying 
for insurance eventually seem more acceptable.  
As NHIF scales up coverage, it will need to ensure that there are ade quate quality 
controls and incentives to provide high -quality care . Kenya’s Reproductive Health Voucher 
Program offered useful expe riences in building capacity for accreditation, quality assurance, and 
reimbursement. This type of program helps build the un derlying mechanisms that will be 
necessary to ensure quality as insurance coverage is scaled. Kenya has also had successes with 
larger, public sector performance -based financing schemes, such as that piloted by the World Bank. 
While this kind of mechanism is outside of NHIF, NHIF can look to experience with performance -
based financing schemes to inform its development of paying provid ers for desired outcomes 
rather than reimbursing the underlying cost of care, building in appropriate incentives for 
desirabl e quality and cost control.  
Even as insurance coverage through NHIF increases, Kenya will need to mobilize 
increasing domestic resources for health, particularly as external funds decline. 
Health in Kenya is primarily tax funded and, as discussed in Chapt er 4, economic growth and 
improved tax collection should increase Kenya’s ability to mobili ze potential resources to health. 
This is contingent on a continued favorable economic climate, which is not guaranteed, as well as 
political will to allocate new re sources to health. Further, Kenya will need to mobilize even greater 
resources as external funding declines and to reduce the burden of OOP (see Chapter 6). Tapping 
into private sector resources will be critical. The HIV infrastructure earmark discussed ab ove is one 
particularly promising approach for the GOK to consider using more effectively, alongside a 
spectrum of blended finance and public -private partnership mechanisms. In this case, the 
government’s authority can establish parameters requiring certai n private sector contributions to 
health as part of the business process. The private actor  can then factor these requirements, and 
any incentives, into its decision as part of the process. In this way, the arrangement may be 
transparent to private actors and also allows the government to exercise some degree of authority. 
There is opportunity f or Kenya to further explore these kinds of mechanisms, along with the other 
public -private partnership models discussed in Chapter 7, to improve the sustainability o f 
financing for health.  Government Resources

9. DISCUSSION AND RECOM MENDATIONS  
As Kenya moves toward UHC, including both expanded access to services and financial protection 
from the costs of using them, the health financing system must be reforme d. This report has given 
a detailed picture of the health financing system with particular attention to the evolving role of 
NHIF, the GOK’s current experimentation with user fee removal, and the impact of devolution 
alongside declining external resources.  Along these key themes, this chapter discusses their 
potential implications for future hea lth financing policy options in Kenya. Given the current 
situation, trends, and future directions discussed above, we consider how Kenya is performing 
along the key functions of the health financing system. For example, to what extent is Kenya 
mobilizing s ufficient resources for health and pooling them to efficiently purchase services for the 
population? This chapter concludes by highlighting important findings and su ggesting an emerging 
timescale for achieving the vision across the key themes of this repor t. Annex B illustrates potential 
phases in Kenya’s health financing transition toward 2030, while Annex C summarizes findings 
across the familiar domains of health f inancing functions.  
Kenya’s advance toward universal insurance coverage under an eventual SHIF 
requires a difficult expansion outward from NHIF’s social health insurance core. This 
has been achieved elsewhere, and success will depend on the ability to poo l resources across 
currently fragmented NHIF schemes that do not pool risk nor offer harmon ized benefits. It is 
probable that an SHIF offering harmonized benefits, driving utilization increases, yet without 
major increase in contributions, will require sup port from Treasury for its sustainability, i.e., tax -
funded cash injections by the GOK to f inance deficits. It is unclear whether long -term fiscal space 
can be planned now for this contingency. To successfully increase the pool of resources and 
political c onsensus around SHIF, the current NHIF will have to begin expanding coverage of the 
informa l sector, as it has already enrolled the majority of the formal sector. Informality also affects 
the size of government tax revenue as the underlying pool of funding  for the social sector. The 
informal sector dominates the Kenyan economy, accounting for 78  percent of total employment 
and a third of GDP. Tapping into this sector for public resources, however, is challenging. As is 
well-known, since informal sector empl oyees do not have a regularized salary, even if they may 
draw wages, it is difficult for th e government to collect direct taxes on this income. The informal 
sector has the highest concentration of income tax non -compliance (Budget Information Program, 
2012 ). The same challenges exist for collecting mandatory payroll contributions, yet either 
collecting from or subsidizing contributions for the non -poor informal sector will be critical to any 
viable single -payer SHIF. Annex A presents the roles of different actors in the formation and 
continuation of the SHIF, based on national documents.  
Recommendations  
 100 NHIF eff orts to increase voluntary enrollment among the non -poor informal sector 
may need to be matched with another revision of the contributory structure.  Outreach, 
househ old sensitization, and increased use of digital services can contribute to growing informal  
membership. In 2012, only 8.5 percent of the informal sector was covered by NHIF. Coverage grew 
to almost 19 percent in 2016. While this growth is promising, a viab le transition to SHIF will have 
to involve considerably more of the informal sector. Kenya must also pay careful attention to 
potential threats of adverse selection and to promoting equity in its growth of coverage. For 
example, initial voluntary adopters of insurance may be higher risk individuals. NHIF has also 
faced challenges retaining infor mal sector members, who temporarily pay premiums when they are 
ill and cease payments when they no longer need services. This makes the membership and 
revenue struct ure volatile. Further, there is a wide range of ability to pay in the informal sector. 
NHIF  currently uses a fixed contribution for informal sector members. There are opportunities to 
mobilize more resources from wealthier informal sector individuals and f rom the formal sector, 
and to reduce financial burdens on the poor. The political feasibili ty of these contribution changes 
will require high -level political vision and stakeholder consensus.  
In order to cover the poor, Kenya will need resources from both  levels of government 
in the long term to subsidize those who cannot afford to pay into NHI F’s schemes . 
Currently, some of the poor are being covered through the Health Insurance Subsidy Program on a 
pilot basis, financed by the national government and the  World Bank. Under devolution, counties 
are expected to make increasing contributions to NH IF from their budgets in order to cover poor 
and elderly populations. In Nairobi, for example, the county government is proposing coverage of 3 
million poor resident s through NHIF. Members would be expected to pay KSh 200 per month for 
coverage at public f acilities. The county government will subsidize the rest of the SupaCover 
premiums (Thiong'o, 2017). Without tapping into local funds for counties with more resource s, 
expanding coverage to poor populations through payments from the national Treasury may n ot be 
sustainable. Under this vision, national resources can be targeted toward the poor and vulnerable 
in more resource -poor counties.  
As it expands coverage of NHI F, Kenya can look to past global experiences for lessons 
and approaches to scaling up social health insurance schemes toward UHC . Global 
experience suggests that enrolling the informal sector is a long process and that it will be difficult to 
quickly mobil ize resources from or for this sector. Box 14 summarizes this and other key 
considerat ions in the context of NHIF reform.  
 Box 14. Can Kenya reach universal insurance coverage by growing from a social health 
insurance progra m? 
Need for pro -equity expansion. The current NHIF revenue and expenditure framework is not 
sufficiently pro -equity,  and this must change for the UHC expansion path to be effective. Some 
countries that expanded population coverage from an SHI core scheme a dopted principles of 
“progressive universalism” favoring coverage of the needs of the poor and vulnerable first. 
Benefits for NHIF voluntary members who have an ability to pay have improved, though they still 
lag behind civil servants —and both categories b elong to higher wealth quintiles. In contrast, for 
the sponsored categories of the neediest (e.g., Health Insurance Subsidy Program households, the 
elderly), benefit use and impact on financial protection are both assessed as low (Barasa et al., 
2018). The  financial protection and learning principles inherent in Kenya’s Afya Care pilots of 
2018 –20, and the drive to enro ll more poor and vulnerable households in NHIF, are laudable, 
though the specific links between these policies are unclear.  Recommendations  
 101  Need for policy coherence. With no clear decision on the UHC -EBP to be adopted by NHIF on the 
path to SHIF, and with independent cou nty-led schemes such as MakueniCare forging their own 
vision for covering the population, there is uncertainty around the path forward. Poli cy coherence 
and a singular vision for sustained county and national government investment are required. Even 
if NHI F coverage expands, without spending on the supply -side of the health system, newly 
enrolled households across geographic and socioeconomic segments will not be able to access 
effective quality of health services.  
Need for major process and governance cha nges . NHIF’s current weaknesses across quality 
assurance, claims management, patient accountability, and reducing voluntary members’ attriti on 
are key process challenges. They can be resolved through improved effort at the management 
level. They have also been reduced elsewhere as schemes garnered a higher policy mandate and 
were put under a more robust social security governance structure. As  NHIF is advancing on the 
enrollment growth path now, and in the context of the Roadmap Towards Universal Health 
Coverage (2018 –2022) , the legal and regulatory reforms to be finalized by the GOK NHIF Task 
Force  need to be agreed upon and implemented on an accelerated timeframe.  
Need for financial planning and mitigating shocks. As suggested in a review by Barasa et al. 
(2018), the additional membership envisaged by the roadmap —with the recently revised provider 
payment rates and the expanded benefits packag e—may begin to stress NHIF’s previously 
experienced financial sustainability. Across two scenarios of an additional 1 million members, the 
authors find that the primary deficit in terms of the excess of total benefit and moderate 
administrative expenses ov er revenues ranged from 29 to 59 percent (Barasa et al., 2018). These 
concerns resulting from adverse selection in i nitial waves of voluntary members have been seen 
previously, e.g., in Indonesia.  
Need for optimism and political will . On paper, the theore tical maximum coverage based on 
achieving the membership numbers may lead to high insurance coverage on the family 
enrollment principle, but without utilization of services and quality of care, this coverage will not 
be meaningful for  UHC. There is skeptic ism internationally that countries can achieve high 
insurance coverage and make a dent toward universal insurance coverage, especially with 
enrollment growth via mostly voluntary membership in the informal sector, and using a “top -
down” approach that began  with better benefits and coverage of richer socioeconomic segments 
(Dutta and Ginivan, 2018). However, Kenya’s approach, even if aligned with this characterization, 
has prior precedent and may be feasible if resources for subsidizing  a larger share of the  poor and 
vulnerable than currently envisioned are allocated and appropriately targeted. In addition, the 
benefits carefully selected for Kenya’s health conditions must be made universally made available 
(Dutta and Ginivan, 2018). Inn ovations in enrollment  as currently being practiced also show 
promise.  
Key challenges for NHIF on the path of UHC -related expansion:  
▪ Fragmented contribution pools limit cross -subsidy and risk adjustment  
▪ Limited ability to increase revenue  
▪ Benefits not har monized across schemes , limiting use and enrollment  
▪ Several user -fee-removal and provider -reimbursement schemes, added to the NHIF 
mandate, fragment operations and policy vision  
▪ Challenges in voluntary enrollment  
▪ Targeting issues for free (sponsored) membe rs, e.g., Health Insur ance Subsidy Program, 
the elderly  
• Provider payment systems still weak  
 
 Recommendations  
 102 Even as NHIF coverage expands, certain inherently public health functions require 
extensive supply -side effort. These areas will c ontinue to require government resources, 
especially at county levels. Beyond subsidizing insurance coverage for the poor, the government 
will have to mobilize sufficient resources to address supply -side constraints. Kenya needs to invest 
in improving the q uality, availability, and distribution of health services and commodities. There 
are continuing disparities across counties in  key supply -side indicators, including health workforce 
and density of health facilities. Expanding NHIF coverage will increase fi nancial protection and 
health -seeking behavior, yet it will fail in advancing UHC if facilities, equipment, and medical 
produc ts are insufficient to meet rising demand. County budgets are dominated by recurrent 
spending. Counties will need to increase the resources available for health, including resources for 
capital expenditures, to improv e availability and quality of health se rvice delivery.    
As external funding for health declines, Kenya will also face the challenge of 
integrating donor -financed verti cal programs into domestic ally financed schemes. 
The contribution of external resources to total health expenditure is still c onsiderable. Kenya has 
not yet reached the point where it can transition entirely from external support, yet external 
resources ar e declining and will only continue to do so as the country matures as a middle -income 
economy. The government should begin pla nning for greater transition now, with integration of 
vertical programs into devolved service delivery and financing, with a role for NHIF as the future 
dominant purchaser. Integrating HIV, TB , and other vertical program interventions into NHIF 
requires th at its risk pool be significantly large and diverse, that it cover the related populations at 
risk, and that the scheme establishe s the provider linkages and purchasing models necessary to 
deliver the related care and to remain financially viable. Linkage with NHIF, however, can 
ultimately help ensure sustainable financing for these services as external resources decline.  
Previous c ost and financial assessments of integration of vertical programs have not moved pa st 
the analysis stage. The Kenya Health  Financing Strategy  proposes financing most aspects of these 
vertical programs through national and county government budgets.  Current ly, the national 
government plays a central role in these vertical programs; it will continue to procure and 
distribute ke y commodities. National allocations to health will have to increase in order to ensure 
these functions continue with the diminution of  external resources. County governments will also 
have to ensure adequate resources for financing and strengthening servic e delivery through public 
facilities, and also increasingly contracting community organizations.  
Kenya is in an ongoing transition ph ase during which universally affordable, 
efficiently procured, and effectively delivered health benefits are not yet widel y 
available, although the framework for this is being put in place —see Annex B for our 
framework of phases . During the transition, pub lic tax -funded free  and subsidized healthcare  
for the poor , increasingly the responsibility of counties, will be critical for financial protection and 
to deliver improving health outcomes. Therefore, emphasis in this chapter on NHIF reform is not 
meant to downplay the need for strong public spending on primary he althcare, especially for 
strengthening health system resource availability for commodities, equipment, and workforce. 
Countries  that achieved high insurance coverage alongside financial protection a nd improving 
health outcomes not only used hybrid appro aches to effectively cover the population, they also 
prioritized investments in the supply -side first.  
The transition from the current transitional phase to one of consolidation around 
SHIF will requir e several policy movements.  The first is to apply learn ing from the Afya 
Care pilots , and even county -led initiatives such as MakueniCare , toward the health system’s 
judged ability to respond to an increase in demand for healthcare and to reduce OOP, espec ially at 
secondary care levels. Based on this judgme nt, stakeholders should make appropriate decisions on 
what secondary and tertiary services can be scaled -up, and when. Second, stakeholders should link 
this learning specifically to a rational and appropr iately targeted iteration of the UHC -EBP, which Recommendations  
 103 NHIF  is willing to guarantee and deliver at affordable cost and quality; and around which actuarial 
and financial modeling can provide the GOK with a reasonable estimate of its future fiscal 
obligations. Th e third task is for national and county levels, govern ment and the private sector, and 
employers and labor ers to agree on the vision of SHIF -oriented universal enro llment as well as the 
costs and benefits of achieving this vision, which will require increase d efforts from all. Key 
evidence needs across these and related policy movements are summarized in Table 1 4. 
Table  14. Areas of evidence need based on key themes of this report  
Policy Issues and Decision Points  Selected Evidence Requirements

115 ANNEX C. REVIEW BY HEALTH F INANCING 
FUNCTIONS  
Resource Mobilization  
Findings:  
 Tax-financed services are the largest source of funding for health in Kenya; thus, the GOK’s 
ability to raise tax revenues directly impacts the amount of r esources mobilized for health.  
 External funding for health is declining as a proportion of THE, from 32 percent to 22 
percent since 2010. Some of this decline is being filled by increased government spending, 
but OOP expenditure has also increased.  
 One -third of health expenditures come from OOP spending, placing a high burden on 
households.  
 The majority of resources for health are generated at the national level, but all resources for 
service delivery flow to county governments from the national lev el through the CR F. The 
amount of shareable revenue counties receive depends on available revenue and county 
characteristics, such as population size and poverty level.  
 Allocation of these resources to health is at the discretion of the counties. There is  
considerable variation across counties and from year -to-year.   
Recommendations:  
 The GOK should c ontinue to improve overall tax revenue collection. Strategic tax amnesties, 
such as the one announced in 2016/17, can help encourage Kenyans to declare more f oreign 
income. Ongoing support for improvements to electronic excise and VAT systems will also 
help capture more non -income tax revenue. The government should also develop county 
capacity to collect locally generated tax revenues.  
 The GOK should consider giving some consideration to health in mobilizing resources as 
shareable revenue at the county lev el to ensure that counties have enough resources to meet 
specific health and service delivery needs.  
 County governments should allocate more resources to hea lth, with a clear understanding of 
exactly what the resource needs are. Nascent program -based budg eting reforms should be 
supported and expanded to ensure that resources are linked to intended outcomes and that 
sufficient resources are allocated to achieve  those outcomes.  
Pooling  
Findings:   
 Resources for health are pooled at three levels: national Tre asury, CR Fs, and insurance 
schemes, primarily through NHIF  
 The CR F pools all resources for health at the county level, including national shareable 
revenue, c onditional grants (i.e., for Mama Linda and free primary healthcare), and 
internally generated rev enues.  Annexes  
 116  Health insurance in Kenya pools government and private resources.  
 Approximately one -fifth of Kenyans are insured. The vast majority (approximately 88  
percent) of these are covered through NHIF, with the remainder covered by private and 
community -based schemes.  
 There are disparities in insurance coverage. Urban populations and higher wealth quintiles 
are far more likely to be insured than rural and poo rer Kenyans.  
 The GOK aims to increasingly pool resources for health through expanded coverage of 
NHIF.  
Recommendations:  
 CRFs are functioning as a pool, but county decisions on allocation are critical to ensuring 
that pooled resources for health are suffi cient. Counties must allocate sufficient resources to 
health and effectively target resources to p oor and vulnerable populations to ensure cross -
subsidization.  
 To sustainably and effectively pool risk and resources through NHIF, the scheme must 
increase t he size and diversity of the pool. NHIF should increase enrollment, with particular 
effort to enro ll the informal sector. It should also reduce fragmentation by pooling resources 
across schemes covering different populations.  
Purchasing  
Findings:  
 National and county governments are the primary purchasers of health services.  
 Households primarily purchas e services OOP from a range of public and private providers, 
with an increasing percentage of THE going to private providers. More data, like the Kenya 
Integr ated Household Budget Survey, is important for a more detailed understanding of 
whom households ar e purchasing services from and their cost.   
 Government purchasing is largely passive, based on input -based, line -item budgeting.  
 At the national level, effo rts to move toward more strategic purchasing are centered on 
shifting increasing purchasing respon sibility to NHIF.  
 Efforts to introduce program -based budgeting and performance -based financing schemes 
are helping to move counties toward more strategic pur chasing, but current purchasing is 
still dominated by passive mechanisms.  
 NHIF accredits and purch ases services from both public and private providers. It pays for 
services through a mix of mechanisms, including fixed reimbursement, fee -for-service, and 
capitation, depending on the type of service. There are challenges in actual  implementation 
of these  mechanisms, including insufficient links between payment volume and quality of 
outcomes, the potential for fraud, and timeliness of payments.  
 NHIF is expanding the package of services it purchases to cover an inclusive list of inp atient, 
outpatient, and ambulatory services. While the list of covered services has grown, it is not 
clear that all of these services are actually being procured.  Annexes  
 117 Recommendations:  
 At both the national and county levels, the government should move away from line -item, 
input -based  budgeting and accelerate program -based budgeting reforms.  
 County governments should begin incorporating more performance -based financing 
schemes to move toward more strategic purchasing of services.  
 NHIF should clearly define a nd communicate the benefits  package to both members and 
providers. Patients need to know what services they are entitled to receive, and providers 
need to know the services for which they will be reimbursed. This will help ensure that 
covered services are actually procured.  
 NHIF ca n improve its payment mechanisms to better control both cost and quality. Moving 
away from fee -for-service, for example, toward more case -based payments, can help 
encourage efficient use of services. It should also increase ongoi ng monitoring of provider 
quality, particularly for capitation payments, and link payment to the quality of services.
