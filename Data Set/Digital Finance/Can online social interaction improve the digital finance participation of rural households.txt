Abstract
Purpose –Digital finance is a promising way to realize inclusive finance. However, the determinants of digital
finance participation are largely unknown. This study aims to analyze the interface between social interaction
and the digital finance participation of rural households and explore potential channels of social interaction tohelp them access digital finance.
Design/methodology/approach –Using rural household survey data from China in 2017, employing the
probit, ordered probit and count model, this study assesses the relationship between social interaction and
digital finance.
Findings –The authors find that active online social interaction of rural households promotes digital finance
participation, which also increases the depth and breadth of digital finance usage. Meanwhile, the role of
traditional offline social interaction is insignificant. Contextual interaction is the channel through which onlinesocial interaction influences digital finance participation. Moreover, word-of-mouth, common topic pleasure
and social norms in endogenous interactions are irrelevant. In addition, the role of online social interaction
complements offline social interaction at promoting digital finance participation.
Originality/value –This study contributes to the understanding of digital finance by investigating the
possible channels by which social interaction influences digital finance participation and highlight an
important channel –contextual interaction, especially for online social interaction. This study expands the
content of social interaction from traditional offline social interaction to online social interaction to evaluate the
interface between social interaction and financial behavior more comprehensively.

1. Introduction
The development of digital finance has been seen as a new and powerful tool to improve rural
households ’access to finance. The “Advanced Principles of Digital Inclusive Finance of G20, ”
which was formulated by the Global Partners of Inclusive Finance (GPFI) and adopted at the
Hangzhou Summit of G20 in 2016, clearly states that it is necessary to “advocate the use of
digital technologies to promote the development of inclusive finance, ”because digital finance
reduces unit transaction costs, expands transaction possibility boundaries and improves the
efficiency of financial transactions. Many researchers observe that digital finance can
affordably provide financial services for rural and poor groups without access to financial
services and become an important way to achieve inclusive finance ( Huang and Xu, 2017 ;
Ozili, 2018 ;Bharadwaj et al., 2019 ).
Digital finance does not necessarily mean the realization of inclusive finance because the
promotion of digital finance requires users to have the corresponding ability to use digitalImproving

accessibility of digital finance in rural areas, the “digital financial divined ”is likely to become
the“digital financial divide ”and further broaden the financial service gap. Therefore, it is
important to investigate the influencing factors of digital finance participation. However,
very little is known about the factors.
Economists have accumulated abundant evidence indicating that social interaction
matters for a large set of financial behaviors. Recent research finds that social interaction has
implications on elements such as social insurance purchasing, entrepreneurship, stock
market participation, and credit decision ( Duflo and Saez, 2003 ;Hong et al., 2004 ;Yu and Man,
2009;Gao; Fok, 2015 ). Regarding digital financial participation as an emerging financial
behavior pattern, the impact of social interaction is also worthy of attention. However, there is
little research on the matter.
It is noteworthy that the mode of social interaction in the existing literature is focused on
traditional face-to-face offline social interaction. Given the rapid development of the internet,
people communicate increasingly in media such as online forums, instant messaging
applications or blogs. Thus, there is an important tendency that online social interaction
substitutes for face-to-face offline social interaction ( Liang and Guo, 2015 ;Hou et al., 2017 ;
Antoci and Sabatini, 2018 ). China is a compelling setting to explore this issue in-depth.
According to the 44th statistical report on the development of China ’s internet, by the end of
June 2019, the number of internet users in China reached 8.54 billion, the number of mobile
internet users reached 8.47 billion, the internet penetration rate in urban areas was 72.7
percent and the internet penetration rate in rural areas was 36.5 percent. As an important new
way of communication, research about online social interaction is rare, and there is little
evidence on the channels through which online social interaction may improve the access to
digital finance of rural households. This study identifies a causal effect of social interaction on
digital financial participation and investigates the possible channels.
Based on the data of the China Rural Inclusive Finance Survey (CRIFS) conducted by China
Agricultural University in 2017, we analyze the effect of online social interaction on digital
finance participation behavior and identify the possible channel that influences digital finance
participation by social interaction. The analysis was done by employing the probit, ordered
probit and count model, using 1,953 samples. The results show that: (1) online social interaction
has a positive impact on participation in digital finance, as well as the breadth and depth of
participation, meanwhile the role of offline social interaction is not significant; (2) online socialinteraction plays a role through contextual interaction rather than word-of-mouth, common
topic pleasure and social norm in endogenous interaction; and (3) the role of online social
interaction complements offline social interaction at promoting digital finance participation,
which means that it can simultaneously promote the participation of digital financial.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of online social
interaction on digital financial participation. Our analysis adds to the literature in three
distinct ways. First, though the digital finance is an important tool to realize financial
inclusion, researchers know little about the determinants of digital finance participation for
rural households. We provide evidence that online social interaction is important. Second,
based on the rapid development of the internet, we expand the content of social interaction
from traditional offline social interaction to online social interaction to evaluate the interface
between social interaction and financial behavior more comprehensively. The theoretical
proposition extends the extant understanding of how social interaction is value-producing.
Last, we contribute to the understanding of social interaction by investigating the possible
channels by which social interaction influences digital finance participation and highlight an
important channel –contextual interaction, especially for online social interaction. This study
is organized as follows. Section 1 offers a brief overview of the literature on social interaction
and empirical studies of the financial behaviors of households. The next section presents theCAER
12,2
296data, variables and methodology; the empirical results and further discussion are then
presented. The final section concludes and offers policy recommendations.
2. Literature review
Social interaction refers to a social phenomenon that is extended to explain the economic
behaviors; it means that the preferences, expectations and budget constraints of decision-
makers are affected by the characteristics of members of their reference group ( Manski, 2000 ).
The reference groups mainly from social networks, such as the surrounding relatives, friends,
neighbors or colleagues ( Manski, 2000 ;Hong et al., 2004 ). Many studies have shown that
social interaction plays an important role in individual financial decision, such as insurance
purchasing ( Liet al., 2019 ), entrepreneurship, stock market participation and credit decision
(Duflo and Saez, 2003 ;Hong et al., 2004 ;Li, 2006a ,2006b ;Yu and Man, 2009 ;Gao; Fok, 2015 ).
Research regarding the examination of the mechanism behind the impact of online social
interaction is even rarer; existing research mainly focuses on offline social interaction.
References to discussions on the mechanism behind the impact of social interaction on
financial decisions ( Manski, 2000 ; Durlurf, 2004; Jang, 2015 ;Liang and Guo, 2015 ;Sarah et al.,
2015) can be divided into endogenous interaction and contextual interaction (exogenous
interaction). Endogenous interaction means that the decision-making of an agent will be
affected by the simultaneous behavior of their reference group members and can react to other
members of the group (Durlurf, 2004). In short, an agent observing other rural households
participating in digital finance will also join in participating. Specifically, endogenous
interaction can take effect through mechanisms of word-of-mouth, common topic pleasure and
social norm. Among the channels underlying social interaction, it is well acknowledged that
endogenous interaction is the most important channel to illustrate financial behaviors.
Endogenous interaction captures that “the propensity of an agent to behave in some way
varies with the behavior of the group. ”Specifically, endogenous interaction can take effect
through mechanisms of word-of-mouth (information acquisition), common topic pleasure and
social norm.
First, the mechanisms of word-of-mouth mean that an agent can obtain relevant
information by word-of-mouth discussion and by observing a peer ’s behavior, which is also
called observational learning or social learning. In other words, potential participating ruralhouseholds obtain relevant expertise or experience in the process of participating by
communicating with relatives and friends who have participated, thus reducing the cost and
increasing the possibility of participation. Taking the stock market participation as an
example, an agent can obtain operational information, such as opening accounts and making
transactions, by direct communication and discussion with reference groups and learning
about relevant stock market information by observing trading behavior from experienced
reference groups. Thus, an agent in a high stock market participation group will be prone to
participating in the stock market ( Hong et al., 2004 ).Brown et al. (2008) employed an
instrumental variable approach to establish the observed causality between an individual ’s
decision to invest in the stock market and the average participation rate of his community
(community effect); Yu and Man (2009) showed that the participants ’entrepreneurial
characteristics would be developed and enhanced through the four key types of social
interaction, including the interaction with team members, instructors, school teachers and
business stakeholders; Pool et al
. (2013) employed the residential address history of fund
managers to identify the role of information transmission among neighbors; using a Chinese
national representative household survey data covering more than 8,000 Chinese households,
Liang and Guo (2015) illustrated that social interactions remain an effective channel of
information transmission in rural China, and there is more room for increasing rural stock
market participation.Improving

participation
297Second, the mechanism of common topic pleasure means that an agent might take pleasure
in indulging in conversations based on common interests, which will simultaneously induce
the agent to act. Moreover, it also means that if rural households participate in digital finance,
they will have common topics to engage with other rural households, and their pleasure of
indulgence and effectiveness will increase through the exchange of common topics. For
example, Hong et al. (2004) found that an investor can get pleasure from a conversation about
stock issues with his peers who also own stocks; Li (2006b) found that the joyful feelings
brought by this same investment decision and from sharing the same experience lift the
willingness of their participation in stocks; Liang and Guo (2015) suggest that the mechanism
of common topic pleasure mainly plays a key role in endogenous interaction.
Last, the “social norm ”mechanism is also called the “keeping up with the Joneses ”effect,
which means that after observing the financial behavior of members from the reference
group, an agent can understand the normative behavior and follow it to increase the utility
and satisfaction ( Brown et al., 2008 ). It also means that rural households participating in
digital finance hope to have similar consumption behavior, investment behavior, life interest
and discussion topics with their peers. The reason is that the agent can win respect from other
members by making financial decisions that conform to the social norms; otherwise,
individuals are often discriminated against if they make contrary financial decisions. This
phenomenon provides insights for many studies: the conformity model by Bernheim (1994) ,
the consumption-based model with external habit formation by Campbell and Cochrane
(1999) and the theoretical work based on competition on local resources of Demarzo et al.
(2004) .Bursztyn et al. (2014) demonstrate that both the learning effect and social norms
underlie the social influence in financial decisions.
Contextual interaction (exogenous interaction) shows that “the propensity of an agent to
behave in some way varies with exogenous characteristics of the group members. ”That is,
contextual interaction means that there is a one-way effect between individual and reference
group members; the agent ’s financial behavior cannot influence the characteristics of
reference group members. Moreover, it also means that an agent ’s decision will be affected by
the results of their reference group members, but their decision cannot simultaneously react
to the reference members (Durlurf, 2004). Contextual interaction induces rural households to
know more about the results of digital finance participation. If they observe the benefits of the
participating rural households, such as the low-cost, high-efficiency and high-quality services
of digital finance, they will, as well, participate; otherwise, if there is fraud, discrimination andloss, they will not part participate. Therefore, unlike endogenous interaction, the impact of
contextual interaction on digital finance may be uncertain; the ultimate direction of the
impact depends on whether the promotion effect or the inhibition effect is greater or less.
Thus, taking the stock market participation as an example, the losses (gains) in stock
investment of neighbors are likely to demonstrate stock investment unattractiveness
(attractiveness). Kaustia and Kn €upfer (2012) present empirical evidence of this type of social
influence: recent stock market returns that local peers experience strongly influence an
individual ’s stock market entry decision. This effect is limited to positive returns that
encourage entry, whereas negative returns do not make entry less likely. Liang and Guo
(2015) confirm the negative effect of the contextual interaction; that is, the negative
demonstration effect of the widespread loss cases in stock investment on stock market
participation in China. Liet al. (2019) also find evidence in insurance purchasing in China.
Correlated effect attributes similar behaviors of group members to their similarities in
individual characteristics and institutional environment. It often has become an endogenous
problem in empirical research on social interaction because individuals are not randomly
assigned to groups or communities; however, owing to their similarities, it is this unobserved
similarity that leads to the consistency of individual and group behavior. Li (2006b)
pointed
out that problem can be solved by adding individual characteristic variables as controlCAER
12,2
298variables, as these variables measure the group characteristics. This mechanism is seldom
discussed in empirical research.
In summary, endogenous interaction can promote participation in digital finance by reducing
the cost of participation, increasing subjective utility or obeying social norms. The impact of
contextual interaction on participation may be positive or negative; thus, the total impact of
social interaction may be uncertain. Most scholar s believe that social interaction exert positive
and significant impacts on households ’financial decision, such as social insurance purchasing
(Duflo and Saez, 2003 ;Hong et al., 2004 ), stock market participation ( Li, 2006a ,b;Liang and Guo,
2015), entrepreneurship ( Yu and Man, 2009 ;Giannetti and Simonov 2009 ) and individual credit
decision ( Karlan, 2005 ). Chinese data also support that households with strong family ties and
social interaction are more likely to save, inv est in risky assets, borrow and take part in informal
finance ( Gao and Fok, 2015 ).Giannetti and Simonov (2009) show that individuals residing in
highly entrepreneurial neighborhoods are more likely to become entrepreneurs and invest more
into their own businesses, even though their entrepreneurial profits are lower, and their
alternative job opportunities more attractive. Liang and Guo (2015) show that the marginal effect
of social interactions on stock market participation is greater in high participation communities,
which supports the social multiplier effect of social interactions.
However, some scholars hold a negative attitude. Beisetiov et al. (2004) studied the impact
of social interaction on the choice of medical insurance for the elderly and argues that families
who often communicate with friends and neighbors are less likely to purchase commercial
insurance. Feng and Seasholes (2004) considered that the response to public information
rather than social interaction is the reason agents belonging to the same group tend to behave
similarly. Gruber (2005) suggests that social interaction, such as visiting neighbors and
participating in religious activities, is closely related to personal characteristics, which are the
important factors affecting stock market participation; thus, the social interaction is not
directly related to stock investment. Liang and Guo (2015) show that due to the investment
loss, the stock market will produce a negative demonstration effect, and it will affect the stock
market participation through the channel of contextual interaction in social interaction. This
negative effect will absorb the promotion effect of endogenous interaction on the stock
market participation; thus, the overall impact of social interaction is not significant.
The existing literature often examines the impact of traditional offline social interaction on
family traditional financial participation behavior but seldom examines the impact of new
online social interaction on digital financial participation behavior in the internet era ( Houet al.,
2017;Antoci and Sabatini, 2018 ). Unlike traditional financial services, the existence of digital
finance in the way of services often relies on the development of the internet. There are no
physical online stores and face-to-face contact with people. Liang and Guo (2015) pay attention
to the information role brought by the internet and find evidence about the substitution
between social interaction and internet access as information channels. Therefore, our
hypothesis highlights the effect of online social interaction on digital finance participation.
H1. Online social interaction increases digital finance participation.
3. Data and variables
3.1 Data sources
Data were drawn from the “Rural Inclusive Finance Survey ”conducted by China
Agricultural University in July 2017. Students from the China Agricultural University
were trained as enumerators and employed to administer the survey in July of 2017.
The survey adopts a multistage random sampling approach. We randomly chose one
province from the eastern, central and western regions of China, representing the advanced,
middle and low development levels in China, respectively. Thus, Shandong, Henan andImproving
digital finance
participation
299Guangxi provinces were selected. In each province, we rank the counties based on the per
capita gross domestic product (GDP) from the highest to the lowest and equally divide the
counties into high-, middle- and low-level groups. The top-, middle- and bottom-one counties
were chosen to capture an equal representation of various levels of per capita GDP by
population. Thus, we choose Anqiu, Shouguang and Gaomi in Shandong province; Tangyin,
Fangcheng and Mengjin in Henan province; and Ningming, Tiandong and Daxin in Guangxi
province. Hence, using the same method, three townships are selected according to the level of
per capita GDP in each county. The sample contains the households from 27 townships. In
each township, we randomly select two natural villages, in which the population is around
30–50 households, and surveyed all villagers.
We employed a face-to-face interview, focusing on the rural agricultural production
status, entrepreneurship, working status and financial statues in 2016. A small gift of
approximately U30 was offered. A total of 2,093 questionnaires were distributed and
collected. However, the data screening yielded a total of 1,953 useable responses for analysis.
The effective sample rate was 93.31 percent.
4. Definition of variables
4.1 Digital finance
Digital finance participation behavior encompasses saving, credits and payments. We divide
the digital finance participation (DF) of households into three sub-parts: digital financial
management participation, digital financial transaction participation and digital credit
participation. If rural households use one of the digital financial facilities, we consider the
rural household as having access to digital finance (DF 51).
We also pay attention to the depth of digital finance (DF_D). Larger values of a DF_D
index imply a higher digital financial usage frequency. Not only the depth but also the
breadth is important. Digital finance encompasses a magnitude of financial products and
services. There is a difference in the degree of usage. We define the breadth of digital finance
(DF_B) by the number of digital finance services used by rural households. Larger values of a
DF_B index imply a broader digital financial participation ( Table 1 ).
The digital financial participation ratio is 24.8 percent, implying that less than a quarter of
the surveyed sample has ever used digital finance tools. The depth of digital finance usage is
only 0.58, which indicates that the vast majority of rural households have only used digital
finance tools once or twice. The depth of use of digital finance needs to be improved. The
average breadth of digital finance usage is 0.25, which means that on average, farming
households used less than one type of digital financial product ( Table 2 ).
4.2 Social interaction
We expand the social interaction from offline to online. Previous studies focused on offline
social interaction; the proxy for offline social interaction includes the number of visiting
friends, the frequency of taking religious activities, the cash-gift expenditure and the
communication expenditure ( Hong et al., 2004 ;Gruber, 2005 ). Studies seldom measure online
social interaction. Following its definition, we construct a proxy for offline social interaction
by measuring online communication.
The results show that 51.5 percent of the surveyed rural households chat, read news, shop
and enjoy entertainment through the internet. The proportion is larger than the digital
finance participation proportion, indicating that many rural households have online social
interaction experience but have no access to digital finance ( Table 3 ).
We also pay attention to the correlation between the two variables. The correlation is 0.021
and is not statistically significant at the 1 percent level; thus, that we do not have to considerCAER

4.3 Control variables
Table 4 presents the definition of the control variables and their descriptive statistics,
according to which 60.6 percent of the surveyed household head are males, the average age
is 45.82 years and the average year of education is around 7.79 years, indicating that most
sample household heads have graduated from junior-middle school. The risk preference is
low; only 13.8 percent of the farmers prefer high-risk activity, and 70.8 percent of thefarmers felt that their neighborhood was more trusted. Moreover, their social trust was high.
We also measure the financial knowledge level because we ask the financial questions for
saving rate.
The family situation shows that the average number of households is 4.60, of which 18.1
percent choose work outside. The family economic situation is measured by total annual
income and the proportion of non-agricultural income. The average annual income of
households is U58,429.74, and the non-agricultural income accounts for a large proportion
(42.9 percent). The results show that the income of migrant workers still accounts for the main
source of household income. The actual farming area of each household is 5.91 mu (1 mu 51/
5 ha), and the proportion of poor households among the households surveyed is 13 percent.
The proportion of village leaders was only 2.4 percent.

percent. The average Gini coefficient of each region calculated by the survey data is 0.56,
which is basically the same as the whole country. The development level of inclusive finance
is 2.32. The average number broadband Internet household user per the number of
inhabitants is 0.166. Furthermore, the proportion ratio of rural households that search the
internet for information when making financial decisions is 26.6 percent.
5. Econometric model and empirical analysis
5.1 Econometric model
We assess the relationship between social interaction and digital finance based on the
following regression setup:
PðjÞ¼α0þα1online_SI iþα2offline_SI iþθXiþμi: (1)
InEqn. (1) ,PðjÞis a measure of whether to use DF for person j, DF_D usage and DF_B usage.
Considering the different structure of the dependent variables, we adopt three regression
models. Moreover, Xiis a set of control variables, including the characteristics of personal,
family, regional economic and financial development level. We employ the logarithm of
education, income and Per_DGP. Furthermore, μiis the error term. All regression errors are
clustered at the village level.
The variable of interest is Online SIiand Offline SIi, a dummy that equals 1 if the family
has active online or Offline_SI. The coefficient, α, therefore, indicates the impact of social
interaction on the use of digital finance. A positive and significant αsuggests that active
social interaction leads to digital finance usage, while a negative and significant αindicates
that active social interaction leads to lower digital finance usage.
When P(j)is DF, we use the binary probit model because the use of DF is a dummy
variable. When P(j)is DF_D, we use the ordered probit model because DF_D is an ordered
variable of 0, 1, 2 and 3. When P(j)is DF_B, we use the count model because DF_B is a
quantitative variable of 0, 1, 2 and 3.
5.2 Preliminary results
Table 5 presents the baseline results. The dependent variable in the first 2, 3 and 4 columns is
DF usage. Columns 2 and 3 report results for the specification without the Offline_SI. In
Column 4, we add both variables. The estimates presented in Columns 5 and 6 are based on
the same explanatory variables as in Column 4, but the dependent variable in Column 5 is
DF_D, and the dependent variable in Column 6 is DF_B.
Online_SI is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. This finding shows
that as a new social model, Online_SI can effectively promote farmers to use digital finance
and enhance and expand the frequency and scope of use. Concurrently, the coefficient of
Offline_SI has no significant impact on the usage and the frequency of digital finance and
only has a slightly positive impact regarding the scope of digital finance use at the 10 percent
significant level, implying that traditional Offline_SI does not promote digital finance.
Other personal and family variables, including sex, age, education, family size, the
percentage of out-of-town workers in family members and income, significantly influence
digital finance participation. For example, under the premise that other situations remain
unchanged, one more year of education will lift the probability of digital finance participation
by 0.064. Regarding the regional variables, the proportion of the primary industry
significantly reduces the frequency of digital finance use. The higher the proportion of the
primary industry, the lower the possibility of farmers ’participation in digital finance; DF_D
and DF_B usage also decreased significantly.Improving

Preliminary resultsCAER

304The preliminary results show that Online_SI has a positive impact on different aspects of
digital financial participation behavior, while traditional Offline_SI is often useless.
5.3 Robustness test
Robustness test 1: Replace the definition of the variables. To check the robustness of our
results, we explore variations regarding the definition of Online_SI. We refer to the definition
of offline interaction. Firstly, we calculate the number of online activity participation. If the
respondent takes no online activity, the number of online activity participation equals 0. If the
respondent takes only one online activity, the online activity participation equals 1, etc. Then,
we calculate the median of online activity participation for each village. If the number of
online activity participation is higher (lower) than the median number in the village,
Online_SI equals 1 (0).The corresponding results are provided in Table 6 , and our findings
remain regardless of the variation.
Robustness test 2: Discussion of endogeneity. The first is the reverse causality problem,
i.e. Online_SI may have an impact on the digital financial participation behavior of rural
households. Conversely, the participation of digital finance will also stimulate more Online_SI
of rural households, which may lead to endogenous estimation error due to the reverse
causality problem. Secondly, the problem of missing variables, some unobservable factors
(such as psychological preference or personal ability) may affect the Online_SI of rural
households and the participation of digital finance at the same time. Finally, the measurement
error of Online_SI may exist, which is inevitable in empirical research. To mitigate this
concern, we use the index of willingness to help each other to instrument social connection.
We construct the index of willingness to help each other by asking how you would help them
if someone in your village has a disaster. It is a multiple-choice question. There are four
options, namely, donate money, spend time with them, psychological comfort and do nothing.
The willingness to help each other equals to the number of choosing the first three options.
For example, if the answer is “donate money ”and“spend time with them, ”the willingness to
help each other equals 2. If the answer is “do nothing, ”the willingness to help each other
equals 0. The index equals the mean of willingness to help each other at a county level. Then,
we use the index to instrument social interaction.
We choose the index of willingness to help each other as an instrument for two reasons.
The first one is that the index reflects the local social circumstances on helping each other,
which is relatively stable for a long time. The high index characterizes the close connection
and the frequent communication between rural households, which indicates an active social

305connection. The second one is that the index represents mutual assistance at the aggregate
level, eliminating the direct impact on digital financial participation. However, a potential
threat arises because unobserved factors we do not consider in the regression may correlate
with both the instrumental variables and individual digital financial participation. So, using
the methodology of Acemoglu et al. (2003) , we run the regressions to test the exclusion
restriction. In the first regression, we add both online social interaction and instrumental
variables. In the second regression, we only include instrumental variables. If online social
interaction is significant and instrumental variable is insignificant in the first regression,
while the instrumental variable is significant in the second regression, the most likely
interpretation is that the effect from instrumental variables is mainly through the online
social interaction channel, not through a range of other unobserved factors. Table 7A is the
result of an exclusion restriction test, indicating that the instrumental variable is unlikely
affected by the unobserved factors in the regression.
The results from the instrumental variable analysis are presented in Table 7B . The first-
stage regression indicates that the effect of the index of willingness to help each other is
significantly positive, which implies local social circumstances on helping each other is
associated with an increase in online social interaction. The value of the Ftest 34.69, which
exceeds the rule of thumb for strong instruments ( F> 10), which means it is unlikely to be a
weak instrumental variable. We find that after the introduction of the instrumental variable,
the impact of Online_SI is still positive, while the impact of Offline_SI on participation
breadth is no longer significant but still positive. The Hausman test and the Wald test both
reject the endogeneity of online interactive variables at the 1 percent level, which indicates
that the introduction of instrumental variables is necessary. Overall, after adding the
instrumental variable, the direction and significance of Online_SI have not significantly
changed, which shows that the estimation results are robust.
6. Further discussion
6.1 Channels from Online_SI to digital finance participation
The existing literature focuses on the test of the mechanism of Offline_SI, but few articles
systematically analyze the mechanism of Online_SI. In this section, we examine the
mechanism of participation in digital finance and discuss the mechanism of the depth andbreadth of participation.
Firstly, we test the contextual interaction mechanism. The contextual interaction
mechanism emphasizes a one-way role between individuals and members of reference
groups. In this regard, this study investigates the opinions of the main reference staff when
asking rural households to make important decisions such as purchasing commodity housing,
borrowing from formal financial institutions, making non-governmental loans, doing financial
investment (including stocks, funds and other financial products, such as internet financial
investment). Specifically, if the main reference opinions of any of the decisions include “network
information, ”rural households are considered to have contextual interaction behavior. Based
on this, the binary dummy variable of acquisition of contextual interaction is constructed. If
there is contextual interaction, the value is 1; otherwise, the value is 0. If “acquisition ”is
included in the equation, and the influence of this variable is positive and significant, the
contextual interaction mechanism is considered to be valid; otherwise, it is not valid.
It can be seen from the results in Table 8 that the acquisition coefficient is always positive
and significant irrespective of whether it is a participation or not or participation breadth or
depth, which indicates that contextual interaction promotes rural households to participate in
digital finance, i.e. contextual interaction mechanism is established. It can be seen from the
above that contextual interaction enables rural households to know more about the results of
participating in digital finance, but its impact direction is uncertain. If rural households knowCAER

307that other rural households enjoy more convenient, low-cost and high-quality services after
participating rather than suffer fraud, or facing other unfair treatment, then contextual
interaction will overall encourage rural households to participate in digital finance. The
results show that the role of digital finance regarding rural households in China is positive.
Thus, we should vigorously promote the development of digital finance.
The endogenous interaction mechanism emphasizes the two-way interaction between
individuals and members of reference groups. Endogenous interaction mechanisms include
word-of-mouth, common topic pleasure and social norm. Due to the availability of data, the
relevant literature often conflates the first two mechanisms without making a distinction, and
the test of the social normative mechanism in endogenous interaction is often carried out
separately.
Next, the word-of-mouth and common topic pleasure mechanism are tested. The word-of-
mouth and common topic pleasure mechanisms emphasize that rural households obtain
information online and exchange feelings. If the mechanism is established, in areas with a
high proportion of digital financial participation, the expanded network effect will lead to a
wider range of information acquisition and exchange fun, and the topic of digital finance will
be more easily discussed by the social interaction between rural households and families. At
this time, the transmission and acquisition cost of digital financial information will be lower,and the impact of social interaction will be more obvious ( Hong et al., 2004 ). To test this
mechanism, this study divides the samples into regions with higher participation and lower
participation based on the average digital financial participation ratio of counties where rural
households are located, and it estimates them. The results are shown in Table 9A .
It can be seen from the results in Table 9A that the value of the Online_SI coefficient in the
areas with a low digital financial participation ratio is significantly larger than that in the
areas with a low participation ratio, irrespective of whether it is a participation or not or
participation depth or breadth. In other words, the mechanism of information acquisition and
exchange of feelings in endogenous interaction is not established. One possible explanation is
that digital finance is still a novelty for rural households in China. Although they have a
strong interest to participate, they have challenging concerns regarding relevant information
in their daily lives. Therefore, if there is an opportunity to acquire information or exchange
feelings through Online_SI, the significance of Online_SI is more obvious for those rural
households who are less involved in digital finance.
We, then, test the mechanism of social norms. The test of the social norm mechanism
emphasizes that individuals want to choose financial behaviors that are consistent with the
average level of reference group members. The income of the reference group negativelyDF DF_D DF_R

308affects an individual ’s subjective well-being. The individual may be concerned with their
incomes relative to their peers ( Demarzo et al. , 2004 ). Households who take relatively
disadvantaged positions on the income distribution scale will emulate the style of richer
households to maintain and improve their social standings. Therefore, in our study, we use
Gini index to present income inequality at the county level. We calculate the Gini index at a
county level. We divide the sample by the Gini index. The income inequality is at a higher level
in the higher Gini index area, where it shows more significant interpersonal comparison,likewise. Therefore, if we observe that the impact of social interaction to digital finance
participation is significant in the higher Gini index area, and is not significant in the lower Gini
index area, we can conclude that the impact of social interaction to digital finance participation
goes through social norms mechanism, and vice versa. The results are shown in Table 9 .
It can be seen from the results in Table 9B that the value of the Online_SI coefficient in
areas with a high-income gap is significantly larger than that in areas with a low-income gap,
irrespective of whether it is a participation or not or participation depth or breadth. In other
words, the social norm mechanism in endogenous interaction is not established. One possible
explanation is that traditional finance has been deeply rooted in the people ’s mind after a
long-term development, and the public will follow some clear or implicit codes of conduct.
Thus, the social norms mechanism is established in traditional financial issues. However, as a
novelty, digital finance has just launched into rural areas and has not yet formed a fixed code
of conduct in the minds of the public; thus, it is not surprising the social norm mechanism is
not established.
In summary, Online_SI has a positive effect on the participation behavior of Chinese rural
households in digital finance, in which the mechanism of word-of-mouth, common topic
pleasure as well as the mechanism of social norms have a negative effect on the participation
behavior, while the effect of situational interaction is significantly positive and exceeds the
negative effect of endogenous interaction.
6.2 The effect of different types of social interaction

309while the leisure type contains playing games and entertainment. The correlation between
leisure and non-leisure type is 0.514. The high correlation suggests that two types are often
highly overlapped, through which the information received may be homogeneous. We also
add interaction term in the regression to testify the relationship between two types. Table 3
are the results.
First, the coefficients of both types are significantly positive, which implies both types
have a positive influence on digital finance participation. Second, the coefficient of non-leisure
type is higher than the leisure type, indicating that non-leisure interaction covers abundant
information, so that the households can understand the digital finance more
comprehensively. Third, the interaction term (leisure * non-leisure online social interaction)
is significantly negative, supporting the substitution relationship between them. Considering
the correlation coefficient between them, it may be because rural households have relatively
limited information processing capabilities. The effect from one type might crowd out
another type ( Table 10 ).
6.3 The relationship between Online_SI and Offline_SI
To explore the impact of Online_SI and Offline_SI on rural households ’digital financial
participation behavior and the relationship between them, this study introduces their
respective interaction items. It is worth noting that, in the nonlinear probit model, the
magnitude of the interaction between variables is not equal to the marginal influence of cross-
terms in the model results ( Ala and Norton, 2003 ). Thus, this study uses the linear probability
model (LPM) to do numerical approximate analysis, and the coefficient symbol and
significance level will not change.
According to Table 11 , the Online_SI coefficient is still positively significant, while the
Offline_SI coefficient is still not significant. Furthermore, the interaction items of Online_SI
and Offline_SI is positively significant in digital participation or not and participationbreadth, while it is not significant in participation depth but remain positive. That is,
Online_SI and Offline_SI are complementary to digital financial participation. One possible
explanation is that, from the perspective of information acquisition, the word-of-mouth and
common topic pleasure mechanism in Online_SI are more valuable for those rural households
that are unable to obtain information from their side, while Offline_SI is also beneficial for
rural households to obtain information on digital finance. In general, the more information,
the more benefit rural households attain. At this time, rural households will not make
tradeoffs between online and offline information channels due to their limited ability when

7. Conclusions and implications
Digital finance is a new way to realize inclusive finance through lower financial service costs
and improve credit access. At the same time, it is needful to stress that rural and poor
communities are easily excluded from digital finance due to their relatively low level of
education and low ability to understand digital technology. Therefore, the question is no
longer if the digital finance is relevant to financial inclusion, but how to raise the digital
finance usage.
This study uses the “China Rural Inclusive Financial Survey Data ”of China Agricultural
University in 2017 to identify the determinants on different aspects of rural households ’
participation in digital finance, focusing on the impact of online social interaction and its
mechanism. The study shows that the emerging online social interaction mode produced in
the internet era has a positive effect on rural households ’participation in digital finance, as
well as the depth and breadth of participation, which is conducive to the realization of digitalfinance and inclusive finance. By contrast, traditional offline social interactions often fail for
emerging digital financial participation behaviors. Further research finds that for the
different aspects of digital finance participation (i.e. participation or not and participation
depth or breadth), the impact of online social interaction is mainly realized through contextual
interaction rather than word-of-mouth, common topic pleasure and social norm in
endogenous interaction.
The conclusions suggest that positive online social interaction significantly enhances the
use of digital finance in a rural area, which provides a new policy perspective for the
promotion of digital finance. Although, traditional policies emphasizing offline procedures
are effective, including digital financial education and teaching rural households to use
digital financial products by offline financial institutions. Insights from our studies suggest
that the use of digital finance is also a social phenomenon. Digital finance users in a rural area
can refuse to use digital finance due to irrational self-exclusion, despite the low cost and easy-
to-use of digital finance. Rural households do not trust word-of-mouth information
communication online, do not get pleasure from common topic online and cannot be
influenced by the social norms online. They only pay attention to the result, and the success or
failure of digital finance participation of the surrounding groups, which means that rural
households are more cautious in online social interaction. Therefore, we need to build a
positive image of digital finance on the internet, improve the online contextual interaction andDF DF_D DF_R
