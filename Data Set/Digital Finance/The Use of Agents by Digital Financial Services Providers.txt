Annex II: List of Reference Regulations 18DFS AGENT BASICS 1A  N INCREASING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES,  
especially emerging markets and developing 
economies (EMDEs), allow a diverse array of banks 
and nonbank institutions to distribute digital financial 
services (DFS) through agents. According to the World 
Bank’s 2017 Global Survey on Financial Inclusion and 
Consumer Protection, nonbank electronic money issuers 
(EMIs) in 61 relevant responding jurisdictions (91 percent) 
are permitted to use agents as third-party delivery channels. 
Ninety-six responding jurisdictions (81 percent) allow 
commercial banks to use agents.1 Permission to use agents 
in this way is a basic regulatory enabler of DFS.2 Agents play 
a crucial role in lowering the cost of delivery to reach the 
unbanked and underbanked population and to provide them 
with financial services and products (Hernandez 2019).
The contribution of agents to achieving financial inclusion 
depends in part on how enabling the regulatory frameworks 
are. This Technical Note focuses on regulating agent models, 
taking a detailed look at different approaches to agency 
agreements, eligibility requirements, rules on exclusivity, 
services that can be offered through agents, standards for 
different types and levels of agents, and agent management. 
For each key point, we discuss the pros and cons of different 
approaches from a financial inclusion perspective. The 
countries covered in this Note are Bangladesh, Brazil, Ghana, 
India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria, 
Pakistan, Peru, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. 
1	 DFS Agent Basics
Regulations define the relationship between an agent  and a 
DFS provider or principal on whose behalf the agent acts (see 
Box 1 for definitions). The rules vary across countries (and to 
some extent within countries) on the scope of responsibilities 
that can be outsourced to agents, although several core 
elements are largely constant across the countries we studied. 
1 Percentages are based on 118 responding jurisdictions for commercial banks and 67 for nonbank EMIs.
2 Staschen and Meagher (2018) describe this as one of four such enablers, the others being nonbank e-money issuance, risk-based customer due 
diligence, and consumer protection.
3 They are referred to as “subagents” of the ANM in Regulation No: 2310/2018–00021[614] of 27/12/2018 of the National Bank of Rwanda Governing 
Agents.AGENCY AGREEMENTS AND LIABILITY
DFS providers are often required to have a written agreement  
directly with all agents that offer services on their behalf. In 
most countries, regulations hold DFS principal providers 
legally responsible for the actions of their agents. The 
principal often remains liable even if agents are originally 
contracted by ANMs. They usually are not permitted to limit 
their liability in the agency agreement. 
Country examples illustrate the different ways in which 
this key component is addressed. Zambia’s regulation, for 
example, holds an EMI liable to its customers for business 
conducted by the agents “within the scope of the agency 
agreement,” and such liability cannot be excluded by the 
agreement. Uganda holds DFS providers (in this case, banks) 
liable for their agents’ acts or omissions “relating to agent 
banking.” Agent banking regulations of Kenya and Tanzania 
clearly state that the DFS provider is responsible and liable 
for all actions or omissions of its agent and emphasize that 
this responsibility extends to actions of an agent “even if not 
authorized in the agency agreement as long as they relate to 
agent banking services or matters.” Such a provision excludes 
the possibility of a principal’s liability being limited through 
the agency agreements. Similarly, Jamaica requires payment 
services providers to remain “fully liable for decisions and 
actions by their agents.”
Even if the principal is liable, it could indemnify itself 
against liabilities arising out of its agents’ actions. Rwanda 
explicitly states that a DFS provider may enter into such 
indemnification agreements. Its regulation also requires 
third-party providers (i.e., ANMs) to assume liability for their 
agents and indemnify the principals for the payments they 
made as a result of agent liability. 3 However, the principal 
remains ultimately liable to the customer even if an ANM 
is used to subcontract and manage agents. Such indemnity 
clauses ensure that agents and ANMs remain vigilant even 
if liability rests with the principal. Several countries also 
require the principal’s liability to be explicitly included 
in the agency agreement, this applies, for example, to 2
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERSall providers in Ghana and to banking agents in Kenya, 
Uganda, and Nigeria. 
Many countries, such as Ghana, Tanzania, and Myanmar 
for EMI agents and Kenya for banking agents, require DFS 
providers to submit the draft standard agency agreement 
before regulatory approval to use agents. Some regulations 
identify provisions that should be included in the agency 
agreement—for example, services to be rendered, anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism 
(AML/CFT) and IT requirements, the liability and 
responsibility of DFS providers for actions of agents, fees 
and revenue-sharing structure, confidentiality of customer 
information, record-keeping, and reporting requirements. 
This is the case, for example, in Ghana and for banking

including Myanmar, Tanzania, and Zambia for EMI agents 
and Rwanda for all agents do not specify the provisions to 
be included in the agency agreement. 
BASIS OF REGULATION
We identified three main approaches to agent regulation : 
institution based, account based, and activity based.4 The 
most common is the institution-based  approach where 
different agent regulations are issued according to the type 
of DFS providers an agent can serve, as is the case in India, 
Kenya, and Pakistan. In this approach, more than one set 
of regulations may apply to agents offering services to more 
than one type of principal. Kenya, for example, has three Box 1. Key definitions
Agency Agreement: An agreement between the principal 
and an agent acting on the principal’s behalf to deliver 
services to customers. Some regulations use different 
terms, such as “service-level agreement,” to refer to the 
agreement between a DFS provider and an agent.
Agency Business: The business of the delivery of DFS to 
customers by an agent on behalf of a principal pursuant to 
the agency agreement.
Agent:  A third party who acts on behalf of a DFS provider 
under an agency agreement for the delivery of DFS directly 
to customers. Other terms for this include “distributor,” 
“correspondent,” or “service point.” This Note distinguishes 
between nonbank and banking agents where necessary, 
and this distinction is based on the type of principals that 
outsource certain activities to agents. “Banking agent” is 
the term for agents that act on behalf of banks to deliver 
DFS to customers; “nonbank agent” refers to the ones that 
act on behalf of nonbank institutions. 
Agent Network Manager (ANM): A third party to 
whom the principal outsources some or all aspects of the 
management of an agent network, including selection, hiring, and training of agents, liquidity management, and 
monitoring of agent operations. For more on the definition 
of ANMs, see Box 3.
Digital Financial Services (DFS):  The range of financial 
services accessed through digital devices and delivered 
through digital channels, including payment, credit, 
savings, and remittances.a Digital channels may include 
mobile phones, cards combined with card readers, 
computers connected to the internet, or automated teller 
machines, among others.
Digital Financial Services Provider:  A provider that 
delivers DFS to its customers. A DFS provider could be a 
bank, nonbank EMI, or any other regulated entity.
Nonbank Electronic Money Issuer (EMI):  Nonbank 
institution authorized and dedicated to issuing electronic 
money (e-money) against the collection of customer funds, 
offering e-money accounts and related payment and 
storage services.
Principal: A DFS provider whose services are being 
delivered to customers through agents under the agency 
agreement.
a. See AFI (2016).3 AGENT ELIGIBILITYseparate sets of regulations for the use of agents, applicable 
to banks, deposit-taking microfinance institutions, and 
payment services providers. 
In countries that follow the account-based  approach, the 
rules are based on which types of accounts the agents 
serve, such as bank accounts or e-money accounts (e.g., 
Bangladesh). In countries that follow the activity-based  
approach, different rules apply depending on the types of 
services being outsourced, regardless of the type of principal 
or the type of account served (e.g., Ghana and Rwanda). 
WHAT ARE THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR AND  
AGAINST DIFFERENT AGENT APPROACHES  
AND LIABILITY PROVISIONS?
Pro
• Holding principals liable for their agents’ actions gives 
them the incentive to be more vigilant in overseeing 
agent activities and assessing the risks involved.5 It also 
addresses supervisors’ concerns about the potential risks of 
using agents.
• Where principals have no liability, supervisors’ concerns 
would focus on how the actions of agents will affect 
consumers. Supervisors would need to monitor and 
supervise the ANM or even each agent (if there is no ANM) 
to protect customers and their funds—which is often not 
possible given limited resources. However, when principals 
do have liability, supervisors are able to focus on the 
principal instead of the activities of ANMs or each agent—a 
proposition that is more manageable.6 
• The activity-based approach (a kind of functional  approach) 
to agent regulation applies uniform rules to all types of 
providers and all types of accounts for a given type of 
activity. It creates a level playing field and is flexible in 
addressing the emerging issues of DFS, especially given the 
increasing trend of agent networks shared among different 
types of principals, new nontraditional providers entering 
the market, and partnerships between banks and nonbanks.
5 A few experts questioned the need for providers to assume liability for and oversight of the activities of all agents (e.g., Mas [2015]). Also, see Mas (2019) 
on the suggestion of building independent cash-in and cash-out (CICO) networks that solely focus on offering CICO services to all customers of DFS 
providers without the need for an agency agreement.
6 For more on supervision of principals, see Dias, Staschen, and Noor (2015) and Dias and Staschen (2018).Con
• In countries that regulate agents using an account-based 
approach, banks that offer both bank accounts, such as 
deposits, and e-money accounts through agents have to 
manage different sets of agent regulations even if the agents 
basically conduct the same type of services (e.g., cash-in and 
cash-out [CICO] services).
• The institution-based approach makes it difficult to 
address fast-evolving DFS models that involve banks and 
nonbanks—such as a digital credit product offered by a 
bank through a nonbank agent network—or where new 
nontraditional players come onto the scene. Also, users 
of similar services may have different levels of protection 
depending on the type of principal.
Overall, the activity-based approach is the preferred policy 
to promote a level playing field and to minimize the 
regulatory arbitrage stemming from the recent emergence 
of new types of players. Some jurisdictions might be obliged 
to issue different sets of regulations on the use of agents for 
different types of providers because their regulatory system 
is institution based. However, even these types of systems 
could be designed to apply similar rules to all agents, thus 
creating a level playing field. 
2	 Agent Eligibility 
Agent regulations state who can become an agent and often 
provide minimum criteria for agent eligibility, including 
business experience, financial situation, and human 
resources. While several countries, including Colombia, 
Ghana, India, and Rwanda, allow individuals to become 
agents, in other cases, such as in Brazil, eligibility rules 
require the agent to be a legal entity such as a company. 
Some countries, such as Brazil and Rwanda, allow any type 
of entity to become an agent and do not list the eligible 
types of entities. In other cases, the regulations, including 
for banking agents in Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, issue a 
long list of types of entities that may become agents.4
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERSRules on who can be an agent vary significantly across 
jurisdictions. For example, Mexico stipulates that an 
institution that is dedicated to money transfer services 
as defined in the General Law on Auxiliary Credit 
Organizations and Activities cannot be an agent.7 
Conversely, in Brazil and Colombia, microfinance 
institutions, savings and credit cooperatives, and other 
financial institutions can act as agents for other financial 
institutions.8 In the case of Nigeria’s agent banking 
regulation, which lists a diverse range of entities that can 
act as agents, a legal person who is not-for-profit, such as a 
nongovernmental organization (NGO) or an educational 
institution, cannot engage in the agent banking business.9 
It is not obvious in each case why the range of eligible 
entities was limited. However, regulators sometimes look for 
agents with one or more of the following characteristics: 
• An established network of outlets particularly those in 
harder-to-reach areas.
• Some experience conducting financial transactions.
• No risk of being steered away from a social mission, but 
also no profit motive— depending on which of these 
two is seen as a higher risk, the outcome would be either 
prohibiting or allowing only NGOs.
Requirements for agents may also include fit-and-proper 
criteria  such as having a good reputation in the community, 
a sustainable business, healthy financials—and no criminal 
record. Where an agent can be a business, they may be 
required, for example, to have a valid business license or 
to have been in business for a minimum period (e.g., 12 
months for all agents in Ghana and for banking agents 
in Nigeria and Kenya; 18 months for banking agents 
in Tanzania).10 Those that want to become agents are 
disqualified if they have been classified as a nonperforming 
borrower by a financial institution within the past 12 
7 Ley General de Organizaciones y Actividades Auxiliares del Crédito, http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/139_090318.pdf 
8 Resolution 3954/2011 of Central Bank of Brazil, Decree 2233/2006, and subsequent revisions and Decree 3965/2006 of Financial Superintendence 
of Colombia.
9 To the contrary, India originally excluded for-profit entities out of concern that poor clients would be exploited. See Tarazi and Breloff (2011).
10 Ghana’s Payment Systems and Services Act (2019) defines “agent” as a person who provides agency services to customers on behalf of a principal under 
an agency agreement. The principals could be a bank, specialized deposit-taking institution, payment services provider, or EMI.
11 See Bangladesh’s Prudential Guidelines for Agent Banking Operation in Bangladesh for the definition of rural and urban.
12 India’s agent banking regulation used to require retail outlets and subagents to be within 30 km of their assigned bank branches in rural, semi-urban, and 
urban areas, and within 5 km in metropolitan centers. These distance criteria were repealed in 2014.months (in Nigeria) or 24 months (in Rwanda) of signing 
the agency agreement. Even agents with agreements in 
place can be disqualified if they become classified as a 
nonperforming borrower while they are agents. 
In some countries, such as Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda, 
a banking agent cannot be run or managed by an employee 
of the principal. In addition, Bangladesh prohibits a former 
employee of a DFS provider from acting as an agent for the 
same provider within one year of retirement or resignation. 
These rules aim to reduce potential conflicts of interest.
Some countries, such as Rwanda for all agents and 
Tanzania for banking agents, require potential agents to 
have appropriate human resources  to provide services 
conveniently and without interruption. Bangladesh goes 
into more detail and requires an agent to have at least a 
manager, a teller, and a counter for cash transactions. 
In addition, several countries require DFS providers to 
submit plans for their agents’ geographical coverage  before 
being approved for agency business. Examples include 
Ghana, Rwanda, and Kenya (for banking agents only). A 
few countries regulate the location of agents. Malaysia’s 
agent banking regulation, for example, identifies the 
districts where a DFS provider may appoint an agent. 
Banks in Bangladesh must give preference to locations 
where there is no bank branch or agent point within a 1 km 
radius. Another requirement for banks in Bangladesh is 
that they should maintain a minimum ratio of 3:1 for rural 
and urban agents.11 These kinds of provisions often reflect 
financial inclusion mandates aimed at ensuring services 
to the unbanked and underbanked population. A few 
countries, including Brazil, India, and Uganda, require a 
DFS provider to assign each agent, subagent, or outlet to 
one of its branches to ensure adequate oversight of their 
activities and effective liquidity management.12 5 AGENT ELIGIBILITYCertain countries require agents to have an ongoing, 
separate line of business. This is the case for Kenya 
and Uganda for banking agents. In other words, those 
operating as agents must cease doing so if their separate 
line of business has ceased or is significantly diminished. 
In the same vein, several countries (e.g., Malaysia and 
Tanzania) prohibit DFS providers from appointing as an 
agent a business whose sole activity is agent banking—a 
dedicated agent. Brazil prohibits specific services such as 
collecting and transferring account opening documents to 
the principal, account-based payments, and bill-of-exchange 
payments to be performed by agents whose principal 
activity is agency business. 
PROS AND CONS OF ADOPTING STRICT,  
DETAILED AGENT ELIGIBILITY RULES
Pro
• Requiring agents to be legal entities such as companies 
ensures that agents have sufficient organization, 
resources, and accountability to provide responsible, 
continuing services.
• Fit-and-proper requirements including appropriate 
human resources help ensure that agents have sufficient 
capacity, expertise, and integrity to offer financial services. 
This means more consistent service quality and reliable 
service delivery. Further, it reduces consumer protection 
risks, thus affording a certain level of confidence to the 
principal regarding the agents’ activities for which they are 
ultimately liable.
• Rules on location of agents, such as minimum ratios of 
agents in rural vs. urban areas, could help push agent 
networks to reach remote areas to the benefit of financial 
inclusion, depending on the business models in the country.
• The requirement of a separate line of business helps to 
ensure that business volume is sufficient to cover the 
operating expenses of the agent, especially in the early phase 
of the business.13 Also, these policies may help to ensure 
that DFS providers retain agents who have a level of activity 
from the separate line of business that generates adequate 
liquidity. This requirement is more important for cases 
13 Kapoor, Pelupessy, and Kusuma (2017) seem to support this, as they showed that agents who conduct other business from their shops in addition to a DFS 
business are significantly more profitable compared to agents who conduct only DFS business. This evidence, however, might be due to selection bias.where the DFS provider does not provide liquidity services 
to the agents. Last, such policies may help ensure the 
integrity of agents and reduce the risk of agent fraud since 
an agent with a separate line of business might be less prone 
to risk its other ongoing line of business by committing 
misconduct and wrongdoing related to its agency business.
Con 
• Even if having strict rules on agent eligibility might reduce 
risks to the financial system, those rules might undercut 
financial inclusion objectives and limit the ability of DFS 
providers to find potential agents, especially in underserved 
regions. Unnecessarily restrictive rules on the type of entity 
allowed to become an agent, required documentation, 
qualified staff, and physical premises increase costs and 
reduce availability of agents in those sparsely populated 
regions where a viable agent business is hardest to achieve. 
Such barriers to entry limit not only the number of service 
points but also the range of different services and products 
that can be conveniently accessed by customers. Such 
negative impact would be exacerbated where the regulations 
impose restrictions on agent eligibility.
• Detailed requirements imposed on agent eligibility would 
also increase the supervisor’s cost of enforcement. This 
is an important issue because supervisory resources are a 
constraint in many EMDEs where agents are being used in 
increasing scale. 
• Rules limiting the distance of an agent from the nearest 
branch assume that agent networks manage liquidity 
through branches, which is not necessarily the case. This 
function can be performed in other ways, including 
through third-party providers or ANMs. Also, because 
branches are often located in urban areas, such a rule on 
proximity will stand as an obstacle in extending agent 
networks into remote areas. Moreover, such a rule may be 
unnecessarily restrictive, especially where DFS providers 
have effective remote monitoring systems that ease oversight 
of agents’ activities. 
• The rule on nondedication of agents—requiring a separate 
line of business in addition to the agent business—may 
keep entities that have the potential to generate sufficient 6
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERSprofits from specializing in agency business from entering 
the market.
The policy and regulatory framework should be flexible 
enough to allow principals to hire eligible agents according 
to their own risk assessments that consider the risk level of 
several factors, including services offered and locations. 
In general, decisions on which types of entities to use as 
agents, whether they need to be nondedicated, and where 
they should be located should be made by the DFS provider. 
The principal should make decisions within the limit of its 
risk appetite and in line with its strategic plan to reach new 
locations and its overall agent management strategy, among 
other things. The policy maker should focus on the liability 
of the principal in managing the risks of its own agents 
and agent network consistent with the complexity of the 
outsourced activities.
The litmus test for any policy on agents—at least where 
financial inclusion is a priority—is whether it supports 
the extension of agent networks throughout the country, 
including remote areas. This makes it imperative that policy 
makers avoid undercutting the business case for agents. 
Regulators should consider introducing different types of 
agents with risk-based eligibility criteria tied to the scope of 
activities the agents can conduct. 
The priority for policy makers should be to promote policies 
and approaches that incentivize principals to extend their 
agent networks to rural areas rather than to impose rules 
that make agency business unattractive.14
3	 Agent Exclusivity
Many countries mandate nonexclusivity of agents. These 
countries include Ghana for all types of agents and Kenya, 
Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uruguay for banking agents. 
Other countries allow exclusivity. These include Brazil and 
Rwanda for all types of agents and Mexico, Malaysia, and 
Pakistan for banking agents. In both cases, agents are free 
to serve multiple DFS providers. Where nonexclusivity of 
agents is possible, DFS providers typically are responsible 
for assessing the capacity of an agent to manage 
14 See Arabehety, McKay, and Zetterli (2018) for more on approaches that could incentivize providers to extend their agent networks into frontier areas.  transactions for multiple DFS providers before hiring the 
agent. Jamaica allows nonexclusivity, but also permits 
exclusive arrangements, making the latter individually 
subject to prior approval by the Bank of Jamaica.
A few countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, and 
India, mandate exclusivity. Bangladesh previously permitted 
the nonexclusivity of banking agents, but in 2017 issued 
new guidelines to require exclusivity. In India, exclusivity 
is mandated at the subagent or retail outlet level, while 
business correspondents, which are essentially ANMs, can 
serve more than one bank.
PROS OF EXCLUSIVITY OF AGENTS
• Exclusivity may encourage providers to invest in building 
agent networks in the early stages of market development, 
enabling them to benefit from the first-mover advantage 
(Tarazi and Breloff 2011). 
• It is easier for agents to manage a single agency agreement, 
maintain a relationship with only one principal, and/or 
handle one platform instead of several.
• Exclusivity makes it easier for all customers to understand 
by which principal they are being served at the agent 
location. Further, supervisors would have better visibility 
into who is responsible for oversight and training of agents 
and resolving consumer protection issues.
PROS OF NONEXCLUSIVITY OF AGENTS
• Nonexclusivity should ease market entry for multiple DFS 
providers in rural areas where it is hard to find qualified 
agents. Further, customers could access a diverse range 
of services from multiple DFS providers at agent points 
of service and choose the ones that meet their needs 
and preferences.
• Nonexclusivity makes it more likely that any given agent 
will work with multiple principals, enabling the agent to 
generate attractive revenues and make a viable business 
case, at least in certain locations. This would encourage 
more agents to enter the market, thus expanding the reach 
of financial services by providing more points of service to a 
larger number of customers.7 RANGE OF AGENT ACTIVITIES• It may also protect competition by limiting vertical 
integration (principals controlling their distribution 
network). The resulting competition should pressure 
providers to maximize customer value and satisfaction.
In most cases, it is best to leave it to both parties—the 
principal and the agent—to decide whether to impose 
exclusivity or not, as they are in the best position to decide 
what arrangement brings most value. Also, some providers 
might prefer to use both exclusive and nonexclusive agents 
to provide financial services that are consistent with their 
agent management and distribution strategy and their 
risk appetite. On the other hand, regulators have less 
information and risk imposing high costs on themselves 
and the market by using mandates. Regulations should 
be flexible. Regulators should keep in mind that ensuring 
the appropriate level of competition in the market and 
creating a level playing field also depend on other factors. 
Mandating contract provisions should be a measure of 
last resort for regulators, for example, when across the 
financial sector (or a subsector), free choice of exclusivity or 
nonexclusivity may produce suboptimal results.15 Market 
failures such as underinvestment in the roll-out of agent 
networks at the initial launch stage due to free-riding 
problems (in cases where exclusivity is prohibited from 
day one) or strengthening even further the position of 
providers with dominant positions due to the use of vertical 
constraints (in cases where exclusivity is permitted) may 
require policy makers to change their rules in order to 
promote financial inclusion.16 
15 EPAR (2018) explored the hypothesis of Tarazi and Breloff (2011) that “regulations allowing or mandating agent exclusivity may encourage early market 
growth, but later limit competition in the market.” They considered trends in market growth and competition in each selected country (Bangladesh, 
India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda) before and after the relevant regulations were introduced. Ultimately, they did not find 
consistent evidence to support or contradict the hypothesis.
16 See Soursourian and Plaitakis (2019) for more on exclusivity rules from a competition perspective.
17 For more on how CICO services are conducted by agents, see Hernandez (2019).
18 The bigger question is whether the DFS provider is permitted to receive international remittances directly into customer accounts (e.g., into mobile 
wallets). For the agent, a CICO transaction linked to international remittances would not be different from any other CICO transaction. 4	 Range of Agent Activities:  
 What Agents Are Allowed to  
 Do for Their Principals
DFS regulations identify the activities agents may perform 
on behalf of their principal. These activities vary somewhat 
according to the country or the types of principals the 
agents serve. Regulations often allow agents to handle 
basic activities such as CICO services, payment services, 
balance inquiry, and issuance of account statements. (See 
Box 2 for a description of different types of agents based on 
the services offered.) In Malaysia, all banking agents must 
provide CICO services at a minimum even if the relevant 
regulation specifies a broader range of permissible agent 
services. CICO services are commonly handled in real 
time on the agent’s own account, although few countries 
explicitly provide for this in regulation.17 Ghana is one 
of the few countries that require all agent-based e-money 
transactions to be done electronically and settled in real 
time against prefunded accounts held by the agents.
Banking agents are generally permitted to conduct more 
types of activities than nonbank agents. For example, they 
may be allowed to disburse and repay loans (essentially 
CICO transactions linked to a different type of account), 
collect loan application documents, and issue credit and 
debit cards or check books. In some countries, agents are 
allowed to handle international remittances (e.g., Rwanda, 
and banking agents in Bangladesh), although regulations 
often lack details on what this means.18 
Most regulations explicitly state that account opening is not 
allowed to be outsourced to agents. However, Colombia, 
Ghana (for e-money accounts only), Mexico, Pakistan (for 
branchless banking accounts), and Peru allow customers 
to open lower-level accounts at an agent. These accounts 
are considered lower risk under money laundering and 
financing of terrorism rules and are commonly subject to 8
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERStransaction, balance, and/or deposit limits. Individuals and 
entrepreneurs in Brazil can use agents to open accounts of 
any level—low and regular.19 However, even if agents are 
allowed to open certain types of accounts, the principal 
is still liable for agent compliance with regulations such 
as AML/CFT rules. This requires the principal to ensure 
adequate oversight of agents. Where agents are not 
permitted to open accounts, they often are allowed to 
facilitate  the opening of accounts, which is important for 
potential customers living in remote areas. Typically, agents 
are permitted to distribute and collect account opening 
documents and transfer them to the principal. This is the 
case in Rwanda; for banking agents in Bangladesh, Nigeria, 
and Tanzania; and for EMI agents in Sierra Leone. 
In practice, CICO services are the predominant activities 
for most agents.20 The risks they face primarily depend on 
the type of activities conducted. For example, agents that 
conduct only CICO services incur comparatively lower 
risk if they transact on their own prefunded accounts and 
operate in a real-time or close-to-real-time environment. 
However, they are exposed to higher levels of risk if they 
also open new accounts for customers. An activity-based 
approach to agent regulation will segment agents by the 
set of functions they perform and the corresponding risks. 
The regulatory requirements would then be different for 
different tiers of agents and proportionate to their risks.21 
Some countries allow a wider menu of activities for agents 
that are legal entities, while they restrict the menu for 
agents who are individuals. For example, in Rwanda 
individuals acting as agents can perform only basic 
activities such as CICO services, bill payments, and balance 
inquiry. Entities that have a business license for an ongoing 
commercial activity can provide a broader range of services 
such as collecting account opening information, accepting 
loan payments, and distributing payment cards. 
Regulations often list activities that agents cannot  carry 
out on behalf of their principals, including granting loans, 
19 For more on risk-based customer due diligence with country examples, see Meagher (2019).
20 GSMA (2019) reports that CICO transactions represented the majority of mobile money flows in 2018. Of those, 73.2 percent of incoming 
transactions are cash-in while 67.9 percent of the outgoing transactions are cash-out activities (as of December 2018).
21 For more on tiering of agents by function, see Chen and Hernandez (2019).
22 Note that these are prohibitions that apply to the agency relationship itself. Where financial institutions and other companies serve as DFS agents, these 
rules usually do not prevent such entities from pursuing their lawful nonagency activities.making check transactions, making transactions in foreign 
currency, charging customers directly, providing cash 
advances, and offering any type of guarantee in favor of any 
customer. Further, agents are often forbidden to charge any 
fee beyond the principals’ prescribed fees.22
WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF  
RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE  
DELEGATED TO AGENTS?
Pro
• Restricting agents’ activities helps manage concerns over 
consumer protection, systemic risks, money laundering and 
terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks, and other matters, as 
long as the regulations follow a risk-based approach where 
requirements are lighter for lower-risk activities. 
• Requiring agents handling CICO services to do so in real 
time (or by checking the balance against data stored on the 
POS device when connectivity issues arise in remote areas) Box 2. Types of agents
Several countries identify different types of agents 
based on the services they can offer. Brazil, for 
example, distinguishes agents who engage in bill 
payments, withdrawals, and transfers from other types 
of agents who provide a wider range of services, 
including selling credits and leasing contracts (Lauer, 
Dias, and Tarazi 2011). Kenya’s National Payment 
System regulations, unlike most others, identify a 
type of agent called a “cash merchant” in addition to 
ordinary agents. Cash merchants are responsible only 
for providing CICO services to customers on behalf of 
the payment services providers. However, agents and 
cash merchants are subject to the same eligibility rules. 
Malaysia’s e-money guidelines identify “reload agents” 
whose activities are limited to cash-in services.9 MULTILEVEL AGENT NETWORKSand on their own account helps limit risks such as agents 
misappropriating customer funds (Chen and Hernandez 
2019).
• Limiting account opening at the agent level to lower-level 
accounts reduces ML/TF risks, and simplified CDD helps 
balance financial inclusion objectives against financial 
integrity burdens. 
Con
• Financial inclusion objectives can be negatively affected 
by an overly restrictive menu of permissible activities for 
agents. At times there is a perception that banking agents 
are riskier because they serve full-fledged bank accounts 
that can be used for deposit-taking and disbursing loans, 
but the underlying risk is basically the same as long as it 
is a CICO operation on a prefunded float account. The 
overall risk of using agents for a range of activities should 
be assessed in the context of the principal’s liability for and 
oversight of agent activities and the risk this channel poses 
to the principal’s safety and soundness (see Section 1).
Where agents are allowed to play a role in account opening, 
the supervisor should be aware of the potential ML/TF risks 
and that risks are lower when account opening is limited to 
low-level accounts, which typically have transaction/balance 
limits. Regulations also should permit simplification of 
some elements of customer identification and verification 
(CIV) in lower-risk settings to promote financial 
inclusion.23 In any case, CIV executed by agents need to be 
monitored commensurate with the potential risks.
Risk-based regulations on different types of agents (based 
on the menu of services they can offer) should ease 
market entry for agents limited to basic services (e.g., 
CICO services) and increase their number. This in turn is 
important for meeting the essential financial needs of the 
low-income population. The distinction among different 
tiers of agents allows the principal to adjust the level of 
agent oversight accordingly.
23 For more on CIV and other CDD elements such as beneficial ownership, risk profiling, and transaction monitoring, see Lyman et al. (2019).
24 In general, the appointed ANMs may or may not contract agents on behalf of the principal, depending on the country and DFS model. Some regulations 
allow a principal to hire ANMs, but the agents they manage are directly contracted by the principal.
25 Ghana’s Payment Systems and Services Act (2019) defines master agents as “a legal person who has an agreement with a principal to contract and manage 
agents that provide banking or e-money services or payment service to customers on behalf of the principal.” The regulation refers to both master agents 
and ANMs. A master agent is considered to be a type of ANM in this Technical Note.  5	 Multilevel Agent Networks
Regulations often allow DFS providers to outsource agent 
network management functions, at least in part. For 
example, Rwanda allows a DFS provider to hire ANMs who 
may contract agents on the principal’s behalf.24 (See Box 3 
for a definition of ANM.) In those cases, the regulations 
include eligibility standards and require a contractual 
relationship to be in place between the DFS provider and 
the ANM. In most countries, the regulations explicitly hold 
principals ultimately liable for the actions of their agents, 
even when the agents are originally contracted by ANMs 
appointed by the DFS provider. If the ANM intends to act 
as an agent as well as manage network functions—as is 
the case in Rwanda and Ghana—it should have a separate 
agency agreement with the principal. Other countries have 
outsourcing provisions but do not expressly refer to ANMs 
in the regulations (e.g., Kenya’s agent banking regulation). 
A few regulations, however, are silent on these issues. 
A DFS provider chooses the ANMs that it wants to work 
with. Third parties usually do not need to be licensed by the 
supervisor to act as ANMs. In this case, the DFS provider 
contracts ANMs and ensures that they are able to render 
the relevant services. Nigeria, by contrast, requires certain 
third parties to apply for a super-agent (a type of ANM) 
license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The 
regulations for super-agents list the eligibility criteria for 
applicants (see Box 4). 
In addition, several countries specify criteria to be an ANM. 
In Ghana, the qualifications of a prospective master agent 
include financial soundness, cash-handling capacity, and 
security and internal controls in proportion to the risks 
involved.25 Fit-and-proper requirements include not being 
classified as a nonperforming borrower in the 12 months 
before application. Within one month of appointing the 
master agent, the principal should submit to the Bank 
of Ghana documentation, including the due diligence 
policy applied by the master agent, new agent onboarding 10
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS26 In Pakistan’s Framework for Branchless Banking Agent Acquisition and Management, the term “direct agent” refers to agents in the same way it is 
used in this Note. The Framework also states that super-agents “may be organizations having well-established owned or franchised retail outlets, or a 
distribution setup. These will be responsible for managing and controlling subagents. These may include fuel distribution companies, Pakistan Post, 
courier companies, chain stores etc.” Pakistan’s super-agent is considered as a type of ANM in this Note.
27 Similar to Pakistan’s agent structure, Nigeria identifies super-agents, sole agents, and subagents.procedures, and the master agent’s AML/CFT procedures. 
Bangladesh requires a master agent to have several branches 
or outlets. The entity should have managerial, financial, 
and technical expertise in managing agents in addition 
to its regular operations, and it or its owner/manager 
should have at least one year of experience in the field of its 
regular operations.
Regulations sometimes prohibit agents that have a 
contractual relationship with a DFS provider from 
subcontracting to a third party. Tanzania and Uganda, 
for example, explicitly state that an agent should not 
subcontract agent banking business. While such regulations 
prohibit subcontracting, they might allow DFS providers 
to recruit third-party providers to help manage their 
agent networks.
Some regulations allow DFS providers to have an agent 
structure with multiple levels of outsourcing . In Ghana, a 
DFS provider can outsource agent management to master 
agents who then contract with agents on behalf of the 
principal. The regulation also allows principals to hire 
ANMs that recruit, train, monitor, or manage liquidity 
for agents. However, unlike master agents, ANMs are 
not allowed to have direct contractual relationships with 
agents. Pakistan’s agent regulation for branchless banking 
identifies three main types of agent: super-agents, agents, 
and subagents.26 While agents must have a separate agency 
agreement with the DFS provider, subagents contract with 
the super-agent who manages and controls subagents on 
behalf of the provider. In addition, Pakistan’s regulations 
allow providers to onboard ANMs to help manage agent 
networks. Nigeria has a similar approach regarding agent 
network structure.27 Box 3. Agent network managers
In this paper, “agent network manager” is defined as a 
third party hired by the principal to take on some or all 
aspects of agent management, which may include: 
• Selecting and hiring agents, managing liquidity, 
training, monitoring operations, and other supporting 
activities.
• Identifying the agency business strategy.
• Providing upfront capital to agents.a 
The type of tasks outsourced to ANMs depends on 
several parameters, including the market, products and 
services offered, internal resources of the providers, 
and market power of competitors. Today, many DFS 
providers use ANMs to manage several of their agents 
while they might still manage a few of them directly.b 
ANMs may or may not operate as agents themselves 
and may or may not have a direct contractual 
relationship with the agents they manage, depending 
on the country model. Regulations might use different 
terms to refer to ANMs such as “master agent,” “super-
agent,” or “aggregator.” In Ghana, for example, a master 
agent can be recruited by the principal to contract 
and manage agents that provide banking, payment, or 
e-money services. In Nigeria, licensed super-agents are 
responsible for managing, monitoring, and supervising 
the activities of their subagents. In this Technical Note, 
we refer to all of them as “agent network managers,” 
regardless of the outsourced functions. 
a. For the roles of ANMs, see Flaming, McKay, and Pickens 
(2011) and Schiff and Jumah (2016), who refer to ANMs as 
master agents.
b. For more on different ANM models, see CGAP’s Agent 
Network Management blog series, https://www.cgap.org/blog/
series/agent-network-management .11 MULTILEVEL AGENT NETWORKSWHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING  
SPECIFIC REGULATIONS THAT PROVIDE FOR  
MULTILEVEL AGENCY, INCLUDING ANM s?
Pro
• Depending on the model, specific regulations on ANMs 
may help alleviate supervisors’ concerns about agent risks 
that may adversely impact customers and providers. This is 
most likely to be true when the number of licensed ANMs is at a level where the supervisor has sufficient capacity to 
effectively monitor and supervise them. 
• ANMs can help principals manage outsourcing risks. 
Where ANMs are allowed to contract with agents on the 
provider’s behalf, the principal need not bear the burden 
of signing and managing separate agency agreements with 
each agent. The respective roles of principals and ANMs 
are clarified, and risk management is strengthened, by Box 4. Super-agents in Nigeria
While regulations often allow providers to hire third parties ANMs without the intervention of the supervisor, Nigeria has taken 
a different path and created a separate licensing category for super-agents. To promote the use of shared agent networks, 
CBN has issued regulations for licensing super-agents. To be licensed, a third party that wants to recruit agents and run and 
manage agent networks should, at a minimum:
• Be a company with an established business that has operated for at least 12 months.
• Be registered with the corporate affairs commission.
• Have a minimum shareholders’ fund, unimpaired by losses, of N 50 million (approximately US$140,000). 
• Have a reference letter from a financial institution as part of its documentation for the license. 
• Have a minimum of 50 agents.a
The regulation also outlines the responsibilities of super-agents. A super-agent should:
• Be responsible for managing, monitoring, and supervising the activities of the agents. 
• Have information on the volume and value of transactions carried out for each type of service by each agent (which 
should be made available to the principal). 
• Monitor effective compliance with set limits and establish other prudential measures in each case.
• Take all other measures, including onsite visits, to ensure that agents operate strictly within the requirements of the law, 
guidelines, and contract. 
A super-agent’s platform is used to manage and monitor the activities of their agents only—it may not hold e-money 
value, whereas the principal provides and operates the mobile money platform and holds e-money value. The regulation 
requires super-agents to renew their operating licenses every two years, subject to CBN evaluation. CBN can request 
any information from agents of a super-agent that it may deem necessary or inspect the agents. Moreover, it can impose 
appropriate sanctions for any contravention by super-agents. In Nigeria, three companies are licensed as super-agents; 
four companies have approval-in-principle.b
a. Called “subagents” in the regulations.
b. The approval-in-principle is valid for six months. After that period, CBN reviews the performance of the companies and decides whether they 
should receive a full license (see, https://www.afi-global.org/news/2016/08/central-bank-nigeria-approves-first-licenses-super-agent-banking ). For 
a list of Nigeria’s super-agents, see https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Paymentsystem/PSPs.asp .12
THE USE OF  AGENTS BY  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERSregulations that set specific standards and provide default 
provisions to govern these relationships.
Con
• DFS providers may lose some control over their agents/
agent networks—for which they are legally responsible. 
Also, providers might not effectively monitor agents’ 
activities, with negative implications for the overall 
quality of the network and of services to customers. The 
identification of common and recurrent problems at the 
agent level and addressing them in a timely manner would 
be a challenge for the principal.
• Depending on the number of ANMs being licensed, the 
direct regulation and supervision of ANMs might create a 
substantial burden for the regulator. 
• It may be hard to manage risks and ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements such as AML/CFT and consumer 
protection rules at the agent level. This would be a concern 
for the regulator. For the agents whose services are limited 
to lower-risk activities (e.g., CICO services), this would be 
less of a concern. 
• A frontline agent who deals with customers might have to 
share its commissions with others and thus see its earnings 
reduced and its viability compromised.13 REFERENCESReferences
