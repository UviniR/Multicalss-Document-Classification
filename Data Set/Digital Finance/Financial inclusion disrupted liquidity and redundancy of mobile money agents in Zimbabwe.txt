Abstract
Mobile money agents (MMAs) are the pedestal of inclusive finance by bringing finan -
cial services closer to unbanked people by offering them capabilities to move from 
cash to electronic money and vice versa. This function is effective in an environment 
where hard cash is in uninterrupted circulation. The aim of this paper is to inv estigate 
implications of cash liquidity challenges in Zimbabwe to the development of financial 
inclusion through MMAs in a rural set-up. Phenomenological in-depth interviews 
were conducted with MMAs. Due to national liquidity challenges, MMAs ceased to re -
ceive cash float support, limiting their cash-in and cash-out services. Pure agents were 
adversely affected, while those who operate retail goods services reported increased 
goods sales through mobile money point-of-sale payments. Consumers are restricted 
to deal in electronic funds in the cashless economy making the cash-in and cash-out 
function of MMAs redundant. MMAs need support to sustain their operations and 
recoup invested capital in infrastructure. Risk management strategies, including the 
principal-agent contracts that minimize the exposure of MMAs to disruption of the 
service are important. MMAs could form an association to lobby financial regulators 
for support, negotiation with principals, market research, political power and activ e 
participation of agents in deepening financial inclusion. Perhaps pure MMAs could 
improve their economic sustainability by diversifying their businesses. Last Mazambani (South Africa),  Tariro Juliet Rushwaya (South Africa),

INTRODUCTION
Mass financial exclusion is a major problem in less developed econ -
omies, particularly in Africa (Mills, 2011; Pickens, 2009). Countri es 
with disjointed and subsistence economies are likely to have most of 
their people outside mainstream financial markets (Viswanathan et al., 
2010). As governments and policy makers fight for financial inclusion 
(Ivatury & Mas, 2008), growth and opportunities, frugal disruptive 
engineering in cloud computing and mobile technology could be the 
transformational panacea in reaching millions of unbanked rural and 
low-income communities (Hughes & Lonie, 2007; Mas & Kumar, 2008; 
Duncombe & Boateng, 2009; Morawczynski, 2010; Turnball, 2010). 
This development has resulted in the emergence of what is common -
ly referred to as cloud banking, cell phone banking, mobile money or 
mobile wallet (Turnball, 2010). These terms refer to all financial trans -
actions performed using cell phone technology (Duncombe, 2012). 
The growth of the service is riding on the back of massive invest -
ments in mobile phone technology and high mobile phone penetra -
tion rate in emerging markets (Donner, 2004; Orozco et al., 2007; The © Last Mazambani, Tariro Juliet

Economist, 2009; Tobbin, 2010). The service’s resultant decentrali zation of banking services based on 
access to a handset and a “subscriber identity module” (SIM) ha s the capability of connecting every 
town and village thereby enabling previously unbanked poor people to sen d and receive money, trans -
fer funds between accounts and pay bills from their cell phones (Heyer & Mas, 20 11; Dikit et al., 2012). 
The introduction of mobile money services in low-income markets such as Ken ya, the Philippines and 
Zimbabwe was received with wide adoption (Hidayati, 2011; Kalba, 2016 ). This phenomenal opportuni -
ty would not have been possible without the employment of MMAs to reach ev en the most remote and 
dispersed areas (Mas & Morawczynski, 2009; Donovan, 2012). MMAs play a criti cal role in the distribu -
tion of mobile phone based financial services and is a game changer to financial i nclusion (Duncombe, 
2012). A MMA works on behalf of a principal to facilitate the distribution of mo bile phone based finan -
cial services. These principals are traditionally banks or mobile netw ork operators (Makanyeza, 2017). 
The sustainability and survival of MMAs is critical to financial inclusio n (Maurer et al., 2013). The 
main function, from which MMAs generate most of their fees or commissions, i s cash-in and cash-out 
services. These commissions are very tinny and dependent on t he values transacted. Given that poor 
people transact low value infrequently amounts, the commercial viab ility of mobile agents is always 
threatened (Duncombe, 2012; Ndlovu & Ndlovu, 2013). The other administ rative functions of opening 
mobile accounts and exchange of electronic float performed by agents on behal f of the principal are 
support services without significant monetary return (Heyer & Mas, 2009 ). Liquidity management and 
the availability of cash float are, therefore, important for MMAs to offer cas h-in and cash-out business 
services (Dermish et al., 2012; Mas & Radcliffe, 2010).
Disruption in liquidity can have dire consequences to national payment s ystems including MMAs 
(Lawack, 2013). It is also important to note that technology based ser vices like mobile money trans -
fers are easily affected by market conditions and can adjust quite quickly. I n the process, there could 
be beneficiaries and casualties from the changes. The mobile money transfe r distribution channel in 
Zimbabwe has been disrupted by liquidity or cash shortages experienced i n the country. There has 
been disruption of the flow of mobile money transfers due to cash shortages. N ow, as mobile money 
substitute cash as means of payment (Dermish et al., 2012), pure MMAs have been f ound losing out, 
while groceries retailer agents that use point-of-sale mobile money pa yments have emerged as benefi -
ciaries of these market changes. This seems to defeat the essence for which MMAs w ere introduced. In 
order to promote financial inclusion, an expansive MMA network is seen as a ke y value driver (Mas & 
Morawczynski, 2009). Proximity of the agents to the market drives adopti on and usage of the service 
(Medhi et al., 2009). MMAs were designed to dispense financial services clo ser to low-income commu -
nities than outreach of traditional banks (Zeng et al., 2017). Any disrupt ion of this fundamental service 
means the served communities revert to the old system whereby they access ca sh from traditional banks 
located in urban areas (Mavhiki et al., 2015; Ndlovu & Ndlovu, 2013). 
The crippling cash shortage has disrupted the normal flow of cash in Zimbabwe. MM As have ceased 
to receive cash float support thereby affecting their business operations . MMAs are being bypassed in 
the distribution of financial services threatening their economic su stainability. It is not clear how this 
development will affect the drive for financial inclusion. The study, ther efore, explores the implications 
of the disrupted liquidity on financial inclusion as championed by MMAs. It w ould also be of interest to 
understand how the operations of the MMAs have been affected.
Research problem
In Zimbabwe, mobile banking agents have been successful in distributin g the service to poor communi -
ties and creating entrepreneurship opportunities. Howeve r, the current liquidity challenges faced by the 
country have changed the fortunes of mobile banking agents. Due to liquidit y challenges consumers are 133Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
failing to cash-out their mobile money, but can purchase or make payments to tr aders and merchants. 
Cashless mobile money exchange is the main currency of business in Zimbabwe . As a result, cash-in 
and cash-out transactions are limited thereby cutting out mobile agent s from the distribution channel. 
Research objectives
The study specifically aims to gain insights into the implications of liquid ity challenges to the develop -
ment of financial inclusion through mobile agent banks. Furthe r, the study will find out how mobile 
banking agents’ business operations have been affected by liquidity chal lenges. Important conclusions 
and recommendations will be drawn for the development of the sector.
Research questions
The study seeks to address the research objectives by answering the follow ing research questions:
• What are the implications of liquidity challenges to the development of fina ncial inclusion through 
mobile banking agents?
• How are the operations of mobile banking agents affected by liquidity chal lenges?
• What are the potential responses to these challenges?
Research significance 
MMAs are critical to deepening financial services towards the unbanked . The paper contributes to aca -
demic knowledge by shedding light on emergent developments in the critical area of financial inclusion. 
The study has connotations on principal-agent contracts and ho w risks could be minimized for both 
parties in the highly disruptive industry. The MMAs are constituted by som e big nationwide retailers, 
but mostly by smaller tuck shops that only provide mobile money servic es and paraphernalia of other 
goods sold on behalf of the principal. These tuck shops are mostly owned by small- to-medium (SME) 
business operators who are required to put down capital to invest in the infr astructure (Mas & Radcliffe, 
2010). The waning of business has severe implications for these SMEs as it affe cts their personal and 
business economic sustainability. The study contributes by reveali ng how the operators view the future 
of their business and how their sustainability can be revived. These devel opments may as well have 
reshaped the value chain such that MMAs might need to start to search for alternat ive opportunities 
within and without the principal.
1. LITERATURE REVIEW
1.1. Financial inclusion
Financial inclusion can be defined as the “process 
of ensuring access to appropriate financial prod -
ucts and services needed by all sections of the so -
ciety in general, and vulnerable groups such as 
weaker sections and low-income groups in par -
ticular, at an affordable cost, in a fair and trans -
parent manner by regulated mainstream interna -
tional players” (Kapoor, 2014). Financial inclusion 
is reached when all the citizens of a country have easy access to a wide variety of financial services 
at a cost that they can afford and the services meet 
their needs (Central Bank of Nigeria Report, 2012; 
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Report, 2015). This in -
cludes lessening the requirements for opening up 
bank branches, setting up ATMs and allowing lo -
cal banking agents to be involved in carrying out 
bank transactions (Kapoor, 2014). It also includes 
removing of barriers and overcoming liabilities of 
the poor and the disadvantaged in the society so 
that they too have access to formal and protect -
ed financial services (Conroy, 2005). Financial 
regulators have been accommodative and flexi -134Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
ble to the free evolution of inclusive finance mod -
els including the deployment of MMAs (Lawack, 
2013). Inclusion of a country’s citizens into the 
formal financial services contributes to reduction 
of poverty and economic growth through mobi -
lization of savings for productive use, allocating 
capital funds efficiently and managing risks there -
by reducing disparities and eradicating poverty 
(Chakravarty & Pal, 2013; De Koker & Jentzsch, 
2013; Kapoor, 2014). The accessibility of mobile 
phone technology brought a sense of hope that 
the unbanked masses could have access to finan -
cial services (Heyer & Mas, 2011; Ivatury & Mas, 
2008; Chandra et al., 2010; Nel & Raleting, 2012). 
The number of mobile banking agents has been 
an important value driver and a key element in 
the delivery of mobile money services (Bangens 
& Soderber, 2008; Alampay & Bala, 2009). Agents 
interact with consumers for cash-in and cash-out 
services and disseminated important banking in -
formation to mostly low-literacy and low-income 
communities. The wide adoption of mobile mon -
ey service has been hinged on the proximity of 
MMAs to the people mostly in areas that were ex -
cluded and neglected by traditional financial insti -
tutions (Medhi et al., 2009). The combination of a 
widely distributed mobile phone technology and 
widespread MMAs makes financial inclusion pos -
sible (Peruta, 2018; Duncombe, 2012).
1.2. Liquidity challenges in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe runs a dollarized economy where a 
multiple of international and regional curren -
cies have been adopted as legal tender since 2009 
(Sikwila, 2013). The US dollar is the main bank -
ing and trading currency (The Economist, 2013). 
Zimbabwe cut an isolated country from econom -
ic sanctions without financial support from mul -
ti-lateral financial institutions (Noko, 2011). As a 
net importer with weak productive capacity, high 
recurring government expenditure and no bal -
ance of payment support, Zimbabwe’s liquidity 
challenges were always lurking. In no time after 
dollarization, the country started to face shortages 
of US dollar hard cash in circulation. The Reserve 
Bank of Zimbabwe issued a bond note, which is a 
surrogate currency, to ease the circulation of cash. 
The bond note is pegged at par with the US dol -
lar, but from inception, it was never fully accept -
ed by the public (Africa Research Bulletin, 2017). However, the continued shortage of the US dollar 
from the official market escalated the emergence 
and flourishing of the black market. As most of the 
liquidity is now in the informal market, illiquid 
financial institutions merely facilitate electronic 
transactions. The situation is dire for MMAs who 
are positioned at the tail end of the value chain 
of money distribution. In fact the principals have 
ceased to support MMAs with any kind of liquid -
ity support. Without cash floats, mobile money 
face liquidity risk which threatens their economic 
survival (Chiteli, 2013). 
1.3. Mobile money in Zimbabwe
Mobile money platforms allow clients to per -
form various functions such as transfer of funds 
and payments for goods and services using a cell 
phone (Maurer et al., 2013). Mobile money is an 
important solution to financial exclusion (Ndlovu 
& Ndlovu, 2013). With the cash-in and cash-out 
services through the agents or cash merchants, 
there has been a rapid increase in people using mo -
bile money transfers (Mavhiki et al., 2015). Mobile 
money has provided opportunities for individuals 
to conduct financial transactions without being a 
bank account holder (Suarez, 2016). Mobile mon -
ey transfers in Zimbabwe have been conducted 
through the use of agents. Mobile network oper -
ators (MNOs) are the main operators of mobile 
money in Zimbabwe and they have been using 
their mobile networks and access to subscribers 
to the exclusion of traditional banks (Mavhiki et 
al., 2015). Banks and MNOs only started to collab -
orate and promote technology and bank systems 
inter-operation ability after liquidity challenges. 
Customers can now transfer funds between their 
mobile wallets and traditional bank accounts. This 
is a great development in the advancement the fi -
nancial markets born as a necessity to the cash 
challenges. It would appear that mobile phone 
technology has not yet been fully explored, with 
the cooperation of actors, it can champion the fi -
nancial sector development (Marumbwa, 2014).
1.4. Agent banking
An agent bank acts on behalf of a principal such 
as a bank or cellular network operator to process 
financial transactions such as depositing, with -
drawal, transfer of funds, and payment of bills 135Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
(Omigie et al., 2017). Agents play a crucial role in 
activating customers. These agents make it pos -
sible through demonstrations for these new cus -
tomers to transact and they also contribute to re -
taining them. They verify the identity of the cus -
tomers when they sign up and in all subsequent 
transactions. The success of mobile money servic -
es is greatly dependent on the quality of the agent 
networks (Argent et al., 2013; Vutsengwa & Ngugi, 
2013). Agents are usually individuals with social 
capital and business relationships with potential 
clients for mobile money in their communities 
(Maurer et al., 2013). Local MMAs have been in -
strumental in extending financial services to the 
unbanked rural and remote areas, thereby pro -
moting financial inclusion (Ndlovu & Ndlovu, 
2013; Zeng et al., 2017). Liquidity management 
and availability of cash float is critically important 
for agent banks to perform their cash-in and cash-
out function. Failure to secure cash would lead to 
customers to bypassing them. As commissions 
from cash-in and cash-out are their main revenue 
source, this has a negative connotation on the eco-
nomic sustainability of their business. 
1.5. Agent banking challenges 
The prime function of MMAs is to help mobile 
money customers move from cash to electronic 
deposits and vice versa. Performing this function 
effectively requires adequate flow of cash float to 
meet withdrawal demands of customers while 
retaining sufficient electronic balances to facil -
itate conversions. Agents should have sufficient 
amounts of cash to allow transactions to take 
place as and when customers want to. Failure to 
do so results in customers perceiving the service 
as unreliable and this can lead to the diminish -
ing reputation of the service provider (Maurer et 
al., 2013; Afande & Mbugua, 2015). Advancement 
in inter-operationability between mobile money 
platforms and traditional bank accounts has giv -
en customers the power to self-serve (Omigie et 
al., 2017). Customers can now self-replenish their 
mobile accounts thereby bypassing MMAs. It is 
paramount to note that the continued infusion 
of technology will broaden the potential of finan -
cial markets and empower customers. Inevitably, 
there will be frequent disruptions to the distri -
bution of technology based financial services 
(Marumbwa, 2014). The future of MMAs could be hinged on broadening value added financial ser -
vices rather than the current transactional servic -
es (Zeng et al., 2017). 
1.6. Agent banking benefits 
Combined with agent banking, the mobile phone 
based banking channels created more benefits than 
disadvantages to the financial market and the new -
ly banked public (Buku & Meredith, 2013). MMAs 
provide a better service to the customers in the 
form of less waiting time, higher market decentral -
ization and democratization of banking services by 
making it available to poor communities (Zeng et 
al., 2017). The new distribution channels are more 
cost-effective such that the general public transact 
at a fraction of the cost. This ultimately leads to low -
er costs to the consumer (Mols, 2001; Campbell & 
Frei, 2010). The new mobile money channels might 
lead to a growth in the customer base as technol -
ogy becomes more and more accessible to clients. 
Agents have further influence on the adoption of 
both mobile phones and mobile money in remote 
places.  The MMA channels provide convenience, 
transactional efficiency, choice and access at com -
petitive prices and returns (Birch & Young, 1997; 
Jack & Suri, 2014; Blumenstock et al., 2015). MMAs 
reduce the cost of transaction as they reduce the dis -
tance to the bank and minimize travel (Marumbwa, 
2014). Ndlovu and Ndlovu (2013) observed that 
mobile agents were impactful as most rural resi -
dents have reduced their travel to urban areas for 
the sole purpose of accessing banking services. The 
technology used delivers quickly. The poor live at 
the margin, hence, the speed of mobile transactions 
becomes beneficial for them (Eijkman et al., 2010).
Due to exogenous market developments strain -
ing market liquidity, the intermediation role of 
the MMA has been obliterated as customers can 
self-service by linking bank accounts and mobile 
accounts for self-replenishing e-funds. It would 
therefore be of interest to understand through an 
empirical study how these developments impact -
ed the functions of the MMAs and the develop -
ment of financial inclusion. The viewpoints of the 
agents are invaluable in understanding the evolv -
ing circumstances. The following section looks at 
the methodology applied before discussing the re -
sults of the study. In the last section, conclusions 
and recommendations of the study are drawn.136Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
2. METHODOLOGY
Financial exclusion is often a phenomenon of the 
rural areas that are avoided by traditional finan -
cial institutions (Sarma & Pais, 2011). In light of 
that, the study was carried out in a rural envi -
ronment at Jerera business center under the ad -
ministration of Zaka Rural District Council in 
Masvingo province, Zimbabwe. The district is 
found southwards of Harare in a drought prone 
area whose main business activity is subsistence 
farming. The business center was selected on the 
basis of convenience and lack of investment by tra -
ditional financial institutions. As recommended 
by Creswell (2014), a phenomenological research 
approach was used to understand the lived expe -
riences of MMAs. Data were collected through 
unstructured qualitative in-depth face-to-face 
interviews with senior managers, experienced 
employees and entrepreneurs operating mobile 
money agency. The interviewees were selected at 
the rural business center using convenience sam -
pling. The interviews lasted for approximately 45 
minutes. The interviews were stopped after reach -
ing data saturation. In total, six interviews were 
conducted providing rich and thick data. The in -
terviewees had cumulative experience of 11 years 
of operating mobile money agency business. The 
sample was equally represented in terms of gender 
representation. The characteristics of the respond -
ents are summarized in Table 1 below.
The respondents have deep customer-faced experi -
ence as mobile agents. Their accounts of the devel -
opments in the sector are first-hand and authen -
tic. The respondents were relatively young and had 
strong views about the business potential of mo -
bile money and how the liquidity crunch had neg -
atively impacted on their network of relationship 
they had created over time. One of the respond -
ents who had substantially invested in infrastruc -ture for the agent bank was quite emotional at the 
possibility of running into financial difficulties 
due to lack of support from the principal. Data 
from the interviews conducted were recorded and 
analyzed by the researcher. 
3. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
3.1. Principal-agent relationship
MMAs reported that the principals are very sup -
portive and quick to resolve any challenges agents 
may face on the electronic platform. The principals 
are said to attend to queries in a timely manner. 
There are monthly meetings where representatives 
of the principals engage with agents to discuss op -
erational issues. Some of the topical proposals in 
these meetings include the adoption of the South 
African Rand as one of the currencies on the mo -
bile money platform. MMAs believe that the in -
troduction of the Rand could solve the liquidity 
challenges. However, they are not too sure of what 
support they will get from the principals. One in -
terviewee summed it up by saying, “…they used to 
support us in all our initiatives but we are not too 
sure if they will attend to this request….” The re -
quest is actually beyond the control of the MNOs 
as it is the prerogative of the central bank of the 
country. 
The researchers made unique observations that 
while the principals provide operational support, 
they unfortunately do not advise agents of the po -
tential risks of the trade. In fact, principals mini -
mize the risks they were exposed to, while they leave 
agents exposed to the vagaries of business risk. One 
of the interviewees invested in a fully-fledged bank -
ing kiosk which cost him a fortune. Unfortunately, 
by the time he finished constructed the kiosks, the 
liquidity crunch was already biting. It would be im -

portant if financial education can also be extend -
ed to agents so that they are fully aware of the po -
tential risks that could affect their business before 
contracting. The interviewee felt neglected by the 
principal. The challenge is that big corporates may 
dictate the conditions of the contract without al -
lowing agents to fairly ask for improved conditions. 
Perhaps this is a learning point for agents to organ -
ize a self-empowerment association that stand for 
the advancement of all banking agents.
3.2. Disrupted liquidity support 
The mobile bank agents interviewed act on be -
half of mobile network operators (MNOs) such as 
Econet, Netone and Telecel. They generally high -
lighted that they were receiving support from their 
principals through regular discussion meetings 
and workshops that are utilized to interactive -
ly address challenges and opportunities (Sanchez 
& Ricart, 2010). All the MMAs decried lack of li -
quidity support from MNOs and bigger banks ever 
since the beginning of liquidity challenges in the 
country. They pointed out that MNOs never used 
to support them with advance liquidity assistance, 
but would avail cash float by gnashing the agent’s 
electronic account with the MNO. MNOs, howev -
er, stopped providing this service when the nation 
started to face liquidity challenges. Some notewor -
thy replies from the interviewees “….the principal 
used to distribute cash to us but stopped when cash 
was a problem because of liquidity challenges…” 
Another respondent said, “…In 2014 we used to 
get cash from the banks but nowadays you just use 
your own resources…” A relatively young respond -
ent note that “….our business is not doing well be -
cause of cash circulation problems. If agents were 
allowed to access cash float for liquidity purposes 
just like banks, our fortunes would improve… We 
used to get rotational cash allocations which the 
principal has since stopped. Now there is virtually 
no cash float support for agents….” 
3.3. Redundancy of MMAs
MMAs pointed out that without cash float, their 
main function of cash-in and cash-out which 
brings most of their revenue is redundant. They 
further complained that the continue lack of liquid -
ity challenges will lead them to lose their customers 
and some relationships they had created. Mobile agents created accessibility for even for civil serv -
ants working in rural areas. An interviewee com -
mented that “…most civil servants in our commu -
nity have mobile money accounts linked with their 
banks but we cannot serve them anymore because 
we do not have cash….. They now abscond classes 
to travel to banks in town in search of cash….” They 
highlighted this has caused a great inconvenience 
to the community which was now used to getting 
cash at their doorsteps. One agent highlighted that 
“…a lot of people were now doing mobile banking 
so the liquidity challenges have affect them severe -
ly…” The results are in live with the observation 
of Maurer et al. (2013) that the intensification of a 
broadly cashless economy would render MMAs re -
dundant. Despite this setback, MMAs are critical -
ly required for deepening financial inclusion. The 
emergent distribution channels of mobile money, 
as a result of the redundancy of the MMAs, clearly 
have no development impact. The channels may not 
advance the interest of financial inclusion as they 
inconvenient and are removed from low-income 
communities. It would be in the interest of the in -
dustry to bring back MMAs into the loop.
3.4. Business sustainability
Mobile bank agents reported reduced business in 
cash-in and cash-out after market liquidity chal -
lenges. Consequently their cash-in and cash-out 
incentive or commission has drastically gone down 
due to reduced business. Pure agents reported that 
their cash-out activities are only limited to the 
amount they receive from cash-in or sales of oth -
er merchandise which they say is too little to sus -
tain operations. Some agents suggested borrowing 
cash from friends and relatives to inject liquidity 
into the business. However, one of the interviewees 
retorted that borrowing cash is pointless as it will 
create headaches to get the money back. Agents 
with grocery stores reported that they hardly get 
cash-in transactions, but they offer 50% on the val -
ue of goods purchased for their clients to cash-out. 
The interviewees were in agreement that when 
there are no cash shortages their mobile money 
agency business operations can cover operating 
costs and post a good profit. They noted that this is 
a major source of revenue for their business, hence, 
it is at the mercy of other developments such as 
the current disrupted cash circulation. Most of the 138Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
interviewees note that competition is not even a 
problem to their viability for as long as they have 
sufficient cash flows.
3.5. Business fortunes
Pure MMAs are those that only provide mo -
bile money services without additional business. 
Interviewees who offered this service complained 
that their business had been adversely affected by 
the cash shortages. Pure agents had more chal -
lenges because their business solely dependent on 
cash-in and cash-out. One pure agent noted that 
‘……we use the little cash we make from selling 
products such as bulky airtime to do cash-out…
otherwise if we do not have cash we just scale 
down”. On the other hand, the interviewees who 
represented grocery retail shops reported that 
their customers and indeed their sales from mo -
bile money payments are increasing. They howev -
er, bemoaned delayed service from the principal 
in terms of the supply of the specialized till slips 
supplied by the principal. One interviewee said 
that “….point-of-sale till roles using mobile mon -
ey finish quickly and we do not get them on time...” 
3.6. Future expectations
The interviewees remain optimistic that their fu -
ture business fortunes will improve once the na -tionwide cash shortage is addressed. This was 
notable by a common response that “…..once we 
get cash, our problems are solved”. They also re -
mained positive that their principals will provide 
them with support to get more additional services 
to sell such as helping the public to pay for pre -
paid subscription television channels, selling pre -
paid electricity tokens, and distribution of bulky 
airtime. They also hope that they will find solu -
tions in their monthly meetings with principals. 
The agents are also anticipative that if the South 
African Rand that has been recently introduced 
on the mobile payment system is fully adopted, it 
might improve the business situation. 
Though they spoke of scaling down operations, 
none of them perceived the market developments 
as long-term or one that can disrupt the distribu -
tion of mobile money forever. They view the li -
quidity challenge as temporal. They also remained 
simplistic on their assessment that when the busi -
ness environment improves their business would 
be resuscitated. Individually, MMAs lack the ca -
pacity to conduct research on the implications of 
these challenges on the future of their operations. 
Their heavy reliance on the principals to find solu -
tions leave them exposed to the whims or arbitrary 
decisions by the principals. There might be need to 
build negotiating or contractual clout through or -
ganizing themselves into an association.
CONCLUSION 
This study captured the viewpoints of mobile agency operators. It is inter esting to note that all the in -
terviewees expressed great optimism that their fortunes will impro ve once the cash situation improves. 
Perhaps, it is because this change in the mobile money market is induced by factor s outside the direct 
evolution of the service. However, technology based products may not rev ert to old practices. Even if 
they do, the amount of business may not be as great as it was before.
Low-income people live in a predominantly cash economy; they cannot sav e or make payments remote -
ly (Medhi et al., 2009). The obliteration of the function of banking agents ap pears inimical to financial 
inclusion. The number of functional agents is a key value driver in mobile mon ey. MMAs are of the view 
that if banking is to be inclusive of everyone, they should be supported throu gh daily allocation of cash 
float just like other banks. Mobile agents believe that to survive they should b e subcontracted to perform 
more value adding services that improve their earnings.
Agents were disrupted unexpected after undertaking huge investment s in infrastructure. Perhaps, this 
has a bearing on the structure of principal-agent contracts in technolog y based services prone to dis -
ruption. The wholesome transfer of risk by principals to agents in buildin g banking infrastructure may 
need to be reviewed in order to minimize the risk exposure to agents. As report ed by Mas and Radcliffe 139Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
(2010), pure agents in rural areas are run by unsophisticated survival ist entrepreneurs, some who may 
hardly comprehend the level of risk exposure they could suffer. Principal -agency contracts that ensure 
that risks to both parties are shared and minimized would ensure that there are no l osers in the event 
of disruption. 
MMAs promoted a cash economy which stifled the adoption of electronic paym ents especially in rural 
areas. The liquidity challenges affected mostly the rural economy becaus e it is traditionally based on 
cash transactions (Medhi et al., 2009). The induced behavioral changes whi ch pushed rural people to 
venture into unfamiliar areas of electronic transactions for a low-li teracy people. However, the liquid -
ity crunch in a way has increased the adoption of mobile payments by people from r ural communities. 
The cash shortages have actually forced rural consumers to adopt electron ic payment systems. Liquidity 
challenges, would appear to increase the use and adoption of plastic and ele ctronic money by the public 
albeit with resistance. 
Mobile money principals recruit or outsource mobile money agency serv ices from SMEs as well as big 
retail chain stores. The liquidity challenges grossly prejudiced SMEs wh ile it transferred business to big 
corporations. It can be deducted that this has a negative connotation on the de velopment of entrepre -
neurship. The liquidity crunch is a serious risk factor at the agent level whi ch requires proactive action 
from financial regulators. The current scenario where only big banks with u rban branches receive cash 
floats is not only an affront to the democratization of financial markets but a perp etuation of exclusion -
ary business practices against the poor and powerless. It is an infring ement on the freedoms of poor 
people who have to travel long expensive distance to stand in long queues to acc ess their money. 
The technology sector is prone to disruptions, some intentional and othe rs emergent (Blumenstock et 
al., 2015). In general, agents can take a pro-active approach to diversify t heir business as a measure to 
guard their economic sustainability. This is done in order to evade redund ancy of the organization and 
its employees. The agents should not wait to be forced out of business by their co mpetitors or chang -
es in the distribution channels (Mols, 2001). However, this is only possib le if there is top management 
support that spots customer needs (Mols, 2001). Literature on distrib ution channels has posited that in 
order to avoid obsolescence, it might be necessary to have different produc ts serving different customer 
segments (Rangan et al., 1992). 
RECOMMENDATIONS
It is high time that pure agents consider diversifying into other business es. With rapid technological 
changes, some services will evolve while others cease to exist. Well diver sified businesses operations 
will ensure continued economic sustainability of MMAs. Alternativ ely, the principal in the agency 
relationship may look for other avenues to utilize the agents in their value c hains. Agents also need 
to empower themselves and the communities they serve by possibly formin g an association that can 
lobby for the full liquidity support of agents in rural areas considering t he critical role they play in fi -
nancial inclusion. The association could also help with nego tiating leverage in drawing principal-agent 
contracts, as well as conducting scientific research to help agents m inimize risks while capturing 
opportunities.
The situation in Zimbabwe might be unique in the sense that the adoption of mobil e money as the an -
chor method of payments was not voluntary. Liquidity challenges create d opportunities for increased 
use of plastic and electronic money. Technology based products are expo sed to rapid change. Without 
the physical cash, MMAs are redundant. Consumers are now dealing direct ly with retailers (distribu -
tion channel has been reduced). Financial regulators and institutions s hould promote the use of plastic 
and cell phone money.140Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 15, Issue 3, 2018
The national payment systems should be developed to be inclusive of some tra nsactions that are still cash 
based. Many service providers such as public transport operators and othe r petty transactions still insist 
on cash payments. The national payment system has not sufficiently develope d to include these transac -
tions. The frequency of public transactions requires payment solutio ns such as using near-field-technol -
ogy or improvement of mobile money. 
The current mobile money services are still transactional services lik e cashing in and out. They have 
only provided access to a mere mobile ‘bank account’ without any added value that improves the wellbe -
ing of previously unbanked people. Perhaps this is the time that mobile agent s could be turned towards 
higher order financial services such as advancing loans, savings and inve stments. They can also be en -
gaged in expanding microfinance services like micro-insurance in rur al areas.
While the fortunes of MMAs are waning due to cash shortages, there is an increa sed use of electronic 
payment methods as many people are driven to adopt mobile money as the anchor cu rrency of business. 
This development has caused increased business for the principals albei t at the expense of MMAs as 
mobile money transactions are confined to electronic transfers betwe en consumers and retailers, and 
person-to-person electronic transfers. There might be need to relook a t the principal-agent contracts to 
ensure that the vulnerable agents are protected from potential risks. 
Financial institutions and monetary authorities might capitaliz e on this window of opportunity to 
strengthen the adoption and acceptance of electronic money in the count ry. Monetary authorities may 
improve the national payment system to ensure that electronic payment me thods become the method 
of first choice. Faced with a dollarized economy suffering from repeated currency crises, some recom -
mendations suggest that financial markets could be innovative enough to de velop and adopt a crypto -
currency that can be used to trade in the cashless economy (Raymaekers, 2015) .
