FOREWORD  
 
We hold these algorithms to be self -evident, that all Internet users are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their software with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are digital Life, e -Liberty and the purs uit of Internet Happiness . 
The fourth industrial revolution is sweeping the world by storm. A digital 
‘Declaration of Independence’ is demanded to enable all humanity to benefit 
fairly from the coming upheaval.  In this new digital economy, every country is  
faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges which are 
fundamentally different from the previous revolution. Entire industries are 
being disrupted and transformed.  
New platforms of collaboration and competition across the public, private and 
peop le sectors are presenting urgent imperatives for governments to innovate, 
to redesign services, and to rethink policies.  The legitimacy of digital government 
will depend on fostering citizens’ consent through a digital social contract that 
embraces e -equit y and value creation.   
Digital government policies must foster agility, innovation and value creation. 
Every public servant, industry professional and citizen must embrace digital 
transformation, and have access to learning opportunities to develop deep and  
holistic skills to thrive in this new era.

 CHAPTER 1: Framing t he Digital Econo my 
In September 2017, Alipay users can walk into any KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) in Hangzhou (China)  
and ‘smile to pay’ enabled by facial recognition technology  – as part of a pilot programme by 
Alibaba’s Ant Financial .1 By 2018, s tudents at the tropical campus of the National University of 
Singapore will see drones carrying parcels as part of a trial by Airbus Helicopters and the Civil 
Aviati on Authority of Singapore2 - the same technology has already been tested to deliver medicine 
in rural Rwanda and Ne w Zealand.3 
 
These are just a few examples of the rapid changes over -taking economies and societies as they ‘go 
digital’. The emergence of the digital economy is transforming the world at an unprecedented scale, 
scope and complexity. Challengingly, t he transformation is characterised by disruption across almost 
all sectors  of industry and society leading to the emergence of new forms of production, 
management and governance .4 The opportunities emerging for governments to reach and enable 
citizens with servi ces are quite profound, but so too are ways in which the government must 
reappraise its role and approach. To begin to frame this dynamic, t his chapter provides a broad 
definition of what the digital economy is, and an overview of the impact and potential of the new 
technologies underpinning and driving digital disruption. It then discusses the unique characteristics 
of the digital economy in terms of sc ale and scope  and briefly introduces the effect of digital 
transformation on governments.  
 
What is a Digi tal Economy?  
There is no universally accepted definition of the digital economy, but  a most common , albeit 
somewhat narrow understanding is the share of GDP accounted for by the ICT sector.5 (Identifying 
what this is and comparing across different economie s raises its own set of problems.) This report 
relies on a much broader concept and defines the digital economy as “the entirety of sectors that

4 Note, the term  ‘disruption’ is here used to denote the upsetting of existing businesses and/or business models, and  as 
such, is part of a process of transformation; while the term ‘transformation’ implies a much broader  change in economic 
and social parameters, for exam ple, the demise of agriculture or heavy industry and the rise of the information society.

 operate using Internet Protocol (IP) -enabled communications and networks” irrespective of 
industry.6   
Digital technologies have been deployed in different parts of national economies for decades, 
notably in communications networks,  but it was the Internet and IP -enabled networks that created a 
universal platform to form the foundation of the digital economy for al l sectors. The distinction 
between the Internet economy and the digital economy (though the terms are often used 
interchangeably ) rests on the difference in sectoral impact : Internet economy “refers to the 
economic activities, inputs, outputs and employmen t directly associated with the use of the 
Internet.”7 By contrast, the digital economy relies on enhanced interconnectivity of networks and 
the interoperability of digital platforms in all sectors of the economy and society  to offer convergent 
services . For example, d igital traffic can cross between  telecommunicat ions and banking networks – 
such as  in the case of payments app s running on India’s Unified Payments Interface, which enable 
funds transfers among customers and merchants using various mobile netwo rk service  providers and 
financial institutions .8 
 
“Going digital”9 is an all -encompassing shift beyond the economic sphere, which impacts society, 
culture, politics, and technological development. For this reason, governments and public bodies 
responsible  for the welfare of citizens need to understand what “going digital” entails, and what 
challenges and opportunities it offers.  
There have been numerous studies on the economic impact of the digital economy upon the GDP of 
countries. Such  attempts at quant ifying have thus far been somewhat problematic due to the lack of 
well -established measurement criteria , and thus the lack of reliable data .  An oft -cited  2011 study by 
the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the Internet accounts for 3.4% of overall GDP in the 13 
nations studied.10 In 2014 , the  OECD measured the digital economy, defined more widely as the ICT 
sector, as accounting “for 6% of total value added, 4% of employment and 12% of total fixed 
investment in the OECD area.”11 These studies provide useful benchmarks and indica tors of the 
extent of the impact, but they have proven less applicable as policy guides or models for 
governance. Studies  focus ed on measuring the impact on a sectoral level (e.g. e -commerce) or on 
non-financial metrics (e.g. th e rate of financial inclusion) offer more straightforward assessments,

 but are also hard to evaluate as a comparative analysis is impossible in the absence of a 
methodology for consistent and extendable digital data collection. This is important because th e 
choices required and the opportunity cost involved in assigning resources to the development of the 
digital economy can be significant and without a demonstrable case of impact, such resource 
diversion can be hard to justify and maintain.  
 
Digital Disru ption  
 Digital disruption occurs in various ways :  
1. Product or service substitution , such as the displacement of music cassettes and compact 
disks with streamed music online , or more starkly, the displacement of printed moto rway 
maps by GPS systems in smart phones which are now widely used to navigate drivers   
2. By-pass , whereby for example, payment no longer goes through the existing gatekeeper 
thereby eliminating demand for its services , as in the case of P2P funds transfer offered by 
TransferWise, which by -passes banks or online insurance sales platforms, which eliminate 
the need for an agent network ;  
3. Technological paradigm shift , such as cloud computing, which represents a fundamental 
change in how consumers procure, access and use IT infrastructure while offering lower 
costs and rapid scalability.  
 Cloud computing, blockchain or the Internet are what economists call a General Purpose 
Technology (GPT), meaning they bring a significant impacting shift across all sectors  of an economy 
and society  as a result of the technology’s introduction . GPTs’  rate of adoption may vary from sector 
to sector, but as economies become increasingly interconnected  they become embedded and 
ubiquitous . Classic example s of a GPT include  electricity or the combustion engine.  
The t able below describes the impact of such “game chang ing” technologies, which have been or will 
be most likely disrupting the economy  and society . The impact potential of most of these GPTs is yet 
to be fully revealed , but their applications are already bein g widely forecast likely giving rise to shifts 
in technology paradigms.

 billions of devices by providing 
seamless and continuous 
connectivity. More than just being 
faster than 3G and 4G LTE, 5G will 
“become the underlying fabric of an 
entire ecosystem of fully connect ed 
intelligent sensors and devices, 
capable of overhauling economic 
and business policies, and further 
blurring geographical and cultural 
borders.”  5G is predicted to create 
22 million jobs worldwide and USD 
12.3 trillion of revenue across a 
broad range of  industries.13 requires operators to invest heavily 
in network trials and rollouts, with 
no guarantee as to returns on 
investment. In China alone, mobile 
network operators are forecast t o 
spend a combined USD180 billion by 
2023.14 Also,  challenging will be 
sstandardizing  spectrum bands and 
network interconnectivity, both of 
which will enable the low -cost 
access and universal interoperability 
demanded by core 5G use -cases, 
and which will be  key to recouping 
investment.15 
Internet -of-Things 
and Machine -to-
Machine network s By 2020, there will be more than 20 
billion installed IoT devices around 
the world generating massive 
amounts of data. With access to this 
kind of information, industries of  all 
kinds will be able to reach new 
levels of efficiency as they add 
products, services, and 
capabilities.16 Security is a major challenge to the 
IoT as newly connected “things” 
bring about new vulnerabilities. The 
hacking of baby monitors, 
surveillance ca meras, smart fridges 
and so on exemplify the security 
threat that can only grow with the 
scale of the IoT. As the number of 
connected “things” increases, so will 
the amount of personal data 
collected, stored and transmitted 
over networks, therefore 
exacerb ating risks that such data is 
compromised.17 Moreover, as data 
can be compromised at any one 
point in the IoT ecosystem, 
stakeholders (device maker, 
platform, network provider, end -
user etc.) throughout the ecosystem 
should be vigilant and responsible 
for IoT security.  
Cloud computing  Cloud computing technology

computing are widely understood

service. Cloud services are scalable 
and on demand, accessible from all 
connected devices. They are 
changing procurement models both 
in the private and public sector and 
offer flexibility and lower costs with 
increased security features 
compared to traditional IT 
resources.  and accepted, su ccessful cloud 
adoption requires organisations to 
remove internal roadblocks by re -
training employees and rethinking 
processes, in order to successfully 
overcome the constraints of legacy 
IT infrastructure.18 
Platform (or Management) Issues  
Data analytics  Big data is the fuel of the digital 
economy and data analytics is 
essential to make data -driven 
decision making possible. Data 
analytics also aid the optimisation of 
service delivery and create 
competitive value chains in every 
industry.19  A lack of inter operability – and 
standards or guidelines that 
facilitate the adoption of common 
methodologies and data formats – 
across different platforms limits the 
impact of big data.20 
Digital identity  Digital identity schemes are largely 
biometric and state -operated  
platforms, which enable the 
identification, verification and 
authentication of citizens. As a 
cornerstone of government services, 
such initiatives allow for targeted 
public service delivery without 
intermediaries, and increased 
participation.  The creatio n of a single digital 
identity will need to accommodate 
heightened security risks from a 
centralised digital identity 
management system, which can 
become a prime target for 
cybercriminals as it establishes a 
single point of failure for the entire 
identific ation system.21 
Blockchain  Blockchain technology can optimise 
the time and costs of any 
transaction with fast, verified, and 
highly secure movement of records 
based on decentralised and publicly 
validated distributed ledger. 
Blockchain has the potential to  
enable applications that allow to A standardisation of blockchain 
technologies, or the ability for 
different blockchain technologies 
with different consensus algorithms 
to communicate with each other, is 
a missing piece of the puzzle  in the 
applicability of blockch ain.

 keep, identify and track exchanges 
and registers at minimum cost 
avoiding the potential risk of 
corruption. It allows community 
collaboration and business 
consolidation in various industries 
including payments, business 
services and logistics.22 While there have been various 
initiatives, including the formation of 
an ISO technical committee, to 
examine standardization issues 
related to blockchain, a lack of 
internationally -accepted standards 
has made firms developing 
blockchain Proof of Conce pts (PoCs) 
wary about committing to the 
technology.23 
Quantum computing  Quantum computers will become 
the sixth paradigm in computing 
replacing bits with quantum bits, 
which allow them to solve complex 
problems beyond the capabilities of 
conventional compu ters.24 This leap 
forward in computing capability will 
enhance data processing and 
pattern recognition in machine 
learning, and significantly improve 
modelling capability in drug 
development, material science, 
climate change research and AI 
development.  Development of actual quantum 
computers is still at an early stage 
due to the complexities in building 
an actual practical quantum 
computer. The quantum system 
needs to be protected from outside 
interference, yet still able to be used 
to make calculations an d churn out 
an answer.25 Current solutions 
involve features like dampeners and 
extreme cold (approaching absolute 
zero) to insulate the actual quantum 
computer chip.26 
Application (or end -user) Issues  
Cryptocurrencies  Cryptocurrencies are digital 
currencie s, where encryption 
technologies regulate the 
generation of units of currency and 
verify the transfer of funds, 
operating outside of the banking 
system. Bitcoin or Ethereum are 
well -known examples, though even 
they face public uncertainty about 
security an d operational resiliency.  The real -life values of 
cryptocurrencies are highly volatile 
as they are dependent on demand 
and supply of users. A 
cryptocurrency’s value is largely 
determined by the number of users 
and the amount of transactions that 
indicate the demand .27 In addition, 
liquidity is dependent on the 
demand and supply, where the lack

 of demand or supply may lead to a 
vicious cycle.  
Governments are still pensive on 
recognizing cryptocurrencies as a 
preferred mode of currency due to 
their inability  to regulate it.28 
Artificial Intelligence  Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables 
new form of automation combining 
robotics and machine learning. AI 
will improve the speed, quality, and 
cost of available goods and services, 
but is also likely to displace lar ge 
numbers of workers.29 In addition to the challenges AI will 
face in its application to robotics and 
autonomous vehicles, the reliance of 
AI development on data input can 
lead to AI inheriting human -
originated biasness that may limit 
the possibilities of applying AI in 
certain regards. For example, the 
dominance of white males in the AI 
industry has led to skewed 
outcomes such as AI -judged beauty 
contest that awarded mostly white 
candidates.30 
Robotics  Robots have been reshaping the 
division of labour betw een men and 
machines, and will increasingly do so 
outside of large factories as small -
scale, adaptable production 
becomes more common in 
manufacturing processes. Robots 
will have a significant role in plastics, 
medical devices, food and beverages 
and the h igh-tech industries.  A common concern among policy -
makers, workers and consumers is 
the ability to balance the economic 
and social impacts of robotics 
advancement. In Dongguan, China, a 
factory replaced 90% of its human 
workforce with machines, resulting 
in a 250% increase in productivity 
and 80% reduction in defects.31 Tax, 
liability and the displacement of 
workers are some issues that need 
to be addressed amid the co -
existence of robots and humans in 
the workplace.  
3D printing  (Additive 
manufacturing)  3D printing makes products via an 
additive layer -by-layer approach and

 large inventories, lowers labour 
costs and trans portation needs.32 By 
2025, 3D printing can have an 
impact of USD 577 billion annually.33  and even counter -productive. In 
addition, the ability to use 3D 
printing technology to manufacture 
proprietary items, as well as illegal 
or controlled items such as guns, 
could trigger the need to regulate 
access to machin es and materials, 
keeping costs high and out of reach

Autonomous vehicles  Enabled by 5G and sensor networks, 
autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a 
significant technological innovation 
as they will increase energy 
efficiency and have a sign ificant 
impact on the labour market both in 
terms of job loss/creation and time 
savings.  Safety and accountability concerns 
go hand -in-hand. While a key factor 
driving the movement towards 
autonomous driving is its  promise of 
reducing safety hazards, the new 
technology also presents new safety 
risks, especially in early stages of 
deployment. However, without the 
presence of a human driver, it is 
difficult to pin the responsibility on 
any one person (e.g. the car 
manufacturer, owner, software 
developer etc. ) for any accident that 
may be caused by an autonomous 
vehicle.35 
 
What is New about the Digital Economy ? 
The digital economy is built of f two key network developments  of the Internet and IP -enabled 
communications systems – such as mobile networks, electro nic payments systems and public service 
networks:  
1. Interconnectivity  of networks means that traffic can travel across and between networks. 
This enables economies of scale as the fixed costs of infrastructure rollout are spread across 
a greater level of out put bring ing about a fall in unit costs.  In the early days of networks, 
resistance to interconnection was a way to maintain a dominant position, but following

 regulatory intervention, the network effect of interconnection in the market -as-a-whole 
could ope rate.  
2. Interoperability  of operating platforms means that traffic can run effectively across different 
types of networks (e.g., from telecoms to banking to educational to health networks and so 
on). This enables economies of scope, as fixed costs are spread  across a wider range of 
output of different products and services.36 However, it is still the case in many markets that 
inter -operability is resisted to maintain exclusivity and market dominance. Regulators need 
to decide if intervention will disrupt innov ation or will accelerate the network effects.  
Economies of scale  arise  from the network effects of having everybody come online, while 
economies of scope is what fuels innovation and offers cross -fertilisation of opportunity across 
sectors, hence the emer gence of FinTech  (finance+technology) and agritech 
(agriculture+technology) , among others . Economies of scale and of scope create a virtuous cycle by 
driving down costs, increasing user choice of products and services and, in turn, stimulating market  
innov ation and economic growth .37 A good example is the completely new combination of Artificial 
Intelligence and high -speed broadband.38 AI works through apps and algorithms applied to data , and 
creates innovative products and services in several industries from  manufacturing to entertainment . 
Broadband provides the network capacity and speeds required , and operates based on economies of 
scale .  
 
Challenges for Policy Makers and Regulators  
From a policy maker and regulator’s point of view, th e emergence of the di gital economy  changes 
the landscape.  As industries, markets, and pricing strategies are transformed, the traditional 
industry -specific approach to policy setting will increasingly fail  to enable expected economic growth 
and social development outcomes. How  to advance financial inclusion without focusing on 
connectivity, social media, identity profiling? How to successfully advance effective  universal 
education without consulting data analytics, behaviour profiling, content delivery, and collaborativ e 
commun ication? Even more challenging is the job confronting the regulator with the traditional risk 
management -oriented approach failing to deliver expected regulatory control  or provide adequate

38 It is a combination that has given rise to what has been termed ‘Industry 4.0.’ It reflects a shift in economic value from 
manufacturing (2.0) and services (3.0) to information and intellectual property. This needs some cla rification. The growing 
importance of ‘data’ as market intelligence or as patents for innovative services or as programmed i nformation for 
machine tools, has been around since the industrial revolution, and was greatly accelerated as econo mies shifted from  a 
focus on manufacturing to services. This was widely known by the 1980s as the rise of the Informatio n Society. However, 
more recent advances in AI and in broadband technologies have lifted economies to a ‘Next Generation ’ level.    14 
 consumer protection. Is Uber a taxi company or a software company?  Is Alipay a bank or non-bank  
financial institution, or is it a technology (or e -commerce) company?  
 
Moreover, what is a ‘monopoly’ and what is adequate market compe tition in such cross sectoral 
growth? Previously -dominant regulated companies have lost gr ound to a new wave of ‘next 
generation’ companies. Market definitions that were vital to regulators when identifying “significan t 
market power” are increasingly failing to work , or work effectively . As an editorial in the London 
Financial Times aptly put i t, “Competition regulators need to arm themselves with new concepts. On 
mergers, rather than concentration in particular markets, the focus should shift to the potential fo r 
customer lock -in.”39 Two further important points are raised : “Ensuring the interop erability of 
technology will be key ….  and the need for regulators to take account of the role of dynamic pricing 
algorithms which effectively “eliminate the very notion of market prices, and with it the consumer 
surplus.”40 
 
Furthermore , in the digital wor ld governments can deliver certain public services in a more targeted 
way at minimal cost with increased agility and impact. Once the digital infrastructure is in place – 
such as the broadband network, a digital identity and authentication system  – new ser vices can be 
added at a much lower cost. Governments can also experiment and innovate relying on the 
aggregate demand and direct feedback of citizens in an environment where location is immaterial, 
and the cost and methods of communication have been drasti cally altered. This increased ability to 
deliver innovative public services repr esent an opportunity for policy makers to create public good, 
at the same time requires improved agility and responsiveness from public administrations, 
particularly in the fac e of changing citizen expectations.  
 
What Does the Government Need to Do?  
For the policy maker , the opportunity cost in decision making and resource allocation changes 
substantially, as do the social development and economic growth targets that can be set . For the

40 Consumer surplus is the notion that some consumer s will pay less than the price they would be prepared to pay because 
the market sets just one prevailing price that attracts the marginal consumer. Dynamic pricing can, in theory, charge each 
consumer exactly the maximum they are prepared to pay, which wil l differ from one consumer to the next. Dynamic 
pricing algorithms rely upon unprecedented access to data about consumer behaviour, right down to th e preferences of 
individuals expressed through their social media accounts, with the result that by using this data, economic value moves 
away from consumers and to producers. In one sense, it is a passive loss of value to consumers as it  consists of price 
differentials they were willing to pay, but it also represents a real shift in significant market po wer, an d regulators are 
usually charged with protecting consumer interests.  15 
 regulator, a mindset shift becomes the fundamental requirement, moving from risk -manager to 
development enabler . Such developments need to occur at each layer:  
 Develop policies towards a digital economy based upon Open Government data sharing an d 
Big Data analytics, including establishing data protection regulations and then ensuring that 
such regulations are kept updated and relevant, particularly as they cut across ever more 
sectors and services.  
 Ensure that critically important networks, such as telecoms and banking systems, 
interconnect , and that platforms become interoperable so that apps and services work 
across all systems , and are accessible by all, as much as possible at any time.  
 Develop smart security policies – in this case, cybersecu rity policies – to protect critical 
national information infrastructure s (CNII) , and promote rapid information sharing , including 
transnationally,  about cyber -attacks.  
 Create cross -agency (whole -of-government) frameworks (and agencies) for effective polici es 
and regulations so as to enable the development and delivery of government and social 
services, and to incentivise innovation and investment, while at the same time protecting 
consumer interests.  
In Chapter 5 , ways to implement these policies are recomm ended, but from any of these  
developments to occur, p olicies need to reinforce the development of digital awareness, skills, 
knowledge and training, especially among government staff to manage the growth of the digital 
economy.  These points are developed a nd further illustrated in Chapter 2 . 16 
 CHAPTER 2: Regulatory and Policy Challenges  
Existing policy tools and governance frameworks have been outdated by the rapid emergence of the 
digital economy leaving policy makers and regulators constantly challenged in  an ‘arms race of 
applied  knowledge’ to try and stay up to date with the pace of change.41 This chapter outlines and 
considers  the disruptive digital challenges confronting policy makers – such as privacy, security, 
surveillance,  sovereignty, data protectio n, and cross -border data flows. Examples of each of th ese 
are provided in Chapter 4  with respect to Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to illustrate the impact of 
emerging technologies on regulatory and policy frameworks  in particular country contexts . 
 
This c hapter first considers the need for, and approaches towards, investment in a national 
broadband infrastructure. The attention then turns to policy and regulatory challenges, notably the 
networking benefits that accrue to a digital economy from either encou raging or regulating 
networks to become inter -operable, and the applications that arise from that, such as sharing -
economy apps that work across different mobile network platforms. The data generated by these 
networks and apps is becoming the currency of t he digital economy, and that raises new challenges 
for data privacy, data security and data sovere ignty, which are the subject of the final part of the 
chapter.  
 
Creating a  National Broadband Network  
Creating a national  high -speed broadband infrastructure is a major financial and regulatory 
challenge  for most developing countries , even though the necessity for an accessible and reliable 
broadband network is acknowledged . In the Asia -Pacific there are now several alternative models to 
consider. In the Austra lian and Malaysian  models, governments have combined a state subsidy with 
a broadband network contract to the dominant national telecommunication carrier, with ta rget 
penetration rates to be met. Singapore  has taken a different route by separating the unde rlying 
broadband network of dark fibre (NetCo) which received a state subsidy, from the wholesale 
business (OpCo), from the retail business which is a competitive market. Competing operators can 
still invest in their own networks if they choose to do so.42 In Thailand , the government is proposing 
a national holding company  to build and operate the country’s national fibre assets  on a wholesale 
basis , a policy that risks reducing competition and slow ing down broadband infrastructure roll -out.

73d1 -11e7 -aca6 -c6bd07df1a3c  
42 In Malaysia, utilities are licensed to lease out their dark fibre, and in many countries private cor porations can do likewise . 17 
 The contributio n of ICTs to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam is around 13%,43 6%44 and 6%45 
respectively. This is one indicator of the level of growth of the digital economy, and although it i s not 
a measure of how ICTs are used or who has access to them, nevertheless the ITU’s fixed broadband 
penetration rates track them quite closely: Malaysia (10%), Thailand (8.5%) and Vietnam (6.5%). 
More telling, however, are the penetration rates of broadband mobile: Malaysia (58%), Thailand 
(80%) and Vietnam (31%). Because Thaila nd was less developed in fixed lines, mobile substitution 
rates galloped ahead. As is true in most Asian countries, broadband mobile is now the primary 
means of access to the Internet, although for large enterprise usage, such as banks, fixed broadband  
remains essential.46 
  
Asian economies can be typically grouped into three ‘clusters’ of wealth and development: low 
income economies, lower -middle income emerging economies, and upper -middle income 
economies.47 In most cases network access parallels such incom e clusters quite closely. Malaysia is 
an upper -middle income country, where in the majority of the population can access the Internet , 
similar in this regard to Brunei. Thailand, while in a similar national income bracket, has more limited 
accessibility and  in this regard,  can be grouped together with Vietnam (which belongs to the lower -
middle income class) and the Philippines. The third cluster of countries – such as Indonesia, 
Myanmar, Lao s and Cambodia  – is characterized by low -income and low access . The obvious outlier  
within ASEAN is Singapore, which acts as a benchmark for the digital future, notably in three ways: 
(i) the degree of interconnectedness of the economy and society, (ii) the coordination and 
consistency of policy and regulation across gover nment agencies, with leadership and coordination 
coming directly from the Prime Minister’s Office indicating the priority assigned to the digital 
economy, and (iii) the promotion and clear articulation of a ‘Smart Nation’  set of objectives , 
combining new d igital technologies with policy adjustments and flexible regulations, that in turn 
promote innovation in business models. But if connectivity and digitalization raise the prospect of 
accelerating economic growth, and of potentially leapfrogging development  stages, then how these 
approaches are next mapped out, integrated and deployed becomes strategically extremely 
important. This is explored further in Chapter 4  which looks at the di gital infrastructure policies of 
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam .

 Interoper ability  of Platforms  
The challenge for policy makers beyond financing the communications infrastructure, is to promote 
the interoperability of network platforms so apps and services can  be shared across them. Policy 
makers and regulators will need to make decisions about when it is in the public interest to require 
the interoperability of platforms, and which apps must be allowed through. For example,  
interoperability among mobile money services can drive adoption and financial inclusion as the 
number of tr ansactions increase if consumers can transfer money using an application run by a 
telecom service provider to a customer of a competing tel ecom service provider, or a customer using 
a commercial bank. Mandating interoperability, however, runs the risk of d iscouraging invest ment 
from players and may limit the  growth of nascent busines s models .48 As with interconnection, there 
are always two stages with interoperability:  
1. Determine w hen to require it of the platforms . Governments can engage industry players to  
examine market conditions and maturity level s in order to understand both the benefits and 
risks associated with mandating interoperability . 
2. Determine when to permit blocking, for example of child pornography or hate speech, or 
throttling of particular ty pes of traffic for the purposes of network management.49 Such 
decisions should be made about censorship and net neutrality issues, keeping in min d the 
benefits of free flow  of data for the development of the digital economy.  
 
The Sharing Economy  
An oft -quoted observation about the sharing economy sheds light on its transformative impact on 
the economy: “ Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most 
popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable ret ailer, has no inventory. And 
Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. ”50 
The sharing economy is an economic model based on the  borrow ing or rent ing of assets owned by 
someone else, but not fully utili sed all the time  (Figure 2, left side) . The rise of the sharing economy 
is taking advantage of the shift from client -server to peer -to-peer (P2P) Internet architectures  – good 
examples are P2P ride-sharing apps such as Grab and Uber, or accommodation sharing sites such as 
Airbnb a nd Couchsurfing (although the emerging opportunities go well beyond these examples, see 
Figure 2 , right side). Challenges posed by the sharing economy are largely on (1) the conflict

 between traditional industries and newly emerging platforms, (2) the reli ability of reputation ratings 
in the shared economy, and (3) consumer protection i ssues – such as data protection, including the 
selling of user data by platforms, liability and insurance.  
 
Figure 2 : The Sharing Economy  
 
 
In the case of ride -sharing apps,  policy makers are under pressure from traditional transport 
companies to protect them against these more flexibl e services, while regulators are under pressure 
to ensure that laws are not being broken. In Singapore, new laws are clarifying the conditions 
required for these services to operate, including minimum periods of driving experience,51 the 
vetting of drivers and appropriate insurance. The result is a traditional taxi service augmented, bu t 
not replaced, by a thriving ride-sharing service,  with many drivers using multiple apps and traditional 
taxi companies changing business and pricing models to compete effectively . The flexibility shown in 
Singapore seems to be working, and illustrates the need for consultation and flexibility, but also f or 
timely p olicy adjustments.  
 
Privacy and Data Protection  
Data is, as the saying goes, the currency of the digital economy. In a digital economy, economic val ue 
shifts increasingly to data, as discussed in Chapter 1. There are several steps involved: (1) collec ting 
data and conforming to the regulations governing that collection, (2) storing and then processing th e 
data, abiding by restrictions that may apply to non -identification of individuals within any given 
sample of data, and (3) using the data in ways that co nform to the conditions of its collection. Step 1 
involves two types of data protection, (1a) the protection of personal privacy, and (1b) the securit y 
of the data collected.

Personal Data Privacy  
Personal data privacy laws have been passed in many count ries, the most common element being 
the need to seek the permission of citizens before data about them can be collected. The purpose of 
the collection must be specified, usually with a commitment to destroy the data once it has been 
used – unless the use i s ongoing, such as a credit card number for e -commerce, or a social security 
number for frequent claims. Data may still be used if seeking permission is not feasible but is judg ed 
to be in the best interests of the individual, such as medical data when a p erson is incapacitated. 
Malaysia has such a law and a Personal Data Privacy Commission to enforce it, but there is no such 
legislation in Thailand or in Vietnam.  
 
Data Protection  
Data protection (Step 1b) refers to the security of the data and the potent ial loss or misuse of data, 
often involving cybercrime. Step 2 is about processing the data, and often this is outsourced by the  
data controller to a third -party. Privacy laws typically hold the data controller liable for any breaches 
that may occur, but i f this data is stored and processed overseas it may be difficult to monitor or 
enforce the law. The issue of ‘localisation’ is examined below. An associated problem of data 
processing is intended or unintended identification of individuals. Much of the dat a being harvested 
today comes not from individuals giving their consent on websites or in written documents, but from 
a myriad of sources, including social media, locational data associated with the use of smartphones,  
and online browsing. Despite data con trollers needing to anonymise data, the reality is that using Big 
Data sources, algorithms can, if they are so programmed, identify individuals by multiple 
triangulations of information. However, if national security agencies are the most likely to use suc h 
methods, they are typically exempt from personal data privacy laws. In some cases, for example 
Malaysia and Singapore, all government agencies are exempt, while in Hong Kong the law includes 
government agencies and generally precludes them from sharing p ersonal information between 
agencies.  
 
Step 3 is about data usage and this is where the impact of Big Data analytics is proving a game -
changer, and a challenge to regulatory thinking. Dynamic pricing algorithms are being developed 
which can all but “elimin ate the very notion of market prices, and with it the consumer surplus.”52 By 
charging different prices to different consumers, consumers willing to pay more do pay more, and

 economic value shifts from consumers to vendors. In one sense, it is a passive los s of value to 
consumers as it consists of price differentials they were willing to pay, but it also represents a r eal 
shift in significant market power, and regulators are usually charged with protecting consumer 
interests.  
 
Cybersecurity  
It must be recogn ized up front that  interoperability can be something of a gift to cyber -criminals, 
and this poses inevitable and important problems for regulators  – now and moving forward . 
Cybersecurity has already grow n from a nuisance to a direct threat to critical nati onal information 
infrastructure , and it is an issue which will continue, and will continue to evolve as the networks and 
platforms continue to evolve, both in their architecture and their usage . If everything is connected it 
is not difficult to install mal ware, ransomware, spyware and other malicious code which can rapidly 
spread , exactly like a virus . 
  
Further, much of the data generated in an Internet -of-Things (IoT) environment will relate to private 
citizens and their usage of devices, websites, medica l facilities, video, etc. The traditional approach 
to personal privacy protection is to require data collectors to obtain consent, but this becomes 
impractical in a world saturated with IoTs , and where the usefulness of data is often not so much in 
its raw  collected form, but in its collated and analysed result – tracing such use back to the original 
consent rapidly becomes impractical.  But there are important opportunities as well. Arrange ments 
to have commercial organis ations, such as public utilities, sh are data, and for government agencies 
to make data available for commercial developers and other members of the public, can incentivise 
apps developers to produce socially useful and sometimes economically profitable services. Such a 
policy was advocated b y U.S. President Obama in 2009 as the Open Government Initiative,53 and has 
been championed by the World Bank.54 
 
Storing and making use of that data requires more and more sophisticated IT systems, cybersecurity 
notwithstanding. Decisions need to be made wh ether to store it in a database in -house, or to use a 
cloud computing system (be that a private cloud, public cloud or a  hybrid  system) . However, making 
these decisions is probably less of a challenge than recruiting staff with the requisite IT skills t o 
manage them, especially if the public sector cannot compete on salaries with the private sector, and 
if there is a national shortage of persons with those IT skills.

Sovereignty and Cross -border Data F lows  
Data can be stored anywhere on the planet. It doe s not need to be stored locally even if the data is 
generated and collected locally. The exponential growth in international broadband submarine 
capacity – by 2016 there were 30 high -capacity submarine cables with an estimated designed 
capacity of over 380  Terabytes serving ASEAN countries, with more cables planned  55 – means data 
transfers are fast and low cost , and the value associated with these data flows – such as orders and 
payments for goods, remittances, streamed media sales –  increasingly underpins  world trade. If 
policy makers can promote such value -chain  development, and regulators can enable participation  – 
for example, many central banks are now studying whether and how best to encourage the use of 
cloud computing for the FinTech sector and to permit the data to be stored outside the country –  
the impact on GDP can be significant: 0.5% in the case of Malaysia, 1.5% in Thailand and 6.6% in 
Vietnam, according to World Bank estimates for 2016.  
  
Sovereignty Issues  
The challenges arise due to extra -jurisdictional issues , such as domestic earnings that flow overseas 
and may be by -passing local taxation authorities . One response to this trend has been an insistence 
in some countries that data generated locally should be stored locally (‘ data localisati on’ or ‘data 
residency’ ) and made available for either tax assessment or security reasons  – or both . China and 
Vietnam require the localisa tion of data, as does Indonesia, of ISPs serving the local market directly. 
Indonesia’s tax department has plans to r equire a permanent local presence ( regulation no. SE -
04/PJ/201756) to ensure taxation can be levied.57 Localisation is usually not welcomed by foreign 
companies because it adds significantly to the cost of doing business in a country that has only a 
small market. Also, a purely nationalistic response , if the consequences are discriminatory,  will also 
be a challenge to the norms of world trade. At the same time, developing countries need effici ent, 
effective and equitable ways to raise revenues from taxes, customs and excise duties. If regional 
assemblies of governments could harmonise approaches to the levy and collection of taxes, possibly 
as aspects of trade agreements, this would be a huge s tep towards avoiding beggar -thy-neighbour 
policies.

 Cross -Border Data Transfer Issues  
It is the norm to place restrictions on the overseas transfer of personal data under personal data 
privacy laws (see above), such as sensitive financial data held by ban ks or medical data. And when 
the data is transferred overseas, there remains a question of how to monitor its use and how to 
enforce domestic laws on overseas data controllers. Each country has its own legislation and 
regulations governing the transfer and  use of data. In some countries, an enterprise needs to 
appoint and register a data controller who may be held legally personally responsibl e for any data 
breach; in other s, enterprises must  be licensed for each category of data they are handling. These 
variations in laws add to the costs and complexities of doing business, and should be reviewed with 
cross -border h armonis ation in mind.58 
 
Closely -related security issues include applying Anti -Money Laundering/Counter -Financing of 
Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulati ons, detecting cybercrimes and anti -terrorist surveillance (see above).  
This raises an important issue; given that the UN adopted a Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime  (UNTOC ) in 2000, to address ways to overcome the hurdles of jurisdictional  
differences, it should be possible for regional associations of countries, such as ASEAN, APEC and 
SAARC to work more closely together, alongside international agencies such as Interpol  – and its 
Asian regional equivalent ASEANPOL – and the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber 
Threats  (IMPACT). The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty ( MLAT ) exists between some countries, but it 
is not universal and is in need of a revamp to meet the demands of the digital economy era. 
Cybercrime and cyber -crimin als and terrorists recognise no boundaries and the Internet’s digital 
technologies, notably through social media and the use of end -to-end encryption, are making it a 
game of catch -up for regulators.  
 
The answers to meeting all the challenges listed above  inevitably vary from country to country, as 
each frame their approach according to the socio -economic and political economy conditions that 
prevail domestically. Chapter 3 looks at these alternative ways of framing policies towards the digital 
economy.

 CHAPTER 3: Driving Digital Opportunity: Enabling Transformation and 
Seeding Capacity  
 
Approaches to Digital D evelopment  
Every government works within the context of its legacy institutions, policy making processes and its 
socio -economic conditions . According ly, the approaches towards creating a policy framework for the 
digital economy vary  quite significantly even among countries with similar level s of economic 
development and access to innovative technologies. Some of the different approaches adopted , and 
how they may  impact upon the digital economy , are illustrated below  with three brief case  studies : 
(1) Government vs . private sector leadership  in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US); 
(2) Top-down vs bottom -up approach es in Singapore and Hong Kong; and (3) Innovation vs 
regulation  in China and Japan.  
 
Government -led EU vs Private Sector  led US  
The European Union  and the United States  take different approaches to who is driving polic y and 
regulatory  change for the digital economy . The European Commission (EC) of the EU is  not merely  a 
regional coordinating body, but often the lead advocate in regulating emerging digital technologies, 
with Brussels adopting a government and regulatory -led approach to digital development. This can 
be seen, for exa mple , in the areas of privacy, data protection, net neutrality and regulating the 
search engine market . The EU takes the position that regulating the digital economy needs to 
happen through frameworks set and developed by national governments . The EU’s Dat a Protection 
Directive established common rules for creating a high standar d of protection for European citizen’s 
personal data both at home and when transferred across borders – these protections will be further 
enhanced when the General Data Protection R egulation (GDPR) comes into force in 2018.59 To 
control the data handling practices  of the large US technology vendors  in particular , the EU -US 
Privacy Shield was negotiated  following a successful legal challenge  to the previous Safe Harbour 
Agreement ,60 which illustrates the importance of decisions by  the European Court of Justice in 
shaping the global discourse on privacy and data protection regulations.

transatlantic data flows, http://europa.eu/rapid/press -release_IP -16-2461_en.htm  25 
 By contrast , in the United States it is the private sector which leads much of the digital regulatory 
agenda, with  the government seeking to create an enabling environment for  private sector  
initiatives . For example, t he majority of sharing  economy apps were first launched and allowed to 
flourish in the US , including Uber, Lyft, A irbnb, and TaskRabbit, and the app-based companies  and 
regulators work together to balance innovation with the public interest.61 In the case of data privacy 
regulation, and in  contrast to the  European approach  that places more direct emphasis upon 
compliance and the risk of penalt ies, in 2016 the US Department of Justice took Apple to court to 
gain backdoor access to the iPhone of a suspected terrorist, which the company refused to grant in 
order to protect users’ data, security and privacy.62 
  
Whether t he American  approach to digi tal technology policy tends to be more enabling and nimble, 
responding to signals from the market, with policy and regulation being tools to foster or enable 
innovation a nd market growth (as opposed to stability) , or whether this is due to the clustering 
effects of locations such as Silicon Valley, is open to argument. What is clear is that the dynamic o f 
the US market is unmatched elsewhere . This further results in the reg ulatory  interests of Am erican  
tech nology  companies being advocated  by the same the me chanisms the US has traditionally used 
to further it s business and trade agendas, namely American chambers of commerce, business 
associations and the US Commercial Service . 
 
Top-down Singapore vs Bottom -up Hong Kong   
Singapore and Hong Kong offer a somewha t similar case study of contrast s in digital development, 
except in this case the difference is much more on how digital initiatives are implemented  and 
deployed, rather than on the framing . Once again, both approaches can be seen to have their 
benefits. Singapore , for example,  was globally the first country  to allow driverless cars on its streets. 
With urban transportation congestion becoming a major issue the world over, t he Ministry of 
Transport set up the Committee on Autonomous Road Transport for Singa pore (CARTS)63 in 2014 to 
create a strategy for launching autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the city state. With the guiding support 
of the Prime Minister’s Office and the head of Singapore’s civil service, the country’s R&D umbrella 
agency, A*STAR, and the Land  Transportation Authority (LTA) launched the Singapore Autonomous

 Vehicle Initiative (SAVI) to explore the technological possibilities that AVs can create for Singapo re. 
The initiative has been one of Singapore’s ‘big bets’ in digital transformation, with enabling AV a s 
part of the broader government strategy for establishing alternative transportation to deal with the 
limitation s of a growing population and scarce supplies of land  for development . Accordingly, SAVI 
has been implemented  in a top -down fashio n by forward -looking government agencies that are 
coordinated at the very top of the political chain to serve  long -term policy goals .64 Hence, being first 
‘out onto the streets ’ was an important benchmark and validation for the government.  
  
By comparison, Hong Kong’s digital economy develop s in a bottom -up manner with a variety of 
initiatives from diverse stakeholders  such as technologists, academics, and companies emerging 
competitively, both as experiments and responses to perceived market demand. In cont rast to 
Singapore, for example, the use of the existing infrastructure such as lamp posts to which to attach  
sensors and WiFi and other communications equipment for AV and IoTs, is stalled owing to concerns 
by the relevant bureau that power supplies from o ther utilities might disrupt operations and add to 
costs. Such inter -agency issues stand in stark contrast to the unified approach of the Singapore 
government. But the Hong Kong approach does have the advantage of encouraging independent 
initiatives. An ea rly but indicative example is that of the Hong Kong Internet Exchange  (HKIX) , the 
first Internet Exchange Point in Asia , established in 1995 on the campus of the Chinese University of 
Hong Kong. HKIX enables autonomous systems to interconnect with one anot her and exchange 
traffic. By the summer of 2017 , the IXP was interconnecting  277 participants , including over -the-top 
service providers ( OTTs ), telecom service providers , universities and cloud service providers; and has 
up to 780 Gbps per minute total tra ffic.65 HKIX not only helps to keep intra -Asian Internet traffic 
with in Asia, but has also enabled Hong Kong to become one of the most important Internet hubs in 
Asia by attracting all major technology and content providers.  Hong Kong is a gateway for  
inter national data centres, with easy access China , and providing a useful communications and 
financial hub for Chinese tech companies  wanting  to expand overseas . The government is keen on 
such investors, and  encourages  the industry by providing access to land for over 50 operational data 
centres – the industry’s projected revenue by 2020 is USD 1.39 billion.66 Hong Kong has remained an 
outlier in international connectivity over recent years, with the Asia Cloud Computing Association 
(ACCA) noting a 90% year -on-year growth and more than five times the capacity of second -ranked

 Singapore in its annual Cloud Readiness Index rankings.67 According to the ACCA, Hong Kong ranked 
first among Asian economies  on international connectivity and datacentre risk, and second on 
broadband quality, power grid, green policy and sustainability, and privacy.  Just as Singapore is a 
gateway to South East Asia, Hong Kong has long been a gateway to mainland China and a major 
transit  point for all Asian traffic to and from the US. 
 
Innovat ive China vs Regulat ed Japan  
With the private sector requiring  both regulatory certainty ( to underwrite investment ) and 
regulatory freedom ( to foster innovation), the relentless pace of technological change is challenging 
policy  makers and increasing unce rtainty about which regulatory approach works best  in the fast-
changing digital economy landscape : clearer guidelines that protect privacy, investments, IP, and so 
on, or a more laissez -faire regulatory environment that sponsor s the fastest, strongest, mos t 
innovative, most efficient . As in the cases above , China and Japan present interestingly different 
attitudes and approaches to how government and the private sector can work together to enable , 
empower or over see and manage the pace of innovation.  
 
In Ch ina, innovation in the digital payments industry has flourished like perhaps nowhere else in the 
world as key public and private sector actors rapidly and exponentially grow digital payment 
ecosystems that increasingly are able to touch on all aspects of l ife by combing a variety of digital 
technologies, ubiquitous  mobile  connectivity, and advanc ed data analytics, by leveraging all existing 
e-commerce and social network  platfor ms. Digital payments have grown rapidly from about 3.5% of 
all retail transaction s in China in 2010, to a conservatively estimated 17% in 2015. Combined , the 
value of payments transacted via Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat , have risen from less than  
USD 81 bill ion in 2012 to an estimated USD 2.9 trillion in 2016 – a 20 -fold incre ase in four years.68 
The growth of the digital payment ecosystem was enabled by the government’s “wait and see” 
approach to regulation which allows for  innovation by industry participants within informal limits,  
under careful supervision by the relevant reg ulators , creat ing new business opportunities and 
increas ing financial inclusion. From an international business perspective, this threatens a high 
degree of regulatory uncertainty, but for Chinese capital it is a well -understood environment.

Chinese Digi tal Payments Industry  
China has essentially replaced cash with smartphone -based digital payments apps in the r etail 
ecosystem  between 2014 and 2017. Richard Lim, Managing Director of venture capital firm GSR 
ventures said: “From a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important 
innovations that has happened first in China, and a t the moment it’s only in China. ”69 In 2016, 
China’s mobile payments hit  USD 5.5 trillion, roughly 50 times the size of the USD 112 billion 
market  in the United Sta tes. The number of total global transact ions per day via WeChat and 
Alipay is expected to surpass Visa and MasterCard  in 2018.70 As China’s online payments 
infrastruct ure is centred around these private smartphone -based payments network, companies 
involved in trade with China will need to create separate structures to link them with the 
international payments system currently dominated by credit cards .  
 
By contrast, Japan has a more risk -averse and regulation -centric approach to managing  
technological chan ge coupled with strong government involvement and a top -down approach. This 
has resulted in a curious mix of coexisting legacy technology and advanced high -tech solutions , while 
Japan has been through a so -called ‘lost decade’ of competitiveness.71 On the one hand, Japan is 
aspiring to be the “the world’s most advanced IT nation” with long -term strategic plans in place, and 
well -earned  leadership in network performance and spectrum allocation for mobile services. On the 
other hand, certain core issues remain  unresolved such as the interoperability of cloud services with 
legacy technology, and the international accessibility of Japanese payment platforms.72 
   
The failure of d igital payments to take off in Japan can be attributed to this risk -averse regulatory 
approach by the government coupled with Japan being an early adopter of advanced technology 
almost two decades ago. In the early 2000s, Japanese flip phones could already be used to pay at 
stores  and offered mobile wallet services , 73 but ironically, their advanced functionality resulted in 
Japan bec oming a  technology laggard when it c ame to interoperable smartphone adoption , and 
without a broader ecosystem driving payments usage, digital payments have  been slow to take off .

 Cash use still dominate s, and sec urity concerns about digital payments have held adoption back  – 
only 19% of payments are cashless (including credit cards). 74 The g overnment is  offering  subsidies  
for the purchase of cashless payment facilities  by businesses , including terminals for credit  cards and 
other smart cards, to ease foreign tourists ’ use of card -based payments during the 2020 Tokyo 
Olympics. A more forward -looking, but still painfully slow step compared to China, is that by  2020, 
rough ly 60% of Japanese banks will allow developers  into their systems to access users' account 
information through open APIs  (Application Programming Interfaces) .75 
 
Other Digital Transformation Strategies that Provide Global Benchmarks  
Beyond the trade -offs highlighted above, different approaches to digit al economy planning and 
deployment have created some widely known initiatives which show the transformation of digital 
disruption into a powerful contributor to economic and social development in the form of better 
public service s delivery , faster economic  growth, increased financial inclusion , and so on . It is worth 
briefly highlighting some of these global examples before examining  in Chapter 4  the way in which 
select Southeast Asian states are beginning their own transformation journeys.

 Box 1: Eston ia: A Digital Society for Digital C itizens  
Having faced severe cyberwarfare in 2007 and fearing such attacks might happen again,76 Estonia 
decided to “put the country into the cloud”, to enable public administration to continue operating 
in the event of a s ubsequent attack, by utilizing digital infrastructure beyond the geographical 
boundaries of the country. This mentality fuels Estonia’s “Government as a Service” programmes  
and digital public services provision. Electronic identities ( e-IDs) enable citizen s to access 99% of 
state services online , such as paying bills, filing taxes and accessing medical records, which has 
created significant time and cost savings by eliminating the need for paperwork and physical 
travel.77  The ubiquitous use of e -signatures is estimated to save the Estonian economy 
approximately 2% of GDP each year.78 Somewhat uniquely, t he country has opened its digital 
infrastructure to foreigners through its e -residency programme, which allows them to apply for 
the same e -ID cards, and acce ss to e -services, such as seamless business registration where SMEs 
can enjoy 0% corporate tax when they reinvest corporate profits back into the company.79  
 
Box 2: India: A Digital Identity Platform to Build On  
Aadhaar, India’s biometric digital identity  scheme ,80 has enrolled 1.16 billion people between 
2010 and August 2017.81 The Indian government considers Aadhaar as one of the key initiatives 
under the Digital India programme and a “strategic policy tool for social and financial inclusion, 
public sector  delivery reforms, managing fiscal budgets, increas ing convenience and promot ing 
hassle -free people -centric governance.”82 The Aadhaar authentication platform is widely used by 
the private sector, as well , including  verification firms in business services, banks , and 
telecommunica tions companies83 – mobile  operators were orde red to  re-verify their subscribers 
with Aadhaar -based eKYC  by March 2018.84 Aadhaar also provides authentication for the Unified 
Payments Interface (UPI), created by the National Payment C orporation of India. The single 
interface platform is used by digital payments applications, which have rapidly sprung up since 
November 2016 built by technology companies such as WhatsApp, banks, and the government 
itself.85

 Box 3: Kenya: Financial Incl usion via Mobile P hones  
Kenya’s M -Pesa is one of the early success stories in mobile money services launched in 2007 by 
telco Safaricom. The money transfer service relied on cheap mobile phones and an extensive 
agent network , and transformed bill payments (including airtime top -ups) and person -to-person 
(P2P) domestic remittances. According to the GSMA, these transaction types accounted globally 
for 96% of the volume and 87% of the val ue in 2015 in the case of M -Pesa -like providers.86 
M-Pesa’s two core innov ations have been proximity and simplicity  made possible by large agent 
networks and simplified account opening processes . Customers have massively embraced the 
ability to access financial services close to home without complex administrative barriers, whic h 
have significantly increased financial inclusion. At the most basic level, low -cost communications 
platforms have enabled this, aided by a network of disperse d nodes for instant transact ions.87 
 
Nonetheless, despite these innovations, the M-Pesa model  does not necessarily offer clear -cut 
solutions other countries can directly copy. There have been several cases where governments or 
private sector stakeholders failed to replicate the success of these platforms, services and 
products when  they launched them in different regulatory regimes and socio -economic settings.  
For example, M -Pesa, which has been highly successful in promoting mobile banking in East 
Africa, but failed in South Africa where a much higher percentage of the population already have 
bank acc ounts, and the perception of the service was more focused upon the financially -more 
secure middle class.88 In a different context, an attempt to introduce a national ID scheme in 2010 
had to scrapped in the UK due to public antipathy, the lack of trust and privacy concerns by the 
public.89 Governments and the private sector need to understand the context in which they build 
a digital economy , and they build their own solutions based on well -defined policy choices and 
many of the building blocks defined in thi s paper.

CHAPTER 4: Digital Economy Planning in Asia: Malaysia, Thailand and 
Vietnam  
This chapter reviews  how  the governments  of Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam  are aligning their 
existing strategies to enable the digital economy , and the  frameworks they  have  developed and 
implemented as a part of their national digital agendas . Essential to any digital agenda is a 
broadband infrastructure. From Table 2 it is evident that despite its higher GDP per capita, Malaysia 
does only slightly better than Thailand in terms of fixed broadband infrastructure, but suffers from 
proportionately higher prices, and trails Thailand in terms of broadband mobile. Vietnam lags the 
others, with relatively high fixed broadband prices, but does better in broadband mobile. Interne t 
speeds, as measured here by data from Netflix, show little difference between Malaysia and 
Thailand. At the time of writing, Netflix is not available in Vietnam.

Malaysia  
Malaysia is a market econom y in which the state plays an active role in shaping economic 
development, with growth targets outlined in a series of Five Year Plans (FYPs). The 11th FYP (2016 -
2020) aims to raise the contribution of ICTs from 13% to 18.2% of GDP as a key component of th e 33 
 country’s target to escape a middle -income trap.90 Developing the country’s technology capacity has 
been at the forefront of a series of national initiatives over the years, such as the Multimedia Sup er 
Corridor (MSC) designed to attract multinational inv estment and domestic flagship projects. 
Spearheading the drive towards a Digital Malaysia is the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation 
(MDEC)91 which has identified five key sectors for digital development: I CT services, E -commerce, ICT 
manufacturing, ICT Tr ade, Content and Media.92 MDEC was also instrumental in supporting the 
establishment of a D igital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) which, like the MSC, offers incentives to investors, 
particularly across the areas of e -commerce.  
  
Holding Malaysia back has been the l ack of accessible and affordable fixed broadband at the national 
level (with Malaysia recently slipping behind Thailand on affordable access per capita, and even 
behind Viet nam on same indices – see Diagram  1). To head this problem off, the Malaysian 
Commu nications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) had given one -third subsidy to state -invested 
Telecom Malaysia (TM) to bring High Speed Broadband in two consecutive programmes (HSBB 1 and 
HSBB 2) with support from Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the strategic investm ent fund of the 
Government of Malaysia.93 As the monopoly fixed line carrier, TM owns around 90% of the national 
network of copper wires, fibre and ducts. Although retail prices are regulated, TM has been able to 
recoup its investments through high wholesal e charges with what is known in the industry as a 
‘profit squeeze’. Competition at the retail level holds down end -user prices, making it difficult for 
new facilities competitors to enter the market. As a result, competition has only been effective in 
the broadband mobile market.

Nevertheless, Malaysia has been striving to become a r egional hub for telecoms traffic  and related 
data centre development , but high cable landing fee s, interconnect ion fees and backhaul fees deter 
international submarine service providers from routing their traffic from the Pacific to the Indian 
oceans throu gh Malaysia, preferring the lower prices and higher capacity available in Singapore.  This 
has further consolidated TM’s stranglehold on the infrastructure market, leading to something of a 
vicious, rather than virtuous, cycle of investment and development.  Many questions have thus 
begun to be raised about the sustainability and advantages of the state -funded HSBB approach, with 
Prime Minister’s office more recently soliciting proposal for a more aggressive ‘fiberization’ 
programme for the country.94  
 
Digita l Planning in Malaysia  
Malaysia’ s goal is to become a high -income country ,95 with ICT contributing 18.2 % of GDP by 2020 .96 
The country has a host of cross -cutting initiatives with digital components to achiev e these targets.  
E-commerce: There are more than 40 e -Commerce related initiatives and programs by more than 20 
government agencies in Malaysia. The National e -Commerce Strategic Roadmap , under the 
supervision of the National eCommerce Council (NeCC), aims to double e -commerce growth in the 
country from the projected 10.8% to 20.8% b etween 2015 and  2020 ,97 and positioning Malaysia as

 the leading hub for e -commerce in the ASEAN region.  To promote this strategy t he concept of Digital 
Free Trade Zones (DFTZs) has been developed to facilitate e -commerce includ ing an e -fulfilment hub 
at KLIA with partners such as Alibaba’s Cainiao, Lazada and Pos Malaysia; and an Electronic World 
Trade Platform is to facilitate cross -border payments targeting SMEs.  The challenge for Malaysia is to 
be able to attract foreign as w ell as domestic e -commerce and logistics companies to invest and 
locate in these zones. DFTZs have also been conceptualized in China, but in China’s case the size of 
the domestic market alone can be a great advantage to the future success DFTZs. In smaller  
Southeast -Asian market s, additional measures may be necessary to ensure success, ranging from 
investment and taxation incentives to fast -tracked business proceedings and regulatory certainty .98 
Public service delivery:  The Malaysian Administrative Moderniz ation and Management Planning 
Unit (MAMPU) was established under the Prime Minister’s Office to transform public service 
delivery through accelerating the adoption of ICT by 2020. MAMPU’s key goals on digital, data, cloud  
and cyber security are outlined in  the Public -Sector  ICT Strategic Plan (2016 -2020). The Plan 
proposes that certain government services will be offered only digitally, and citizens will get IDs to 
access online services. The government also intends to allow online payments, with 19 agencie s to 
offer mobile payments by 2020. MAMPU will look to encourage broader use of data in government, 
with analytics used to improve digital delivery. It will build  the Consolidated Secured Government 
Cloud Platform for agencies to consolidate and share data  with each other.  
 
While Malaysia has several initiatives to drive digital economic growth, the country lacks a coherent 
digital agenda as government agencies like the Malaysian Investment Development Authority 
(MIDA), the Malaysian Communications and Mul timedia Commission (MCMC), the Malaysian Digital 
Economy Corporation (MDEC) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) have 
at times seemed to be at odds with one another. For example, the MCMC and MDEC both hold 
positions under the Min istry of Communications and Multimedia  (known as KKMM) but without a 
well -established coordination mechanism to formulate policies and foster programmes together . 
While the MCMC is primarily responsible for regulating the state -invested Telkom Malaysia (TM ), 
MDEC is on record as wanting to see m ore competition in the sector.  While the government is 
committed to the digital agenda – fostering entrepreneurship and a start -up culture is of particular 
interest – it has failed to create an institutional or regul atory environment that can resist vested 
interests, or the short -term requirements of national politics, and a fragmented administrative 
structure. Both in the case of DFTZs and MAMPU’s initiative to  digitize public services , this gap

 translates into slow implementation due to the need for coordination with multiple stakeholders 
within the government  and with external stakeholders .  
 
Thailand  
The context of Digital Thailand is markedly different from Malaysia or Vietnam due to the coming to 
power of the mil itary in 2014. The new government has re -written the national digital plan as a 
Digital Economy Master Plan and created a new Ministry of Digital Economy and Socie ty (MDES) 
from the Ministry of I nformation and Communication Technology (MICT). The Plan is an ambitious 
transformation undertaking, particularly aggressive in its timelines, and comprehensive in its 
coverage  and scope (Figure 1 ).

Also new is a National Committee of Cyber Security (NSC) and a Digital Commission for Social Affairs  
and the  Economy. Under the powers to be given to the NSC, telecom operators and ISPs will be 
required to submit cyber information on users without court warrants.99 The most controversial 
change has been the replacement of the independent broadcast and telecommuni cations regulator, 
(the NBTC) with a Digital Economy Policy Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister. This has raised 
questions as to the long -term independence of the state -invested incumbent carriers, the TOT and 
the CAT. The policy of auctioning of radi o spectrum will be continued as it is designated as one of the 
sources of funding for the Digital Economy Fund, which will be used to support universal service and

 to support a new national holding company to build and operate (as a wholesale business ) Thailand’s 
fibre and telecom tower assets. Thailand’s new government is adopting a more assertive top -down 
approach to promoting and managing the digital economy, although it remains an economy open to 
foreign direct investment in most sectors.  
 
Digital Plan ning in Thailand  
Digital Thailand 4.0  aims to promote creativity, innovation, and the application of technology in 
various economic  activities,  to launch a new economic model to develop Thailand into a valued -
based economy , and enable the country to break out from the middle -income trap. The Digital 
Thailand 4.0 initiative relies on the public and the private sector working together with society at -
large in six key action areas : 
1. Digital infrastructure100 
2. Digital innovation ecosystem  
3. Digital technology for an equitable society  
4. E-government services  
5. Human capital  
6. Holistic frameworks for a Digital Thailand  
The National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)  has responsibility within the 
plan to promote smart city applications. As part of the government ’s push for implementation, the 
new policies were implemented in 2016/2017  including the Ministry of Information and 
Communication Technology Reform Act/Ministry of Digital Economy and Society Act, which 
restructured the ICT Ministry into the Ministry of D igital Economy and Society (MDES); and the 
Digital Development Act.  
 
Digital Development Act : The bill established the Digital Economy Promotion Agency to manage the 
Digital Development for Economy and Society Fund, which promotes enterprises and initiati ves that 
advance the use of technology that would foster economic and social development. It also 
establishes the National Committee for Digital Economy and Society, which will be responsible for 
setting policies and directions for the country’s digital ec onomy development.   
Digital Economy Master Plan : MDES has been tasked to draft the twenty -year Digital Economy 
Master Plan which will replace the existing IT 2020 ICT master plan, and is expected to be completed

integrated, citizen -centric digital government within 5 years’

 by November 2017. The plan will consist of f ive main domain missions, namely (i) hard 
infrastructure, (ii) soft infrastructure, (iii) service infrastructure, (iv) digital economy acceler ation, 
and (v) digital workforce.101  
The government’s commitment to transformational change for the digital economy  is well -
supported by institutional restructuring and regulatory changes. Nevertheless, political uncertainty  
and leadership changes in the leading agencies make implementation less efficient,102 and such 
issues hindered execution in the past, as well. Also,  issues around personal data protection, taxation 
for technology companies and cybersecurity have not been resolved in the newly emerging digital 
economy framework. Most importantly, while Thailand 4.0 is comprehensive and holistic, it fails to 
offer a cle ar implementation path: it does not prioritize among the various goals and policy areas; 
nor are the agency leadership roles made clear. In a broader sense,  the military government of 
Thailand faces the challenge of how to manage competing vested interests  and tackling the 
implementation gaps in the programme as they arise.   
 
Vietnam  
Vietnam’s shift towards a digital economy is taking place within the context of a transition from a 
centrally -controlled to a state -directed mixed economy in which markets play  a greater role. Digital 
policies are being driven by the ministries of Science & Technology, Planning and Investment, 
Information & Communications, and Finance.  
 
Competition is being introduced between state -invested networks, with government encouraged 
market -focused investment, and supported by universal service charges (USC). On the down side, 
the implementation phase of the USC ran into inefficiencies due to carriers competing to give 
discounts to subscribers,103 but on the up side the spread of broadba nd has been rapid, especially of 
mobile services. Government policy aims to have at least 40% of households and individuals covered 
                                                             
101 The Master Plan takes a holistic approach to digital development and sets specific goals and targets : 
 10,000 free Wi -Fi spots across the country, nationwide broadband, doubling of submarine cable capacity  
 15,000  one-stop online SME merchants  
 Promote SMEs in the tourism industry  
 Promote 1,500 start -ups each year  
 Establish Smart Cities (Phuket and Chiang Mai)  
 Develop Electronic Health Records (EHR)  
 Establish 600 community digital centres  
 Target 1,600 farmers for t echnology use  
 Train 4,000 underprivileged individuals and elderly  
 Establish Massive Online Open Course (MOOC)  
 Develop G -Cloud, Software as a Service (SaaS) in 30,000 villages  
102 The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society has 24 projects planned in the effo rt to create the Digital Thailand 
programme, at a total cost of BT3.76bn ($113.2m)

 by fixed broadband Internet networks by 2020, 60% of Internet users supported by download 
speeds of 25Mbps, with 100% public  Internet access points linked by fixed broadband and over 50% 
of them with downloads speeds of 50Mbps.104  
 
The adoption of digital technologies across industries, including agriculture, healthcare, security and 
defence is being promoted up to 2020 by the N ational Technology Development Programme. 
Vietnam is also aiming to reduce the use of cash to less than 10% of daily transactions and to 
promote mobile payment platforms for rural areas. E -commerce is one of the drivers of going 
cashless, valued at around 4% of GDP and growing rapidly.105 One very important aspect of the 
Programme is to promote start -up incubators, venture capital and more IT trained and skilled 
workers, including visas for foreign workers. Foreigners can now own prope rty in Vietnam and 
opera te 100% foreign owned companies. This is part of a more general opening of Vietnam. For 
example, access to social media such as Facebook has been permitted since 2013, and import tariffs, 
for example, on mobile phones, from ASEAN countries falls to zero un der the ASEAN Economic 
Community (AEC) which formally came into existence in January 2017.106 
   
Digital Planning in Vietnam  
Vietnam does not have a comprehensive strategy for digital economy development, but it has 
national -level strategies and initiatives with a digital component, and the government has 
acknowledged the importance of digital transformation for national competitiveness and keeping 
pace with global technology developments. The government aims to make Vietnam an international 
software hub and promote entrepreneurship as well as smart cities development, and has been 
trying to strengthen policy mechanisms and dialogue with the business community.  
 
E-Commerce: The Vietnamese e -commerce market is forecast to be worth USD 10 billion by 2020 
with the  mobile Internet creating some 150,000 new jobs, or 3.2% of total employment growth.107 
The e-Commerce development plan (2016 -2020) seeks to boost the sector and digital payments. The 
National Payment Corporation of Vietnam (NPCV) operates and manages an int er-bank connection 
system with 43 domestic commercial banks and foreign banks and provides e -commerce services to

help the low -income replace analogue TV sets.

 over 200 merchants helping to overcome the limited interoperability among foreign payment 
providers.  
 
Smart Cities: Vietnam has started the gr adual development of smart cities that include Hue (2015), 
Da Nang (July 2016); Ho Chi Minh City (August 2016); Can Tho (September 2016).  Free city -wide Wi -
Fi has been installed in ten major cities. Smart city initiatives are more localised and are aligned  to 
regional planning strategies.  
 
Given the importance of the Internet to the successful development of digital industries in Vietnam , 
the government maintains a strict regulatory approach to the Internet which may restrict the impact 
of entrepreneurship and innovation. The scope and clarity of digital economy building efforts by the 
state remains limited compared to the opportunities a more enabling role might create, especially 
given the vibrancy of Vietnam’s private sector which is engaged in a broad ra nge of industries from 
online learning to e -commerce .108 Hence the gap betwe en the government’s  support  of the digital 
agenda  and what it actually does is defined more by the role it chooses to play as opposed to 
inherent problems with its initiatives.  
 
Com parative Assessment: Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam  
As the examples in the country cases above suggest, the approach they have taken to develop their 
digital economies differ significantly. These differences are based on the level of economic maturity , 
legacy  institutions, power distribution vis -à-vis to the central authority, the level of economic 
liberalization and state involvement among other factors.  This assessment aims to give a brief 
overview without attempting comprehensive analysis of the differences . 
 
Government vs Private 
Sector Leadership  Malaysia and Thailand both consider government leadership to be 
paramount in shaping the digital agenda. In Vietnam, the state’s 
primary self -identification as a regulator and “controller” of the 
economy, coupled with an enterprising and vibrant private sector 
gives more opportunities to the latter to shape a  forward -looking 
agenda.  
Top Down vs Bottom Up  All the three economies illustrate a more top down approach , 
although in Vietnam’s cases this is of limited sco pe. Only Malaysia 
and Thailand have comprehensive national digital plans as blueprints 
                                                             
108 TRPC (5 Dec 2015), Going Digital: The Status and Future Potential of Inte rnet-Based Economies across Asia, p.  55 41 
 for state promotion of  the digital economy. Vietnam has issued a five 
year (2016 -2020) National Development Programme which sets out a 
Tech 2020 Plan , mostly focused up on supporting sector -specific 
developments and grants for start -ups.109  
Innovation vs Regulation  All three governments place importance upon both, which sometimes 
helps and sometimes hinders innovation -led development. An OECD 
report on Malaysia found that  a vibrant economy nevertheless 
suffered shortages of requisite skills and low levels of productivity, 
while national plans were trying to address both110.  A UNCTAD 
assessment in 2015 of innovation in Thailand points to a supply -side 
dominated approach, cit ing the preponderance of research institutes, 
but “a lack of clear and strategic orientations and a dispersion of 
resources on  multiple, uncoordinated projects with an insufficient 
critical mass. ”111 A World Bank report on innovation in Vietnam noted 
the cou ntry’s strong attraction to foreign investment, but low levels 
productivity and especially a “s seriously  underdeveloped information 
base for innovation policy making. ”112 
 
Besides the different approaches, these countries also differ in their capacity  both in terms of 
institutional resources in the government and technological readiness  to address the challenges 
driven by the digital transformation . For example, Thailand’s digital agenda was able to successfully 
reflect its core strengths in manufacturing an d IoTs – this does not appear in Vietnam’s plans at all, 
even though the Vietnamese economy has very developed manufacturing capacity in certain 
industries. Similarly, Thailand focuses on the issues of cybersecurity and data privacy, but has  limited 
acknow ledgement of data sovereignty issues, which weakens the country’s ability to enforce data 
security. Malaysia, which has one of the earliest data privacy laws in the ASEAN, has  issues of data 
privacy and protection from state investigation  which hinders the  country’s ability to compete for 
hosting data centres which are fundamentally concerned about data sovereignty issues. Neither 
Vietnam nor Thailand has a cybersecurity law , which is a concern to the emerging digital industries 
sectors .

 Table 3 summarises where Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam currently stand with regard s to data 
security/cybersecurity and data privacy.  
 
Table 3: Cybersecurity and Data Privacy in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam  
Malaysia  
Cybersecurity  
Malaysia has comprehensive legislation co vering cyber security and national security. The 
National Security Council Act was passed in 2016, giving the new NSC extensive powers of 
surveillance and detention of persons deemed a threat to the state. In 2006, the National Cyber 
Security Policy (NCSP)  was established to protect the Critical National Information Infrastructures 
(CNII) and encourage greater cross -agency reporting of cyber -attacks. Cybersecurity Malaysia 
(CSM) was created to foster greater co -operation with the private sector and overseas  
government agencies. Other legislation overlapping with NSC powers and CSM, and which gives 
authorities wide powers of search and seizure, includes the Computer Crimes Act (CCA) 1997 and 
the 1998 Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA).  
Data Privacy  
The P DPA does require data on Malaysians to be stored on local servers, but cross -border data 
transfers are permitted subject to the agreement of the data subject, or where it is the personal 
interest of the data subject, and where reasonable steps to protect t he data have been taken.  
However, there are certain restrictions on the use of the cloud for financial data. Bank Negara’s 
approval is required until policy towards FinTech companies has been finalised.  
Thailand  
Cybersecurity  
The disclosure or transfer o f data may be considered a wrongful act under the Thai Civil and 
Commercial Code, if it causes damage to the data owner. Besides that, Thailand does not have a 
specific law to protect personal data privacy, but it does have laws giving the authorities 
wide spread powers of surveillance and cybersecurity, including the Special Case Investigation Act 
of 2004, covering the interception of communications in postal, digital and telephonic forms, and 
the Computer -Related Crime Act (CCA), which came into effect in 2016. Under the Cybersecurity 
Bill, currently being considered by the National Assembly, the powers of the Cyber Security 
Commission (CSC) would be further strengthened. The chairman of the CSC is the Digital Economy 
Minister, and other commissioners repre sent the Secretary of the National Security Council, the 
Digital Economy Permanent Secretary, the Defence Permanent Secretary and the Commander of 
the Technology Crime Suppression Division. Despite there being a civilian government in Malaysia 43 
 and a milita ry government in Thailand, the current approaches to national and cybersecurity 
security are rather similar.  
Data Privacy  
There is no direct reference to data transfers in Thai law, but under the Thai Civil and Commercial 
Code, a person who wilfully, negli gently, or unlawfully injures the life, body, health, liberty, 
property or any right of another person has committed a wrongful act and is required to 
compensate the victim. Disclosure or transfer of data may be considered a wrongful act if it 
causes damag e to the data owner. In practice, the prior written consent of the data owner should 
be obtained before transferring the data to any third person. Disclosure of data without the 
consent of the data owner is permissible in very limited circumstances (e.g. p ursuant to an order 
from a government authority or Thai court).113 
Vietnam  
Cybersecurity  
Vietnam plans to introduce an import licensing requirement for cyber information security 
products, falling into three categories: (i) products that scan, check, and/or  analyse the 
architecture, status, and record data of an information system, detect its flaws and weaknesses, 
and examine risks to information safety; (ii) products that supervise and analyse data in an 
information system, collect and analyse record data i n real time, and detect and alert on unusual 
events or those with potential danger to information safety, and (iii) products that stop attacks 
and intrusions into information systems (a category that could be broadly interpreted to include 
many products th at have standard mechanisms to deter cyber -attacks.  These are under 
discussion with international trade partners.  
Data Privacy  
Vietnam  has no laws protecting personal data privacy, and has relied upon its state -owned 
national carriers to conduct surveilla nce. ISPs, for example, are expected to monitor and block 
undesirable sites, but as this is done through the DNS (Domain Name Server) only whole sites can 
be blocked. The government is  currently implementing the regulations of the 2015 Law on 
Network Infor mation Security.  Circular No. 38 came into effect in February 2017, detailing the 
cross -border distribution of public information. The Circular was the regulatory implementation of 
Decree 72 issued by the Ministry of Information and Communications in 2013.  Government 
policies towards online data are restricted to public information and data transmitted over the 
Internet must be in accordance with Vietnam’s laws. But ISPs must store at least one copy of data 
pertaining to Vietnamese citizens in -country and m ake available for inspection by the relevant 
authorities.

 CHAPTER 5 : Recommendations: Building Blocks for a Digital Economy 
Framework  
 
This chapter outlines  policy options and measures available to governments to build their digital 
economies. This digita l development ‘toolkit’ outlines the policy and regulatory tools governments 
can use and the strategic choices they must make. These choices, coupled with cross -agency  work 
within the government, can create more agile  methods of  governance preparing  polic y makers to 
become enablers of the digital economy. Enablers by way of direct state initiatives and investments; 
enablers by way of policy -incentives and market -sensitive regulations. For government agencies , the 
shift from the position of regulators and “ risk managers” to be coming  enablers is necess ary as 
traditional policy tools and regulatory regimes developed in an industrial age of vertical policy silos 
are not suitable for the new interconnected landscape. The cross -cutting and horizontal issues 
discu ssed in Chapter 2 such as privacy, data protection, interoperability and cybersecurity require 
flexible tools and a good understanding of national regulatory issues, markets and legacy 
institutions. As the pace of innovation accelerates, countries  must ada pt their policy making and 
regulat ory processes  or risk being left behind.  
 
Measurement and Goal S etting  
A preamble to any digital economy framework building is the ne ed of measuring the impact the 
government is set ting out to achieve. But measuring the d igital economy in national economic and 
trade statistics  is often complicated as the cross -cutting nature of the Internet  makes it hard to 
delineate and quantify its benefits . 
  
However m easurement of the digital economy is necessary not only for a better understanding of 
the state of the economy and society with statistical tools. Negotiating government budgets and 
resource allocation  in agency portfolios is a highly politicised process, hence agencies and initiatives 
championing digital change need the ab ility to monitor and evaluate their projects, and measure and 
showcase their impact boundaries.  
 
Leadership and Coordination C ompetencies  
Cross -sectoral policy making : Traditional public administration function s are  based on silos – where 
public servants’ expertise is mostly limited to a specific policy domain such as agriculture, education 45 
 or infrastructure. Creating a digital economy requires the breaking down of such b oundaries  within 
areas of policy , expert ise and across areas of perceived or real insti tutional hierarchies  work ing 
across sectors . This cross -sectoral approach depends on a sustainable mechanism which enables the 
continuous incorporation of digital into sectoral policy making.114 Many governments have chosen to 
create distinct entities in ch arge of the digital economy – agencies like the MDES in Thailand and 
MDEC in Malaysia, or specialised departments within the Prime Minister’s Office. Singapore’ s 
GovTech, “the CIO of the Singapore government” in charge of the digital transformation of the  
public sector, established a cluster group  that collaborates closely with sectoral agencies  (in finance, 
health, education etc.) to ensure that newly developed digital services answer the needs of their 
users.115 Specialis ed agencies alone won’t create a cr oss-sectoral communication proce ss without 
establishing formalis ed communication channel and collaboration methods.  
 
Agility : The pace of innovation has accelerated and rapid technological changes require 
governments  to gauge, understand, make  and implemen t regulatory decisions faster.  The internal 
constraints of agencies, the risk of overregulation or  simply  taking a bet on a specific technology for 
policy  making purposes means that agility is not only about speed, but more about  flexibility.  Agility 
shou ld also be a defining characteristics of public service provisions (e.g.  finding faster and more 
efficient ways to handle  licensing, business registration).  
 
Multi -stakeholder approach : Governments not only need to coordinate various public sector 
stakehol ders, but engage the private sector, civil society and academia  in setting the agenda for 
digital development,  creating appropriate regulations and implementing digital initiatives. A widely 
used long -term cooperative arrangement is Public -Private Partners hips (PPPs). Malaysia , for 
example, uses the PPP model  – for example, in April 2017, the Ministry  of International Trade and 
Industry  launched the M -Powered Platform, an employment porta l for persons with disabilities, in 
collaboration with Microsoft.116 These initiatives are important, but only if they genuinely involve a 
partnership, with mutual responsibilities and accountabilities, and are not simply another name for 
outsourcing. For example, monitoring and evaluation are methodologies that are too infre quently 
applied in the public sector, and consequently  there is no learning nor improvement, for example, in 
project management.   
 
                                                             
114 The European Union uses the expression “digital mainstreaming” (along the lines of gender mainstream ing) to describe 
the process of incorporating the digital  agenda into all its development policies.

 Strategic Choices on P latforms  
Digital platforms range from social media  to national e -identity schemes, from application s tores to 
public cloud services , including infrastructure. Such platforms facilitate exchange between multiple 
communities (such as users and service providers) in a massively scalable  manner . Governments 
using these platforms must make strategic choices ar ound which ones to use for an efficient  
allocat ion resources . For example, some governments in the Asia -Pacific have launched ‘cloud first 
policies’, which aim to foster the use of cloud computing services in the public sector. There are 
different models for implementing such a policy – agencies can build their own proprietary systems  
(government  or G -cloud) or the government can establish a cloud services panel, where agencies can 
procure from selected public cloud providers.  
 
Building your own  platform : Governments can get their own platforms built . Thailand’s e -ID scheme 
and India’s Aadhaar both run on servers stored i n a government -owned data centre . Thailand has 
budget ed for the  procurement of 200,000 smart card readers for 80 state agencies to improve  
accuracy and accountability in verification of e -ID.117  
 
Outsourcing the platform : Public and hybrid cloud services offer a cost -effective alternative to 
governments, who are not keen on investing in their own hardware, yet want to benefit from data 
storag e and analytics capabilities. Malaysia has such a private cloud run by Microsoft  for 1GovEA and 
1GovUC initiatives .  
 
Regulating existing platforms : Beyond making decisions about platform technologies used in  public 
administration and service delivery , gov ernments can regulate existing platforms to boost the digital 
economy.  Mandating or facilitating the interoperability of  platforms means that digital traffic can 
run effectively across differe nt types of networks (including telecoms, banking, educational a nd 
health networks) enabling economies of scope.118 But the time must be ripe to mandate, and that 
time is usually after a market has been created and is in need of the removal of barriers to further  
expansion in a way that encourages competition. Lack of in terconnectivity or interoperability will, at 
some point in time, become a barrier to new entrants and new services.

118 The interconnections of networks, which brings greater economies of scale as the fixed costs of infr astructure rollout 
are spread across a greater level of output bringing about a  fall in unit costs. The interoperability of operating system 
platforms. This brings about economies of scope, as fixed costs are spread across a wider range of o utput of different 
products and services . 47 
 Policy Approaches and Tools for E ffective Digital  Governance  
Whole -of-government  (WOG)  initiatives  offer  a methodology for cross -sectoral c ollaboration 
among various public sector agencies. The WOG  approach requires agencies to make their vertical 
organisational structures permeable so that learning, communication, analysis and decision -making 
processes can take place across organisational bo undaries.  Most  WOG initiatives are  directed top -
down from sen ior leadership, and require a disciplined approach to information gathering and 
sharing.119 The WOG approach allows agencies to move towards a more enabling  approach , by 
rethinking the role of regu lator, increasing agility and creating opportunities for cross -agency 
learning and exchange of knowledge on policy issues and tools to tackle them with.  
 
The relationship between governments and the private sector  in service of building a digital 
economy h as several well -trodden avenues for engagement  enabled by a commitment to the multi -
stakeholder approach. PPPs, government procurement mechanisms and the transfer of expertise in 
niche areas such as cybersecurity are established practices.  
 Marketplace for  government procurement . To take advantage of innovative technologies 
such as cloud services, governments need to reform their IT procurement processes. Shifting 
from a capital expenditure base (where agencies buy distinct goods like computers) to the 
oper ating expenditure model would allow government to take advantage of scalable, on -
demand services (such as public cloud infrastructure or data analytics). A marketplace model 
simplifies multi -layered procurement systems both on a departmental and national l evel. 
Agencies can shop at the centralised digital marketplace, which limits vendor participation 
by a shared set of standards.  In Thailand, individual ministries have been trying to change 
procurement processes to access digital tools more easily, but ar e hindered by the lack of 
centralised government policy.   
 Sandboxing  is a regtech framework increasingly used by financial regulators experimenting 
with FinTech  solutions in a low risk, but real -life setting without the burden of licensing or 
regulatory re quirements . Sandboxing allows the private sector and regulators to engage in a 
fail-safe environment, while fostering innovation. The Monetary Authority  of Singapore 
launched such a “regulatory sandbox” for organisations to test and trial FinTech  solutions . In 
a similar vein, Bank Negara Malaysia released the Regulatory Sandbox Discussion Paper in 
July 2016 to set a space for FinTech  companies to develop digital services and products to 
bring down regulatory barriers.

  A different aspect of the relationship between governments and the private sector is the 
relationship with civil society organizations , and governments’ ability to engage with not—
for-profit  entities and incorporate their insights into building the digital economy. While 
political and legacy fa ctors often create a top -down approach towards NGOs ,  creating 
avenues for bottom -up development has its merits  as these organizations have the ability to 
advocate for and raise awareness among the public on various digital issues. In some cases, 
governmen t-sponsored efforts can result in distrust arising within civil society as to the true 
motives behind the introduction of a digital technology, such as a nationwide ID system. In 
India, the spread of the Aadhaar card was seen by government as an effective tool for social 
inclusion in welfare payments and in the banking system, but was strongly opposed by some 
as an unwarranted form of mass surveillance.120  
Besides focusing on the relationship among government agencies, and between the public and the 
private sector, governments also need to have sufficient capacity to understand the changes in the 
international technological and policy landscape  and their impact on national digital economy 
agendas. Cross -border data transfer, data privacy and security and the taxation of digital economy 
players present ever -shifting challenges  to policy -makers and regulators and it helps of there is a 
good understanding international  trends i n these areas .   
Interoperable regulatory regime setting  requires accepting the princip le of equivalence – for 
example, in the levels of data protection offered and expected when data is transferred from one 
jurisdiction to another. On the local level, national standards bodies have to consider the costs of 
setting localized standards as opp osed to following international ones – differences can affect the 
costs and competitiveness various industries from phone manufacturing to the building 
requirements of data centres.   
Technology foresight121 is an initiative by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 
The methodology aims to provide input in policy design and problem definition through capacity 
building and a knowledge exchange platform. Vietnam , for example,  relies on the project to help 
developing policies and strategies on s cience, technology and industrial innovation, compatible with 
the economic and social goals of the country.122 
Digital assessment123 is a methodology used by EU institutions, which focu ses on identifying digital 
technology related issues to an already identifi ed problem definition  or issue . The importance of

123 Digital assessment questions:  
Are there relevant ICT or Internet drivers influencing the way the prob lem is defined?  
Are there identifiable trends in your policy domain indicating that digital technologies will change  the nature of the define d 
problem?  49 
 digital assessments is justified on the grounds that the sooner “the earlier ICT requirements and 
associated implications are identified and analysed, the greater the likelihood that appropriate 
solutions c an be prepared which are accepted by stakeholders .”124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                             
How are ICT and the Internet linked to the problem? Is Internet based activity growing compared to c lassical activity (face 
to face; snail mail; broadcast, etc.)? Is amongst the causes of the problem the fact that ICT means are not used, or are 
insufficient/outdated and not responding to the needs?  
Whether ICT and Internet factors are properly identified in the baseline scenario. How rapidly is the problem changing? To 
what extent? How stable is the baseline scenario you have established with respect to identifiable t echnology trends?  
Who are the stakeholders and how they are linked to the ICT and Internet di mension of the problem?
