A Digital Credit RevolutionEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Digital credit has expanded rapidly in 
both Kenya and Tanzania, yet there is 
limited evidence on who is using it, how 
it is used, and the risks customers face. 
Two large-scale surveys conducted in 
Kenya and Tanzania help to fill in this 
evidence gap.
The survey findings suggest that digital 
credit is not widely used by the most vul -
nerable groups characterized by irregu -
lar cash flows, such as those primarily 
receiving income through farming and 
casual work. To serve these segments, 
digital credit may need to be appro -
priately and adequately adapted, such 
as through more nuanced algorithms 
and flexible repayment structures, time 
frames, and pricing appropriate for their 
ability to repay. Alternatively, digital 
credit may prove unsuitable for these 
segments, and other solutions will be 
needed to help them build resilience and 
meet liquidity needs.
The findings and discussions with digital 
lenders suggest that growth in the digi -
tal credit market is driven by a segment 
of active users who borrow every month 
or even every week. This segment would 
benefit from opportunities to graduate 
to larger, more affordable loans with lon -
ger repayment periods that can be put 
to more productive purposes than the 
typically short-term, high-cost current 
offerings.
The results also indicate that better 
transparency and consumer protection 
requirements are needed, and regula -
tors will need tools to monitor com -
pliance and consumer outcomes. This 
includes tracking the potential risks of 
over-indebtedness and multiple bor -
rowing, as up to 20 percent of borrow -
ers report reducing food purchases to 
repay their loans and about half in each 
country report having repaid a loan 
late. Credit reporting requirements and credit bureau functions may need to 
be updated, as the current practice of 
monthly reporting by lenders is not well 
suited for the speed of digital credit. 
Such rules should be extended to cover 
all lenders, including those that are cur -
rently unregulated, so that all borrowers 
have the same protections.
Investors and donors can play a greater 
role mitigating risks and ensuring dig -
ital credit markets grow responsibly. 
Investors can support responsible actors 
through their investment decisions and 
through guiding investees through active 
engagement. Further, donors and other 
development actors can work with mar -
ket facilitators and country regulators to 
support development of regulatory and 
supervisory frameworks that adequate -
ly address existing and emerging risks. 
Donors and investors should work to 
ensure their funding minimizes negative 
consumer outcomes.
The following key findings emerge from 
this research:
■■Thirty-five percent of mobile phone 
owners in Kenya, and 21 percent 
in Tanzania, have taken out a digi -
tal loan.  In Kenya, 82 percent of digi -
tal credit users have used M-Shwari, 
while in Tanzania, the market is more 
evenly split among the top three 
lenders, M-Pawa, Timiza, and Nivushe.
■■Digital borrowers are active.  Sixty 
percent of digital borrowers in Kenya, 
and 54 percent in Tanzania had a dig -
ital loan outstanding at the time of the 
survey, and two-thirds of digital bor -
rowers had taken out at least one loan 
in the past 90 days.
■■A significant minority have bor -
rowed from multiple digital lend -
ers.  Thirty-five percent of Kenyan 
digital borrowers have borrowed 2
A Digital Credit Revolutionfrom more than one digital lender, 
and 14 percent had loans outstand -
ing with more than one digital lender 
at the time of the survey. In Tanzania, 
15 percent have used more than one 
digital lender, and 6 percent had 
multiple digital loans outstanding.
■■Digital borrowers tend to be 
young, urban men. Individuals that 
count self-employment or wage- 
employment as their primary in -
come source are over-represented 
among digital borrowers.  Those 
who report farming, transfers from 
others, or casual work as their main 
source of income are less likely than 
average to use digital credit (though 
the farmer segment still makes up 
a substantial portion of digital bor -
rowers because it is the largest in -
come group in each country).
■■Household and business needs 
dominate reasons for borrowing.  
Digital borrowers report primarily 
taking out loans for ordinary house -
hold needs (35 percent in Kenya, 
37 percent in Tanzania) or for busi -
ness purposes (37 percent in Kenya, 
31 percent in Tanzania).
■■Digital borrowers report rarely 
using digital loans for medi -
cal needs or emergencies.  Seven 
percent in Kenya and 9 percent in 
Tanzania report having used a dig -
ital loan for medical needs, includ -
ing medical emergencies. Less than 
2 percent in either country report 
having used a digital loan for any 
other emergency.
■■Some gender differences emerge 
in use cases.  In Tanzania, women 
are more likely to report using loans 
for business purposes, medical 
needs, and school fees, while men 
are more likely to borrow to pay 
for ordinary household needs, air -
time, and to pay bills. In Kenya, the differences are smaller, with men 
more likely to borrow for the same 
purposes as men in Tanzania, and 
women more likely to borrow for 
school fees.
■■About half of borrowers report 
having repaid a digital loan late, 
and a significant proportion re -
port having defaulted.  Fifty-six 
percent of borrowers in Tanzania 
and 47 percent in Kenya have repaid 
a digital loan late; 31 percent in Tan -
zania and 12 percent in Kenya report 
having defaulted. Reported rates 
of late repayment and default are 
relatively consistent across gender 
and education segments, as well as 
across those receiving income from 
different types of livelihoods. For ex -
ample, in Tanzania, those with only 
primary education are most likely 
to report having defaulted (33 per -
cent), but even among those with 
tertiary education, 25 percent have 
defaulted.
■■Some repayment behaviors may 
signal that borrowers are strug -
gling to repay.  Twenty percent of 
Kenyan and 9 percent of Tanzanian 
digital borrowers reported reduc -
ing food purchases to repay a loan. 
In Kenya, 16 percent report having 
borrowed money to repay a loan, as 
have 4 percent in Tanzania.
■■Between a fifth and a quarter of 
borrowers have experienced a 
lack of transparency. Experiencing 
poor transparency is correlated 
with higher reported levels of late 
repayment and default.  Twenty- 
seven percent of digital borrow -
ers in Tanzania and 19 percent in 
Kenya report experiencing at least 
one form of poor transparency (e.g., 
unexpected fees, unexpected with -
drawal by lender, or not understand -
ing costs or terms of loan).3
A Digital Credit Revolution■■Most borrowers have never con -
tacted customer care.  Customer 
care for digital credit is little used—
only 5 percent of digital borrowers 
in Tanzania and 10 percent in Kenya 
have ever contacted customer care 
with a question, concern, or com -
plaint about a digital loan. About 
10 percent in each country reported 
needing to contact customer care 
but not knowing how to do so.
■■Digital borrowers use more fi -
nancial services than the average 
Kenyan or Tanzanian adult.  In both 
countries, digital borrowers are about 
twice as likely to have a bank account 
(other than those associated with a 
digital credit service) than average.
■■Digital credit is only one loan 
source among many.  Thirty-three 
percent of digital borrowers in Kenya 
and 25 percent in Tanzania were jug -
gling loans from two or more sources (including digital and nondigital) at 
the time of the survey. Family mem -
bers, friends, savings groups, and 
banks are the most common sources 
of nondigital loans among digital 
borrowers.
■■In Kenya, borrowers tend to use 
digital credit to substitute away 
from nondigital loans. In Tanzania, 
digital credit primarily adds to or 
complements the borrowers’ ex -
isting credit sources.  Sixty-three 
percent of digital borrowers in 
Kenya reported reducing their use of 
at least one type of nondigital loan 
source since they began using dig -
ital credit. This suggests that many 
Kenyan borrowers use digital credit 
as a substitute for other sources. In 
Tanzania, only 34 percent report 
reducing use of other loan sources, 
suggesting digital credit comple -
ments, rather than replaces, other 
loan sources.4
A Digital Credit RevolutionINTRODUCTION
Digital credit has reached millions 
of borrowers in Kenya and Tanzania 
since it launched in 2012. Its key 
characteristics—instant loan access, 
automated credit decisions, and remote 
disbursement and repayment—make it 
a fast, private, and convenient option for 
many borrowers. But these characteris -
tics also hold potential risks.
Identifying who is using digital credit, 
the ways it is used, and the risks borrowers experience is critical for 
understanding the role digital credit 
plays in borrowers’ financial portfolios 
and how it affects financial inclusion. 
A deeper understanding is also critical 
for identifying actions providers, policy 
makers, investors, and development 
actors can take to maximize the bene -
fits of digital credit while minimizing 
risks. See Box 1 for a brief description of 
digital credit, as it is referred to in this 
paper.
BOX 1. What is digital credit?
Digital credit in this study refers to loans that are delivered and repaid digitally, 
typically over a mobile phone. We differentiate digital credit from conventional 
loans by identifying three key characteristics: digital credit is instant, automated, 
and remote (Chen and Mazer 2016).
Instant . Digital lenders use digital data, such as airtime top-ups, mobile phone call 
records, and app-based data (on smartphones), on potential borrowers to make 
near-instant credit decisions. Disbursement also happens quickly because loans 
are delivered digitally.
Automated . From registration to application, disbursement, and repayment, 
lender decisions and actions are automated based on preset parameters.
Remote . Loan applications, disbursements, and repayments are managed and con -
ducted remotely, generally eliminating human interaction from the loan process.
In Kenya and Tanzania, loan sizes are typically US$30–50, though they can vary and 
increase with positive repayment history. Repayment periods are usually around 
four weeks (Hwang and Tellez-Merchan 2016).
Digital lenders take a variety of forms. The most commonly used digital lenders 
in Kenya and Tanzania (e.g., M-Shwari and M-Pawa) involve partnerships between 
mobile network operators (MNOs), which manage mobile money wallets and 
agent networks, and banks, which provide loans and assess creditworthiness 
using data from the MNOs. These credit offerings come with an associated savings 
account provided by the bank partner.
A second configuration involves an MNO partnering with a nonbank financial insti -
tution. This type of partnership is like an MNO-bank partnership, though nonbank 
financial institutions cannot provide formal savings accounts and are not regulated 
in the same way as banks.
In a third configuration, lenders operate and lend through smartphone-based 
apps. These lenders use data from a smartphone, such as geospatial data and 
data from social media apps, to assess creditworthiness.
Other configurations include a partnership that contracts with a third party to 
analyze creditworthiness of potential borrowers and others.5
A Digital Credit RevolutionCGAP , Financial Sector Deepening Kenya 
(FSD Kenya), and Financial Sector Deep -
ening Tanzania (FSD Tanzania) conducted 
large-scale phone surveys of digital credit 
users and nonusers in Kenya and Tanza -
nia to learn more about their experiences 
with digital credit. The study also aims to 
contribute to international discussions 
on responsible digital finance, including 
efforts of the Global Partnership for Fi -
nancial Inclusion (GPFI) and the G20 on 
Principle 5 of the High-Level Principles 
for Digital Financial Inclusion.
As the first large-scale demand-side 
surveys dedicated to these topics, the 
study emphasized identifying potential 
risks emerging from these new credit 
sources. The results shed light on mar -
ket development and evolution in the 
two leading digital credit markets and 
provide insights on how more nascent 
markets might evolve.
Digital credit’s beginnings: Context
Digital credit initially took off with the 
launch of M-Shwari in Kenya in Novem -
ber 2012, five years after the launch of the 
M-Pesa mobile money service. Created 
through a partnership between Commer -
cial Bank of Africa (CBA) and Safaricom, 
M-Shwari provides a savings account and access to digital loans through the M-Pe -
sa platform. Leveraging Safaricom’s and 
CBA’s strengths, including Safaricom’s 
brand and network of over 100,000 mo -
bile money agents and CBA’s risk man -
agement experience, M-Shwari attracted 
KSh 24 billion in deposits and disbursed 
KSh 7.8 billion in loans in just one year af -
ter launch. M-Shwari had a head start on 
the competition thanks to an exclusivity 
agreement between Safaricom and CBA 
that initially limited Safaricom’s ability to 
offer competing lending services embed -
ded on the M-Pesa platform. While other 
services such as Tala and M-Coop Cash 
launched their own app-based platforms 
in 2014 and grew considerably, they are 
limited to customers with smartphones, 
and they have not reached the scale of 
M-Shwari.
The first digital lender in Tanzania, M-  
Pawa, launched in 2014. Like M-Shwari, 
M-Pawa was a partnership between CBA 
and an MNO—Vodacom Tanzania. Six 
months later, Airtel Tanzania launched a 
competing service called Timiza with AFB, 
a pan-Africa nonbank credit provider. The 
following year, Tigo Tanzania launched 
Tigo Nivushe in partnership with Jumo 
Tanzania, a nonbank mobile lending plat -
form. See Table 1 for a summary of the top 
lenders in Kenya and Tanzania.

A Digital Credit RevolutionIn 2015, several developments and new 
entrants significantly expanded the 
reach of digital credit in Kenya. First, 
smartphone penetration continued to 
grow, which increased the pool of po -
tential customers for app-based lenders 
such as Tala, M-Coop Cash, and new en -
trant Branch, which launched in 2015. 
Second, the contractual agreement that 
restricted Safaricom’s ability to part -
ner with others beyond CBA expired in 
2015. This allowed Kenya Commercial 
Bank (KCB) to partner with Safaricom 
to launch KCB M-Pesa on the M-Pesa 
network. Third, Equity Bank introduced 
a mobile virtual network operator 
(MVNO) that runs on Airtel’s network to 
offer a range of digital financial services, 
including a full mobile banking solution 
and a digital credit product called Eazzy 
Loans.
In 2016, instability in Kenya’s banking 
sector decreased many institutions’ ap -
petites for risk. Moreover, the Kenyan 
government introduced an interest rate 
cap for regulated lenders of 4 percent -
age points above the Central Bank rate, 
which has remained between 9 per -
cent and 10 percent (for a total of about 
13–14 percent interest) since the cap 
was instated (CBK n.d.). Although the 
cap has not immobilized the digital cred -
it market, it has led to significant chang -
es. KCB M-Pesa and Equity Eazzy Loans 
lowered their interest rates and intro -
duced other fees that brought the total 
cost closer to, but still lower than, the 
previous rate. Equity reduced the loan 
limits for a significant number of Eazzy 
Loans customers, and KCB M-Pesa tem -
porarily stopped offering longer term 
(three and six months) loans. CBA made 
no changes to its pricing, and stated that 
the interest rate cap did not apply to 
M-Shwari’s 7.5 percent monthly “facil -
itation” fee. CBA successfully defended 
this position in court after the Consumer 
Federation of Kenya sued CBA and Cen -
tral Bank of Kenya (Fayo 2018).In sum, the cap narrowed the range of 
products on offer, effectively decreasing 
providers’ interest in experimenting or 
taking risks. In May 2018, the Kenyan 
Treasury Cabinet Secretary proposed the 
full repeal of the interest rate cap law in 
his 2018 budget speech (Herbling and 
Genga 2018). However, the proposal was 
opposed by some members of parliament 
and, as of July 2018, the way forward is 
unclear (Kamau and Omondi 2018).
Regulatory infrastructure
The advent of digital credit introduced 
complex regulatory questions, particu -
larly those related to consumer protec -
tion and credit reporting. In both Kenya 
and Tanzania, general consumer protec -
tion regulation applies to digital credit 
products offered by or with a regulated 
financial institution. The rules, however, 
do not apply to nonregulated digital 
credit products, including those from 
app-based and “over-the-top” lenders or 
from partnerships between MNOs and 
unregulated lenders. This results in an 
uneven playing field, where regulated 
and unregulated lenders operate under 
different rules
For regulated lenders, the rules in both 
countries require clear disclosures of 
all fees and charges associated with a 
digital loan. In Kenya, banks are further 
required to present standardized APRs 
for traditional credit products (to be lis-
ted on the website https://www.costof  
credit.co.ke/ ), but not for digital credit 
products.
Both countries have credit reporting re -
quirements. The first credit reference 
bureau (CRB) in Kenya was licensed 
in 2010 and in Tanzania in 2013. Since 
2014, CBK has required regulated banks 
and MFIs in Kenya to report “full-file” 
credit histories, meaning positive as 
well as negative items. Enforcement has 
been inconsistent, however, and one of 7
A Digital Credit Revolutionthe largest lenders initially reported 
only negative information, impeding 
other lenders from accurately assessing 
potential customers’ risk profiles and 
narrowing borrowers’ options. Similarly, 
in Tanzania, regulated providers are re -
quired to report credit information.
These rules on disclosure requirements 
and credit reporting do not apply to 
nonregulated lenders in either coun -
try. In Kenya, nonregulated lenders can 
report to CRBs with permission from 
their customers and approval by CBK, 
but they are not required to report to 
CRBs. In Tanzania, one CRB announced 
in 2016 that it would begin collecting 
information from informal financial ser -
vices providers that are not regulated by 
the Bank of Tanzania, but such reporting 
is optional. Further, the interest rate cap 
in Kenya does not apply to nonregulated 
lenders, meaning that some digital lend -
ers can charge substantially different 
rates than others, and as a result offer 
different types of loans.
Survey methodology
To understand customer experiences 
with digital credit, uses of digital credit, and emerging risks, CGAP , FSD Kenya, 
and FSD Tanzania partnered to conduct 
large-scale demand-side surveys on dig -
ital credit use in Kenya and Tanzania in 
2017. The surveys measured customer 
experiences with digital credit, uses of 
digital credit, customer risks associated 
with digital credit, market penetration 
of digital credit, and demographics of 
digital credit users. The surveys in both 
countries were conducted via phone, 
and the samples were weighted to be 
representative of mobile phone owners 
in each country.1 Because using digi -
tal credit requires access to a mobile 
phone, the subsample that had used 
digital credit can be considered repre -
sentative of digital credit borrowers. 
(See Table 2.)
Respondents who had not used digital 
credit answered a set of brief ques -
tions on demographics and use of fi -
nancial services, while respondents 
who had used digital credit answered 
the full questionnaire about their use 
of and experiences with digital credit. 
The result are comparable because the 
same questionnaire was used in both 
markets. See Annex 1 for details on 
methodology.

A Digital Credit RevolutionPENETRATION OF DIGITAL CREDIT
More than a third of mobile phone owners 
in Kenya and a fifth in Tanzania have tak -
en out a digital loan—representing about 
6 million unique borrowers in Kenya and 
4 million in Tanzania.2 (See Figure 1.)
The digital credit market is more concen -
trated in Kenya than it is in Tanzania, with 
29 percent of phone owners (82 percent 
of digital borrowers) having used the 
leading lender, M-Shwari, and 12 percent 
of phone owners (34 percent of digital 
borrowers) having used the closest com -
petitor, KCB M-Pesa.3 In Tanzania, the mar -
ket is split more evenly, with 10 percent of 
phone owners (48 percent of digital bor -
rowers) having used M-Pawa, 8 percent of phone owners (39 percent of digital 
borrowers) having used Timiza, and 6 
percent of phone owners (29 percent of 
digital borrowers) having used Nivushe.
The concentration in the Kenyan market 
suggests that M-Shwari benefitted from 
first-mover advantage (reinforced by the 
CBA-Safaricom exclusivity agreement) 
and maintained that advantage even af -
ter others launched. It continues to enjoy 
a greater market share than KCB M-Pesa, 
even though the two services operate on 
the same M-Pesa platform and there -
fore have access to the same customer 
base. Because lenders use data-driven 
algorithms to determine credit limits,

were weighted to be representative of phone owners. Multiple responses were allowed.FIGURE 1. Share of mobile phone owners who have borrowed from each lender

2 In Kenya, about 77 percent of adults own a mobile phone, for an estimated total digital credit penetration of 27 percent of 
the adult population. Approximately 63 percent of adults own a mobile phone in Tanzania, for an estimated digital credit 
penetration of 13 percent of the adult population.
3 Many digital borrowers have used more than one digital lender.9
A Digital Credit RevolutionM-Shwari may benefit from a longer 
period of data collection on repayment 
behaviors. More data can enable lenders 
to better tailor loan offers and possibly 
offer larger loans to those with strong 
repayment history, potentially keeping 
borrowers loyal. M-Shwari’s persistent 
popularity could also indicate that the 
relationship between borrowers and 
lenders is sticky, with borrowers hesi -
tant to switch.
Despite operating on Tanzania’s most 
popular mobile money platform and 
launching before any other digital cre dit 
product in the country, M-Pawa does not 
have the same outsized lead in Tanzania 
as M-Shwari has in Kenya. The mobile 
money market is also more competitive 
in Tanzania than in Kenya, driving 
greater competition for services like 
lending offered on the mobile money 
platforms.
Active rates
Digital borrowers tend to be active— 
60 percent of Tanzanian borrowers had at least one digital loan outstanding at 
the time of the survey, as did 54 per -
cent of Kenyan digital borrowers (see 
Figure 2). To put this in context, borrow -
ing from family and friends is the most 
common type of traditional, nondigital 
borrowing among the digital borrowers 
in our surveys. Of those who have bor -
rowed from family or friends, 27 percent 
of Tanzanians and 29 percent of Kenyans 
had a current loan from a family mem -
ber or friend at the time of the survey, so 
the active rate for digital loans is about 
double in each country.
Add to these numbers those who had 
borrowed digitally in the past 90 days 
(but did not have a current loan outstand -
ing), and fully 67 percent of Tanzania’s 
digital borrowers were 90-day active, as 
were 64 percent of Kenya’s borrowers. 
The similar active rates in both markets, 
which have different market histories 
and structures, indicate that, at least in 
these two countries, once borrowers 
engage with digital credit, they typically 
remain active by taking out additional 
loans.

A Digital Credit RevolutionBy actively borrowing and repaying, 
many borrowers build positive repay -
ment histories. Most digital lending 
models use such repayment histories to 
increase loan size, but keep interest or 
fee rates and repayment periods fixed—
limiting borrowers’ ability to qualify for 
and use loans for longer-term invest -
ments. Recently, M-Shwari announced 
plans to segment borrowers by credit 
history and offer lower rates to bor -
rowers with good credit history (Ngugi 
2017). Based on the high active rates in 
Kenya and Tanzania, more lenders could 
take advantage of the positive credit his -
tory data they are obtaining to vary loan 
size, interest rate, and repayment period, 
thus deepening the credit markets and 
allowing loans to be used for broader 
and possibly more productive purposes.
Multiple borrowing
Thirty-five percent of Kenyan digital bor -
rowers have borrowed from more than 
one digital lender as have 15 percent of 
Tanzanian digital borrowers. The high 
percentage in Kenya is primarily due to 
M-Shwari borrowers who have also bor -
rowed from another digital lender. This in -
dicates that digital lenders in Kenya should 
be aware that many of their customers al -
ready have a credit history with M-Shwari. 
Because M-Shwari had little competition 
for its first few years of operation, early 
M-Shwari borrowers may have been try -
ing other offers as they became available.
Further, 14 percent of digital borrowers 
in Kenya had multiple digital loans out -
standing at the time of the survey, com -
pared to 6 percent of digital borrowers 
in Tanzania. In Kenya, a borrower using 
Safaricom’s phone service and M-Pesa 
mobile money can directly access both 
M-Shwari and KCB M-Pesa through their 
mobile money menu. In Tanzania, where 
the top digital lenders operate through different mobile money platforms, a 
borrower would need SIM cards with 
two different phone and mobile money 
services, and would need to build a data 
history with each, to access loans from 
multiple providers.
While multiple borrowing can indicate 
high latent demand for credit, it can also 
lead to negative consumer outcomes. Dig -
ital lenders are unlikely to know about 
other outstanding loans their borrow -
ers have because they often rely on data 
they or their partners hold rather than 
data from external sources, such as cre-
dit bureaus, to assess creditworthiness 
(Owens 2018).4 Even those that do check 
credit scores may not have a full picture 
of borrowers’ outstanding debts because 
CRBs typically receive data monthly 
(rather than daily or in real time), which 
means data on other short-term digital 
loans may not be up to date. The lack of 
data on other outstanding loans can re -
sult in loan offers that do not adequately 
consider ability to repay. For borrowers, 
the easy access to multiple digital loans 
combined with behavioral biases such as 
loss aversion and present bias can result 
in borrowing more than they need or can 
repay (Mazer and McKee 2017).
Multiple borrowing can also indicate 
debt cycling—taking out a loan to pay 
off another loan—which can be costly 
(Gordon and Lyon 2017). Debt cycling is 
not a new phenomenon, and it has been 
documented with microfinance loans as 
well (Rutherford 2017). With one-sixth 
of digital borrowers in Kenya balancing 
more than one digital loan simultane -
ously, and more than a third having 
borrowed from multiple digital lenders, 
this is an area where greater transpar -
ency on credit history and current debt 
load and continuous attentiveness and 
information sharing by regulators and 
lenders would be prudent.
4 This was and still is a common problem for microfinance as well. See, e.g., Schicks and Rosenberg (2011).11
A Digital Credit RevolutionDEMOGRAPHICS OF DIGITAL CREDIT BORROWERS
In both markets, young, urban men are 
the most common digital borrowers 
(Figure 3.). Compared to the average 
adult, the typical digital borrower in 
both markets is more likely to live in an 
urban area, be between 26 and 35 years 
old, and have completed at least second -
ary schooling. Education is a strong pre -
dictor of digital credit use in Kenya, with 
72 percent of digital borrowers having 
secondary schooling or above, compared 
to 41 percent of all adults. In Tanzania, 
however, the share of digital borrowers 
who have completed secondary school -
ing (one in four) is only four percentage 
points above the national level.Compared to an earlier study in Kenya, 
the gender gap in digital credit bor -
rowers may be declining. The previous 
study estimated that men represented 
59 percent of unique digital borrow -
ers and women 41 percent—a gap 
of 18 percentage points. The study 
presented in this paper indicates a 
10 percentage-point gap, with 55 per -
cent male and 45 percent female unique 
borrowers (Gichuru 2017). That said, 
the gender gap in terms of volume and 
values of digital lending may persist: 
interviews with providers confirm that 
men tend to borrow more often and 
larger sums on average than women do.

A Digital Credit RevolutionPRIMARY INCOME SOURCES OF DIGITAL CREDIT BORROWERS
In Tanzania, digital credit is concentra-
ted in the relatively small segment of 
entrepreneurs: 50 percent of digital bor -
rowers report self-employment as their 
primary income source, compared with 
only 14 percent of the adult popula -
tion. (See Figure 4). In Kenya, those with 
self-employment as their primary income 
source are also the main users of digital 
credit (31 percent of digital borrowers), 
but the market is otherwise more spread 
across different types of livelihood groups.
In both countries, those with wage 
employment as their main source of income are more likely to use digital 
credit than the rest of the adult popu -
lation.5 In Tanzania, 17 percent of digi -
tal borrowers have wage employment 
as their main source of income, ver -
sus 6 percent of all adults. Similarly in 
Kenya, 20 percent of digital borrowers 
have wage employment as their main 
source of income versus 12 percent of 
all adults at the national level. This rel -
atively high penetration among wage 
employees may be driven by scoring al -
gorithms, which favor customers with 
regular cashflows. It also may stem from 
the demand of employees who need

A Digital Credit Revolutionadditional funds between monthly sal-
ary payments. In this case, digital credit 
may be serving a function similar to that 
of payday lending.
In both countries, the penetration of 
digital credit among those with farming, 
casual work, or transfers from others 
as their primary income source is rela -
tively low. Uptake is particularly low for 
the farming and casual work segments 
in Tanzania, both of whom represent 
major livelihood groups (41 percent 
and 20 percent, respectively) but ac -
count for only 18 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of digital credit borrowers. 
In Kenya, the contrast is less striking, 
although uptake is still disproportiona-
tely low among the farming segment 
and those who depend on transfers 
from others. People who report farming, 
casual work, or transfers from others as 
their primary income source are likely 
to be in the most vulnerable segments 
with the greatest liquidity constraints 
and consumption smoothing needs. The 
low uptake among these groups sug -
gests digital credit is not meeting their 
needs in a way that is accessible, afford -
able, or appropriate.14
A Digital Credit RevolutionDIGITAL CREDIT USE CASES
Across Kenya and Tanzania, borrowers 
report two widespread use cases of dig -
ital credit: basic “day-to-day” household 
needs (35 percent and 37 percent, re -
spectively) and working capital for small 
enterprises and self-employment (37 per -
cent and 31 percent, respectively). When 
day-to-day needs and “personal house -
hold goods” (22 percent for Tanzania, 
and 10 percent for Kenya) are combined, 
these household consumption purchases 
are by far the most commonly reported 
use cases for digital credit (Figure 5).6
Because these use cases are self-reported, 
and money is fungible, digital loans could 
have additional effects on borrowers’ financial portfolios beyond reported 
uses. Taking out money for one purpose 
could free up funds for another purpose.7 
Evidence from behavioral economics, 
however, suggests that people often asso -
ciate an account or source of credit with 
a specific purpose, which is called “men -
tal accounting” (Thaler 1999). As such, 
reported use cases give important insight 
into both how the loans are used and the 
kinds of use cases with which borrowers 
associate digital credit.
Purchasing airtime is another common 
use case in Tanzania (36 percent), where -
as it is much less common in Kenya 
(15 percent). This is likely because 
6 In the survey, “meeting day-to-day ordinary household needs” is defined as meeting needs such as food and transportation, 
while “personal or household goods” is defined as goods such as clothes and televisions.
7 Further, self-reported use cases can yield under-reporting of some uses (such as betting), and over reporting of others.Source: National phone survey of N 53,150 in Kenya, of whom 1,037 have used digital credit, and national phone survey 
of N54,574 in Tanzania, of whom 1,132 have used digital credit. Both surveys were conducted June-August 2017 and

Tanzania Kenya15
A Digital Credit RevolutionSafaricom in Kenya provides airtime on 
credit through a service called Okoa Ja -
hazi, which “lends” airtime only, not cash, 
and therefore is not analyzed in this study.
Kenyans are more likely to report us -
ing digital credit to pay school fees 
(20 percent) compared to Tanzanians 
(8 percent). In other research, 75 percent 
of Kenyan households with school-aged 
children reported that they did not have 
funds to pay for school (Kaffenberger 
and Braniff 2016). Further, according to 
the study, 60 percent of households with 
children enrolled in school were sending 
their children to schools that charge fees. 
In Tanzania, both situations are less com -
mon, with 46 percent lacking funds to 
pay for school, and only 18 percent send -
ing children to schools that charge fees. 
This suggests that there could be a mar -
ket in Kenya for loans tailored specifically 
for school fees and to the school calendar.
Small percentages in both countries 
report using digital loans for betting, 
including mobile betting. Because re -
sponses are self-reported, it is possi -
ble that the actual percent using digital 
loans for betting is higher, if respondents 
are reluctant to admit to this practice. 
See Box 2 for more information)
Despite expectations that the speed and 
convenience of digital credit can help the 
poor better cope with emergency expens -
es, few digital borrowers reported hav -
ing used it for these purposes. Less than 
10 percent of digital borrowers in each 
country report having used a digital loan 
for any kind of medical need, including 
medical emergencies, and less than 1 per -
cent of Tanzanian and 2 percent of Kenyan 
digital borrowers report having used a dig -
ital loan for any other kind of emergency.
Loan uses by primary income source 
and gender
In Kenya, there is a close relationship 
between purposes of digital borrowing and primary income source of bor -
rowers (Figure 6). In Tanzania, on the 
other hand, uses of digital credit do not 
vary substantially across these groups 
(Figure 7).
In Kenya, two main groups emerge. The 
first group, borrowers who primarily 
earn income from running their own 
business, is far more likely to report us -
ing digital credit for business purposes. 
For example, anecdotal reports suggest 
considerable volumes of lending in the 
Kenyan market occur early in the morn -
ing, between 3 and 5, mostly by female 
traders who purchase fruits and vege -
tables from wholesale markets to resell 
over the course of the day (FSD Kenya 
2017).
A second group comprises borrowers 
who receive their income primarily 
from wage employment, casual work, or 
transfers from others. This group uses 
digital credit mostly for basic, day-to-day 
consumption needs and for purchasing 
personal or household goods. Education 
is the second most common use case 
for those who primarily receive income 
through transfers from others or from 
wage employment.
Most Tanzanian digital borrowers re -
port similar uses of digital credit re -
gardless of primary income source. 
Day-to-day household needs, airtime, 
and business purposes are the most 
common use cases, with medical needs 
and schooling among the least report -
ed use cases. Individuals who reported 
casual work as their primary income 
source represen ted the main outlier. 
These individuals were much more 
likely to have used digital loans for day-
to-day household needs, which may 
reflect their less consistent income 
streams.
Looking at use cases by gender, women 
in Tanzania are more likely than men to 
report using digital loans for business 16
A Digital Credit RevolutionBOX 2. The rise of mobile betting in Kenya: Reason for concern?
The rise of digital credit in Kenya has raised concerns about its possible connec -
tion to an increase in mobile betting. Although there is limited data on the size 
and volumes of mobile betting in East Africa, recent media reports estimate that 
27 percent of adults in Kenya have engaged in mobile betting—this is, by far, 
the highest in East Africa.a PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated the sports betting 
industry (including both digital and nondigital) was worth $20 million in Kenya in 
2017, and it had the potential to grow to $50 million by 2020.b
Source: National phone survey of N 53,150 in Kenya, of whom 1,037 have used 
digital credit, conducted June-August 2017 and weighted to be representative

It is difficult to determine the exact relationship between digital borrowing and mo -
bile betting from survey data because there is reason to expect under reporting— 
borrowers may be reluctant to reveal that they use their mobile loans for betting. 
Only 3 percent of digital borrowers reported sports betting as a reason for taking 
out a loan. However, when respondents were asked if they had ever tried mobile 
betting, digital borrowers were almost twice as likely to report having tried mobile 
betting compared to nondigital borrowers—16 versus 31 percent, as shown in 
Figure B2-1.
This finding poses more questions than it answers. In addition, the correlation 
may be driven by other confounding factors (e.g., digital borrowing and mobile 
gambling appeal to the same demographics). More research is needed on this issue.

purposes, medical needs, and school 
fees (Figure 8). In contrast, men are 
more likely than women to report us -
ing digital loans for meeting day-to-day 
household needs, purchasing airtime, and paying bills. Similar findings apply 
to the Kenyan market, though in Kenya, 
there is less variation between men 
and women than there is in Tanzania 
(Figure 9).17

A Digital Credit RevolutionLATE REPAYMENTS AND DEFAULTS
Late repayment of digital loans is wide -
spread, with 56 percent of digital bor -
rowers in Tanzania and 47 percent in 
Kenya reporting having ever repaid late 
(Figure 10). Because these numbers are 
self- reported, the actual rates could be 
higher. (For example respondents may 
not have reported instances of late re -
payment if they thought doing so would 
reflect badly on them.)
The similarity in late repayment rates 
in the two markets indicates this is a 
common occurrence with digital loans. 
Qualitative research has suggested 
that the privacy and lack of human 
touch with digital loans makes their 
repayment a lower priority for bor -
rowers, compared to loans from family or community members where bor -
rowers’ local reputations are at stake 
(Mustafa 2017b).
Late repayment can have significant 
consequences for borrowers. Lenders 
typically roll over loans and charge a 
second origination fee on the balance 
at the end of the initial loan period.8 
Further, when borrowers are late in 
repaying their loans, both M-Pawa and 
M-Shwari freeze balances in the associ -
ated savings account up to the amount 
due until the loan and fees are repaid, 
and borrowers cannot use frozen funds 
to repay the loan. Both M-Shwari and 
M-Pawa also reserve the right to close 
a borrower’s account if the loan is not 
repaid 60 days after disbursement

A Digital Credit Revolution(which would be 30 days late for typ -
ical loans), thus preventing customers 
from using the savings product as well 
(CBA 2014b).
If loans remain unpaid, regulated lend -
ers are required to report borrowers to 
CRBs for failure to repay, resulting in a 
listing of a nonperforming loan (CBK 
2014b; BoT 2012). If borrowers subse -
quently repay, the loan listing is changed 
to reflect that it has been paid, and the 
CRB keeps this listing for five years in 
Kenya and for six years in Tanzania. If 
borrowers do not repay and instead 
default on the loan, the nonperforming 
loan listing stays in place.
In both markets, borrowers who have 
repaid late report a variety of reasons 
for doing so (see Table 3).
In Tanzania, 31 percent of digital bor -
rowers reported having ever defaulted 
on a digital loan, while in Kenya, 12 per -
cent reported having ever defaulted. 
This information is self-reported and 
therefore could be underreported out 
of fear or embarrassment. The defini -
tion of “default” is also more ambigu -
ous than “late repayment”, especially 
if borrowers do not understand credit 
reporting requirements, which could 
further contribute to under (or over) 
reporting.
Most digital lenders require borrowers 
to repay a loan before they can take out 
another loan. Therefore, borrowers who 
default on a digital loan cannot access 
other loans from that lender while the 
loan is in default.9 The requirement that 
regulated lenders report nonperforming 
loans to CRBs can also make it harder for 
borrowers to access loans from formal 
lenders, such as banks, which use data 
from CRBs in credit assessments.The Smart Campaign, which has de -
veloped Client Protection Principles 
for microfinance and, more recently, 
has issued recommendations for dig -
ital credit, suggests that while credit 
bureaus are unequivocally important 
for strengthening credit markets, it may 
be beneficial to enact rules prevent -
ing negative credit reporting for small 
loan amounts (Rizzi, Barrès, and Rhyne 
2017). A 2016 TransUnion survey found 
that more than 400,000 Kenyans were 
listed in CRBs for outstanding loans of 
less than Sh 200, presumed to be digital 
loans (Ngigi 2016).
Qualitative research in Kenya has sug -
gested that borrowers typically have 
only limited awareness and knowledge 
of lender practices for reporting to CRBs 
and of processes for checking credit 
history, resolving incorrect entries, and 
clearing negative listings (Mustafa et al. 
2017a). Better understanding of conse -
quences of late repayment and default, 
including implications of being listed 
in a CRB, may help reduce the relative -
ly high share of digital borrowers who 
have repaid late or have defaulted on a 
digital loan.TABLE 3. Reasons for repaying

A Digital Credit RevolutionDefaults by demographics and 
primary income source
In Tanzania, defaulting on digital loans 
is common across demographic seg -
ments and those reporting different 
primary income sources. A similar per -
centage of men (30 percent) and women 
(32 percent) report having defaulted. 
Among education levels, those with 
only primary education are most likely 
to report having defaulted (33 percent), 
but even among those with tertiary 
schooling, a quarter report having de -
faulted. Similarly, among different live -
lihood segments, those with casual 
work as their primary income source 
and those who depend on transfers 
from others for income are most likely 
to report having defaulted (42 percent 
and 38 percent, respectively), but even 
among those with wage employment as 
their primary income source, 26 percent 
report having defaulted (Table 4).
In Kenya, fewer respondents report 
defaulting, but the demographic pat -
terns are similar. Respondents who 
had completed primary education or 
less were most likely to report default -
ing (16 percent), but even among those 
with tertiary education, 11 percent re -
port having defaulted. Across primary 
livelihood segments, those who depend 
on transfers from others are most likely to report having defaulted (17 percent), 
while even among those with wage 
employment as their primary income 
source, one in 10 has defaulted.
The similar shares of respondents 
across heterogeneous demographic and 
income-source segments who report 
having repaid late or defaulted may in -
dicate that ability to repay may not be 
the only, or even the primary, driver of 
repayment behaviors. Qualitative re -
search in both Tanzania and Kenya sug -
gests that digital loans “feel” different 
from traditional loans, and that con -
sumers experience loss and gain dif -
ferently when money is digital (Mazer 
and Fiorillo 2015). While digital loans 
may feel different, the consequences of 
late repayment or default, such as being 
locked out of future loans, can be very 
real. Therefore, actions to make the con -
sequences more salient could improve 
repayment rates and reduce negative 
repercussions.
Actions taken to repay
Even borrowers who do repay digi -
tal loans sometimes struggle to make 
repayments. When asked about spe -
cific actions taken to repay loans, one 
in five digital borrowers in Kenya and 
one in 10 in Tanzania report that they 
have reduced food purchases to repay

nia, 4 percent report this. These behav -

cisely identify the effect of servicing a particular debt on a household’s entire balance sheet.23
A Digital Credit RevolutionTRANSPARENCY AND RECOURSE
Transparency of fees and loan terms
Clear disclosure and transparency of 
digital credit pricing and terms are crit -
ical to ensure borrowers understand 
their obligations and can make informed 
decisions when taking out a loan, and 
they have been recognized as an area 
of concern in digital finance (McKee, 
Kaffenberger, and Zimmerman 2015). 
More than a quarter of digital borrow -
ers in Tanzania reported experiencing 
poor transparency of fees or terms, as 
did nearly a fifth in Kenya (Figure 12). 
Most commonly, these borrowers were 
charged fees they did not expect, indi -
cating poor disclosure or understanding 
of fees. Others reported that lenders un -
expectedly withdrew money from their account—likely indicating policies in 
which lenders could auto-withdraw to 
retrieve loan payments—and that they 
did not fully understand the costs or fees.
In both countries, poor transparency 
was highest among older segments—
roughly those older than 46—and low -
est among the youngest group of 18–25.
In Kenya, poor transparency was high-
est among those with farming or casu -
al work as their primary income source 
(21 percent of each) and lowest among 
those who depend on transfers from 
others.11 In Tanzania, only those report -
ing wage employment as their primary 
income source reported considerably 
lower levels of poor transparency (about

A Digital Credit Revolution20 percent), while other segments had 
similar levels, with 25–28 percent re -
porting poor transparency.
Poor transparency has been well docu -
mented for digital finance products gener -
ally (ITU-T 2017), and with digital credit, 
it can take multiple forms. For example, 
many digital lenders provide access to 
credit terms and conditions only through 
a web link, making this information inac -
cessible to those without internet access 
(Mazer and McKee 2017). Further, inter -
est rates or fees are not displayed in a 
standardized way across lenders, making 
it difficult for borrowers to compare loan 
costs (Kaffenberger and Chege 2016).Digital borrowers in both Kenya and 
Tanzania who reported poor transpar -
ency were also more likely to report 
having repaid a digital loan late or de -
faulted on a digital loan (Figure 13). In 
Tanzania, poor transparency is associ -
ated with a 37 percent higher likelihood 
of having repaid late and 39 percent 
higher likelihood of having defaulted.12 
This finding is supported by experimen -
tation by CGAP that found improving 
transparency can also reduce delin -
quency and improve lenders’ bottom 
lines. The experiments found, for ex -
ample, that making costs of credit more 
salient, by separating loan principle

A Digital Credit Revolutioncosts, reduced defaults. Designing the 
purchase process so that borrowers are 
more likely to review terms and condi -
tions also reduced delinquency (Mazer 
and McKee 2017).
Recourse
Access to adequate recourse is criti -
cal for consumers to be able to seek 
information and help when needed 
(Mckee, Kaffenberger, and Zimmerman 
2015). Timely and responsive com -
plaint resolution mechanisms is one of 
the Client Protection Principles put for -
ward by the Smart Campaign for digital 
credit (Rizzi, Barrès, and Rhyne 2017). 
Only 5 percent of digital borrowers in 
Tanzania and 10 percent in Kenya re -
ported having contacted anyone with a 
question, concern, or complaint about 
their digital loan (Figure 14). This may 
indicate low demand for contacting 
customer care or difficulty doing so. 
In both countries, about 10 percent of digital borrowers reported needing to 
access customer care and being unable 
to figure out how.
In Tanzania, the most common reason 
for contacting customer care was to 
complain about information reported 
to the credit bureau (Figure 15). The 
second most common reason was to re -
port or complain about an unexpected 
charge or fee. Both complaints indicate 
a need for better disclosure of cred -
it reporting policies and loan fees and 
terms.
In Kenya, borrowers most commonly 
contacted customer care to ask about 
the loan amount they qualify for; the 
second most common reason is to ask 
about repayment requirements. Other 
common reasons to contact customer 
care are to report a problem with the 
app or messaging platform, indicating 
possible technology issues, and to re -
quest a higher loan limit.

A Digital Credit RevolutionPOSITIONING OF DIGITAL CREDIT IN EXISTING  
FINANCIAL PORTFOLIOS
In both markets, digital credit reaches 
those who were already more financially 
included. In Kenya, digital borrowers are 
26 percentage points more likely than 
the typical adult to have a bank account, 
while in Tanzania they are 19 percentage 
points more likely (Figure 16). Digital 
borrowers are also more likely to have 
national health insurance and to engage 
with other financial services, including 
pensions and microfinance.
Use of other credit products
In both Kenya and Tanzania, digital bor -
rowers tend to have diversified credit portfolios. Most digital borrowers had 
a least one loan outstanding at the time 
of the survey (including both digital and 
nondigital sources) (Figure 17). One-
third of digital borrowers in Kenya and a 
quarter in Tanzania were “juggling” two 
or more loans, often from diverse sourc -
es (i.e., digital, informal, and formal).
In Kenya, jugglers—those simultane -
ously repaying multiple loans—are 
most likely to earn income primarily 
through self-employment (36 percent 
are jugglers) or farming (35 percent are 
jugglers) and are less likely to depend 
on transfers from others (22 percent).

A Digital Credit RevolutionJugglers are most likely to be between 
36 and 45 years old, and least likely 
to be young (18–25) or elderly (older 
than 55).
In both Kenya and Tanzania, borrow -
ing from a family member or friend 
is the most common nondigital loan 
source and borrowing from a savings 
group is the second most common (see 
Figure 18). Bank loans are about twice 
as common in Kenya (9 percent) as in 
Tanzania (5 percent), and savings and 
credit cooperative organizations (SAC -
COs) are much more common in Kenya 
than in Tanzania.
Digital credit as a substitute and 
complement to other loan sources
In Kenya, 63 percent of digital borrow -
ers say they have reduced their use of at least one type of (nondigital) loan source 
since they gained access to digital loans 
(see Table 5). This suggests some level 
of a substitution effect. Thirty percent 
of digital borrowers reported reducing 
use of shopkeeper credit, 19 percent 
reduced use of conventional bank cred -
it, and 15 percent reduced use of loans 
from savings groups and 15 percent 
from family and friends. These data sug -
gest that, while digital borrowers in Ken -
ya continue to use many types of loans, 
they use them less often after accessing 
digital credit and substitute occasionally 
with digital loans. This likely represents 
an attempt by digital borrowers to keep 
their credit portfolio diversified and 
to avoid relying excessively on a single 
source of credit.

A Digital Credit Revolutionend financial relationships with their 
social networks or informal institutions 
just because they are using digital credit. 
Rather, they seem to expand their port -
folio and favor digital loans when they 
are the best option.
In Tanzania, this dynamic is less obvi -
ous, likely because use of other financial 
services is lower than in Kenya to begin 
with (see Figure 16). Thirty-four percent 
of digital borrowers in Tanzania report 
having reduced their use of other loan 
sources since accessing digital credit. 
The main sources affected are loans from 
friends and family (17 percent of digital 
borrowers reduced use of these loans) 
and shopkeeper credit (15 percent). In 
Tanzania, therefore, digital credit is pri -
marily expanding and complementing 
the credit available to and used by bor -
rowers, while in Kenya there is more 
substitution among options.How different credit 
sources are used
Different loan sources provide differ -
ent loan sizes at different costs, and 
with varying repayment periods, reper -
cussions for late repayment, and other 
terms and conditions, making each fit for 
different purposes. Understanding how 
digital borrowers use digital loans com -
pared to other loan types is instructive 
for understanding the place digital loans 
hold in their financial portfolios.
While, in both markets, day-to-day 
household needs are among the most 
common reported use case for digital 
credit, digital borrowers are even more 
likely to turn to informal sources for 
these needs rather than to digital sources 
(see Figures 19 and 20). In Tanzania, the 
dynamic is similar for business loans;

more commonly used than digital credit. 
This suggests that while the use of dig -
ital credit has expanded rapidly, other 
sources continue to have advantages.
In Kenya, borrowers report using digital 
loans and formal loans at similar levels for 
business purposes. The combination of 
digital and formal loans for business fits 
with findings from an earlier study of mer -
chant digital credit, which found that most 
merchants who took out digital loans used them to augment bank loans that were not 
quite big enough—indicating bank loans 
were the first choice, and digital loans 
were supplementary for business purpo-
ses (Kaffenberger and Nguyen 2017).
In Tanzania, the only use case where dig -
ital loans are more commonly used than 
either informal or other formal loans 
sources is for airtime purchases. Box 3 
provides additional insights on credit 
sources and livelihoods in Kenya.32
A Digital Credit RevolutionBox 3. Credit portfolios in Kenya
Among all phone owners surveyed—including digital borrowers and nondigital 
borrowers—livelihoods are an important determinant of credit portfolios in Kenya. 
Those who primarily earn income from wage employment (12 percent of adults) 
are the most likely to have a loan from a formal institution (e.g., banks, SACCOs, 
microfinance institutions) and are the least likely to have a loan from informal 
sources (e.g., friends, family, savings groups).
One in four phone owners in this wage employment segment also had an active digi -
tal loan at the time of the survey. Phone owners who primarily earn income from their 
own business are most likely to have a digital loan, and they are slightly less likely to 
use informal loans. Informal loans are prominent among those who primarily receive 
income from farming, casual work, or transfers from others. However, 10 percent of 
the farming segment also accesses formal loans, especially from credit cooperatives.

These questions were not asked of nondigital borrowers in Tanzania, so similar comparisons cannot be drawn.33
A Digital Credit RevolutionDIGITAL SAVINGS
The surveys also examined use of digi -
tal savings accounts, which digital lend -
ers offer in both markets. Regulated 
products (those that are operated by, or 
through a partnership with, a regulat -
ed financial institution, such as a bank) 
offer formal savings accounts. An exam -
ple of a regulated product is M-Shwari, 
which provides mobile savings accounts 
with CBA, a regulated bank. Digital sav -
ings accounts allow customers to save 
and earn interest digitally, and data on 
savings behaviors are inputs to cred -
it assessments. Nonregulated lenders, 
such as app-based lenders and nonbank 
institutions that operate outside the 
purview of central banks cannot pro -
vide these formal accounts. However, 
digital financial services users often 
treat mobile money wallets as a means 
for longer-term stored value, much like a traditional savings account from a reg -
ulated institution.
The Kenya survey asked digital borrow -
ers about their use of formal digital sav -
ings accounts offered by M-Shwari (with 
CBA), KCB M-Pesa (with KCB Bank), Eq -
uity Eazzy savings (with Equity Bank), 
and M-Coop Cash (with Co-Operative 
Bank). In Tanzania, only M-Shwari is of -
fered through a formal bank, CBA, and 
therefore digital borrowers were also 
asked about saving digitally with Tigo 
Pesa and Airtel Money, both of which 
would involve saving and earning inter -
est in a mobile wallet.

in both markets currently save digi -

than a fifth in each country having never

Looking at digital savings by provider, 
M-Shwari dominates the market in Kenya, 
with 75 percent of digital borrowers 
having saved with it at some point. KCB 
M-Pesa has much lower savings use, at 
26 percent (see Figure 22). In Tanzania, 
the market is more diverse, with about 
half having saved with M-Pawa, 40 per -
cent with Tigo Pesa, and 33 percent with 
Airtel Money (see Figure 23). Some pro -
viders require all customers to make an 
initial deposit in the mobile savings ac -
count to qualify for a loan.
In Kenya, a slightly higher percentage of 
men than women had some money in digital savings at the time of the inter -
view (48 percent of men, 43 percent of 
women). A higher percentage of women 
had saved digitally in the past (39 per -
cent), but not at the time of the survey 
(33 percent).
Respondents report using digital sav -
ings for a diverse set of purposes (see 
Figure 24). A third of borrowers in 
Tanzania, and less than a fifth in Kenya, 
were using digital savings for business 
purposes. Basic consumption needs, in -
cluding for household and personal goods, 
were common reasons in both markets.
Saving to access digital loans is an import -
ant underlying motivator in both mar -
kets. Saving to “increase the loan amount” 
and to “access a loan” are both among the 35

A Digital Credit Revolutiontop five reasons for digital savings in both 
markets. This behavior was also identi -
fied soon after M-Shwari’s launch, when 
it was reported that potential borrow -
ers would make a deposit and soon after 
withdraw money from digital savings ac -
counts in hopes of increasing their loan 
limits (McCaffrey, Obiero, and Mugweru 
2013). While credit scoring algorithms 
can use savings behavior as an input in determining loan qualifications, the algo -
rithms use many other data points and 
this is far from a guaranteed way to in -
crease loan sizes (Kaffenberger 2014).
Saving for education and emergencies 
of various types (medical, fire, theft, 
etc.) play important roles in Kenya. In 
Tanzania, saving for bill payments is 
much more common than in Kenya.37

Millions of Kenyans and Tanzanians who 
had been excluded from formal credit 
markets now have access to technology 
that can deliver microloans within sec -
onds and build a credit history that can, in 
theory, enable access to larger and cheaper 
loans. This represents a tremendous step 
toward formal financial inclusion, but it is 
critical to understand the economic and 
social outcomes associated with the use 
of digital credit and balance the benefits 
of these new credit sources with potential 
risks. The survey findings presented in 
this report suggest several key messages 
for providers, policy makers, investors, 
and donors on how to enable responsible 
credit access as digital credit continues to 
grow and expand into new markets.
Adapt services
Despite growing market competition, 
digital credit remains mostly out of 
reach or unused by the most vulnerable 
groups, such as those relying on farm -
ing and casual work as their primary in -
come sources, that are characterized by 
irregular cash flows. If digital credit is to 
serve these populations, services would 
need to be appropriately and adequa-
tely adapted, for example, through more 
nuanced algorithms, flexible repayment 
structures, timeframes suited to manag -
ing the uncertainty and the seasonality 
of rural livelihoods, and pricing that con -
siders borrowers’ ability to repay. This 
requires deeper understanding of these 
segments’ financial lives, the key risks 
they face, and their day-to-day liquid -
ity needs.14 Further, digital credit may 
prove not to be an appropriate solution 
for these segments. In such cases, the 
focus should turn to other solutions for 
building resilience and meeting liquidity 
needs.Identify graduation pathways
Another opportunity in the digital cred -
it market is to identify clearer and more 
direct graduation pathways for borrow -
ers who build positive credit histories. 
Survey data and interviews with provid -
ers suggest that high volumes of digital 
credit are driven by a segment of active 
users, usually small traders and entre -
preneurs, who borrow multiple times 
every month, or even every week. There 
is little evidence that these borrowers 
have opportunities to graduate to more 
affordable loans with longer repayment 
periods. Many borrowers, therefore, re -
main stuck with low-value, short-term, 
expensive credit, and they could poten -
tially benefit from loans with terms bet -
ter designed for productive uses.
Improve transparency and 
consumer protection
A third important area is to improve the 
monitoring mechanisms for transpa-
rency and consumer protection in the 
digital credit marketplace. Regulators 
and supervisors need better tools to 
track potential risks, including poor 
transparency, over-indebtedness, and 
multiple borrowing. Use of phone sur -
veys such as those cited in this paper 
are relatively low-cost and can help reg -
ulators spot concerns. Auditing lenders’ 
loan disclosures can also enable regula -
tors to identify problematic disclosure 
and transparency practices.
Credit reporting requirements and cre-
dit bureau functioning may also need 
to be updated. Credit bureaus are ill-
equipped to manage the speed of digi -
tal credit. Many customers borrow and 
repay within a short time, but digital 
14 Some of which could be gained through analyzing existing data sources such as CGAP’s Smallholder Financial Diaries 
(http://www.cgap.org/data/data-financial-diaries-smallholder-families ).38
A Digital Credit Revolutionlenders submit data to CRBs monthly, so 
lenders accessing CRB data cannot as -
sess borrower risk in real time. This can 
lead to lending more than a borrower 
can repay given other existing loan com -
mitments. As the market develops, reg -
ulators need to ensure an appropriate 
infrastructure for data submission and 
continuous monitoring of debt stress 
among borrowers.
Moreover, between 2015 and 2018 
many unregulated lenders who operate 
beyond the purview of any regulatory 
authority entered the markets in both 
Kenya and Tanzania. Regulations should 
be extended to cover all lenders, includ -
ing currently unregulated ones, so that 
all borrowers have the same protections. 
In May 2018, Kenya’s Finance Ministry 
proposed a draft bill that would estab -
lish a Financial Sector Ombudsman, a Fi -
nancial Sector Tribunal, and a Financial 
Markets Conduct Authority, the latter 
of which would, among other duties, 
license and oversee digital lenders 
(Omondi 2018; Government of Kenya 
2018). These changes could significantly improve consumer protection and fi -
nancial stability in Kenya.
Improve the role of 
development partners
Development partners can play a great -
er role in mitigating risks and ensuring 
that digital credit markets grow respon -
sibly. Investors can leverage their influ -
ence over the industry by supporting 
responsible actors through their invest -
ment decisions and guiding investees 
through active engagement. In June 
2018, the Responsible Finance Forum 
launched Investing in Responsible Digi -
tal Financial Inclusion Guidelines, which 
provide guidance to development fi -
nance institutions and other investors 
(RFF 2018). Donors and other devel -
opment actors can work with market 
facilitators and country regulators to 
support development of regulatory and 
supervisory frameworks that adequa-
tely address existing and emerging risks. 
Donors and investors should work to 
ensure their funding is minimizing neg -
ative consumer  outcomes.39
A Digital Credit RevolutionAPPENDIX 1. SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Surveys in both countries were conduc-
ted by phone and followed the method -
ologies described in this annex.
Tanzania
In Tanzania, the sample was drawn using 
a random digital dial (RDD) technique— 
a common approach for large-scale 
phone surveys. The approach begins by 
randomly generating a list of possible 
mobile phone numbers from the com -
bination of numbers available. The raw 
list of possible numbers is then “pulse-
checked” using an autodialer to produce 
a list of active mobile phone numbers. 
Finally, the list of active numbers is strat -
ified based on mobile service provider 
distribution to obtain a representative 
sample. Enumerators call the phone 
numbers on the final list and administer 
the survey. This is done until the desired 
sample size is reached. Each number is 
redialed up to three times if the respon -
dent is not available or does not answer 
the initial calls.
A total of 4,574 respondents completed 
the survey; 1,132 of them had used digital 
credit. The final sample of 4,574 res-
pondents was weighted on demogra phic 
characteristics to be representative of 
adult mobile phone owners in the country. 
Innovations for Poverty Action conducted 
the fieldwork in June-August 2017.
To compare digital credit users with 
all Tanzanian adults, select data points 
from the 2017 FinScope dataset were 
also analyzed.15 The FinScope data were 
collected through a nationally represen -
tative, in-person household survey. The 
survey collects data on demographics 
such as gender breakdown and educa -
tion attainment of Tanzanian adults as 
well as mobile money use, bank account use, and more. These data were used to 
draw comparisons, such as identifying 
how the gender or education break -
down for digital credit users differs from 
the Tanzanian adult population overall.
Kenya
In Kenya, FSD Kenya partnered with the 
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Kenya 
National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 
for the survey and sampling approach. 
The phone survey used the 2016 FinAc -
cess Household Survey respondents as 
a sampling frame. The FinAccess survey 
is a nationally representative, in-person, 
household survey that includes 8,665 re -
spondents. Of those interviewed for the 
FinAccess survey, 85 percent consented 
to be contacted for follow-up surveys or 
questions. The sample for the phone sur -
vey was selected randomly from a pool 
of these respondents. As in Tanzania, the 
sample of respondents to the phone sur -
vey was weighted to be representative of 
adult phone owners.
The phone survey included 3,150 re -
spondents; 1,037 of them had used 
digital credit. IPSOS conducted the field -
work in Kenya in mid-2017. Moreover, 
to gain a deeper understanding of the 
market, FSD Kenya partnered with some 
of the largest digital credit providers in 
Kenya to interview and analyze an ad -
ditional sample of approximately 5,000 
recent digital credit borrowers from 
the lenders’ customer lists. These data 
are covered by a nondisclosure agree -
ment and are not shown in this report. 
However, insights from this additional 
research and from the discussions with 
providers were used to improve the in -
terpretation of the findings and identify 
relevant implications for policy makers, 
industry players, and researchers.
15 Because the phone survey includes adults with access to a phone only, FinScope provides a better comparison to all adults 
in Tanzania. For information on FinScope, see Financial Sector Deepening Trust (n.d.).40
