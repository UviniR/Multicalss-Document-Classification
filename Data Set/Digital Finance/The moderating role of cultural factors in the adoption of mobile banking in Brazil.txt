Abstract
Purpose –This study aims to evaluate the impact of country culture, represented by Hofstede cultural
dimensions, in the adoption of Brazilian mobile banking services.
Design/methodology/approach –Based on the replication of a theoretical model previously tested in
Mozambique (Africa) that combines the extended version of the uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use of
technology (UTAUT2) with the ﬁve Hofstede cultural dimensions, this study tested that model in another
emerging country, Brazil, using partial least squares (PLS) as a modeling method.
Findings –Replication showed that the cultural d imensions do not present strong signi ﬁcance in the
moderation of the use of mobile banking. In fact, out of the ﬁve dimensions tested, three were not signi ﬁcant and
two showed weak signi ﬁcance ( p<0.10): collectivism and short-term orient ation. Those results, contrasting with
that one presented by Baptista and Oliveira (2015) , made sense under Ajzen ’s theory (1991) –the TPB, leading to
the conclusion that the moderation of cultural d imensions on behavior use is not applicable.
Originality/value –The authors concluded that the tested model may not be adherent, ﬁnding a theoretical
gap to be explored in future studies: the moderation of the behavioral intention by cultural variables proposedby Hofstede. That ﬁnding supported the proposition of a new theoretical model, which considers the
moderation of cultural dimensions in another place: behavioral intention to use mobile banking instead of the
behavior use, as proposed by
Baptista and Oliveira (2015) . So, based on the research results and based on some
authors cited in this study ( Choi et al.,2 0 1 4 ;C h o u ,2 0 1 3 ; Srite and Karahanna, 2006 ), it is proposed to insert
Hofstede cultural variables as moderators of independent variables on the behavioral intention.

1. Introduction
Profusion of innovation based on mobile technologies connected to the internet is happening
at an unprecedented rate ( Chen and Chan, 2014 ). People ’s lives have been invaded by devices
such as smartphones and tablets, affecting the way they communicate and relate to otherindividuals, either by instant messaging or social networks ( Nikou and Mezei, 2013 ). It is a
so signi ﬁcant trend that there are already more mobile phones in the world than bank
accounts ( Chauhan, 2015 ).
At same time, the banking industry seeks to introduce a new service channel to its
customers, actually a transformational channel ( Zhou et al. , 2010 ) that has mobile
technologies to support such a strategy in the post-internet banking era ( Leeet al.,2 0 1 5 ).
Mobile banking is the platform that makes possible to carry out banking transactions viamobile devices connected to the internet ( Lin, 2011 ). In addition to being innovative andRole of cultural

strategic for ﬁnancial institutions, mobile banking services also allow lower operating costs
(Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ) and higher quality in the services provided ( Moser, 2015 ). It has
been noticed, however, that people rarely use mobile banking in the world ( Lin, 2011 ;Yu,
2012;Zhou et al.,2 0 1 0 ).
A recent bibliometric review prepared by Shaikh and Karjaluoto (2015) corroborates that
conclusion of low adoption, showing that, for a world population of 7.1 billion people in2011, there were only 8.6 per cent of the total with mobile banking accounts in the world.Moser (2015) uses a percentage of 8 per cent of consumers worldwide as mobile banking
adopters, considering them as early adopters. An annual report issued by the organization
that represents more than 90 per cent of all ﬁnancial institutions in a developed country like
Brazil shows that 9.5 million people (or 6.6 per cent) use mobile banking intensively for a
population of 143.9 million banked people in the country ( FEBRABAN, 2017 ), con ﬁrming
low adoption.
Shaikh and Karjaluoto (2015) also suggest that studies on mobile banking shall consider
cultural factors, mainly in developing countries where cultural factors like individualism,
uncertainty avoidance and masculinity/femininity ( Hofstede et al. , 2010 ) have positive
impact on factors (trust and privacy, utility expectancy, effort expectancy) that in ﬂuence
mobile banking adoption behavioral intention ( Bankole et al. ,2 0 1 1 ). In the same study,
power distance ( Hofstede et al., 2010 ) appears as a cultural factor that positively in ﬂuences
behavioral intention. National culture is a factor that impacts antecedents on mobile
banking adoption ( Mortimer et al., 2015 ), so it may be an important misconception to ignore
those cultural dimensions and to stick only to the in ﬂuence of psychological or functional
drivers ( Nistor et al.,2 0 1 4 ).
The same bibliometric study ( Shaikh and Karjaluoto, 2015 ) also explains that research on
the adoption of mobile banking has concentrated on three main theoretical models:innovation diffusion theory (IDT) ( Rogers, 1962 ), technology acceptance model (TAM)
(Davis, 1989 ) and uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT/UTAUT2)
(Venkatesh et al. ,2 0 1 2 ). UTAUT2 is differentiated, however, by unifying the concepts of
ITD, TAM and UTAUT, as well as by the focus on research directed at ﬁnal consumers.
It is an unusual combination, however, to reconcile UTAUT2 and cultural dimensions
(Hofstede et al., 2010 ) to explain the adoption of a technological innovation. Regarding the
adoption of mobile banking, for instance, in the review of the literature on the subject, theinﬂuence of cultural factors are present in only a few published scienti ﬁc articles. One of
those studies, done by Baptista and Oliveira (2015) , supported the hypotheses of cultural
factors in ﬂuencing the use of mobile banking in the Mozambican culture.
The theoretical model advocated by Baptista and Oliveira (2015) more speci ﬁcally
considers that cultural dimensions moderate the effective use of mobile banking. Under thelens of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) ( Ajzen, 1991 ), a theory of psychology that the
elaboration of UTAUT/UTAUT2 ( Venkatesh et al.,2 0 1 2 ) is based on, this statement is not
consistent: cultural variables should moderate the intention to adopt mobile banking ( Nistor
et al., 2014 ) rather than the relation between the intention and effective use of the technology.
Analyzing the TPB diagram proposed by Ajzen (1991) , subjective norms are de ﬁned from
normative beliefs originated from society or culture, and those subjective norms in ﬂuence
intention rather than behavior directly. Therefore, bringing it to the research model, itmakes sense to af ﬁrm that culture would affect directly intention rather than usage
behavior.
In this context, the objective of the present research was to evaluate the impact of the
culture of a country, represented by the cultural dimensions of Hofstede, on the behavior ofusing a technological innovation in the ﬁnancial services sector: mobile banking. To achieveIJIS

it, the model of Baptista and Oliveira (2015) was replicated in Brazil for the intention to use
mobile banking in Brazil that reconciled the UTAUT2 model with cultural dimensions. Such
replication had the objective of testing the validity of the model and verifying that for
different cultures, different results occur, given the mediation of the cultural dimensions
incorporated.
It may sound reasonable to argue that a replication study cannot be treated as new or
valuable knowledge. However, this study was based on the assumption that replication in
science is considered a useful tool because it has the ability to show researchers that certain
knowledge is valid in situations other than those predicted in the original study, not just the
fruit of speci ﬁc circumstances that are not repeated in other studies ( Schmidt, 2009 ).
Replicating scienti ﬁc studies is also a way to improve reliability and credibility while
accelerating discovery, as stated by Munafo et al. (2017) .
2. Theoretical background and hypothesis generation
Theoretical elaboration on innovation adoption has, as its ﬁrst milestone, the development
of the IDT ( Rogers, 1962 ). From that theoretical model, other theories and models have been
used by the scienti ﬁc community, especially the theory of reasoned action (TRA) ( Fishbein
and Ajzen, 1975 ), TAM ( Davis, 1989 ), TPB ( Ajzen, 1991 ), social cognitive theory (SCT)
(Compeau and Higgins, 1995), task technology ﬁt (TTF) ( Goodhue and Thompson, 1995 )
and UTAUT/UTAUT2 ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ;Venkatesh et al.,2 0 1 2 ), the latter being one of
the most used in the research on adoption of mobile banking services ( Shaikh and
Karjaluoto, 2015 ).
The theory behind the UTAUT2 model ( Venkatesh et al. ,2 0 1 2 ) is an evolution of the
UTAUT ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ), but emphasizing aspects more relevant to the context of the
ﬁnal consumers. It is a model with signi ﬁcant potential for explaining the adoption of mobile
internet services ( Rondan-Cataluña et al., 2015 ) and of internet banking ( Hoehle et al.,2 0 1 2 ),
in addition to mobile banking ( Shaikh and Karjaluoto, 2015 ).
According to the UTAUT2 model, seven independent variables de ﬁne the adoption of
innovations by ﬁnal consumers. Expectation of performance represents the degree to which
an individual believes that their productivity can be magni ﬁed by using a particular
innovation ( Yuen et al. ,2 0 1 5 ). Expectation of effort comprises the degree of ease of use
associated with an innovation ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). Social in ﬂuence shapes the intention
of using a technological innovation by individuals ( Wang and Wang, 2010 ), by measuring
the in ﬂuence of friends, family and colleagues on the individual ’s intention ( Yuen et al. ,
2015). Facilitating conditions assess whether consumers have the resources and knowledge
available for the use of a given technological innovation ( Alwahaishi and Snasel, 2013 ).
Hedonic motivation contrasts the original approach of the UTAUT model, which prioritizes
utility (extrinsic motivation) as the strongest in ﬂuence on the prediction of acceptance and
use (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982 ). Price value is perceived as positive when the bene ﬁts
of adopting innovation are greater than the associated cost ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ).
Habit represents the degree of automaticity of a behavior resulting from a given learning
(Venkatesh et al., 2012 ).
UTAUT2 also presents moderating variables, such as age, gender and experience,
already presented in UTAUT ( Venkatesh et al.,2 0 0 3 ) and consistent with studies such as
Morris and Venkatesh (2000) ,Venkatesh and Morris (2000) andAlafeef et al. (2012) .
One of the shortcomings of the UTAUT2 model is the fact that it does not directly assess
the impact of cultural aspects in adopting innovations ( Imet al.,2 0 1 1 ). It is already known
that the acceptance of technological innovations occurs differently from country to country
(Chemingui and Lallouna, 2013 ), depending on the country ’s culture and local factors suchRole of cultural
factors

as government policies, legislation, domestic market and local industry ( Imet al. ,2 0 1 1 ).
National culture certainly in ﬂuences adoption of innovations ( Leeet al.,2 0 1 3 ); however, it is
not a fully understood phenomenon ( Ashraf et al. , 2014 ). The application of UTAUT, for
example, in different countries presents similarities and differences for each of the cultures
(Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ).
Culture can be understood as a set of values and beliefs that manifest in the way of
thinking, feeling and acting, in ﬂuencing people ’s behavior, among them consumption
(Ladhari et al., 2015 ). Although they can be evaluated at the level of nation, ethnic group,
profession or organization ( Nistor et al., 2014 ), this study deals with culture at the national
(country) level.
A widely accepted way of measuring cultural orientation ( Hassan et al., 2011 ) is through
the use of ﬁve cultural dimensions ( Hofstede et al. ,2 0 1 0 ). Individualism/collectivism
measures how much a person behaves in relation to himself or herself and to the groups towhich he (or she) belongs, giving more emphasis to individual needs or to the needs of thegroup to which he (or she) belongs ( Hofstede, 1984 ). Uncertainty avoidance evaluates the
reaction of individuals in a culture to unforeseen situations ( Yuen et al., 2015 ) and refers to
the tolerance of people to ambiguous situations ( Arpaci, 2015 ). Femininity/masculinity is a
variable that explains masculinity as dominant in the power structure of a culture andfemininity related to a lesser degree of assertiveness and competitiveness ( Chung and
Holdsworth, 2012 ). Power distance means that people of less power in one culture accept
inequality in which power is distributed to others ( Hofstede and Bond, 1984 ). Long-term
orientation can be understood as the degree to which individuals in a society embrace long-
term values, usually more traditional people ( Hofstede et al., 2010 ).
Cultural dimensions may affect the adoption of an innovation ( Mortimer et al. ,2 0 1 5 ).
However, it may sound reasonable to argue that national cultural is at a macro level, whileacceptance of a technological innovation occurs at an individual level. Literature review
showed that national cultural values in ﬂuence acceptance of new information technologies
at an individual level ( Srite and Karahanna, 2006 ). Culture has in ﬂuence on consumer
behavior, so joining economic and demographic variables with culture (collective values)and personal values is a proven tool to describe consumer reasons and behavior ( Mooij,
2017). Also, ﬁnancial institutions looking for new clients or retain current clients need to
consider effect of culture on communication to those ones about new technologies (onlinetechnologies with services) that bring added value ( Loureiro et al., 2014 ).
One of the recent innovations, arising from the spread of mobile technologies, is the use
of mobile devices to perform banking transactions, de ﬁned as mobile banking services (or
m-banking) ( Lin, 2013 ). For the banking industry, mobile banking is a technological
innovation that allows the expansion of access to banking transactions through mobile
devices, regardless of the place or time (ubiquity), and the client can create value without
being tied to previously de ﬁned places or moments ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ).
In emerging countries, mobile banking is a service that transforms the relationship
between banks and customers, bringing convenience to users ( Zhou, 2012 ). Through mobile
banking services, it is possible to reach the population of unbanked personnel, who do not
have access to banks or bank accounts ( Tobbin, 2012 ), in what is often referred to as
ﬁnancial inclusion ( Mishra and Singh Bisht, 2013 ). To the concept of ubiquity, coined by
Weiser (1999) and applicable to mobile devices ( Mishra and Singh Bisht, 2013 , p. 503), we
add the characteristics of ﬂexibility and mobility, forming the differentials of m-banking,
compared to traditional channels ( Lin, 2013 ).
It is in the context presented here, where mobile banking is understood as an innovation
(Lin, 2013 ) and where cultural factors may affect its adoption ( Nistor et al. ,2 0 1 4 ), that aIJIS
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 01:30 01 December 2018 (PT)
proposition arose: replication of a model that combines adoption of mobile banking with
cultural dimensions ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ).
The analytic model replicated ( Figure 1 ) in this study combines the theory of UTAUT2
(Venkatesh et al. , 2012 )a n dH o f s t e d e ’sc u l t u r a ld i m e n s i o n s( Hofstede et al. , 2010 ). Its ﬁrst
conception comes from Baptista and Oliveira (2015) ,h a v i n gb e e nt e s t e dw i t hi n d i v i d u a l sf r o m
Mozambique, a country in a region frequently ci ted regarding innovation in combining mobile
andﬁnancial services for people ( Anderson, 2010 ;Berger and Nakata, 2013 ;Jack and Suri,
2014;Tobbin, 2012 ). The interest of this research is in the in ﬂuence of the cultural dimensions;
thus, the replicated hypotheses of Baptista and Oliveira (2015) in this paper have only that
focus, as shown on the following hypotheses.
Every culture has a greater or lesser degree o f individualism/collectivism, which means that
individuals may prefer to act individually or collectively ( Straub et al. , 1997 ). Research
conducted by Baptista and Oliveira (2015) explores the moderation of the individualism/
collectivism variable on the behavior of mob ile banking use, synthesized by the following
hypothesis replicated in research in Braz il, a culture of high collectivism factor ( Hofstede, 2016 ):
H1. The in ﬂuence of the behavioral intention (BI) on the behavior use (BU) of mobile
banking services is positive, moderated by individualism/collectivism (IC), withgreater strength in people with a collectivist culture.
Uncertainty avoidance can be understood as the risk that an individual accepts as
reasonable (
Leeet al. ,2 0 1 3 ) in unknown situations. He/she feels nervous or comfortable
under unstructured and unclear conditions ( Merkin, 2006 ). Higher levels of uncertainty
aversion imply a lower probability of adopting a technological innovation ( Imet al., 2011 ).

The hypothesis tested for the signi ﬁcance of uncertainty aversion in the adoption of mobile
banking in Brazil is as follows:
H2. The in ﬂuence of BI on BU of mobile banking services is positive, moderated by
uncertainty avoidance (UA), but weaker in people with a higher degree of UA.
Long-term orientation is related to tradit ions, harmony between people and thinking
about the future ( Hassan et al. , 2011 ). In the case of Brazil, which has a low score in this
dimension ( Hofstede, 2016 ), the consequence is that it is a country with a strong short-
term orientation ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ). The replicate hypothesis, in this case, is
described as follows:
H3. The in ﬂuence of BI on BU of mobile banking services is positive, moderated by
long-term orientation (LT), but lower in people with long-term culture ( Baptista and
Oliveira, 2015 ).
Stronger masculinist cultures emphasize characteristics such as assertiveness, high
performance and competitiveness, compared with factors such as quality of life andfraternal relationship with others (
Straub et al.,1 9 9 7 ). In the study by Baptista and Oliveira
(2015) , masculinity/femininity moderates BU ( Arpaci, 2015 ), a hypothesis that was
replicated in the study carried out in Brazil.
H4. The in ﬂuence of BI on BU of mobile banking is positive, and moderation by
masculinity/femininity (MF) taken as the strongest in people with cultural values ofmasculinity should be observed.
Theﬁfth cultural dimension, power distance is de ﬁned as the level of inequality that the
population of a given culture takes as acceptable (
Straub et al. ,1 9 9 7 ). In Brazil, power
distance has a high degree ( Hofstede, 2016 ). Regarding power distance, the replication of
Baptista and Oliveira (2015) model in Brazil, then, considers the following hypothesis:
H5. The in ﬂuence of BI on BU of mobile banking services is positive, being moderated
by power distance PD, and particularly stronger in people with a greater culturalvalue of distance from power.
3. Method
This research was classi ﬁed as descriptive and has a causal character, as it sought to
evaluate the impact of a country ’s culture on the use of mobile banking. The universe of
research replicated was de ﬁned by a composition similar to that one de ﬁned by
Baptista and
Oliveira (2015) , with individuals residing in Brazil, who had a cell phone, smartphone or
tablet and also banking account (or savings) in the largest banks in the country. These are
institutions that provide mobile banking to their clients, which for this study was composedof the ﬁve main banks of the country ( “Top 50 Banks in Brazil ”, 2014): Banco do Brasil,
Caixa Econômica Federal, Itaú-Unibanco, Bradesco, and Santander.
The replicated survey used non-probabilistic convenience sampling ( Hair et al. ,2 0 1 3 ),
collecting data from a sample composed of 400 individuals, without considering any
restriction of gender, age, educational level, ethnic/religious group or professional category.Data collection took place from November to December 2015.
Data were collected through survey self-administered via the internet, contracted to a
research institute ( Conecta, 2016 ), allowing greater breadth of geographic coverage andIJIS

speed of return of responses (Cooper and Schindler, 2001). The same scales were used
(Table I )b yBaptista and Oliveira (2015) .
Each variable was measured using a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5
(fully agree), according to Malhotra (2010) . The ﬁnal question of the form, which involved
the frequency of use of the application of mobile banking, was prepared considering a
semantic differential scale of seven points ( Malhotra, 2010 , page 223). The declaration of
experience level on the self-completion form followed the self-declaration template or
subjective expertise.
4. Results and analysisAccording to the data collected in a sample of 400 individuals surveyed (
Table II ), there was
a balance of the distribution of demographic indicators, such as gender and age group.Respondent social classes in the surveyed sample included categories A, B and C, but
categories D and E were not part of the sample, ﬁltered by the de ﬁnition criteria of the
universe searched.
The researched sample was also characterized, after the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test, as
not adhering to the normal distribution. In addition, 35 outliers were identi ﬁed in the sample,
by means of the measurement of D2of Mahalanobis (Hair et al., 2009). However, there was
no occurrence of procedural error or extraordinary unexplained occurrence, following the
guidance of Corrar et al. (2014) . Other tests such as homoscedasticity and multicollinearity
were applied, and no evidence of abnormality was identi ﬁed in the variables that could de-
characterize the regression analysis of the replicated model ( Figure 1 ).
Following the tests mentioned above, particularly considering that data were not
normally distributed (as shown by Kolmogorov –Smirnov test where p<0.01) and the initial
stage of mobile banking adoption evaluation as cited by Oliveira et al. (2014) , it was
understood that a good choice would be a non-parametric statistical method like partial least
squares (PLS). So, it was decided to apply it and follow the validation of the research model
through the reliability and validity tests of the measurement model ( Malhotra, 2010 ) and
structural model analysis ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ).
The convergent validity analysis sought independent variables with average variance
extracted (AVE) less than 0.5 (Hair et al. , 2009). However, no occurrences were found,
conﬁrming that the variables explain more than half the variation of their indicators ( Oura,
2014). On the other hand, the analysis of the factorial loads did not reach loads lower than 0.7
(Hair et al. , 2009), con ﬁrming the validity. The analysis of the discriminant validity
evaluated the cases in which the square root of VME is greater than the relation with the
constructs ( Fornell and Larker, 1981 ). No evidence being found ( Table III ), it is, therefore,
conﬁrmed that each set of items effectively measures its own construct ( Oura, 2014 ).
Discriminant validity was also tested by cross-loadings, showing that, in each construct, the
factor loads are higher than in other variables ( Table IV ), con ﬁrming the discriminant
validity.
The reliability test was performed by analyzing the CR value (composite reliability or
compound reliability) and Cronbach ’sa. In the case of CR, the value higher than 0.7 in all
constructs reinforces the reliability of the variables. In the case of Cronbach ’sa, as the value
is higher than 0.7, the scales used are considered consistent, con ﬁrming the reliability of the
constructs ( Straub et al.,1 9 9 7 ).
As a ﬁnal step, before the PLS analysis, the determination coef ﬁcient ( R2), an index
representing the variance of the dependent variables in relation to the mean explained by the
independent variables (Hair et al., 2009), was evaluated. For the variable BI, R2has the value
of 0.740, and for the BU variable, the value is 0.226, both of which are considered acceptable.Role of cultural

weak ( p<0.10). The results ( Table V ) do not permit the cultural dimensions to be
categorized as of strong signi ﬁcance in the moderation of mobile banking for the sample
researched in Brazil.
A comparison between the original study ( Baptista and Oliveira, 2015 ) and replicated
study presented in this paper is presented in Table VI .
The comparison between the two studies reveals that, in three cultural dimensions (IC,
LTO and MF), Brazil and Mozambique have similar results in terms of moderation of the use
of mobile banking. In the dimensions of UA and PD, the results were different, which can beexplained by the high adherence of Brazilians to the activities of mobile banking: accordingto data from FEBRABAN (2015), the growth by more than 100 times in the number oftransactions made by mobile banking since 2011, to 11.2 billion in 2015 –138 per cent higher
than in 2014, according to a report by that entity, the result of an effort by banks to meet thedemand for digital inclusion that has been taking place in Brazil. According to supplementalTable III.

data from the information and communication technologies (ICTs) of the National
Household Sample Survey (Pnad) 2014 (ICT, 2015), cell phone usage to access the internetsurpassed computer use for the ﬁrst time in Brazil: more than half of the 67 million Brazilian
households had internet access in 2014 (54.9 per cent). In 2013, that percentage was 48per cent. More than 60 per cent of these homes were in the urban area.
However, in spite of the mentioned differences and similarities between the results of the
countries, the data collected and analyzed by means of PLS –path analysis in this research
conﬁrmed only two cultural dimensions with some signi ﬁcance in the moderation of the
relationship between BI and BU: collectivism and short-term orientation. Nevertheless,the signi ﬁcance is weak ( p<0.10). Three other variables that represent cultural dimensions
(MF, UA and PD) did not appear to be signi ﬁcant in the role of moderation in BU for mobile
banking by respondents.
Although the replicated model has not been shown to be signi ﬁcant for the sample
surveyed in Brazil, literature review depicts that the national culture exerts in ﬂuence over
the adoption of innovations (
Leeet al. ,2 0 1 3 , Choe, 2004), even though its in ﬂuence is not
completely understood ( Ashraf et al. , 2014 ). That is not a reason to deny the in ﬂuence of
culture on the adoption of mobile banking, but to re-adapt the proposed theoretical model.
TPB ( Ajzen, 1991 ), cited in this study, explains how beliefs affect intentions directly and
its impact on BU. The culture of each country, in the light of this theory from the ﬁeld ofTable IV.

psychology, used by Venkatesh for the elaboration of the widely adopted UTAUT model,
inﬂuences the intentions (or attitudes) in using certain technology and not the behavior use.
This is the reason why, in this research, a theoretical model is proposed that considers
the cultural dimensions moderating the in ﬂuence of the independent variables of the
UTAUT2 model on BI to use mobile banking and not on BU, as proposed by Baptista and
Oliveira (2015) . In Venkatesh ’s model (UTAUT2), the moderating variables proposed by him
(age, gender and experience) act primarily on the BI of consumers, as explained byVenkatesh et al. (2012) :“Facilitating conditions will act more like perceived behavioral
control in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and will in ﬂuence the intention and
behavior use ”in the adoption of the technology studied (in the present case, the adoption of
mobile banking).
Some scienti ﬁc studies already treat the cultural dimensions as moderators of BI, instead
of BU, although none of them deals with mobile banking or even treats moderation over allthe independent variables of UTAUT2. The work of
Choi et al. (2014) deals with IC and UA
as moderators of attitude. Hung and Chou (2013) deal with cultural dimensions as
moderators of perceived utility and perceived usability, synonyms for performanceTable V.

expectancy and effort expectancy, respectively. Srite and Karahanna (2006) also de ﬁne the
cultural dimensions variables as moderating the intention of use and not the behavior of use,
although they only associate them with the independent variables performance expectancy,
effort expectancy and social in ﬂuence.
This research suggests, then, that a new model should be proposed to con ﬁrm the
moderating role of cultural dimensions in BI to use of mobile banking, and not on BU of
mobile banking, based on the evidence found ( Figure 2 ).
5. Final considerations
The objective of this research was to test the validity of the hypotheses proposed by
Baptista and Oliveira (2015) as a signi ﬁcant model to explain the impact of cultural
factors ( Hofstede et al. , 2010 ) on the adoption of mobile banking. To meet that objective,
the present study replicated the research c arried out in Mozambique, which deals with
the cultural dimensions ( Hofstede et al. ,2 0 1 0 ) as moderating variables of BU of mobile
banking.
Replication showed that the cultural dimensions do not present strong signi ﬁcance in the
moderation of the use of mobile banking. In fact, out of the ﬁve dimensions tested, three
were not signi ﬁcant and two showed weak signi ﬁcance ( p<0.10): collectivism and short-Table VI.

Baptista and
Oliveira (2015) ? Possible reasons
IC Yes Yes Both countries are collectivists. The relationship between
people and groups in fact moderates decision on usingmobile banking
UA No Yes Brazil has high level of UA (index = 76), on the contrary to
Mozambique (index = 44). In spite of it, in Brazil, UA wasnot found as a moderating condition, probably becausemobile banking is not considered as an uncertain condition
by respondents anymore. That may be con ﬁrmed by data
from FEBRABAN (2015) , which show que mobile banking
adoption has is grown (138%, from 2014 to 2015). In otherwords, for that innovation (mobile banking), Brazilians
have shown little risk aversion
LTO Yes Yes Brazil has shot-term orientation, a situation con ﬁrmed as a
moderator for the use of mobile banking adoption
MF No No Both countries did not con ﬁrm that moderation. Brazil has
an index equal to 49, an intermediate value according to
Hofstede (2016) . Mozambique has an index equal to 38,
showing that Mozambique is considered as a nation withhigher femininity ( Hofstede, 2016 ). However, for mobile
banking, MF did not show relevance, which may be
corroborated by Ames et al. (2016) , for whom there is no
signiﬁcance of gender in the adoption of m-commerce
PD No Yes In Brazil, there is no moderating in ﬂuence of the difference
in social hierarchy between the richer and poorer. People
decide to use mobile banking, regardless the PD, even thatindex being high in both countries. (Brazil = 69,Mozambique = 85).

term orientation. Those results, contrasting with that one presented by Baptista and
Oliveira (2015) , made sense under Ajzen ’s theory (1991) –the TPB, leading to the conclusion
that the moderation of cultural dimensions on BU is not applicable.
That ﬁnding supported the proposition of a new theoretical model, which considers the
moderation of cultural dimensions in the right place, BI to use mobile banking instead of BU,
as proposed by Baptista and Oliveira (2015) . So, based on the research results and also based
on some authors cited in this article ( Choi et al. , 2014 ; Chou, 2013; Srite and Karahanna,
2006), it is proposed to insert Hofstede ’s cultural variables as moderators of independent
variables on BI.
Thus, the initial intention just to verify the validity of the model proposed by Baptista
and Oliveira (2015) in a different culture (Brazil, different from the originally applied
country, Mozambique) concluded that such a model may not be adherent, ﬁnding a
theoretical gap to be explored in future studies: the moderation of BI by cultural variables
proposed by Hofstede.
In addition, the innovation adoption model developed by Venkatesh et al. (2012) , giving
rise to UTAUT2, advocates that age, gender and experience are variables that also moderate
the intention of use. The study from Baptista and Oliveira (2015) , however, did not ﬁnd
evidence of those moderations in the research on Mozambique, which is not surprising. For
Lewis et al. (2013) , age is not signi ﬁcant in the role of moderation in the adoption of
innovations, and according to Pascual-Miguel et al. (2015) , gender differences are becoming
less important in the adoption and use of innovations. Recent reports in Brazil also do notFigure 2.

present evidence of signi ﬁcant differentiation in the use of mobile digital technologies by
gender or age ( IBGE, 2013 , FEBRABAN, 2014).
Next to the proposition of a new theoretical model, then, the little signi ﬁcance of the
moderating variables of Venkatesh et al. (2012) regarding BU, leads this research to suggest
that BI to use mobile banking is moderated by cultural dimensions ( Hofstede et al., 2010 ). In
future studies, age, gender and experience shall not be considered moderating factors of BI to
use mobile banking. On the other hand, the results from this research show that Hofstede ’s
cultural dimensions shall be tested as moderating variables in BI to use mobile banking.
The research on the adoption of mobile banking is signi ﬁcant because it is a key issue in
the banking industry because, for ﬁnancial institutions, the projection of the future is closely
linked to new technologies that make the digital bank scenario a reality, with extensive useof mobile banking (FEBRABAN, 2014). Banks consider it relevant because it is the nextfrontier of ﬁnancial services, replacing internet banking (
Leeet al., 2015 ). However, not only
banks will bene ﬁt from mobile banking. Because it is embedded in a convergent service
model, mobile banking is also an important candidate to help increase the revenues of otherplayers like mobile operators and internet providers ( Leeet al., 2015 ).
One limitation of this study was to use –intentionally –a non-probabilistic-sized sample
and also the fact that the sample had no regional strati ﬁcation representing all Brazilian
geographic regions. It may be signi ﬁcant knowing that culture can vary widely in regions,
even within the borders of a country, especially in a country of continental dimensions suchas Brazil (
Hofstede et al. , 2010a ;Nistor et al. ,2 0 1 4 ). Another limitation was the lack of
consideration of the sixth cultural dimension, indulgence ( Hofstede, 2016 ), which is not
treated in this research due to the lack of extensive material on the subject in scienti ﬁc work
repositories.
Concrete data shows that mobile phone subscriptions are increasing fast with already
more than one subscription per person in the entire world ( World Bank, 2016 ). Within that
universe, higher-income people own more subscriptions and access to broadband than low-
income people, but that gap between high- and low-income ones is rapidly decreasing incountries ( World Bank, 2012 ). Data from Brazil also con ﬁrms that higher-income owns more
mobile phone subscriptions ( IBGE, 2013 ). This research, however, did not provide any
evaluation on the impact of social factors as pointed by Shaikh and Karjaluoto (2015) ,o r
even demographic data ( Mooij, 2017 ), focusing only on cultural dimensions moderation
impact. So, as future research, we recommend an analysis also on the socioeconomic statusand demographic data among the survey sample.
