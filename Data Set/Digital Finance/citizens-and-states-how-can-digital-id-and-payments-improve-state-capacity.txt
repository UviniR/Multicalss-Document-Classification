—+1This report considers the potential of digital ID, 
financial inclusion, and mobile technologies to 
improve the capacity of governments to deliver bet-
ter, more inclusive, and accountable public ser vices, 
subsidies, and transfers. It proposes an analytical 
framework to achieve global development objec-
tives, reviews the growing body of lit er a ture on digi-
tal reforms, pre sents new evidence from country 
case studies and field- based research, and recom-
mends a set of princi ples for countries to follow as 
they move forward on their digital governance 
journey.
Universal access to well- functioning ID, connectivity, 
and financial inclusion has to be a first princi ple when 
considering moving citizen- government interactions 
in this direction. Digital reforms should be designed in 
a beneficiary- centric approach, understanding their 
needs and their capacity to navigate the new digital 
ecosystem. Aligning incentives is critical to improve 
accountability and prevent vested interests from 
derailing well- meaning reforms. Digital technology 
should be a tool for inclusion and empowerment as 
embodied in the SDGs—it is certainly pos si ble but not 
certain.
Fi nally, the report outlines the challenges that states 
must confront, including the issue of po liti cal  will, 
digital capacity, and protection of personal informa-
tion. ID, mobile communications, and digital finance 
offer huge potential but also increase risks of track -
ing and surveillance. Digitized ser vice delivery also 
generates enormous volumes of data, much in real 
time, increasing the importance of sound data gov-
ernance.  These are universal challenges and ones 
that resonate strongly in countries of the developing 
world.Digital technologies are part of our everyday lives. We 
communicate through email, text messages, and 
WhatsApp. We connect with  others on social media, 
search for information, listen to  music, stream mov-
ies, shop online, and commute using rideshare ser-
vices. We pay for  these digitally, often using our 
mobile phones. Many of the digital tools we use did 
not exist a de cade ago and some may not survive 
beyond the next de cade. The only constant in the dig-
ital world is change, and we need to adapt quickly to 
keep up with it.
Governments around the world are moving to harness 
the power of digital technologies to improve their 
capacity to serve  people. Many public ser vices are now 
online— passports, driver licenses, land rec ords, just to 
name a few. Food stamps are distributed as electronic 
vouchers; pensions, education stipends, and social 
grants are directly transferred to bank or mobile 
money accounts.  These changes are not  limited to rich 
economies— countries like Bangladesh, India,  Kenya, 
Pakistan, and Rwanda, for example, are leapfrogging 
their way  towards digital governance at a rapid pace. 
The language of governance is changing, and it is 
becoming increasingly digital.
In this dynamic and evolving context, how can digital 
technologies play a positive role to achieve the ambi-
tious objectives and targets embodied in the Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs)? How can they both 
empower citizens and improve state capacity? What 
can we learn from the experiences of digital reform in 
developing countries? Fi nally, what can we say about 
the  future trajectory of digital governance— the guid-
ing princi ples, the harmonization of policy design 
and technology, the risks, and the challenges  going 
forward?Preface

—+1Expanding the policy  
possibility frontier
This report considers the potential of ID, mobiles, and 
payments to improve the capacity of governments to 
deliver more effective, inclusive, and accountable pro-
grams. This trinity has been termed “JAM”1 in India, 
and the same terminology is used  here for con ve-
nience, though the focus is more general than India 
alone. The programs can provide government- to- 
person (G2P) payments, or vouchers tied to the pur-
chase of essential goods, or in- kind provision of goods 
and services— with or without conditionalities. They 
can also include fee- based ser vices that require 
person- to- government (P2G) payments.  These enable 
governments to implement a broader set of policies to 
reform citizen– state interactions—in other words, 
expanding the “policy possibility frontier.” In this 
report, we explore a wide range of  these digitally 
enabled reforms and their implications across sectors, 
regions, and countries— and more importantly, on 
 actual beneficiaries of public ser vices, subsidies, and 
transfers.
The objective is not to cover this huge field exhaus-
tively or to advocate for one approach over another, 
such as  whether to provide food rations or cash, or 
education vouchers or public schools. It is, rather, to 
consider the potential for digital technology to enable 
three  things— the precise identification of all parties to 
a transaction; low- cost communications; and accu-
rate, accountable, and con ve nient payments— and so to 
improve the interactions between citizens and states.
1. The letters stand for Jan Dhan program to open bank accounts, Aadhaar 
biometric ID, and Mobile communications.In Bangladesh, a  mother can now receive her child’s 
education scholarship through her mobile phone 
account instead of having to stand in long lines at the 
school on a prearranged day for a cash handout. Not 
only does this save her time and effort and provide 
accurate and documented payment, but it also relieves 
school officials of a burdensome administrative pro-
cess and of the risk that— rightly or wrongly— they can 
be accused of corrupt  handling of funds. In  Kenya, a 
farmer can invest his or her savings directly in a small 
slice of a government bond through a mobile phone. 
He or she can become eligible for a small loan on the 
basis of a stable rec ord of receipts and payments on 
his or her mobile account without posting collateral. 
In Andhra Pradesh, a state in India with 50 million 
 people, the authorities can drill down through state-
wide reporting data, in real time and across thousands 
of delivery points, to monitor the provision of rations 
to poor beneficiaries. They can detect transaction fail-
ures almost immediately and require rapid follow-up 
and remediation.
Digital technology, notably in the areas of identifica-
tion (ID), mobile communications, and financial pay-
ments, is impacting socie ties and economies in many 
ways. It is changing the way that citizens (in the sense 
of individuals) and states can interact and transact 
business with each other across a wide range of pro-
grams and ser vices. This offers new levers to states to 
implement a wide range of policies and programs, 
to  increase effectiveness and accountability, and also 
to include many who have been effectively shut out— 
whether through lack of recognition, high transactions 
costs, or the inability to ensure that payments or other 
ser vices are delivered accurately, to the right person, 
and at the right time.Executive Summary

+1—reforming pricing in resource- based sectors while 
preserving or improving equity; to expand the cover-
age and effectiveness of social protection systems, 
 whether cash- based or in- kind; to improve per for-
mance and reduce corruption in ser vices requiring 
user charges and similar P2G payments; to render 
public ser vices more accountable and increase client 
satisfaction; and to support affirmative mea sures to 
help close gender gaps, including in access to ICT.
 These objectives should motivate governments to use 
digital technologies— especially ID and payments—to 
improve delivery of public ser vices, subsidies, and 
transfers. Without an effective ID system, beneficiary 
lists are often replete with non ex is tent individuals or 
“ghosts,” resulting in misuse of scarce public resources. 
Without increased access to financial accounts, it is 
difficult to pay beneficiaries electronically instead of in 
physical cash. Fi nally, without the capacity to gather 
feedback on the quality and timeliness of public ser vices 
and payments, it is difficult to identify bottlenecks and 
improve the efficiency and accountability of ser vice 
provision. Digital technologies, appropriately designed 
and implemented, can address  these issues, improving 
the capacity of states to improve the efficiency and 
equity of delivery mechanisms over a broad range of 
public goods and ser vices in developing countries.
This report follows the SDG- based structure, drawing 
on selected examples for policy lessons on how  these 
challenges can be addressed through the application 
of digital technologies strategically, through JAM. 
Each country is dif fer ent, so the aim is not to provide a 
detailed blueprint. It is, rather, to set out a broad pic-
ture and impor tant policy directions.
Report summary
The aim of the report is to consider the potential for 
digital technology that enables three  things— the pre-
cise identification of all parties to an interaction; low- 
cost communications; and accurate, accountable, and 
con ve nient payment processes—to help reform citizen– 
state interactions, and to do this in a way that increases No silver bullet
Even though this report stresses potential benefits, it 
recognizes that context  matters more than technology, 
and that the latter is only a tool. On its own it does not 
necessarily lead to better policies or to stronger 
implementation— and it can also be used to implement 
bad policies more effectively. Much depends on the 
objectives to which it is applied and how well- 
implemented and inclusive the systems that use it are. 
This theme emerges clearly from the cases considered, 
together with some downside risks. ID systems can be 
used to exclude as well as include, and even well- 
intentioned innovations can increase the exclusion of 
vulnerable groups. The massive amounts of data gen-
erated by digital systems can facilitate profiling and 
tracking, including transaction rec ords and locations, 
and can threaten privacy. And while it has the poten-
tial to increase state capacity and effectiveness, JAM 
imposes new demands on states and civil society, as 
well as imposing capability requirements on citizens 
who need to be able to navigate new systems.
Conceptual framework: The SDGs  
as a mea sure of state capacity
Is a capable state a “good” state? The rec ord suggests 
not necessarily. In developmental terms, state capacity 
can only be assessed relative to some specified objec-
tives. For  these, we can turn to the global development 
consensus, as embodied in the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals (SDGs). They represent an ambitious ele-
vation of aspirations relative to the Millennium 
Development Goals, placing new emphasis on the 
nexus between the state and the individual.
Box 1 sets out SDG goals and targets especially relevant 
for JAM. As shown in the first cluster, the SDGs recog-
nize the importance of JAM; ID, mobile communica-
tions, and financial inclusion are intrinsic goals in 
themselves, in addition to being pos si ble instruments 
to help achieve other goals and targets. Box 1 clusters 
the latter around several groups of SDG objectives: to 
increase environmental sustainability, including by

—+1citizens, such as identifying recipients, transitioning 
from physical cash to digital payments, monitoring 
implementation, increasing accountability, and gath-
ering feedback on the quality of public ser vices and 
transfers. Furthermore, effective governments desire 
to empower and build the agency of their citizens to 
grow and prosper. JAM provides the capacity to direct 
payments to verified recipients at con ve nient times; individual agency and improves efficiency in the deliv-
ery of public ser vices, subsidies, and transfers.

+1—Chapter 3: Policies  towards universal JAM
JAM is greater than the sum of its parts. Chapter  3 
demonstrates the wide range of synergies between its 
three components, including economies of scope that 
can reduce the costs of essential infrastructure. For 
example, the provision of mobile financial ser vices, as 
well as voice and data, boosts the business case for 
constructing cell towers to expand mobile coverage. 
 There are also two- way supply- side and demand- side 
 drivers between JAM and its use in the delivery of pub-
lic ser vices. As noted in Chapter 2, routing G2P trans-
fers and other payments through bank or mobile 
accounts can help drive financial inclusion and encour -
age competition, especially if recipients have a choice 
of payment providers. Figure  1 illustrates how each 
component fits into supply-  and demand- side  drivers 
that reinforce their shared utility for payments and 
transactions.
Figure  2 situates JAM as a digital mediator in the 
 middle of citizen– state interactions, highlighting the 
supply-  and demand- side  drivers as well as risks for 
each side of the transactions. With the population 
financially included, fee- for- service programs can be 
facilitated by frictionless and accountable digital P2G 
payments, as described in Cluster 4 of Box 1. While we 
do not address this area in detail in this report, the 
available lit er a ture indicates the need for an enabling 
digital payments ac cep tance ecosystem to reap the full 
benefits of digital G2P transfers.  Because so many dif-
fer ent regulatory agencies and ser vice programs are 
involved, governments need to adopt a strategic 
approach based on JAM as an integrated platform for 
ser vice delivery and governance. Each country starts 
from a dif fer ent place, so the details  will differ, but the 
framework presented  here would be relevant for most 
cases.
The next three chapters illustrate the vari ous contexts 
where this can be applied: reforming energy and agri-
cultural subsidies, strengthening social protection, 
and facilitating beneficiary feedback mechanisms.it allows governments to transfer benefits directly 
and target progressively instead of relying on 
economy- wide price ceilings and subsidies— thus 
enabling more equitable outcomes. But while digital 
technology has the potential to increase state capac-
ity, it creates new demands on citizens, especially the 
poor and the vulnerable, who need to be able to access 
payments, ser vices, and information in new, digital 
ways.
Chapter 2: A picture of JAM coverage
Citizens and states cannot interact with each other 
through JAM if  people do not have ready access to 
its components that constitute the first SDG cluster 
in Box 1. In Chapter  2, an index of JAM inclusion 
shows that this is  shaped by both country- level 
 factors and layered individual attributes including 
wealth, education, workforce status, and gender. 
Access to an ID and a mobile increases the probabil-
ity that an individual  will have a financial account. 
When all of a person’s demographic attributes are 
favorable (i.e., employed men with high levels of 
income and education), their probability of financial 
inclusion is over 80   percent; when they are unfavor-
able (i.e., poor, unemployed, illiterate  women), it is 
as low as 7   percent. Having an ID and a mobile phone 
boosts the chances of financial inclusion— the proba-
bility for the most disadvantaged group increases to 
34  percent, an increase of nearly five times over the 
baseline case. Fi nally, receiving a government trans-
fer increases the probability of financial inclusion by 
31  percent for an individual at the midpoint of the 
attribute scale. G2P transfers therefore can be an 
effective means for greater financial inclusion. How-
ever, our analy sis also shows that in addition to 
addressing country- level issues such as weak ID sys-
tems and inadequate mobile coverage, policies to 
provide for universal financial access  will need to 
make special efforts to reach excluded groups, often

minorities.

+1—transfers, increasingly delivered through financial 
intermediaries.  There may indeed be a trend in this 
direction, but the choice of modality needs to be 
assessed carefully for each program, taking into 
account any wider objectives it might have. The cases 
examined in this study from Bangladesh, India, and 
Pakistan indicate that digitized delivery systems can 
improve the per for mance of both cash- based and in- 
kind social protection programs (and ser vice programs 
more generally) along some critical dimensions— 
better ser vice, greater user convenience—as well as 
possibly providing fiscal savings. But the cases in Chap-
ter 5 also show that results are heavi ly dependent on 
the institutional context, the objectives of the reform, 
and  whether incentives along the delivery chain are 
also reformed as it is digitized, to encourage ser vice 
providers to reach out to their clients. Ill- designed 
reforms can raise transactional costs and access barri-
ers for poor beneficiaries, and can increase exclusion.
Programs can also be structured to provide advantages 
to  women, including launching their first steps on 
the road to financial inclusion. At the same time, in 
strongly patriarchal settings,  women may face struc-
tural barriers to agency, impeding their access to the 
opportunities that digital reforms are able to provide. 
This warrants careful attention in the design of reforms 
(see  Table 2 below).
Chapter 6:  Towards real- time governance
With accurate identification, mobile communications, 
and payments, citizen– state interactions and payments 
can be tracked individually and in real time. Even as 
the huge volumes of data produced by such digital sys-
tems raise certain risks, they can be used to monitor 
per for mance and increase accountability, as illus-
trated in Chapter 6, directly related to SDG Cluster 5. 
Monitoring can also draw on rapid citizen feedback, 
including from providing choice between dif fer ent 
ser vice providers or, indeed, alternative programs. 
Real- time feedback systems are not new in the com-
mercial world, but in the development context this Chapter 4:  Towards sustainability:  
Efficient pricing with equity
Fuel subsidies continue to be a major concern in many 
countries; many governments also offer price subsi-
dies on other products with environmental effects, 
such as fertilizers. In addition, countries have been 
slow to levy “green taxes” to price fuels “efficiently” to 
allow for carbon emissions and other externalities. 
They also fail to price natu ral resources, such as  water 
or forests, to reflect their scarcity and the environ-
mental ser vices they provide. All  these examples reflect 
the importance of reforming prices (Cluster 2 in Box 1), 
a policy made more difficult  because of its distribu-
tional implications.
As noted in Chapter 3, use of JAM can help to person-
alize subsidies, to move away from inefficient, distor-
tionary, and inequitable price subsidies  towards 
individualized vouchers or transfers. This enables the 
price system to be liberated from distributional con-
straints and allows resources to be priced at efficient 
levels. India’s massive LPG cooking gas program dem-
onstrates that personalizing subsidies can also facili-
tate new approaches to targeting and more fiscal 
flexibility to respond to unexpected price shocks. 
Moreover, it can also address existing gender inequali-
ties within the  house hold distribution of  labor and 
access to public benefits through greater use of ICT, as 
described in SDG Cluster 6. Reforms of fertilizer subsi-
dies in several countries show dif fer ent ways of engag-
ing JAM, and also varying degrees of success. However, 
as confirmed by recent protests in France, Iran, and 
other countries, it is also clear that technology is no 
substitute for effective communication and the po liti-
cal  will to overcome vested interests.
Chapter 5: Social protection  
and associated goals
Social protection features prominently in the SDGs, as 
described in Box 1, Cluster 4. At first sight, the use of 
JAM argues for moving all social protection  towards 
587-84331_ch01_4P.indd   6 2/12/20   2:15 PMExecutive Summary 7

—+1for example, can ease the burden of managing cash on 
frontline ser vice providers, such as teachers in the case 
of education supplements in Bangladesh.
Gains are not automatic, however. Technology is 
only a tool. Even as it opens up new opportunities, 
its impact  will be  shaped by institutional and eco-
nomic conditions as well as the aim of the reforms. 
In some cases, state capacity has been a constraint on 
implementing better policies (Nigeria), but expanding 
the policy possibility frontier does not necessarily lead 
to better policies,  either to address sustainability 
(Bolivia) or to improve social protection. Reforms are 
inherently po liti cal and often require sustained effort 
to overcome strong vested interests. A shift to digitized 
programs places new demands on the capabilities of 
the state to regulate the new systems and to apply them 
in programs, and on citizens to navigate them.
Technology amplifies the power of data, and its 
impact on development depends on how this power 
is used. States can use data to improve ser vice delivery, 
but they may not be benign users of data. The rapidly 
evolving tools available to governments also have the 
potential to leave marginalized groups  behind, or to 
further isolate them. New checks and balances  will be 
needed to ensure that digital technology serves the 
needs of all citizens.
JAM is a flexible platform, and it is being applied in 
dif fer ent ways. The princi ples that follow are based on 
cases to date, but  there is still a  great deal to learn 
about the introduction of digitized ser vice programs.
Access
Universal access to well- functioning ID, connectiv-
ity, and financial inclusion has to be a first princi ple 
when considering moving citizen– government 
interactions in this direction.
The details differ, but  there are common policy direc -
tions. A full treatment of policies to increase access 
to JAM is beyond the scope of this report. However, area is still nascent. While some programs have moved 
 towards collecting real- time data, few have yet devel-
oped comprehensive systems to analyze it in real time, 
to combine administrative data and customer feed-
back, and to cycle the information back into imple-
mentation.  These capabilities as developed by the state 
of Andhra Pradesh, for example, represent the most 
advanced phase of the digital ser vice revolution and 
are still very much at the frontier.
Cross- cutting theme: Gender- based digital 
and financial inclusion
Throughout each chapter, we consider how gender 
differences reflect structural barriers that impede 
uptake among potential users. Globally,  there is a 
1.4  percentage point gap in identification coverage, a 
6.0 percentage point gender gap in financial inclusion, 
and an 8.1  percentage point gap in mobile phone 
owner ship between men and  women. Getting to uni-
versal JAM coverage pre sents a challenge and an 
opportunity for  women, but  there is a need for policies 
that facilitate their engagement with digital public ser-
vice delivery platforms.
Key messages and princi ples  
for policy
Digital technology, including ID and payments and 
supported by mobiles (JAM), can enhance state 
capability to deliver a wide range of policies and 
programs relating to multiple SDGs in the areas of 
 sustainability, social protection, and governance.  
Improvements can include better accountability, ser vice 
and user empowerment, greater equity, and sometimes 
fiscal savings. The last can come mainly from three 
sources: lower transaction costs, eliminating ghost and 
duplicate beneficiaries (both within and across pro -
grams), and reducing leakages in subsidies delivered 
through G2P and P2G payments as well as goods deliv -
ered through digitally controlled supply chains. Shift-
ing from physical cash payments to financial transfers,

+1—and the LPG cooking gas case in Chapter 4). In extreme 
cases a hurried emphasis on cutting costs may even 
backfire, as in the abortive effort to introduce stock 
reconciliation in the ration system in Jharkhand. It is 
better to take a phased approach, first putting in place 
the new systems, ensuring that they work well, and 
then using them to help trim beneficiaries and reduce 
leakage (see discussion of the LPG cooking gas case and 
Andhra Pradesh’s implementation throughout Chap-
ters 4 and 5) than to attempt to do it all si mul ta neously 
(see the Rajasthan case in Chapter 5).
Digital approaches can open the door to new ways 
to approach targeting. Targeting offers another 
opportunity for phased approaches.  Because they 
enable benefits to be provided accountably to well-  
identified recipients, governments can invoke “soft 
targeting” through moral suasion and other indica-
tive approaches (see the LPG cooking gas case in 
Chapter 4). Targeting can then be progressively “hard -
ened,” including through mechanisms such as legally 
binding self- declarations, to focus the benefits more 
tightly on poorer citizens. A further phase, using data 
analytics on consumption patterns to screen poten-
tial beneficiaries on an ongoing basis, is increasingly 
feasible in a digitally connected world but may be 
seen as overly intrusive.
Incentives throughout the delivery chain are a criti-
cal counterpart to accountability and need to be fac-
tored into rollouts and reforms. If digital reforms 
eliminate ave nues for diversion and corruption, mar-
gins for ser vice providers  will prob ably need to be 
increased to compensate for reduced opportunities to 
exercise their discretion. Cooking gas distributors, for 
example, as well as  owners of ration shops in Rajasthan 
and Andhra Pradesh, saw increases in commissions; 
many would prob ably not have stayed in business 
other wise. In the latter case, dealers also benefited 
from reforms higher up the supply chain that increased 
the accuracy and predictability of deliveries to their 
shops. Inadequate compensation for business corre-
spondents prob ably was a  factor in the unsatisfactory 
per for mance of the banking system in delivering drawing on a range of material in addition to our own 
studies,  Table 1 shows policy directions acting on both 
the supply side and the demand side, applicable to 
many countries. Some have the primary objective of 
increasing access;  others of increasing functionality, 
value, and user trust which, in turn, encourages take-
up. Many require coordination across several minis-
tries or regulators to reap the benefits of common 
physical or agent infrastructure, which can expand the 
reach of JAM components and increase the con ve-
nience of users, such as common payment arrange-
ments across programs.
Fiscal windfalls from the mobile revolution can be 
exploited to encourage access. For example, the rap-
idly growing demand for high- speed internet increases 
the value that governments can obtain from spectrum 
auctions. Part of this can be allocated to cross- subsidize 
at least basic connectivity for more remote or disad-
vantaged groups. Increased access, in turn, enables 
government to shift more programs and ser vices onto 
a JAM- based platform (including  those that require 
fees and other P2G payments), to improve ser vices, 
and, in many cases, to create fiscal savings.
Accountability
Accountability for ser vice delivery is a second princi-
ple that emerges from the cases.
The primary aim of reform should be to improve 
quality and inclusion, with fiscal savings a secondary 
objective, to be obtained from efficiency gains. Cases 
suggest that a single- minded focus on fiscal savings 
risks increasing exclusion  because  there is  little effort 
to put in place the monitoring and protocols needed to 
prevent it (see the Jharkhand food rations case in 
Chapter  5). They also show that large fiscal gains are 
often pos si ble,  whether through eliminating ghosts or 
duplicates from beneficiary rolls or from eliminating 
leakages and corruption in the distribution and pay-
ments pro  cess, even when fiscal saving is not the prime 
driver of the reforms (see the biometric smartcards 
and food rations cases in Andhra Pradesh in Chapter 5,

No . Goal Description
1 Access to ID and 
building trust• Robust ID for all with strong authentication ecosystem.
•  Free, easy enrollment with minimum pos si ble data requirements.
• Coordination with civil registration to facilitate updating.
•  Clear accountability for data protection, managing grievances, and  handling technology failure.
2 Access to mobiles  
and finance•  Simplify KYC documentation around ID and move to risk- based KYC and e- KYC to cut  
onboarding costs.
•  Level the playing field: uniform requirements for SIM registration and basic mobile money or 
bank accounts.
3 Access to mobile • Encourage universal access to at least 2G.
• Cross- subsidize coverage through proceeds and conditions of spectrum auctions.
• Consider subsidies or tax breaks on feature phones; avoid excessive taxation.
• Provide for number portability.
4 Access to finance,  
and trust•  Allow nonbanks (notably MNOs but also other businesses) to offer payment ser vices as a 
low- cost way to extend financial access to poor customers.
•  KYC, along the lines of SIM registration subject to trust account arrangements and prudential 
oversight.
5 Access to mobile  
and finance• Encourage shared infrastructure— cell towers, perhaps through tower companies— and agents.
• Promote nonexclusivity to share fixed costs and facilitate expansion.
6 Value and con ve nience 
of finance• At an appropriate stage of market development, encourage payments interoperability.
•  Support technology switch (like UPI) and encourage mutually beneficial interchange  
agreements between providers.
• Encourage innovations such as tokenized addresses to increase con ve nience and trust.
7 Accountability and 
access to finance•  G2P payments through common platform able to pay to any general- purpose financial  
or mobile account.
•  Minimize cash and special- purpose channels, while recognizing that  these may be essential in 
some areas.
•  Develop a common approach to paying for “last- mile delivery” through general- purpose 
instruments, and for separating out identity verification from payments.
8 Value, ac  cep tance, and 
con ve nience of finance•  E- Payment Gateway to enable P2G payment for government- provided ser vices to be made  
easily through any account.
• Enforce use progressively as financial inclusion increases.
•  Use Gateway and possibly other mea sures to incentivize wider merchant ac  cep tance ecosystem 
for digital payments.
9 Value, ac  cep tance, and 
con ve nience of finance•  Avoid excessively high taxation of digital transactions that may discourage use and  
merchant ac  cep tance.
•  Consider fiscal incentives to encourage ac  cep tance, such as temporary VAT reductions  
on digital transactions.
•  Review tax administration and audit requirements to reduce need for paper receipts and rec  ords, 
since  these undermine the benefits of moving to digital systems.
10 Value/access, benefits 
of digital governance, 
trust in digital data•  Use digital data to monitor implementation and per for mance of government programs  
( towards real- time digital governance).
•  Monitor beneficiary experience to ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are not excluded by 
digital divide.
•  Take steps to secure the large amounts of transactional and other data that  will be generated  
by the use of JAM.
11 Access to ID, mobile, 
and finance•  Ensure that applications and interfaces are designed to meet the unique needs and preferences 
of vulnerable and marginalized groups, including but not  limited to  women, linguistic/ethnic/
religious minorities, differently abled  people,  etc.
12 Capability for wider 
access and 
functionality•  Encourage partnerships, including with ser vice providers, self- help groups, and NGOs, to promote 
digital education and capacity across the population, in par  tic u lar among  women.

+1—frequently the most dependent beneficiaries of public 
programs. It is essential to have well- working systems 
to resolve such difficulties, as well as to enable the easy 
updating of personal information.
Choice and voice
Digital technology should empower citizens by 
increasing agency, expanding choice, and strength-
ening voice through better and more effective use of 
feedback systems.
Digitized delivery systems generate enormous quan-
tities of data, much of it in real time, which can pro-
vide critical feedback to programs and transition 
 towards a system of real- time governance. With fully 
identified participants and mobile communications, 
delivery can in princi ple be monitored continually at 
 every ser vice point (as shown in Rajasthan and Andhra 
Pradesh). This enables governments to identify under-
performing ser vice areas and failed individual trans-
actions. The example of Andhra Pradesh suggests that 
the feedback loop from a failed transaction can inter-
vene with the dealer (one of some 24,000 in the state) 
within as  little as 10 minutes. This degree of monitor-
ing may not be realistic on a large scale, but it illus-
trates something about the possibilities of such 
systems. Clients can also receive timely information on 
the status of their requests ( orders for LPG cooking gas 
cylinders, for example).
 Because benefits are personalized and attached to 
the beneficiary, they can be made portable, subject 
to logistical constraints. The exercise of choice by 
users provides a second impor tant real- time feed-
back signal to program administrators. Choice of 
ser vice provider has been an impor tant ele ment of 
beneficiary empowerment in some programs (see the 
case of LPG cooking gas in Chapter 4 and the Andhra 
Pradesh food rations and pensions cases in Chapter 5). 
Surveys suggest that this is much welcomed by ben-
eficiaries. It adds con ve nience, especially for mobile 
populations, and provides the option of moving to 
suppliers who provide better ser vice. Efficient pensions in Andhra Pradesh. It may be necessary to 
adopt tiered ser vice margins to compensate for higher 
last- mile delivery costs, especially as ser vices and 
benefits are extended to sparse or poor regions. Also, 
charges for authentication and other “platform” 
ser vices should not be set at levels that compromise 
inclusion.
It is essential to have effective policies and proce-
dures in place to monitor technology failures and 
grievances and to resolve them, especially as reforms 
move impor tant ele ments of delivery out of the 
hands of local officials and  towards more remote 
systems and data. By and large,  people respond prag-
matically to the introduction of new systems. They like 
them when they feel empowered, with better ser vice 
and more control; they disapprove when faced with 
difficulties in executing transactions, even in cases 
where  these are not so serious as to result in  actual 
exclusion. No system is perfect, and even the best tech-
nology is subject to failures,  whether due to poor con-
nectivity, authentication failures, or other  factors.
Even programs seen as “good” by the majority of 
beneficiaries and customers can increase the mar-
ginalization of vulnerable groups. For this reason, 
 there needs to be a special focus on such groups when 
assessing the impact of changes. This can include tech-
nological challenges— for example, to provide alterna-
tive options for authentication through an ID system. 
Examples show that per for mance can improve over 
time (see the experience of vari ous Indian authentica-
tion cases in Chapter  5, and the fertilizer cases in 
Chapter 4), but  human pro  cesses are essential as a last 
resort. Innovative use of technology can also limit the 
amount of discretion in  these pro  cesses (see the case of 
Andhra Pradesh in Chapter 6), thereby maintaining a 
high level of accountability.
Reforms can also involve transitional frictions such 
as reconciling data errors and inconsistencies as pre-
viously manual or scattered systems are integrated. 
 These prob lems  will be more serious for groups with 
less capacity— the poor, el derly, or  women— who are 
587-84331_ch01_4P.indd   10 2/12/20   2:15 PMExecutive Summary 11

—+1■ Second is program and funding stability, 
together with a degree of preexisting capacity. 
Reforms of this type typically take several years 
to transition to steady- state systems. Feedback 
loops  will not resolve prob lems that originate 
outside the delivery system, such as erratic fund-
ing or severely disrupted supply chains (see the 
fertilizer reforms in Nigeria and Zambia in 
Chapter  4). In a low- performing program, a 
real- time feedback system would prob ably be 
overwhelmed by complaints and quickly become 
in effec tive.
■ Third is the social and po liti cal acceptability of 
ID systems with the capabilities of Aadhaar, 
together with the retention of transaction rec-
ords to build large data sets. Only now are gov-
ernments, as in the case of Andhra Pradesh, 
beginning to grapple with the question of how to 
manage the data generated by their reforms.
Ensuring the long- term po liti cal sustainability of 
real- time feedback systems is difficult, but transpar-
ency can help build citizen demand and buy- in. The 
real- time governance cases studied in Chapter  6 fea-
ture real- time aggregated scores based on beneficiary 
feedback, but some of  these are only vis i ble internally. 
The results generated by feedback systems  will need to 
be readily available and easily accessible to the public 
to establish it as a citizen expectation and a useful tool 
for civil society.
Cross- cutting goals: Gender equity  
and financial inclusion
Even as digitizing programs can contribute to more 
effective ser vice delivery, it can support  women’s 
empowerment and provide a stimulus to financial 
inclusion.  These are useful steps  towards the goal of 
changing gender norms, although this is a much 
longer- run proposition.
While this report focuses on ser vice delivery in gen-
eral, several programs are particularly significant for portability within an in- kind delivery system is not 
pos si ble without real- time monitoring of transactions 
to reconcile stocks and flows and avoid excessive 
buildup of inventory or stockouts. Choice might not 
be feasible in all situations (for example, in sparse 
regions), but even  there it can sometimes be facilitated 
through more flexible arrangements— enabling trans-
fers to be cashed out at shops and other local ser vice 
points and enrolling businesses as smaller- scale rural 
distributors, as in the case of the LPG cooking gas 
program.
User responses can provide a third feedback loop, 
operating in almost real time. This can include star 
ratings of distributors and beneficiary surveys through 
robocalls (see the LPG cooking gas and Andhra Pradesh 
case in Chapter 6) as well as phone- based systems for 
filing complaints. Complaints need to be routed rap-
idly to the responsible department, with time- bound 
and monitored deadlines for response. Such real- time 
systems have  great advantages over more traditional 
user surveys and studies that may take years to yield 
results, during which time administrators and officials 
 will have turned over. Rapid feedback can help to focus 
the bureaucracy and feed into systems that rate pro-
viders on ser vice delivery, increasing competitive pres-
sure for improvement.
Although ele ments of the approach could be included 
in many programs, not all jurisdictions  will have the 
motivation and capability needed to operate a full 
real- time governance feedback system. While JAM 
opens up new possibilities for real- time governance, 
cases suggest that  there are some preconditions for 
such systems to be effective.
■ First is sustained po liti cal  will, to prioritize ser-
vice delivery over other po liti cal interests. The 
successful cases studied for this report benefited 
from support at the highest levels of govern-
ment. This is needed to counterbalance the ten-
dencies for lower levels of the administration to 
work against such a governance system, since it 
severely constrains their discretion.

+1—to accessing ser vice points to cash out transfers, or to 
transacting in de pen dently.
The road from digital transfers to full use of financial 
accounts is long, but specific mea sures can help. By 
and large, very few of the  women receiving transfers 
into bank or mobile money accounts are  doing more 
than cashing them out. They are financially included, 
but more in a formal sense than in a real sense. This is 
not unexpected; it  will take time to build experience 
with the saving, payments, and other ser vices that 
financial accounts can offer, as well as to build the 
wider ac cep tance system for payments. Digital and 
financial literacy is a hurdle for many  women; partner-
ships with self- help groups and NGOs could help to 
improve  these capabilities and empower them to func-
tion in the digital economy. Government can comple-
ment this with active mea sures to link the provision of 
mobile phones to programs and to support the provi-
sion of messaging and interfaces in the local language 
(as shown in the case of Bangladesh in Chapter 5).
Combining policy and technology
Drawing from the SDG framework and analy sis of 
cases, this report suggests several princi ples that can 
be helpful in formulating or assessing digital gover-
nance systems. Do they provide for universal access? 
Do they embody clear accountability for per for mance? 
Do they empower beneficiaries by providing them 
with choice over ser vice provider and effective voice? 
Does the design of reform exploit the potential for 
favorable externalities, such as gender equity and 
 women’s economic empowerment? Each of  these ele-
ments has both a policy design and a technology com-
ponent that should be considered together to achieve 
better developmental outcomes ( Table 2).
Concluding comments
 There is a large unfinished agenda to extend JAM 
access and use. JAM cannot be used as a delivery plat-
form for ser vices  unless it is widely accessible. While 
 there has been spectacular growth in coverage, the  women.  These include the LPG cooking gas program, 
which aims to improve time use and health outcomes 
for  women; Rajasthan’s Bhamashah program desig-
nates  women as the head of  house hold for program 
purposes; Bangladesh’s program to provide education 
supplements to  women through mobile phones; and 
Pakistan’s BISP program to support poor  women. The 
case of Andhra Pradesh highlights the role of  women 
in the new digital economy as business correspondents 
of commercial banks.
A growing body of evidence shows that  women and 
other marginalized groups such as ethnic and lin-
guistic minorities, as well as differently abled per-
sons, face extra structural barriers to adopting the 
JAM components. This report shows that globally, the 
8.0 percentage point gender gap in financial inclusion 
would close by 5.5 percentage points if  women had the 
same socioeconomic characteristics as men (the same 
level of education, income, workforce status,  etc.). 
 Women’s economic empowerment through education, 
workforce participation, and access to mobile technol-
ogy would contribute significantly to closing the gaps.
Surveys paint a broadly favorable picture in most 
cases but point to the need for attention to the con-
straints on  women that limit their agency. This can 
dilute the gains from digitizing programs or even 
cause more difficulties. Programs like  these can 
improve  women’s lives even though the immediate 
outcome may represent only a modest step  towards 
the ultimate goal of gender equality. But multiple over-
lapping attributes can contribute to individuals falling 
below an “agency threshold” needed to benefit from 
the reform. For example, if the shift  towards digital 
ser vices and payments reinforces structural barriers to 
financial access rather than providing alternative solu-
tions, reforms can reduce  women’s agency. Mea sures 
may be needed in multiple areas; the gender gap in 
mobile owner ship, for example, appears to be related 
to that in financial inclusion and is of similar magni-
tude. Technology can help to ensure that  women 
receive their benefits in person (as in the Pakistan case 
in Chapter 5), but they may still face par tic u lar hurdles

—+1questions around the longer- run implications of digi-
tization. While digitization of government payments 
has been motivated largely by the objective of govern-
ments to improve the efficiency of public expenditure, 
we have yet to see its impact on revenue mobilization, 
especially in developing countries. To what extent 
ubiquitous citizen– state digital payments (both G2P 
and P2G) would lead individuals to change their pref-
erences for cash versus financial transactions is also an 
open question. The impact of digitization is complex— 
for example, the trade- offs between greater transpar-
ency and accountability of transactions enabled by 
digital ID and payments on the one hand and the 
incentive to deliver better ser vices by  those who cross- country picture is uneven, including in reaching 
the poor and vulnerable groups who are often the high-
est priority for ser vice. Similarly, the wide gap between 
leading use cases and  others indicates how much fur-
ther  there is to go in using JAM to reform citizen– state 
engagement. Addressing this challenge  will require 
strategic approaches that build on natu ral synergies, 
especially since ID systems, mobile communications, 
and payment systems are multiuse platforms that can 
be applied to many programs and ser vices.

—+1This transition  towards digital governance and ser vice 
delivery is not without its risks. As shown by many 
examples of success and failure, technology is not a sil-
ver bullet. Its impact in any given application  will 
depend on many contextual  factors, including the 
objectives to which it is applied and the details of 
implementation. Each of the three technologies erodes 
the anonymity of users, enabling better tracking of 
transactions and locations.  There is also the risk that 
some  will find the new systems and approaches diffi-
cult to navigate and that innovations intended to 
empower marginalized groups  will end up marginal-
izing them further. But at the same time, the transition 
offers new levers to states to implement a wide range 
of policies and programs, to increase effectiveness and 
accountability, and also to include many who have 
been effectively shut out— whether  because of lack of 
recognition, or high transactions costs, or the inability 
to monitor delivery and ensure that payments or other 
ser vices are delivered accurately, to the right person, 
and at the right time.
This paper considers the potential of digital technolo-
gies, particularly in the areas of identification, mobile 
communications, and finance/payments, to improve 
the capacity and effectiveness of states and to support 
more effective and accountable interactions between 
citizens and states and more efficient and inclusive 
programs. The interactions can be of several types. 
One category, such as pensions, child allowances, or 
education grants, involves government- to- person or 
G2P payments.  These can be unconditional (proposals In Bangladesh, a  mother can now receive her child’s 
education supplement through her mobile phone 
account instead of having to stand in long lines at the 
school on a prearranged day for a cash handout. Not 
only does this save her time and effort and provide 
accurate and documented payment, but it also relieves 
school officials of a burdensome administrative pro-
cess and of the risk that— rightly or wrongly— they may 
be accused of corrupt  handling of funds. In  Kenya, a 
farmer can invest his or her savings directly in a small 
slice of a government bond through a mobile phone. 
He or she can become eligible for a small loan on the 
basis of a stable rec ord of receipts and payments on his 
or her mobile account without posting collateral. In 
Andhra Pradesh, a state in India with 50 million  people, 
the authorities can drill down through statewide 
administrative reporting data, in real time and across 
thousands of delivery points, to monitor the provision 
of rations to poor beneficiaries. They can detect trans-
action failures almost immediately and ensure rapid 
follow-up and remediation.
Digital technology, notably in the areas of identification 
(ID), mobile communications, and finance/payments, is 
impacting socie ties and economies across the develop-
ing world in many ways. Technology has increased the 
reach of ID systems and mobile networks and helped to 
increase financial inclusion in many countries; it has 
also boosted capabilities in each area. This is changing 
the ways that citizens and states can interact and trans-
act business with each other across a wide range of 
programs and ser vices.Chapter 1.

+1—the potential for digital technology that enables three 
 things— the precise identification of all parties to an 
interaction; low- cost communications; and accurate, 
accountable, and con ve nient payment processes—to 
help reform citizen– state interactions across any of 
 these modalities.
Having said this,  there is, however, one clear implica-
tion of the shift  towards digital technology for policy 
design. Combined with accurate identification, digital 
payments enable benefits or subsidies to be personal-
ized, rather than relying on blunt, indiscriminate 
mechanisms like controlled prices. As is widely recog-
nized, price subsidies have many undesirable side 
effects and distortions, and they tend to be inequitable 
 because richer consumers use more of the subsidized 
commodity than the poor. The benefits from precise 
personalization of interventions is an impor tant 
theme, and perhaps especially relevant in the context 
of natu ral resource pricing and sustainability.
Beyond this, it is less easy to assert that digital technol-
ogy provides a conclusive argument for one modality 
over another. At first sight, it appears to provide an 
edge to interventions that stress payments or vouchers 
rather than the direct provision of goods or ser vices, 
 because payments become so much more accurate 
and accountable. But in an age that has seen huge 
improvements in logistical efficiency and the emer-
gence of Amazon, e Bay, and Alibaba, this may not 
always be the final word. As noted by Alderman et al. 
(2017):
[I]n- kind assistance has not benefited to the same extent as 
cash transfers from knowledge- sharing and learning plat-
forms. This is an area where countries could greatly benefit in 
exchanging experiences from reform pro cesses, program 
design, and implementation.
We therefore see digital mechanisms as providing 
platforms that are broadly applicable to a wide range 
On the question of school vouchers, Epple, Romano, and Uquiola (2017) pre-
sent a comprehensive review of the economic lit er a ture. While they find 
that, in general, the competition induced by vouchers tends to improve the 
per for mance of public schools, the evidence is not conclusive enough to 
warrant recommending that vouchers be  adopted on a widespread basis.for a universal benefit, as in India), categorical (grants 
to  women only, as in the BISP program in Pakistan, or 
child support grants and pensions, as in South Africa), 
or conditional (the Bangladesh education supplements, 
which require  children to attend school). Another cat-
egory involves the use of vouchers,  whether for the 
purchase of food and essential supplies (the US SNAP 
program), clean cooking fuel (India’s LPG program), 
fertilizers (the digital voucher programs of Nigeria and 
Zambia), or other prescribed commodities. A third cat-
egory is the direct, in- kind provision of essential com-
modities (India’s PDS system) or ser vices such as health 
or education. Yet another group of interactions are 
 those that involve person- to- government or P2G pay-
ments (more generally, person– provider payments), as 
are common in many countries,  whether for vehicle 
registration, passports, hospital care, school or exami-
nation fees, access to public recreational facilities, or 
taxes.
Our objective is not to cover this huge field exhaus-
tively or to advocate for par tic u lar modalities— for 
example,  whether to require conditionality for social 
grants,  whether to replace in- kind food ration pro-
grams with cash grants, or the merits of education 
vouchers relative to public schools.  These questions 
have been much debated and researched, and other 
studies have covered them more completely and 
authoritatively than we can hope to do. In general, the 
lit er a ture does not provide clear and universal pre-
scriptions,  either on conditionality or on the debates 
over cash versus vouchers versus in- kind provision. 
Context  matters, as do the objectives of a par tic u lar 
program.2 The aim of this paper is, rather, to consider 
2. Attanasio, Oppedisano, and Vera- Hernández (2015) summarize arguments 
for and against conditionality in cash transfers. One view is that if cash trans-
fers are desirable, for redistributive purposes or to alleviate liquidity con-
straints, conditionalities would not be required as  house holds would allocate 
the grants to their most efficient use. An alternative view is that conditionali-
ties promote investments in some activities that should be subsidized,  either 
 because of positive externalities or  because of the failure on the part of the 
parents to recognize the long- run returns to such activities. Conditionalities 
can increase the cost of  running programs but may also provide a po liti cal 
justification that allows their survival. Alderman, Gentilini, and Yemtsov 
(2017) provide an extended analy sis of another debated area— the arguments 
for cash transfers versus food vouchers versus food rations.  Here the prime 
focus hinges on the impact on nutrition, but the authors recognize other, 
perhaps complementary, objectives, such as ensuring national food security.

—+1relationship between citizens (in the sense of individu-
als) and states into sharp relief. The explicit focus on 
inclusion signals a shift  towards a rights- based view of 
development even if the goals and targets are not 
explic itly framed in this way.  There is a fine line 
between declaring that every one should have ade-
quate social protection or health care or access to a 
“good job” and asserting  these as rights.
A second difference is that, in contrast to the MDGs, 
the SDGs explic itly recognize the importance of access 
to digital technology. This evolution is not surprising, 
as the period between the announcements of the 
MDGs and the SDGs was one of enormous advances in 
this area. The MDGs  were announced at the 2000 Mil-
lennium Summit, but they originated  earlier, in the 
report Shaping the 21st   Century (Development Assistance 
Committee, 1996). At that time, digital technology had 
only begun to gather momentum from its modest 
beginnings. In 1993 the volume of digital data was 
barely 3   percent of the global total; by 2000 its share 
had risen to 25   percent, and by 2002 to 50   percent. A 
mere five years  later, it was estimated that 94   percent 
of the world’s information storage capacity was digi-
tal.3 By the time the SDGs came of age, the develop-
ment community was enveloped in a digital world, 
with as many mobile subscriptions as  people and about 
half of the global population using the internet. The 
spread of mobile technology has been astonishing, 
including in poor countries; mobile phones are 
becoming a key mode of interaction between citizens 
and states, as well as between private parties. Figure 1.1 
shows global trends in mobile and internet use for the 
2000–2016 interval between the MDGs and SDGs (the 
interval marked by vertical lines).
A third difference is recognition of  legal identity for all 
individuals as a goal (Goal 16.9), although the appro-
priate indicator is still a  matter of some debate. This, 
too, responds to facts on the ground. The period since 
the announcement of the MDGs has seen a huge

more  flexible approach to ser vice delivery, including 
expanding citizen choice over the appropriate form of 
intervention.
Development themes: From MDGs 
to SDGs— with JAM
“Strengthening state capacity” is a nebulous concept. 
Capacity for what? Is a capable state necessarily a 
“good” state? Many examples suggest that the answer 
is not necessarily yes, and that some “capable” states 
have also been heavi ly repressive. Capacity can only be 
understood and assessed relative to some specified 
objectives. For  these, we can turn to the global devel-
opment consensus, as embodied first in the Millen-
nium Development Goals (MDGs) and  later in the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In impor tant 
ways, the latter are far more than simply an extrapola-
tion of the former.
As a first difference, the SDGs marked a quantum 
leap in aspirations. The MDGs  were oriented  towards 
reducing extreme income poverty and vari ous other 
mea sures of severe deprivation. Their targets  were 
broad, mainly related to achieving specified rates of 
pro gress—to reduce severe poverty, bring down 
infant and maternal mortality, and improve other 
development indicators. It was never completely 
clear  whether the goals should be interpreted as 
global ones (would the MDG criteria judge develop-
ment as a success if almost all global pro gress could 
be attributed to China?) or as distinct concerns at the 
level of each region or individual country—or prov-
ince, or municipality?
In contrast, the SDGs represent a critical conceptual 
shift away from focusing on improving global trends 
and  towards universal inclusion— the philosophy 
that  successful development requires that no one be 
left  behind. Even accepting this— and the enormous 
increase over the MDGs in the numbers of specific 
goals and targets—as more aspirational than realistic, 
the level of ambition and scope of the SDGs throws the

+1—Digital Financial Ser vices (DFS) is a relatively new, low- 
cost means of digital access to transactional financial ser-
vices. Aimed at  those at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) 
in developing and emerging countries and with an aspira-
tional goal of improving financial inclusion, it shifts pro-
vision of financial ser vices from primarily banks to 
non- banks, with the core access to ser vices using a mobile 
phone.
The trinity of ID, mobile communications, and finance/
payments— the so- called JAM trinity in India5— has been 
engaged in many countries to help “digitize” a wide 
range of government programs, including  those that 
provide transfers, subsidies, and other benefits. The 
JAM functionalities may be applied in dif fer ent ways 
depending on country- specific conditions and the 
needs of par tic u lar programs. For example,  because of 
Aadhar’s cardless design, mobile is used extensively in 
India to authenticate beneficiaries of government pro-
grams against the central database, while most other 
countries use ID card– based systems. On the other 
hand, “mobile money” provided through new regula-
tory arrangements and relationships between mobile 
network operators (MNOs) and banks is more preva-
lent in East Africa than in India, where finance is still

and Mobile communications.increase in the focus on ID systems and development. 
Since the start of the new millennium, more coun-
tries have initiated national- level ID systems than 
ever had them before (Gelb and Diofasi Metz, 2018). 
Not all are geared up to provide full “digital ID” or 
remote digital authentication, but many have this 
potential, and the vast majority embody digital tech-
nology in vari ous ways, including biometrics to 
ensure that registered identities are unique.4 The 
number of application- specific, or functional, ID sys-
tems has also boomed, spurred on by the needs of 
dif fer ent programs as well as global concerns around 
security following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade 
Center and the Pentagon.
As one consequence of the digital revolution,  there has 
also been an upsurge of attention to financial inclu-
sion and the provision of digital payments and other 
financial ser vices. This has involved both the onboard-
ing of new customers through mobile money and the 
provision of mobile banking and payments for estab-
lished customers of more traditional banks. As defined 
by Perlman and Wechsler (2019):
4. Digital ID or e- ID is usually taken to mean the ability to authenticate indi-
viduals using digital mechanisms,  either remotely or in person by a frontline 
ser vice provider. While this may be the wave of the  future, few systems yet 
have this capability, even though most now use digital technology in essen-
tial ways, including to ensure that identities are unique by biometric 
de- duplication.

—+1more accountable governance, with less corruption 
and higher citizen satisfaction with the quality of 
ser vice.
Fi nally, the sixth cluster,  women’s empowerment and 
gender equality, can be an impor tant consideration in 
the design of digital reforms, even when their main 
focus is not necessarily on this issue. Globally, surveys 
suggest a 1.4  percentage point gap in identification 
coverage, a 6.0 percentage point gender gap in finan-
cial inclusion, and an 8.1 point gap in mobile phone 
owner ship between men and  women. Throughout 
each chapter, we consider how gender differences 
reflect structural barriers that impede uptake among 
potential users. Getting to universal JAM coverage pre-
sents a challenge and an opportunity for  women, but 
 there is a need for policies that facilitate their engage-
ment with digital public ser vice delivery platforms.
Cautions: No “silver bullet”
Before proceeding further, some qualifications are 
needed. First, it is not a new message that context 
 matters more than technology in the application of 
technological “solutions.” Technology is a tool, and by 
their nature tools help do tasks better; on its own, 
technology does not necessarily lead to better policies 
or to stronger implementation— and it can also be used 
to implement bad policies more effectively. Technol-
ogy expands the policy possibility frontier— the set of 
policies that government is able to implement— but 
successful outcomes depend on the objectives to which 
technology is applied and how effective and inclusive 
the systems are that use it. The importance of po liti cal 
economy  factors is evident, for example, in the uneven 
results of proj ects to install financial management 
information systems (FMIS) to strengthen public 
financial management (Cangiano, Gelb, and Goodwin- 
Groen, 2019). This theme— that technology is a tool 
rather than a solution— emerges clearly from the cases 
considered below.
Second, even as we stress potential benefits, we need 
to recognize the potential downsides to a JAM- based bank- based, although  there too the number and value 
of digital payments are increasing rapidly. Such differ-
ences, while impor tant, do not detract from the broad 
commonality in the direction of digitization across 
many countries. For con ve nience, we refer to the trin-
ity by its Indian acronym (JAM) but as a common term 
in a broader global context.
For development applications, we can look for the 
main linkages between the SDGs and JAM.  These are 
set out in Box 1.1 and are grouped into six thematic 
clusters. The first cluster sets out the goals relating 
to universal access to JAM itself—to identity, mobile 
 communications, and financial inclusion. Universal 
JAM is therefore an intrinsic SDG aspiration in its own 
right, as well as an instrument to help achieve other 
SDGs.
 These intrinsic and instrumental aspects of JAM are 
closely related. Governments cannot move programs, 
ser vices, and other interactions with citizens onto a 
digital platform  unless  people are digitally included 
and able to use the systems. But, conversely, govern-
ment programs can provide a power ful stimulus 
 towards universal JAM, increasing demand for ID, 
mobile communications, and finance/payments, and 
at the same time supporting the wider rollout of  these 
ser vices.
The clusters in Box 1.1 can be used to set out policy 
areas where reforms and program implementation 
can be most closely related to JAM. The second cluster 
concerns natu ral resource management and environ-
mental sustainability.  These are areas where pricing 
policies are key. One impor tant use of JAM is to help 
move  towards efficient prices— with equity— through 
shifting from price subsidies  towards individualized 
vouchers or transfers. The third cluster involves the 
broad area of social protection, including both the 
provision of G2P cash payments and in- kind com-
modities or ser vices. The fourth considers the role of 
 frictionless private– government, or P2G, payments to 
facilitate a range of critical public ser vices as well as 
better tax administration. The fifth cluster covers

Another potential example could be the rollout of Aadhaar in Assam, a state 
where the  legal status of many longtime residents is uncertain. The Aadhaar 
does not constitute proof of national status or even  legal residence, but by 
linking Aadhaar numbers to the determination of status, it can be a power ful 
tool to exclude noncitizens from a very wide range of ser vices. See https://

and vulnerable groups. More rigorous identification 
or authentication requirements can exclude their 
members, even without intending to do so. Technol-
ogy makes it easier to deliberately exclude par tic u lar

6. One example has been the Dominican Republic, where the rollout of a 
strengthened ID system facilitated the loss of de facto nationality for many 
residents of Haitian origin even as it supported the inclusion of many poor 
Dominicans into the national social safety net (Gelb and Diofasi Metz, 2018). Box­1 .1 .­SDGs­Related­ to­Digital­ID, ­Mobile, ­and­Payments

—+1not try to be all- encompassing but draws on selected 
examples for their policy lessons. The following sec-
tions of the paper correspond, broadly, to the cluster-
ing of SDG goals and targets set out in Box 1.1.
A picture of JAM coverage
Citizens and states cannot interact with each other 
through JAM if  people do not have ready access to its 
components. This is particularly impor tant for the 
poorer and more excluded sections of society, who 
most need the benefits, ser vices, and access that tech-
nology is intended to provide. Drawing on informa-
tion in Findex surveys and other sources, Chapter  2 
develops an index of JAM inclusion— the first SDG clus-
ter in Box 1.1. Even as ID systems and digital access have 
spread across the world,  there are still many who lack 
access of some, or all, of the trinity.  These include 
many of the poorest and most vulnerable, who are 
most in need of the support and ser vices that govern-
ments need to provide.
Inclusion into the components of JAM is  shaped by a 
range of country- level  factors and layered attributes at 
the personal level. Individuals who are rich, male, in 
the workforce, and well educated are very likely to be 
financially included, especially if they also have an ID 
and a mobile phone. Conversely, poor  women not in 
the workforce and with  little education are unlikely to 
have an account, especially if they do not have an ID or 
mobile phone. In terms of individual coverage, the 
vari ous JAM components tend to come together. As 
well as supply- side policies, demand- side mea sures, 
such as providing social transfers through financial 
ser vice providers, can help to boost inclusion for less 
favored groups.  Women in par tic u lar confront large 
gaps in mobile owner ship in some countries, as well as 
in financial access.
Of course, coverage is not a sufficient metric. Quality 
dimensions are also impor tant; the capabilities of an ID 
system (and how it  handles grievances and authentica-
tion failures), the reliability and speed of mobile con-
nectivity, and the con ve nience and interoperability of use of mobile technology, and the replacement of 
(anonymous) cash by digital payments can facilitate 
profiling, as well as transactional and location track -
ing.  These systems generate massive amounts of data, 
which can raise threats to privacy. From the govern-
ment’s perspective, the ineffectual implementation of 
digitization programs that serve no useful purpose can 
lead to wasted resources. And, even as digital technol-
ogy has the potential to increase state capacity, it 
imposes new capacity requirements on states to regu-
late the area (Ndung’u, 2019) and to manage data, as 
well as capacity requirements for citizens who need to 
be able to access payments, ser vices, and information 
in new ways.
Third, just as technology is a tool that can increase effi-
ciency, when combined with vast amounts of informa-
tion, it also amplifies power. The ability to collect, 
aggregate, and analyze large volumes of data shifts the 
balance of power  towards  those who are able to draw 
insights and take action.7 While this creates new oppor-
tunities for states to improve governance, not all of 
them may be benign in the design of their policies 
based on the information collected. Citizens and states 
must continue developing new ways to constrain and 
balance power so that governments serve the needs of 
citizens through the appropriate use of technology.
A final caution is that this is a rapidly evolving area. 
Only a few use cases have been rigorously researched, 
and  these tend to be in relatively few countries. India 
has emerged as a country of special interest, a global 
laboratory for the deployment of digitized programs, 
often at  great scale.8 But other countries also offer use-
ful examples, including the remarkable cases of the 
rollout of mobile money in East Africa, Bangladesh, 
and some other countries, and the use of e- vouchers 
to reform pricing policies in  others. This paper does 
7 . For example, it is often feasible to identify individuals based on fully ano-
nymized data. Kondor, Hashemian, de Montjoye, and Ratti (2018)  were able 
to match mobility metadata to individuals at a 17   percent success rate with 
one week of observations, increasing to over 55  percent with four weeks.

fer (DBT) cash transfers and 700 million in DBT in- kind transfers using digi-
tal mechanisms, including Aadhaar identification. See https:// www  . cogitasia

beyond the scope of this paper, but this section con-
cludes with a compact list of the main policy directions 
for accelerating universal access to JAM.
 Towards sustainability: Efficient pricing  
with equity
Even  after the decline in energy prices from peak lev-
els, bud getary and economic subsidies continue to be a 
major concern in many countries. In addition, coun-
tries have been slow to levy “green taxes” to price fuels 
to reflect the impact of emissions on climate change, 
health, and other externalities. Pricing policy is a more 
general issue; many governments offer price subsidies 
on other products with environmental effects, such as 
fertilizers, or fail to price valuable natu ral resources, 
such as  water or forests, to reflect their scarcity and the 
environmental ser vices they provide. Failure to imple-
ment “efficient” pricing that takes externalities into 
consideration creates massive misallocation losses and 
compromises several SDG goals and targets.
While  there are many challenges to implementing effi-
cient pricing policies, an impor tant one is how to do 
so in an equitable manner— the second SDG cluster in 
Box 1.1. Even though the poor may consume less energy 
than the rich, fuels and energy- intensive items can 
account for a sizable share of their spending. As set out 
in Chapter 4, JAM can help to personalize compen-
satory subsidies through direct transfer programs or 
vouchers, and to reform pricing in areas such as fuels 
or fertilizers. This enables efficient pricing policies to 
be implemented in an equitable way. As shown by the 
case of India’s massive LPG program, which shifted 
from price subsidies to a form of voucher, it can also 
facilitate new approaches to targeting, increasing sav-
ings that can then be used to expand coverage to the 
poor. But technology does not make policy;  there is no 
guarantee that countries  will respond to this expan-
sion of the policy possibility frontier to improve sus-
tainability, efficiency, and equity.financial and payment systems can be as critical as 
the level of access, although they are less systematically 
documented.
Policies  towards universal JAM
As set out in Chapter  3,  there are strong synergies 
between the three components of JAM as well as two- 
way supply- side and demand- side  drivers between 
JAM and its use in the delivery of public ser vices. The 
combination of ID, mobiles, and finance/payments is 
greater than the sum of its parts. Impediments to one 
component  will impede demand for the  others, while 
access to any one component makes it easier to roll out 
the  others. In many countries, the need to register 
SIMs is the greatest stimulus to acquiring an ID, with 
KYC requirements for a financial account not far 
 behind. Conversely, having an effective ID system can 
cut the cost of onboarding clients for mobile and 
financial ser vices.  There are also power ful economies 
of scope— the provision of mobile financial ser vices, as 
well as voice and data ser vices, boosts the business case 
for constructing cell towers to expand mobile cover-
age. Routing government- to- person (G2P) payments 
through bank or mobile accounts can help drive finan-
cial inclusion and encourage competition, especially if 
recipients have a choice of payments provider. Con-
versely, a wide range of fee- for- service programs, 
 whether for health, education, driver’s licenses, pass-
ports, or access to national parks, can be facilitated by 
frictionless and accountable digital P2G payments— the 
fourth SDG cluster noted in Box 1.1.
In areas related to JAM  there  will typically be at least a 
dozen dif fer ent agencies and regulatory bodies, in 
addition to the many ministries and agencies respon-
sible for the government programs and ser vices that 
can use JAM. The synergies argue for a strategic view of 
how best to increase access, using both supply- side 
and demand- side policies.  Because of the importance 
of individual attributes in coverage, active mea sures 
 will be needed to ensure that the most vulnerable

—+1road to financial inclusion. At the same time, in 
strongly patriarchal settings they may face difficult 
prob lems of agency, not being able to exercise the 
opportunities that digital reforms are able to provide. 
This warrants careful attention in the design of 
reforms.
 Towards real- time governance
With accurate identification, mobile communications, 
and payments, citizen– state interactions and payments 
can be tracked individually and in real time. Even as 
they raise certain risks, the huge volumes of data 
produced by such digital systems can be used to moni-
tor per for mance and increase accountability. They 
can also facilitate rapid citizen feedback and choice 
between dif fer ent ser vice providers or, indeed, alter-
native programs.
Real- time feedback systems are not new. Major compa-
nies such as Amazon, Google, Walmart, and FedEx or 
UPS make extensive use of data analytics, including rat-
ings. Some airports, too, are following Singapore’s lead 
by offering passengers the opportunity to signal satis-
faction with security or check-in pro  cesses by choosing 
to press a button with a smiley, neutral, or frowny face. 
But in the development context, this area, related to 
Cluster 5  in Box 1.1, is still nascent. While some pro-
grams have moved  towards collecting real- time data, 
few have yet developed comprehensive systems to ana-
lyze it in real time, to combine administrative data and 
customer feedback, and to cycle the information back 
to improve quality of implementation and accountabil-
ity of government functionaries as well as frontline 
public ser vice providers.  These capabilities represent 
the most advanced phase of the digital revolution and 
are still very much at the frontier.
Chapter  6 draws on selected cases to consider digital 
governance and accountability, notably India’s LPG 
program and, in par tic u lar, the comprehensive sys-
tems developed in Andhra Pradesh. It also considers 
the preconditions for demanding systems of this type Social protection and associated goals
Chapter 5 considers the third cluster of SDGs in Box 1.1, 
related to the more efficient and equitable implemen-
tation of a range of G2P transfers and in- kind benefits. 
Digital delivery can improve the per for mance of both 
 these modalities along some critical dimensions: bet-
ter ser vice, user con ve nience, and choice of provider, 
and possibly fiscal savings. But cases also show that 
results are heavi ly dependent on the institutional con-
text, the objectives of the reform, and  whether incen-
tives are also addressed along the delivery chain as this 
is digitized, to encourage ser vice providers to reach 
out to their clients. Ill- designed reforms can raise 
transactional costs and access barriers for poor benefi-
ciaries, thus increasing exclusion. One priority is for 
accurate and timely monitoring of per for mance, par-
ticularly as it impacts beneficiaries. Placing fiscal sav-
ings as the sole, or even the dominant, objective of the 
reform is likely to result in worsened ser vice and per-
haps exclusion. Far better is to seek to improve effi-
ciency and delivery, and to reap savings in the pro  cess.
With the population financially included, fee- for-  
service programs can be facilitated by frictionless and 
accountable digital P2G payments, as described in Clus-
ter 4 of Box 1. While we do not address this in detail in 
this report, the available lit er a ture suggests the need for 
an enabling digital payments ac cep tance ecosystem to 
reap the full benefits of digital G2P transfers.  Because so 
many dif fer ent regulatory agencies and ser vice programs 
are involved, governments need to adopt a strategic 
approach based on JAM as an integrated platform for 
ser vice delivery and governance, not only to increase 
efficiency of public expenditure but also to improve its 
capacity for mobilization of domestic resources through 
taxation. Each country starts from a dif fer ent place, so 
the details  will differ (as we illustrate in the cases of  Kenya 
and India in Chapter 2), but the lessons from the cases 
presented  here would be relevant for many countries.
Programs can also be structured to provide advantages 
to  women, including launching their first steps on the

Full application might be beyond the pre sent capabil-
ity of many countries, but ele ments of the approach 
could be introduced into many programs.  There is still 
a  great deal to learn about the applications of JAM to 
strengthen state capacity, but this, in par tic u lar, is an 
area that warrants far more research.to be effective. One is po liti cal  will; administrative and 
customer feedback data cannot be effective in driving 
per for mance  unless  there is a commitment to use it 
for this purpose. The other is a reasonable degree of 
preexisting capacity; if this is lacking, feedback  will 
overwhelm the ability of the system to respond to it.

2017 , the latest date pos si ble, and explores  factors 
associated with exclusion and gender gaps.
Data considerations
Creating an index of access to JAM  faces challenges, set 
out in more detail in Annex 1. Survey data are lacking 
on some impor tant countries. Mea sures of coverage— 
whether an individual has access to an ID, a mobile or 
SIM, and a financial account—do not account for the 
quality of the ser vices  these facilities are able to pro-
vide, including the capabilities needed to reduce 
transaction costs through the full use of digital tech-
nology. Each facet of JAM pre sents specific nuances to 
be considered.
■ Is the ID system robust, and can it assure users 
that identities are unique? Should the mea sure 
focus on only one credential, such as a national 
ID (the approach in the Findex survey), or count 
a voter card or some other widely held creden-
tial that may offer a partial substitute (the 
approach in the World Bank’s ID4D database)? 
How to allow for the capabilities of dif fer ent sys-
tems, including their ability to offer full remote 
digital authentication and e- KYC? Although 
almost all national ID and similar systems now 
use digital technology in many ways, only a few 
have  these capabilities.9 How do the systems 
9. Digital authentication can be defined as the capability to authenticate 
identity by digital means,  whether in person at a ser vice fa cil i ty (Aadhaar) or 
remotely, using a mobile or other portable device (Estonia). Although most 
systems use digital technology in vari ous ways, including biometrics to The UK government made Universal Credit the first major 
government ser vice that is “digital by default.” . . .  Many 
poorer and more vulnerable  house holds are effectively 
offline . . .  21% of the UK population do not have five 
basic digital skills. . . .  Universal Credit has built a digital 
barrier that effectively obstructs many individuals’ access 
to their entitlements.  Women, older  people,  people who 
do not speak En glish and the disabled are more likely to 
be unable to overcome this hurdle. . . .  As of March of this 
year, only about one third of all Universal Credit claim-
ants could verify their identity online via GOV  . UK Verify, 
a crucial step in the application pro cess.
— Professor Philip Alston, United Nations  
Special Rapporteur on Extreme  
Poverty and  Human Rights (2018)
States cannot effectively move their ser vices and inter-
actions with citizens onto a digital footing without 
ensuring that all have the means to access them. This 
can be a special challenge for the poorer and less con-
nected social and economic groups that are the focus of 
many government programs. As shown by the example 
of Universal Credit in the UK, the prob lem of including 
all when systems transition  towards new delivery mech-
anisms is not confined to poor countries. Over time, the 
coverage and capabilities of ID systems and mobile net-
works have been increasing, as has the number of 
 people with financial accounts. But  there are still many 
who lack one or more of the interrelated ele ments of 
JAM, and who  will not easily be able to participate in 
programs that require them as conditions of inclusion.
This chapter considers the first cluster of SDGs in 
Box 1.1. It draws on data from the Findex 2017 survey Chapter 2.

+1—its population with financial accounts: financial access 
 rose from 35   percent in 2011 to 53   percent in 2014 and 
to 80   percent in 2017 , largely closing the gender gap in 
the pro  cess. As coverage increases,  there  will be an 
increasing focus on quality of ser vices and capabilities 
rather than on  simple inclusion numbers. But this 
should not distract attention from the remaining chal-
lenge of including all.
A global snapshot
Findex 2017 is the largest survey that can provide a 
combined picture of all three JAM components at the 
individual level. It covers 144 countries, but for the 
2017 iteration it excludes Somalia, a country of  great 
interest. For 45 countries the survey did not include a 
question on possession of a national ID. Most of  these 
are high- income states, but the list also includes sev-
eral impor tant developing countries such as the 
Demo  cratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Iran, Nige-
ria, and the Philippines. The individual- level analy sis 
can therefore cover 99 countries that have individual- 
level data on all three components.
Population- weighted individual survey results for 
 these 99 countries show that 93.3   percent of adults 
have a national ID, 80.0   percent own a mobile phone, 
and 65.9   percent have a financial account, that is, a 
bank or mobile money account. (As flagged in Box 2.1, 
this terminology differs from that in Findex, so that 
“financial inclusion” corresponds to having a “finan-
cial account,” which can include mobile money.) For 
 women, the corresponding numbers are 92.6, 75.4, 
and 61.8   percent. This picture represents substantial 
achievement against the first cluster of SDGs set out in 
Box 1.1, Chapter 1. ID falls  under 16.9 ( legal identity for 
all), mobile phones  under 9.c (increase access to infor-
mation and communications technology), finance 
 under 8.10 (expand access to banking, insurance, and 
financial ser vices for all), in addition to the gender- 
focused cross- cutting 5.b (enhance the use of enabling 
technology, in par tic u lar ICT, to promote the empow-
erment of  women).protect personal data and remediate technology 
failure?
■ Mobile access can be mea sured in several dif fer-
ent ways, including the number of total active 
SIMs per (adult) population, the number of 
unique subscribers (which can be difficult to 
monitor in a country without a robust unique ID 
system), or the percentage of (adult) possession 
of a mobile phone. This may underestimate 
access since  people may share mobile facilities, 
accessing ser vices through a close  family mem-
ber. Potential access can be mea sured as the 
share of the population in areas with mobile 
coverage. The speed and reliability of connectiv-
ity constrains the range and quality of ser vices 
that mobile can offer, including the con ve nience 
and reliability of digital payments.
■ Financial accounts offer variable bundles of ser-
vices and dif fer ent levels of con ve nience to their 
holders. Some countries have moved  towards 
full payments interoperability; in  others it may 
be easier and cheaper to cash out and cash in 
again than to transfer funds across providers. 
Some accounts may be inactive, so that their 
number overestimates use- based financial 
inclusion.10 On the other hand, some  people 
without financial accounts may have effective 
financial access through a close  family member.
The JAM picture can also change rapidly at the country 
level, so that any survey is a transient snapshot. Malawi, 
for example, rolled out its national ID in late 2017 ,  after 
the Findex survey, extending coverage to almost all 
adults (Malik, forthcoming 2020). India has seen a 
remarkable increase in the coverage of Aadhaar and 
mobile communications, as well as the proportion of 
de- duplicate identities, only a few have the capacity and authentication eco-
system to enable fully digital or remote authentication, or to source personal 
data electronically to satisfy KYC requirements, thus bypassing paper docu-
mentation. The combination of ID, mobile, and finance can work in dif fer-
ent ways, so that, for the purpose of assessing coverage gaps, we abstract 
from this question. However, as countries shift  towards digital ser vices and 
commerce, the capabilities of ID systems  will become increasingly impor  tant.
10. Perlman and Wechsler (2019) note that while the number of mobile 
money accounts has been rising, so have levels of inactivity.

tently have higher rates of ID and mobile owner ship 
than access to financial accounts. Only the top five 
countries have over 90   percent financial account 
owner ship, so that financial inclusion and Goal 8.10 
remain the major laggard of the three components. 
Only South Sudan and Malawi come in below 100, and 
Malawi’s successful ID registration in late 2017 and 2018 Coverage varies substantially by country and region. 
Figure  2.1a stacks adult coverage for each component 
by country on a scale of 0–100 such that full coverage 
would represent a score of 300. Unsurprisingly, the 
score tends to rise with income levels— but  there are 
outliers. Even as countries like  Kenya are nearing uni-
versal access, some richer ones, like Mexico and Lao 
PDR, rank far lower than would be expected. Most Box­2 .1 .­Note­on­ Terminology­and­ Weighting
Account types
We draw on the Global Findex for much of our data 
but use a dif fer ent vocabulary to describe financial 
inclusion. Specifically, we discuss three types of 
accounts.
This differs from the Findex database labels, which 
reserve the term “Financial Account” for  those with 
a bank or formal financial institution and treats the 
combination of  these and mobile money accounts 
as “All Accounts.”
National IDs
The Global Findex mea sures  whether  people have 
a nationally defined identity card.  There is signifi-
cant heterogeneity in the types and quality of 
 these IDs, which is discussed in more depth in 
Annex 1.
Financial: a transacting
account that at the very least
can be used to save money and
make transactions. This
includes both institutional
bank accounts and mobile
money accounts. However , this
does not include accounts with
a rotating credit and savings
association (ROSCA) or , for
example, department store–
issued credit cards.Bank: a transacting account with a bank
or formal financial institution, “such as a
credit union, a microfinance institution, a
cooperative, or the post of fice (if applicable),
or having a debit card” (Findex Glossary).
Mobile Money: a transacting account with
a mobile money service that is included in
the GSMA’ s Mobile Money database.{Mobile phone owner ship
Information about mobile phone owner ship is 
based on the Gallup World Poll survey, for which 
the Global Findex was a module.
Weighting
All statistics in this section are computed using 
population weights. In the micro data, each person 
comes with a sample weight that is relative to their 
own individual country. To arrive at the population 
weights used in our analy sis, we aggregate weights 
by country. Second, each individual’s weight is 
divided by their aggregated national weight and 
then multiplied by the adult population of that 
country. To ensure that weights are not driving sta-
tistical findings, we test uniform country weights 
in Annex 2.2 and find that results are relatively sta-
ble for dif fer ent weighting systems.

is quite high in (relatively poor) South Asia, a conse-
quence of the aggressive opening of Jan Dhan bank 
accounts in India to receive the proceeds of G2P pay-
ments, lower in the  Middle East and North Africa, sub- 
Saharan Africa (SSA), and surprisingly low in (relatively 
richer) Latin Amer i ca and the Ca rib bean. In the MENA 
region, Morocco (28.6   percent) and Egypt (32.8) pull 
down the regional average,11 while Algeria, Jordan,

where:  Table 2.1 excludes countries that do not have data for national ID cov-
erage but have higher account coverage, such as Iran (94.0   percent) and 
Libya (65.7   percent). Still, the spread of outcomes— especially for large coun-
tries—is worth considering.(Malik, forthcoming 2020) should see it leapfrog ahead 
in the next round of data collection. Figure 2.1b shows 
the distribution of JAM scores for the lowest tercile of 
countries and for the low- income countries, two sub-
samples that are considered separately in Annex 2.2.
 Table  2.1 aggregates at the regional level. ID coverage 
surpasses 90   percent everywhere except in sub- 
Saharan Africa, where low levels are largely driven by 
fragile or conflict- affected situations. Mobile phone

in large countries can represent enormous user bases 
in absolute terms. For example, at 19 million  people 
the 2.0   percent of Indian adults with mobile payments 
represent the third- largest user base.12  After  these 
three, the next largest in Findex 2017 include Iran (16.1 
million), Tanzania (11.8 million), Uganda (10.9 million), 
Turkey (9.7 million), and Pakistan (8.7 million).
One impor tant outlier that was not surveyed in the 
2017 edition of Findex is Somalia. In 2014, 75   percent of 
its financial inclusion was accounted for by mobile 
money accounts. A 2017 World Bank study found that 
mobile money penetration had grown to 73   percent of 
adults (16 years and older), while mobile phone owner-
ship sat at 90.1   percent and ID at 44   percent (Altai Con-
sulting, 2017). The gender gap in mobile money was only 
5  percent— quite small relative to comparator coun-
tries, although perhaps less surprising as mobile money 
has largely displaced the role of cash for transactions. 
Somalia’s mobile network operators operate in an 
12. In all likelihood, at the time of publication India is prob ably already far 
ahead of Bangladesh in terms of its mobile money user base. The 2.0   percent 
estimate falls within the 2.2   percent margin of error for the India sample, 
and even a 0.6 percentage point increase would be sufficient to put India’s 
user base ahead of Bangladesh. Likewise, Annex note 2.1 on the JAM data 
describes how an Indian mobile money platform launched during the Fin-
dex 2017 sampling pro  cess had accumulated over 350 million active users 
within two years, again suggesting that India now has an enormous mobile 
money user base—to say nothing of China.Lebanon, and Morocco suffer from gender gaps of 
over 20 percentage points in account coverage.
Figure 2.2 shows relationships with income at the coun-
try level. While most countries report reasonably high ID 
coverage, the strugglers are not  limited to the poorest 
countries. Panels B and C show clearer relationships 
between mobile and financial access and income, 
although the dispersion around the trends is consider-
able. The strongest relationship at the national level is 
between income and financial inclusion. In the poorest 
countries, only around 30  percent of adults  will typically 
hold a financial account, but mobile phone owner ship of 
60  percent is not unusual, even in a poor country.
The state of financial inclusion in SSA has some dis-
tinctive features. It is relatively high in a number of 
countries, including  Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zim -
babwe, largely due to the prevalence of mobile money. 
With a JAM score of 258,  Kenya stands out as exceptional 
considering its level of income and development, well 
ahead of South Africa and India. Beneath similar JAM 
scores, countries can be very dif fer ent; a comparison of 
 Kenya and India offers an example (Box 2.2). Overall, 
mobile money accounts for around 10  percentage 
points of SSA’s 45   percent financial coverage; Box 2.3 
sets out its contribution for leading countries.
As impressive as mobile money penetration has been 
in Africa, however, the largest absolute user bases 
are  found elsewhere. From the 2017 Findex data, the ­ Table­2 .1 . ­JAM­components­by­region

two. Among  those who have two of the three compo-
nents, more than twice as many  people have an ID 
and a mobile phone than an ID and a financial 
account, confirming that the  drivers for mobile are 
stronger than  those for financial inclusion. Signifi-
cant gaps exist, and the 2.1   percent of  people who are 
fully excluded from all three JAM components  will be 
the hardest populations to reach. Analyzing the data 
at a more granular level  will allow us to better iden-
tify  those populations and design policies to reach

nation of insecurity and weak governance. While secu-
rity concerns have pushed  people  towards mobile 
money for P2P payments and as an alternative to hold-
ing cash, the lack of regulation, including the lack of an 
effective ID system, means that trust in mobile net-
work operators and the system as a  whole is low (Altai 
Consulting, 2017). Without an effective ID system to 
register accounts and transactions, it is difficult to use 
the system for payments for public ser vices.

sector remained bank- based, with many accounts 
opened to receive G2P direct- benefit transfers. In 
contrast, spurred by an explosion in digital P2P and 
 later P2B payments, using feature phones rather 
than smartphones, and with an innovative domi-
nant provider, mobile money accounted for much 
of  Kenya’s financial inclusion.
 Kenya’s high digital consumer readiness and prev-
alence of digital transactions may also reflect the 
relative strength of its education system, with an 
estimated 7 .8 learning- adjusted years of school rel-
ative to only 5.8 years in India. Kenya and India both have high JAM scores for 
their income levels, but this masks some impor tant 
differences. For ID,  Kenya operates a traditional 
card- based system with wide coverage, while 
India’s Aadhaar system provides full digital ID to 
virtually all adult residents, including e- KYC to 
streamline the opening of financial accounts and 
SIM registration. Mobile owner ship was higher in 
 Kenya in the Findex 2017 survey, but with major 
efforts to improve infrastructure and affordability, 
India had pulled ahead in the 2018 GSMA Index of

mobile money accounts (that is, users who do not 
also have a bank account). As of 2017 , the only non-  
African country to make it into the top 20 is Para-
guay. Likewise, top- placed Côte d’Ivoire and Chad 
along with four other countries are listed as fragile 
and conflict- affected situations, demonstrating the 
potential for mobile money to bridge financial 
inclusion gaps even in very weak institutional con-
texts with  limited banking systems. As noted else-
where, mobile money is even more dominant in 
Somalia, both relative to its banking system and in 
terms of absolute coverage.Countries that are higher up the income ladder gen-
erally have higher levels of financial inclusion. This 
is not universally the case, however, and several Afri-
can countries like  Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and 
Tanzania are outperforming lower middle- income 
countries like Honduras, Pakistan, and the Philip-
pines, and even upper middle- income countries 
like Colombia and Mexico. Many of  these cases can 
be attributed to the additionality provided by mobile 
money, which remains largely an African story.

+1—Regarding the 2.1   percent of completely excluded indi-
viduals in Figure 2.4, 2.7   percent of  women fall into this 
category, almost twice the 1.4   percent rate of men. 
While the highest rates of full exclusion track closely 
with mea sures of overall coverage, the countries that 
host the highest absolute numbers of fully excluded are 
large countries: Pakistan and Ethiopia (both around 16 
million), India (9.9 million), Bangladesh (6.8 million), 
Indonesia (4.6 million), and Mexico (4.1 million).
Of  these cases, Pakistan illustrates how gender can be a 
major  factor for exclusion. Its fully excluded popula-
tion includes 21.0   percent of  women, but only 
5.1   percent of men. Only 32.6   percent of Pakistani 
 women own a mobile phone, which is less than half 
the rate of men (72.3   percent). Only a quarter of 
 women in the poorest income quintile own mobile 
phones, and the rate does not surpass even 35   percent 
 until the richest quintile. If income has an effect 
on  diminishing gender- based exclusion for mobile 
phones, it therefore kicks in only at the highest income 
quintile.  Under the BISP program, discussed further in Panel B shows the same picture for the 33 countries 
that make up the lowest tercile by overall JAM score. 
For this sample, only about one in five  people have all 
three components, while 13.3   percent are completely 
excluded. While 74.1   percent of  people have an ID and 
60.2   percent have a mobile, less than one in three 
holds a financial account.
Findex enables analy sis of coverage gaps by several dif-
fer ent attributes, including income quintile, gender, 
 labor force status, and region.13 Within- country income 
quintile influences financial inclusion more than it does 
mobile owner ship, as shown in Figure  2.5; while both 
panels A and B show a steady increase with income in 
the proportions of  people who, respectively, own an 
account or a mobile phone, the effect is more power ful 
for financial accounts than for mobiles.14
13. Unfortunately, Findex does not provide public data on rural/urban status. 
This is likely to be impor tant for JAM  because of  limited mobile network cov-
erage in sparse regions.
14. The low outliers in mobile phone owner ship include South Sudan and 
Madagascar in all quintiles, joined by Malawi and Ethiopia in two cases.

—+1Both are troublingly high rates of exclusion for a sta-
ble country with a relatively functional bureaucracy.
Researchers have noted the low level of financial 
account owner ship in Latin Amer i ca and the Ca rib-
bean relative to their per capita income levels. The 
conundrum has generated several hypotheses, includ-
ing pervasive income in equality and deficiencies in 
institutional quality (Rojas- Suarez, 2016), low levels of 
financial literacy (Garcia, Grifoni, López, and Mejía, 
2013), and “insufficient resources, high charges and 
mistrust of, or discomfort with, banking institutions” 
(Solo, 2008). While it is easy to come up with examples 
of  these  factors outside the region, the Findex data 
does offer some support for the cost argument. 
 Table  2.2 lists several reasons cited for not having a 
bank account. The first three relate to  factors largely 
on the supply side of financial ser vices: distance to 
ser vice point, costs and charges levied on financial 
accounts, and the difficulty in meeting documentation 
requirements to open accounts; the last can also act 
directly to depress demand. The last three relate to 
 factors on the demand side: lack of money to deposit 
into an account, ability to access a shared account, and 
expressed lack of need for financial ser vices. Overall, 
lack of money is the most frequently cited reason, par-
ticularly in (poorer) sub- Saharan Africa, but LAC is a 
clear outlier on the cost of maintaining an account. 
Fully 53   percent of  those without an account cited 
this as a reason, far above the percentages in other 
regions.15 To expand their coverage, financial sectors 
 will need to innovate, moving  towards lower- cost 
mobile and low- fee accounts and designing and mar-
keting financial products that serve the con ve nience 
and needs of marginalized groups (Mattern and Tarazi, 
2015). Lack of necessary documentation can refer to a 
national ID or similar credential, but banks fre-
quently require additional documentation to open an 
account. Chapter  3 elaborates further on risk- based 
15. In the 2017 Global Financial Access and Consumer Protection Report, 
59  percent of reporting countries had no regulations on bank charges. Only 
8  percent regulated account opening fees and 10   percent account mainte-
nance fees.Chapter 5, Pakistan has used dedicated bank transmis-
sion accounts to deliver social benefits to poor  women, 
but it is pos si ble that this choice has had an oppor-
tunity cost by failing to stimulate a demand channel 
for mobile communications. Ethiopia is also a nota-
ble case—36.1   percent of  women have none of the 
three components, compared to 15.9   percent of men. 100%

comparable to that of the average male, but only 
53.6   percent of  women out of the workforce have an 
account. Of the  women who have a primary education 
or less, 60.3   percent have an account, and for  those 
outside of the workforce, only 48.3  percent.
Although mobile phone owner ship is higher on average 
than financial inclusion, the gender gap is slightly larger 
at 9.3  percentage points. Again, mobile phone owner-
ship among working females is near that of (all) males, 
but only 67 .3   percent of out- of- workforce  women have 
a mobile phone. In the poorest quintile, 68.4   percent of 
 women overall have mobile phones, but if  those  women 
are out of the workforce, the proportion drops to 
62.8   percent. Notably, 95.3   percent of  women with ter-
tiary education or more own a mobile phone, slightly 
more than the 93.8  percent of men who do.
Another approach to help understand what  matters 
most for  women’s financial inclusion is to apply the 
Blinder- Oaxaca decomposition to analyze inclusion 
gaps.17  Table 2.3 breaks down the differences in finan-
cial account owner ship into three components: (1) 
 those due to observed characteristics (“endowments”), 
17 . For a description of this procedure, see Jann (2008). This decomposition 
uses a logistic regression based on Model 4b in Annex 2, but it has been 
somewhat modified due to the way that Stata computes this decomposition. 
The education and income components are pro  cessed as continuous, rather 
than categorical, variables, and country dummies are not included.KYC approaches to simplify requirements for restricted 
accounts to ser vice poor customers.
Gender gaps in the JAM trinity
Gender coverage gaps in the JAM trinity reflect the lay-
ering of several attributes, each associated with exclu-
sion. At 92.6   percent,  women have 1.4  percentage 
points lower ID coverage than men. The difference is 
compounded by the intersection of income and work -
force participation— only 88.6   percent of  women in the 
poorest quintile and not in the workforce have ID. For 
out- of- workforce men, inclusion bottoms out in the 
second income quintile at 87 .4   percent. It is unclear 
 whether lack of ID might make it difficult to access 
employment or  whether other vectors of poverty and 
deprivation, or seclusion from social and economic 
activity, which make it difficult to obtain ID, also make 
it difficult to find gainful employment. Regardless, the 
groups that have the highest levels of ID exclusion tend 
to be poor and out of the workforce.
Figure 2.6 breaks down the two remaining JAM com-
ponents (using the 99- country sample). Examining 
financial account coverage,  women are less included 
than men in all cases bar one.16 Overall, men have 
8.3  percentage points higher account coverage than 
16. Working  women with the highest levels of education are just as financially 
included (90  percent) as their male counter parts.­ Table­2 .2 . ­Reasons­for­not ­having­a­bank­account

—+1Differential coefficients are less salient; a higher level 
of education, a change in workforce status, or being 
in a higher income quintile have broadly similar 
effects in changing the probability of financial inclu-
sion for  women and men. In other words, when 
examining financial inclusion, it is not that  women 
are affected differently by income level; it is simply 
that they are poorer.
 These group differences are amplified as we apply 
the decomposition to the more  limited country sam-
ples for the lowest JAM tercile and LICs. In LICs, 
owning a mobile phone emerges as the most impor-
tant contributor to the gender gap in financial inclu -
sion (2.7  percentage points), followed by having 
a  national ID (2.6  percentage points) and work -
force  participation status (2.2  percentage points). 
This suggests that the complementarities between 
the ele ments of the JAM trinity are stronger in low-  
income countries. Each country  will be dif fer ent; 
policymakers  will need to understand the social and 
economic  factors, as well as  those relating to policies 
and regulation, that limit universal access to JAM. 
Nevertheless, global patterns provide useful bench-
marks for comparison.including income and workforce status, education 
level, access to ID and mobiles, and  whether the indi-
vidual received a government transfer in the last 12 
months; (2)  those due to dif fer ent coefficients on  those 
characteristics (“coefficients”), and (3) the interactions 
between  these two effects (“interaction”). Fortunately, 
the interaction terms are small, allowing us to concen-
trate on the first two sets of effects. Intuitively, the esti-
mates for endowments represent how much better off 
 women would be if they had the same observed char-
acteristics, while the estimates for the coefficients rep-
resent the advantage men have over  women when all 
observed characteristics are equal.
The first conclusion is that the endowment effects 
dominate the coefficient effects. For the full sample, 
the gender gap of 8.0 percentage points would close 
by 5.5  percentage points if  women had the same 
observed characteristics as men. Workforce partici-
pation (2.4  percentage points) and mobile phone 
owner ship (1.4 percentage points) are the largest con-
tributors to the gender gap in financial inclusion.18 
18.  These findings echo the conclusions of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 
Global Microscope 2019, which notes that barriers to accessing tools like 
mobile phones and the internet also interfere with  women’s capacity to 
access financial instruments.In the wo rkforce

of countries designated as LICs. In general, the results 
are quite stable, including when dummy variables are 
included to allow for unobserved country- level  factors.
Individual attributes enter with the expected signs and 
are impor tant. For the global sample, when all are 
favorable, the probability that an individual  will have a 
financial account is as high as 84   percent. When they 
are all negative, it is only about 7   percent. Having an 
ID and a mobile boosts the probability of financial 
inclusion— removing  these from the favorable scenario 
drops the probability to 44   percent, while adding them 
to the unfavorable scenario boosts it to 34   percent. Financial inclusion patterns and 
government transfers: Insights from 
logistic regressions
Several studies, including Klapper and Singer (2017) 
and Stuart (2016), have considered the potential for 
government transfers to spur financial inclusion. 
Logistic regressions can further analyze the association 
of individual attributes with financial inclusion—  
education level, income quintile, gender, workforce 
status, having an ID or a mobile phone, and also 
 whether or not the individual received a government 
transfer. Detailed results are set out in Annex 2 for a 
variety of specifications across all 99 countries, for the ­ Table­2 .3 . ­Exposing­financial­inclusion­gender­gaps­using­a­Blinder-­ Oaxaca­

—+1 because more transfer payments are made through 
financial accounts rather than in cash. The category 
includes 68.5   percent of transfer recipients (6.4   percent 
of the LMIC population).
From data to policy
Although only a rough snapshot of JAM coverage in 
2017 , this picture suggests some impor tant conclusions 
regarding the first set of SDGs in Box 1.1,  those relating 
to identification, mobile coverage, and financial inclu-
sion.  There is no single  factor that shapes coverage. At 
the country level it correlates with income, but the 
considerable variation around this relationship indi-
cates the importance of other  factors, including policy. 
Countries like  Kenya and India are well above their 
expected ranking;  those like Mexico and Lao PDR are 
lower. Finance is the lagging component; mobile 
money can make a major contribution to financial 
inclusion (including in very difficult conditions, as 
shown by Somalia) but has done so in only a relatively 
few countries, mostly in Africa.
At the individual level, the probability of inclusion is 
 shaped by country- level  factors as well as powerfully 
affected by a range of personal attributes, such as 
income, education level, workforce status, and gender, 
as well as having access to other components of JAM. 
The latter does not prove a causal relationship, but it 
does indicate the degree to which the JAM components 
tend to come together. Gender gaps in financial and 
mobile inclusion are severe in certain countries, such 
as Pakistan, but modest in  others. Overall,  these gaps  These are not causal relationships, but they indicate 
how strongly the ele ments of the JAM trinity tend to go 
together, even allowing for other personal attributes.
To estimate the impact of transfers, the target popula-
tion  will generally be  people with a low probability of 
financial inclusion, or perhaps in the mid- range. The 
logistic regressions show that receiving a financial 
transfer is strongly associated with financial inclusion. 
For a (hy po thet i cal) person with other attributes at the 
midpoint between favorable and unfavorable, receiv-
ing a transfer boosts the probability of financial inclu-
sion by some 31  percentage points. Moreover, the 
results confirm the importance of the channel for pro-
viding transfers. For  those reporting receiving them 
only in cash,  there is no positive impact of the transfer 
on financial inclusion.
Further insight into this question is provided by 
information on the use of financial accounts ( Table 2.4). 
For the 99- country sample, over half of  those who 
had received a government transfer reported using a 
financial account to do so. In low- income countries, 
43.9   percent of  people who had received a government 
transfer reported that the first account they had opened 
was to receive this transfer. This group represents 
3.0   percent of the LIC population.19 In lower middle-  
income countries, the effect is stronger, prob ably 
19. Of low- income- country  people who received a government transfer, 
51.7   percent said that their account was their first account. Of  those, 
85.0   percent said they had opened it to receive government transfers. Com-
bining  these ratios yields 43.9   percent. The estimate of 3.0   percent comes 
from combining this with the 6.7   percent of the low- income- country popu-
lation who received a government transfer.­ Table­2 .4 . ­Conditional­use­of­financial­accounts

+1—country- level mea sures of access to components of 
JAM can change relatively quickly. For ID we have 
examples such as India’s Aadhaar and Malawi’s ID, 
which was rolled out in 2017 (Malik, forthcoming 
2020). Many countries have seen astonishing growth 
in mobile coverage— India and  Kenya offer examples— 
and also of rapid increases in financial inclusion  towards 
some 80   percent of the adult population through dif-
fer ent routes. At the individual level, inclusion in JAM 
is likely to become more difficult as the challenge 
focuses on more disadvantaged groups— those with 
multiple economic and social attributes associated with 
exclusion. Both supply- side and demand- side policies 
to extend JAM to all are considered in Chapter 3.are of similar magnitudes and strongly associated. 
While differences in several “endowments” are associ-
ated with the gender gap in financial inclusion, for 
low- income countries access to a mobile appears to be 
the most impor tant correlate of the financial gender 
gap followed by access to ID. Fi nally, the results con-
firm that government transfers can play an impor tant 
role in increasing access to finance, provided they are 
not disbursed in cash. This highlights the link between 
“supply- side”  factors shaping access to JAM and the 
“demand- side”  factors relating to the use of JAM in the 
delivery of a range of government programs.
The next step is to consider implications for policies 
to ensure universal access. It is already clear that

—+1 drivers. As with any commodity or ser vice, the observed 
levels of use of an ID system, a mobile network, or 
financial ser vices  will reflect the interaction of demand 
and supply  factors.  People  will not want to register for 
an ID if policies and arrangements for enrollment 
make this costly or difficult;  there  will also be  little 
demand for the ID if it is seen as providing  little value. 
Banks  will have less incentive to roll out financial 
accounts to the poor if the regulatory cost of onboard-
ing customers is high due to demanding customer 
identification requirements in the face of an inade-
quate ID system. Mobile operators  will have an addi-
tional incentive to build out their cell- tower networks 
if they can also offer financial ser vices in addition to 
voice and data. Over time, JAM coverage is driven for-
ward by changes in demand- side and supply- side 
effects, and  these  will reflect both policies and evolving 
technology.
ID- mobile and ID- finance
According to the GSMA, at least 147 governments across 
the world require prospective mobile users to show 
proof of identity before a mobile network operator can 
activate a prepaid mobile SIM (GSMA, 2019b). Consid-
ering the high penetration of mobiles, it is not surpris-
ing that surveys confirm SIM registration as the major 
demand driver for the acquisition of an ID, followed by 
KYC requirements for financial accounts. Conversely, 
mobiles can facilitate enrollment into identification 
systems. One example is digital birth registration in 
Pakistan through a partnership that includes Telenor 
and UNICEF. Using franchising network points as regis-
trars, some 700,000  children have been registered. As shown in Chapter 2, gaps in the coverage of ID sys-
tems, access to mobile phones, and financial inclusion 
relate to both country- level  factors and a layered set of 
personal attributes— poverty, low levels of education, 
being out of the workforce, and being female.  There 
are synergies between the JAM components in the 
sense that having some of them increases the probabil-
ity of having  others. In addition to supply- side mea-
sures to increase access to IDs, mobiles, and financial 
accounts, demand- side effects can also be impor tant, 
including the use of bank and mobile accounts to 
receive government transfers and, more generally, the 
use of components of JAM in a range of government 
programs.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider all poli-
cies concerning each of the three JAM areas. The focus 
is, rather, on broad policy directions. ID, mobile, and 
finance are multipurpose societal and economic plat-
forms, providing capacity to identify, to communicate, 
and to transfer resources. Together, they offer econo-
mies of scope and scale from sharing essential infra-
structure. Pro gress in one can reduce the ser vice costs 
of the  others and can help to extend their coverage. 
This argues for a strategic and coordinated approach, 
with mechanisms to improve coordination across a 
range of regulators and agencies, as well as govern-
ment programs and ser vices.
Synergies across the three 
components
Synergies between the three JAM components, set out 
in Figure 3.1, involve both supply- side and demand-  side Chapter 3.

+1—At the same time, efficient and accessible ID ser vices 
lower the cost of business for financial institutions and 
mobile network operators. Surveys conducted for the 
2017 Global Financial Inclusion and Consumer Protec-
tion Survey Report find that, in addition to generally 
requiring a national ID or another ID document to 
open a bank account, 75   percent of reporting coun-
tries require proof of address, 69   percent proof of 
nationality, 44   percent proof of income, and 35   percent 
proof of employment (Demirgüç- Kunt et  al., 2017). 
Although about half of the countries indicated that 
they had instituted risk- based KYC in the form of sim-
plified requirements for restricted accounts intended 
for poor customers, this suggests that the prob lem 
posed by KYC requirements is greater than simply 
access to a national ID.20
20. The Financial Action Task Force (2017) finds that national regulators have 
been cautious in applying simplified risk- based KYC and that financial insti-
tutions may be more conservative than their national regulators. This may 
reflect caution or the use of documentation requirements as a screening Similar programs have been launched in Tanzania, tak -
ing advantage of the mobile agent network.
Mobile also provides power ful ways to amplify the 
authentication ecosystem and propagate it across the 
country. The Aadhaar system relies on mobile for remote 
authentication. Smartphones can provide an alterna-
tive to a card and deliver power ful three- factor authen-
tication using a combination of PINs and biometrics. 
With mass production, iris cameras can be built into 
smartphones at a unit cost of only $4 (Gelb and Diofasi 
Metz, 2018), while recent advances in the accuracy of 
face recognition open up a natu ral role for built-in cam-
eras, but even a  simple feature phone linked to an ID 
number can offer authentication through an OTP. As in 
the India Stack model, mobile communications can 
expand the range of ID- based applications in other 
areas, including digital signatures and digital lockers as 
well as digital payments.  These can be power ful ser vice

—+1Mobile- finance
As discussed in Chapter  2, mobile and finance also 
have strong potential synergies, in par tic u lar the abil-
ity of digital financial ser vices to extend low- cost access 
to poorer customers (Perlman and Wechsler, 2019). 
Key to the spread of mobile money has been regula-
tory permission for nonbanks to offer payment ser-
vices,  under supervision and with counter parts to 
balances held in trust accounts with one or more com-
mercial bank. The model can differ between countries, 
with MNOs in the lead in East Africa, a bank subsidiary 
(bKash) in Bangladesh, and a consortium approach in 
Peru (BIM). The impor tant common  factor appears to 
be to open up this space to nonbanks to make it con-
testable, and to harmonize the customer due- diligence 
requirements with  those needed for SIM registration.
In the absence of  these steps, efforts to encourage the 
use of mobile operators to include new customers 
appear to run into difficulties. MNOs have  little power 
or security to motivate investments. Banks may offer 
mobile payment ser vices to their clients but see  little 
advantage to themselves in making the large and sus-
tained investments required to roll out mobile money 
to poor customers, together with an associated agent 
network. Suarez (2016) offers a po liti cal economy 
analy sis of the difference between  Kenya, where MNOs 
 were permitted to launch mobile money ser vices 
despite opposition from the banks, and Mexico, where 
close relationships between banks and regulators pre-
vented them from  doing so. Mattern and McKay (2018) 
chronicle the case of Ghana, where mobile money 
stalled  until MNOs  were accorded this power in the 
face of determined efforts by banks to prevent it.21
The build-out of the agent network, together with its 
associated liquidity- management structures, is an essen -
tial step extending even beyond the early stages of dig-
ital money, to reduce distance to cash- in–cash- out 
21. In addition to the East African model of MNO- led mobile money, this can 
be rolled out by bank subsidiaries such as bKash in Bangladesh (BRAC bank) 
or, as in the case of BIM in Peru, by a consortium of companies including 
banks.Especially in countries with high levels of informality, 
potential clients often cannot provide such documen-
tation. Ferreira, van der Linden, and Cooper (2018) 
analyze survey data for Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. 
Considering ID only, this was held by 47 , 74, and 
69  percent of respondents in the respective countries, 
but when including both ID and proof of address, the 
numbers fell to only 39, 11, and 12   percent. As explained 
by Ferreira et al., the requirement for proof of address 
is due to cut- and- paste adoption of US requirements 
that date from a period when other forms of identifi-
cation  were lacking; it does not reflect the recommen-
dations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 
which has become increasingly concerned about bar-
riers to financial inclusion and the slow adoption of 
risk- based or tiered KYC (FATF, 2017; Pisa and Wood-
some, 2019). Ferreira et  al. also note that countries 
have been slow to take advantage of improvements in 
the rigor and coverage of their ID systems to reduce 
other documentary requirements that offer far less 
robust identification than a modern ID system. Fully 
digital ID can make onboarding bank and MNO clients 
still cheaper and faster through e- KYC; in India this 
has reportedly cut costs associated with financial KYC 
from $15 to $0.50.
A strong ID system also makes it easier for banks or 
MNOs to authenticate clients for transactions. Weak 
country- level ID systems have sometimes forced banks 
to develop their own solutions, such as Nigeria’s Bank 
Verification Number (BVN); this raises the cost of  doing 
business for the banks and discourages the onboard-
ing of small customers. In countries like Peru and Paki-
stan, the financial sector accounts for a major part of 
the verification ser vice requests addressed to the ID 
agency. As  these countries show, fees for verification 
ser vices can create income for the ID agency, but expe-
rience shows that if the charges are set too high, they 
can drive banks back  towards the (inefficient) solution 
of creating their own systems.
mechanism to weed out potential customers who offer  little potential busi-
ness and profit.

+1—such as rent and utilities, can represent as much as 
70  percent of their total costs. The more lines of busi-
ness an agent can combine, the greater are the possi-
bilities to spread  these costs across multiple businesses. 
On average, digital financial ser vices represented only 
around 47   percent of the ser vices offered by the aver-
age agent covered in the survey. The synergies are even 
greater when some of the shared businesses generate 
cash to augment the float needed to ser vice CICO 
requests. Especially in rural areas, travel time and 
cost to replenish the float can absorb valuable agent 
resources. The implication for regulators is to open up 
access to providing mobile money and payments ser-
vices while insisting on the role of the banking system 
in ensuring financial soundness, and to do every thing 
pos si ble to encourage the sharing of infrastructure 
and agent networks.22
In addition to facilitating transactions, mobile com-
munications transmit valuable information— for exam -
ple, notification that a subsidy or pension payment has 
been made into an account and is available for pickup. 
The cumulative information from payments data can 
build customer information profiles to increase 
access to further financial ser vices. DigiFarm— launched 
in  Kenya by Safaricom, Mezzanine, and two other 
partners— has enrolled almost a million of  Kenya’s 7 mil -
lion small farmers. With  little available data on their 
businesses, they have suffered from inadequate exten-
sion and access to financial ser vices. But virtually all 
have mobiles that can be used to cut the costs of acquir-
ing information on their activities. Farmers register, 
provide basic details, and gain access to input e-  vouchers 
and customized technical and farm management 
advice. With the building of receipt and payment rec-
ords over time, some have become eligible for small 
loans to augment their businesses.23
Connectivity weaknesses have been flagged in many 
countries as limiting the efficiency and ac cep tance of

ing the prob lem of managing agent liquidity, including the “Uberization” of 
agents.
23. https:// www  . mezzanineware . com / digifarm.(CICO) points. For  Kenya, Suri and Jack (2016) observe 
that before M- PESA was launched, the average dis-
tance to the nearest bank was 9.2 kilo meters, but in 
2015, eight years  later, the average distance to the near-
est M- PESA agent was a mere 1.4 kilo meters. Tanzania, 
Uganda, and some other countries in Africa have seen 
similar build-outs of their mobile agent networks with 
the spread of mobile money. Such an agent network 
 will be needed for a long time— Hernandez (2019) sum-
marizes several studies that demonstrate that the 
importance of CICO continues, and even increases, 
 until financial markets reach their mature stages.
Mobile wallets and disruptive innovations in digital 
payments have erased much of the transactional dif-
ference between bank accounts and mobile money, 
other than the agent network. Working with accounts 
of any type, applications can increase the con ve nience 
of transacting between private parties, reduce fric-
tions for G2P and P2G payments, and also increase 
user confidence. VOCALINK offers an example, com-
bining real- time electronic payments between finan-
cial accounts and payment addresses such as mobile 
numbers or email addresses as alternatives to national 
ID or other numbers used to register the accounts. 
This helps to bolster confidence in the system  because 
users can transact without divulging sensitive personal 
information. Rolled out as PromptPay in Thailand, the 
system now has 40 million users registered— more than 
half the population— and hundreds of millions of 
transactions. The system is being replicated in Peru 
and potentially other countries.
In turn, providing digital financial ser vices creates 
economies of scope for mobile infrastructure and 
agent networks. In a study of six rural coverage pi lots 
in Tanzania (GSMA, 2018), half of the revenue flow 
from cell towers came from voice and data ser vices 
and half from mobile money ser vices. Similarly, the 
opportunity to offer a bundle of ser vices, including 
CICO, mobile facilitation, and possibly other busi-
nesses such as retailing, provides economies of scope 
for agents. As shown in the agent surveys of Unnikrish-
nan, Larson, Pinpradab, and Brown (2019), fixed costs,

—+1mandated by the Bank of Ghana, but only in 2018, not 
too early in the rollout pro  cess. In  Kenya, on the other 
hand, one innovative provider continues to dominate 
digital payments and controls the vast majority of 
mobile money agents, despite efforts to push for 
interoperability (Ndung’u, 2019). By comparison, in 
Bangladesh, a country where an early player captured 
a large market share, one response has been to pro-
mote mobile money ser vice backed by a consortium of 
publicly owned banks. The systems, however, are not 
yet interoperable but may move  towards being so in 
the  future.
Increasing mobile and financial adoption is more than 
a financial and engineering challenge; it involves miti-
gating the impacts of social structures and systems that 
may exclude potential users.  Women and the poor 
tend to face the most challenges in accessing mobile 
technology, although  there is a growing body of lit er a-
ture suggesting several interventions that can over-
come  these exclusions (Buvinić and Furst- Nichols, 
2016; Buvinić, Furst- Nichols, and Pryor, 2013; Buvinić 
and O’Donnell, 2016, 2019). Some of the easiest solu-
tions simply involve recognizing  women and the poor 
as potential customers— too often firms in the greater 
JAM space are concerned only with providing ser vices 
to the “traditional” customers, and fail to carry out the 
basic market research necessary for identifying the 
needs and preferences of new customer segments 
(Mattern and Tarazi, 2015). The barriers to accessing 
mobile phones and  those that impede mobile- enabled 
payments are intertwined, and many of the policy 
solutions for one have positive spillovers for the other.
Agents are usually the customer’s bridge between 
cash and noncash (mobile) money, and incentive 
structures and policies can help change inclusion 
dynamics, making the role more flexible or even allow-
ing any mobile money customer to perform cash- in–
cash-  out ser  vices for any other customer as a kind of 
Uberization of banking agents (Kiarie et  al., 2018). 
Bastian et  al. (2018) demonstrated in Indonesia that 
banking agents can be incentivized to recruit  women 
for their platforms, and  women who also received a digital payments. Studies note the prob lem of “dropped 
transactions” and that time- out effects can be more 
serious for 2G transactions using feature phones and 
USSD interfaces that require interchange across pro-
viders. Cook and Raman (2019) provide an example for 
India, against the backdrop of the phenomenally suc-
cessful introduction of the Universal Payments Inter-
face (UPI), launched in 2016 by the National Payments 
Corporation of India. The prob lem partly reflected 
anticompetitive be hav ior by individual ser vice provid-
ers who failed to streamline user interfaces to facilitate 
easy USSD cross- provider transactions. On this view, 
the thrust of the UPI has been more  towards facilitat-
ing the higher- end levels of financial transactions than 
working effectively at the lower end.
This example, as well as the case of Tanzania, which has 
succeeded in creating a fully interoperable system—in 
a 2017 survey some 60   percent of users had made cross- 
provider payments (Cook, 2018)— points to the impor-
tance of encouraging payment ser vice providers to 
reach mutually beneficial revenue- sharing agree-
ments as well as simply focusing on providing a pay-
ments switch. MNOs, or  others planning to roll out a 
digital payments ser vice, can expect to make heavy 
investments before the business reaches sufficient 
scale to be profitable. Even modest profits should not 
be expected in less than four to five years (Almazán 
and Vonthron, 2014). In the long run all can benefit 
from an expanded user base, but the fact that much 
revenue derives from cash- out fees, commonly set at 
around 2   percent of value (Amin, 2014), creates a disin-
centive to transfer funds between providers.
The timing of a push  towards interoperability is there-
fore a delicate  matter; in the long run it is essential for 
quality ser vice, but if it comes too early it could under-
mine incentives to invest. Active engagement by the 
Bank of Tanzania— after the mobile money system had 
begun to take off— was instrumental in encouraging 
mutually agreeable terms (Mattern and McKay, 2018; 
Ndulu and Qhotsokoane, 2018). In this case interoper-
ability is secured through bilateral agreements rather 
than one single switch. In Ghana, interoperability was

tial infrastructure. Chapter 2 noted the role of govern-
ment transfers in encouraging financial inclusion, 
but many programs are still not realizing their full 
potential.
Combining wages, transfers, and other payments to 
individuals, government payments typically represent 
around 12   percent of GDP in a developing country. The 
average government may operate as many as 21 dis-
tinct transfer programs, each with its own arrange-
ments for making payments. In an ongoing World 
Bank survey of 71 social protection programs in 35 
countries, 36   percent used cash or analog instru-
ments such as checks or money  orders to disburse 
payments, while 64   percent used digital channels, 
 either smartcards or direct deposits into accounts. 
However, many of the latter cases used limited- purpose 
payment instruments— for example, cards or dedi-
cated cash- out accounts (as for beneficiaries of Paki-
stan’s BISP program)— that did not offer payments, 
savings, and other financial ser vices. Overall, fewer 
than half of the programs provided funding through 
general- purpose channels that facilitated access to business training intervention reported increases in 
 house hold decision- making power. The financial sec-
tor also opens up a role for  women as financial agents, 
a role that some interpret as also having an ele ment of 
social work (Aadil et al., 2019). In a sector dominated by 
men,  women agents can play a special role in encour-
aging other  women to become familiar with mobile 
transactions.

—+1care, and a range of other ser vices to remote commu-
nities in Peru’s Amazon region.25 But the wide, and 
advancing, spread of mobile communications argues 
that it should be pos si ble to reach an ever- increasing 
share of beneficiaries through direct deposit and simi-
lar mechanisms.
Two prob lems need to be addressed in order to shift 
from limited- purpose payment channels to general- 
purpose channels that blend transfers with funds from 
other sources. First, how to pay for the last- mile costs 
of delivery? Incentives are critical— financial institu-
tions  will have no incentive to deliver last- mile bene-
fits  unless they are adequately compensated; the case 
of pensions in Andhra Pradesh, discussed in Chapter 5, 
offers an example where commissions  were too low to 
motivate delivery. It may be less complicated to build 
payment arrangements into specific channels; for 
example, the government may absorb all cash- out fees 
related to the provision of social grants through a 
selected provider, as in the case of primary education 
stipends in Bangladesh (Chapter  5), whereas cashing 
out their transfers through any other provider of the 
beneficiary’s choice would normally incur a fee. Deliv-
ery fees might have to be tiered— higher for more 
remote areas—as in  Kenya’s Orphans and Vulnerable 
 Children Cash Transfer Program,26 which operates a 
three- tier system. One approach, consistent with allow -
ing beneficiaries a flexible option to cash out their pay-
ment at any ser vice provider, could be to build an 
allowance for the cash- out fee into the amount of the 
benefit. Another option could be to negotiate one  free 
withdrawal per month into the payment fee structure, 
but this encourages cashing out the benefit, which obvi-
ates the purpose of shifting  towards general- purpose 
mechanisms.
A second challenge can be how to  handle beneficiary 
authentication in the likely event that programs 
require a higher level of confidence than is needed for

encouraged competition by offering beneficiaries a 
choice of payment ser vice providers. This could be for 
several reasons, including reluctance to change arrange-
ments made at a time when  there  were few alternative 
payments providers. In some cases, banks have not 
found commissions high enough to interest them; also, 
they may not want to introduce the beneficiary authen-
tication requirements demanded by the programs.
Even if many beneficiaries are initially slow to move 
away from cashing out their benefits as soon as they 
receive them,  there is clearly room for more strategic 
use of G2P payment systems to encourage greater 
financial inclusion, both on the demand side and with 
delivery commissions supporting the further rollout 
of financial and digital infrastructure. India’s Direct 
Benefit Transfer (DBT) program offers one example, 
with all payments routed through bank accounts 
linked to unique Aadhaar ID numbers. This has pro-
vided the impetus to open over 340 million accounts 
through the government of India’s universal financial 
inclusion, or Jan Dhan, initiative. Another approach, 
as in Mexico, is to route G2P payments through a pay-
ments aggregator, such as a single trea sury account, 
able to transfer funds directly to individual accounts 
held in any authorized PSP.
One question then is how to deal with the costs 
involved in making “last- mile” payments, especially to 
more remote communities.  Under the physical cash 
payment option, much of the delivery costs are borne 
by the payments- providing agency in assembling, pro-
tecting, transporting, and disbursing cash, although 
the time and transport costs to beneficiaries of having 
to travel to a cash point at a par tic u lar time can also be 
considerable. In extreme situations,  there  will prob-
ably be  little alternative to the use of dedicated mecha-
nisms, for example, military facilities in some mountain 
communities of Bolivia (Laserna, 2018) or the naval 
vessel that provides banking, civil registration, health 
24. Of the 51   percent that did not, 31   percent  were due to the use of cash or 
analog payments and 20   percent to the use of digital payments that are 
standalone cash- out.

+1—Another example is the conversion of tourism pay-
ments in Tanzania from cash to cards (Pillai, 2016). Two 
years  after  going cashless, the Ngorongoro Conserva-
tion Area Authority reported a 40   percent jump in rev-
enue from the same volume of tourists. Other parks 
moved  towards cashless payments, and in Decem-
ber 2015 cash was banned for all tourism- related pay-
ments in the national parks. While this has reduced 
some serious prob lems, including diversion and the 
theft of cash from tour operators and  drivers, it has 
also faced challenges  because of network connectivity 
failures, including long time lags in connectivity that 
prevent payments from being completed. All such ini-
tiatives expand the uses of finance and payments and 
boost demand for their ser vices, as well as increasing 
the accuracy and accountability of payments to gov-
ernment agencies by avoiding cash payments at the 
point of ser vice.
 Here, too, a strategic approach can be helpful. As for 
G2P programs, in the early stages, individual ser vices 
and facilities tend to develop their own customized 
approaches  towards accepting noncash P2G payments. 
This became a prob lem, for example, in Tanzania, 
partly  because of the lack of coordination across the 
government, but also  because of the need to encour-
age the ac cep tance side of digital payments more 
widely across the economy. As an exceptionally large 
entity, government can play a key role in developing 
the wider ac cep tance of digital payments by transi-
tioning  towards a common, inclusive system for 
accepting digital payments. One example is Tanzania’s 
Government e- Payment Gateway, which enables cus-
tomers to pay for virtually all public ser vices via cards, 
internet banking, and mobile money from any provid-
er.27 The need to increase ac cep tance by merchants 
and other ser vice providers in India was highlighted by 
the report of the High- Level Committee on Deepening 
27 . Government officials have noted that in addition to easing the pro  cess of 
acquiring bills and making payments, the e- Payments Gateway has resulted 
in benefits such as proper recordkeeping, timely reporting, reducing leak -
ages and fraud, as well as increasing revenues to the government entities 
(Tigo Tanzania, 2018). See https:// www  . tigo . co . tz / news / tigo - customers - can 
- now - make - payments - using - the - government - electronic - payment - gateway

life, for example, would need to be separated from 
authentication for cash- out; the alternative, to require 
it for  every cash- out or payment transaction, would be 
unworkable for a general- purpose account that blends 
social transfers and other funds. Social payments in 
 Kenya, for example, have been managed through a con-
sortium of banks using biometric smartcards rather 
than simply routed through the M- PESA accounts that 
many beneficiaries already have. More recently, proof 
of life has been separated from payments, enabling 
more flexible arrangements for the latter while still 
requiring beneficiaries to authenticate periodically 
with the banks. In some extreme cases it may be risky 
to separate out authentication of low- agency benefi-
ciaries from their receipt of payments if this enables 
 others to appropriate their benefits. Biometric authen-
tication for BISP payments in Pakistan, discussed in 
Chapter 5, offers an example.
P2G payments, JAM, and the  
ac cep tance ecosystem
The other side of the government– JAM linkage is the 
value of a strong payments ecosystem to facilitate a 
range of ser vices by removing frictions and leakage 
from P2G payments, and from P2Provider payments 
more generally. East Africa has made pro gress in this 
area; Pillai (2016) and Ndung’u (2019) offer examples 
of ser vices that have been facilitated by cashless pay-
ments in Tanzania and  Kenya. They include the provi-
sion of cashless  water vending machines; M-  Tiba, a 
mobile phone– based health wallet that enables users 
to save and to pay accredited health ser vice providers; 
and M- KOPA pay- as- you-go residential solar systems. 
As of June  2017 , M-  Tiba was reported to have regis-
tered nearly 900,000 users with access to 450 health 
facilities, and to have pro  cessed payments for 100,000 
visits totaling $1.4 million. In 2019 M- KOPA reported 
cumulative sales of over 750,000 off- grid solar sys-
tems serving 3 million individuals; customers  were 
estimated to save about $650 over five years (M- KOPA, 
2019).

Gateway fa cil i ty.
Boosting the wider ac cep tance ecosystem has emerged 
as a common “second stage” challenge in many coun-
tries where  either P2P remittances or G2P payments 
have driven financial inclusion.  Kenya appears to have 
had more success than most in this area, perhaps 
 because the dominance of M- PESA has made ac cep-
tance simpler, at the cost of market competition. Gov-
ernments can also use fiscal mea sures to encourage 
wider ac cep tance of digital payments. Uruguay, for 
example, offered a temporary reduction in value-  
added taxes on digital payments, and this appears to 
have stimulated takeup by merchants (Better Than 
Cash Alliance, 2016). With high levels of tax evasion 
in  the cash economy, such a mea sure may not incur 
a  revenue cost and can be a good investment in 
strengthening the tax base for the  future. Other ave-
nues can be to subsidize the initial acquisition of POS 
terminals, reducing a setup cost that can be high for 
small businesses.
Leveraging high- speed mobile 
infrastructure to foster inclusion
While mobile phone owner ship is relatively high in 
most countries, mea sures of higher- level connectivity 
and access to the internet show a more differentiated 
picture. Among the indexes in this area,29 the GSMA 
Connectivity Index (2019a) covers 3G and higher net-
works and ser vices and includes a number of indica-
tors, including network speed, reliability, and content, 
as well as affordability. The overall index shows a very 
strong, almost linear cross- country relationship with 
log GDP per head, with rudimentary values in the 
poorest countries. Over time, the index also captures 
the marked increases in network power and capacity 
that have taken place in many countries.

29. For discussion and comparisons, see Esselaar, Gillwald, and Stork (2017).Nevertheless,  there are economic limits to the expan-
sion of high- speed connectivity. Perlman and Wechsler 
(2019) point out that, barring a breakthrough in tech-
nology such as satellite internet or transmissions from 
balloons,30 the economics of rolling out high- speed 
internet access  will slow its spread, especially to poor 
and sparsely populated regions.  These  will not gener-
ate the density of business needed to warrant the 
substantial cost of rolling out high- speed network 
infrastructure. This is not to say that lower- income 
countries cannot make rapid pro gress. With major 
gains in coverage and falling broadband prices, India, 
in par tic u lar, has made remarkable gains on the GSMA 
Mobile Connectivity Index, advancing by 15 points 
between 2014 and 2017 .31 However, India has far higher 
population and economic densities than many other 
developing countries; it  will therefore be more eco-
nomical to extend high- speed ser vices across a greater 
part of its territory.32
The market forces generated by higher- income con-
sumer and commercial demand are driving countries 
 towards ever- higher capacity networks— a trend that is 
evident from the GSMA Mobile Connectivity Index 
components, which show a larger gain in speed than in 
coverage between 2014 and 2017 . This offers a huge 
opportunity for governments, even if high- speed 
internet ser vice does not rapidly diffuse to serve poor 
 people.33 While 3G and higher communications can 
support a richer menu of ser vices, including better 
customer interfaces for financial transactions, feature

31. Well- performing countries at comparable levels to India, such as  Kenya 
and Tanzania, advanced about 8–10 points in the same period. Countries that 
 were already high in the 2014 index, like Canada or Australia, typically 
advanced by around 3 or 4 points. Countries at the very lowest level of the 
index in 2014— the bottom decile— also advanced more slowly. This suggests a 
pro cess of convergence in many advancing countries, except at the bottom 
end, where some are being left  behind.
32. To take an example, the economic density of India in 2017 , mea sured as 
US dollar GDP per square mile, was 14 times the economic density of Tanza-
nia. The combination of size and density provides a far larger potential mar-
ket base to roll out high- speed connectivity.
33. Advances in technology and competition are pushing down the cost of 
smartphones to $15, a level that is widely affordable in even the poorest 
countries (see https:// qz . com / africa / 1629078 / africa - will - stay - loyal - to - chinas

be a staple for some time to come.

1 Access to ID and 
building trust• Robust ID for all with strong authentication ecosystem.
•  Free, easy enrollment with minimum pos si ble data requirements.
• Coordination with civil registration to facilitate updating.
• Clear accountability for data protection, managing grievances, and  handling technology failure.
2 Access to 
finance and 
mobile•  Simplify KYC documentation around ID and move to risk- based KYC and e- KYC to cut onboarding costs.
•  Level the playing field: uniform requirements for SIM registration and basic mobile money or  
bank accounts.
3 Access to mobile • Encourage universal access to at least 2G.
• Cross- subsidize coverage through proceeds and conditions of spectrum auctions.
• Consider subsidies or tax breaks on feature phones; avoid excessive taxation.
• Provide for number portability.
4 Access to 
finance and 
trust•  Allow nonbanks (notably MNOs, but also other businesses) to offer payment ser vices as a low- cost  
way to extend financial access to poor customers.
•  KYC, along the lines of SIM registration subject to trust account arrangements and prudential oversight.
5 Access to mobile 
and finance• Encourage shared infrastructure— cell towers, perhaps through tower companies— and agents.
• Promote nonexclusivity to share fixed costs and facilitate expansion.
6 Value and 
con ve nience of 
finance• At an appropriate stage of market development, encourage payments interoperability.
•  Support technology switch (like UPI) and encourage mutually beneficial interchange agreements 
between providers.
• Encourage innovations such as tokenized addresses to increase con ve nience and trust.
7 Accountability 
and access to 
finance•  G2P payments through common platform able to pay to any general- purpose financial or  
mobile account.
•  Minimize cash and special- purpose channels, while recognizing that  these may be essential in  
some areas.
•  Develop a common approach to paying for last- mile delivery through general- purpose instruments, and 
for separating out identity verification from payments.
8 Value, ac  cep-

—+1agency. To this should be added the range of govern-
ment departments responsible for ser vices and pro-
grams that use JAM,  whether for identification or 
payments, both government- to- person and person- 
to- government. This formidable list points to the 
strengthening of regulatory capacity and coordination 
that  will be needed as socie ties and economies transi-
tion  towards greater use of digital mechanisms. Both 
are flagged as essential by Ndung’u (2019) in the case of 
 Kenya’s digital transformation.
Fi nally, the use of each component of JAM to imple-
ment government programs  will generate vast quanti-
ties of data, including identities, locations, and 
transaction rec ords. This can be helpful in monitoring 
the quality of ser vice delivery (Chapter 6), but it raises 
the urgency of putting in place laws for data protection 
and arrangements to manage and safeguard public 
data. Many countries have already experienced huge 
and embarrassing breaches,34 and the situation  will 
only become more urgent as countries transition 
 towards digital states.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to address all policy 
issues related to access to JAM, but it  will be useful to 
summarize some broad policy directions for accelerat-
ing pro gress  towards the first cluster of SDGs in Box 1.1, 
to provide all with ID, mobile access, and a financial 
account ( Table 3.1). Some relate to individual JAM com-
ponents, some to combinations,  others to government 
programs that engage JAM and create demand for its 
ser vices. Some are directly concerned with expand-
ing access;  others are mainly concerned with improv-
ing functionality, value, and trust.  These are, of course, 
related— adding value and trust encourages take-
up— but it is helpful to be clear on the prime focus. 
Country- level priorities  will, of course, depend on 
local conditions. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 focus on the use 
of JAM to improve government capacity to implement a 
range of programs.

ing making payments, verifying balances, managing 
savings, and CICO ser vices (Perlman and Wechsler, 
2019). Increasing demand for high- speed ser vice 
translates into increasing rents from auctions of high- 
speed spectrum. Fiscal policies to support basic com-
munications can include cross- subsidizing basic 
ser vice by using a portion of  these rents to support at 
least basic connectivity in poor, sparse regions.
Rents from spectrum auctions and modest taxes on 
high- speed communications could also be used to 
underwrite programs to actively empower disadvan-
taged groups, subsidizing mobiles, including in the 
context of social protection and other transfers, and 
encouraging mobile and financial literacy for  those 
needing assistance to navigate the system. As discussed 
in Chapter 5, in some countries restricted agency and 
capacity have emerged as a constraint for disadvan-
taged groups, often including  women.
Broad policy directions
The synergies in the system, as well as between JAM 
and a wide range of government programs, argue for 
taking a strategic approach to the area. The aim should 
be to avoid silos where  there is  little consideration of 
the impact of decisions in any one area on the demand 
and supply conditions that shape access, functionality, 
and use in other areas. Perlman and Wechsler (2019) 
list at least 13 commonly found regulators, agencies, 
and authorities with remits relating to JAM.  These 
include the telecommunications regulator; the cen-
tral bank (oversight of financial regulation, interoper-
ability,  etc.); the consumer protection agency; the 
Department of Home Affairs (civil registration and ID); 
the competition regulator; bodies overseeing financial 
intelligence, credit, insurance, and privacy/data pro-
tection; the environmental agency (rights of way for 
mobile infrastructure); the Ministry of Finance (VAT, 
taxes on licenses, mobile spectrum auctions, duties on 
imported equipment); and possibly a universal ser vice

tion, environmental degradation, and the depletion 
of valuable aquifers.
While the princi ples of efficient pricing apply to many 
commodities, we focus on fuel and fertilizer subsidies. 
As the world grapples with the  causes and conse-
quences of climate change,  there is an urgent priority 
to restructure the pricing of  these commodities to 
minimize distortions, incorporate environmental 
externalities (through green taxes, for example), and 
improve equity through better targeting and delivery 
of benefits to the poor.
In this chapter, we consider an approach that uses 
digital ID, payments, and mobile technology to shift 
from a generalized price subsidy regime to personal-
ized transfers. This increases the flexibility to reduce 
price distortions while at the same time efficiently 
costing externalities and enhancing equity by target-
ing subsidies to  those most in need. We argue that 
many governments can enhance their capacity to 
undertake  these reforms if they utilize synergies 
between the three digital pillars in a strategic way to 
expand their policy possibility frontier. However, as 
we also show, having capacity does not always trans-
late into  actual reform. The transition from price subsi-
dies to efficient pricing with equity can be contentious. 
It confronts entrenched interests and requires both 
po liti cal  will and sustained administrative effort to 
succeed.Efficient pricing and the SDGs
Efficient pricing arrangements take into account 
impor tant economic and social externalities from the 
consumption of some key commodities, such as fuels, 
fertilizers, and  water. The same princi ples apply in 
other areas—for example, the pricing of forest resources 
to value their benefits in terms of carbon sequestration 
and preserving biodiversity. Moving  towards efficient 
pricing is critical to achieving a number of the SDGs, in 
par tic u lar the sustainability objectives in Goals 12 and 
15 (Box 1.1).  These include a range of targets related to 
combating climate change and adopting sustainable 
production and consumption patterns, including the 
management of  water resources. Achieving  these global 
goals in the long run depends on how well policies can 
be designed and implemented to balance three con-
cerns: sustainability, efficiency, and equity.
Energy and food security policies exemplify the diffi-
cult trade- offs between  these three objectives. Gov-
ernments around the world provide subsidies to 
energy and agriculture to incentivize production and 
protect consumers from external shocks, but they 
distort prices in the pro  cess. Prices are sometimes 
held below market levels, while market prices in turn 
may be below efficient pricing levels. The result is 
heavy overconsumption relative to efficient and sus-
tainable levels— for example, of  water resources 
pumped by farmers using subsidized power. Over the 
years, generalized subsidies have had unintended Chapter 4.

 These are recognized in Target 12c of the Sustainable 
Development Goals:
Rationalize inefficient fossil- fuel subsidies that encourage 
wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in 
accordance with national circumstances, including by 
restructuring taxation and phasing out  those harmful 
subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental 
impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and 
conditions of developing countries and minimizing the 
pos si ble adverse impacts on their development in a man-
ner that protects the poor and the affected communities.
Consistent with SDG12, one pos si ble way to address 
this challenge is to shift from price subsidies  towards 
individualized compensation, with the degree of tar-
geting depending on country conditions. We break 
down the pro  cess into four components, as repre-
sented in Figure  4.1. They are not strictly sequential 
since the reform pro  cess  will involve some focus on all 
ele ments at any given time and a constantly shifting 
emphasis between them.
Following this framework, a strategic approach to lever-
age digital technologies, especially digital ID and pay-
ments infrastructure, can facilitate the transition from 
price subsidies to individualized transfers in four ways.Moving to efficient pricing  
with equity: The role of digital 
technologies
Reforming inefficient and inequitable energy subsi-
dies continues to be an impor tant priority for policy-
makers, as does instituting “green taxes” to reduce 
carbon emissions. In 2015, fossil fuel subsidies, defined 
as fuel consumption times the gap between existing 
and efficient prices (including environmental costs), 
touched $4.7 trillion, nearly 6.3   percent of global GDP 
(Coady, Parry, and Shang, 2019). Underpricing of local air 
pollution constitutes half of this amount, and account-
ing for global warming contributes another quarter of 
the total subsidy. The IMF also estimates that moving 
from market to efficient fossil fuel pricing through the 
introduction of “green taxes,” for example, would have 
lowered global carbon emissions by 28   percent in 2015 
while increasing government revenues by 3.8   percent at 
the same time. If used appropriately, this fiscal space can 
improve equity by increasing access to clean energy 
sources for the poor, as we  shall see below.
Global priorities and realities within countries often 
diverge, making it difficult to agree on a set of policy 
mea sures that would guide the pro  cess of reforms. At 
the country level, energy subsidy reform is complex,

+1—requiring verification of income or asset owner-
ship, removing beneficiaries who do not meet 
the means test. With better data on income and 
consumption, the targeting mechanism can 
exclude beneficiaries whose income is above a 
cutoff point, or who own assets that indicate 
their economic status, such as owner ship of a 
valuable  house or motor vehicle or paying costly 
fees for private schools. This graduated approach 
to targeting is dif fer ent from one where the 
starting point is to cut the number of beneficia -
ries, often in an arbitrary manner. It can help 
mitigate popu lar opposition while at the same 
time consolidating support for the reforms if 
they are perceived to be fair and equitable.
■ Fourth, digital mechanisms generate large vol-
ume of high- frequency data that can be used to 
monitor the implementation of the reform pro-
gram. This can be supplemented by beneficiary 
feedback that would enable governments to flag 
bottlenecks, redesign policies, and address griev -
ances in near real time. A digitally enabled, well- 
functioning feedback and grievance redressal 
system improves credibility and trust in the gov-
ernment, which in turn reduces the po liti cal risk 
of popu lar backlash against the reform.

context of direct transfers
Reducing fossil fuel consumption is at the heart of the 
solution to combat green house gas emissions. As well 
as moving away from subsidies relative to market 
prices, fossil fuel pricing reforms can include the 
implementation of green taxes in order to reduce car-
bon emissions and encourage a shift  towards clean 
and renewable sources of energy. Designing, imple-
menting, and enforcing green taxes has been difficult 
at both country and global levels. The recent (and con-
tinuing) “Yellow Vest” protests in France have rejected 
the notion of carbon taxes as “elitist” and detrimental 
to income security not only of the poor but also of the ■ First, digital communications provide govern-
ments with tools to raise awareness of the need 
to reform subsidies and the consequences of 
inaction. Fuel subsidy reforms invariably trigger 
popu lar unrest since they are accompanied by 
increases in prices that affect every one, particu-
larly the poor. Governments need to control the 
narrative and proactively engage with citizens to 
build co ali tions of support that would minimize 
the downside po liti cal risks of reform. Digital 
communications, including the use of social 
media, can facilitate outreach at scale and miti-
gate the po liti cal risk of the reforms. Digital and 
social media may also be used to mobilize citi-
zens against reforms; they need to be an integral 
part of the government’s strategy to highlight 
the need for action, lay out goals and targets, and 
strengthen accountability.
■ Second, the spread of digital technologies has 
made it pos si ble to transition from general price 
subsidies to more efficient and equitable direct 
transfers. While relatively few countries have 
implemented this at scale in the case of fuel sub-
sidies, many have G2P payments programs such 
as social pensions, maternal and child benefits, 
or student bursaries that are transferred through 
digital means.  These can serve as a backbone for 
direct payments of compensatory subsidies to 
individuals.
■ Third, digital technologies can provide govern-
ments with new opportunities to target benefi-
ciaries in a progressive way. Beneficiary lists 
based on unique digital IDs can eliminate dupli-
cate and false entries and generate fiscal savings 
for the government in the pro  cess. Once lists are 
clean, governments can implement “soft target-
ing” through moral suasion (or “nudges”), encour -
aging recipients to self- select out of the subsidy, 
through the “GiveItUp” program in India, for 
example (see Box 4.1). In the next step, it can 
tighten targeting by requiring self- declarations 
of income and move  towards “hard targeting” by

—+1Moving from taxes to pricing, a tax of $20 per ton adds 
about $0.20 per gallon to gasoline prices (somewhat 
less than 10   percent of recent US retail prices) and 
$1.00 per 1,000 cubic feet for natu ral gas (Hafstead and 
Picciano, 2017).  These increases are modest relative to 
the observed differences in fuel prices across countries 
and variations over time. A carbon tax at the upper 
end of the range would involve a tax of $1.00 per gal-
lon, but even this falls well within the range of histori-
cally observed price variation. Prices for West Texas 
Crude, for example, peaked at $122 per barrel in 1980, 
crashed as low as $18 per barrel in 1998, then skyrock -
eted as high as $160 per barrel in mid-2008, just before 
the global financial crisis.
The percentage increase in fuel prices resulting from 
any given level of green taxes  will vary a  great deal 
across countries and over time, depending on the pre-
vailing price of fuels. Across countries, on Septem-
ber  17 , 2018, petrol prices ranged from a low of $0.01 
per liter in Venezuela to a high of $2.17 in Hong Kong, 
with Norway and Iceland only a  little lower. Natu ral gas 
prices vary a  great deal too, being far lower in North 
Amer i ca, which currently has a surplus of gas, than in 
Asia, which has a deficit.
Proposals to compensate consumers for higher fuel 
prices have outlined a number of possibilities. For the 
United States, for example, Metcalfe (2007) and a num-
ber of other studies have advocated using carbon tax 
revenues to reduce payroll taxes. A tax of $17 per ton in 
the United States is estimated to provide enough 
resources to eliminate the payroll tax on the first 
$3,660 earned by each worker and would enable an 
average 11   percent reduction in payroll taxes, with 
greater percentage reductions for the lowest- paid 
workers. Such an approach could be considered for 
higher- income countries, but in low- income coun-
tries payroll taxes are only levied on employees in for-
mal sector occupations (and in some cases, only on 
public employees), and  these tend not to be among the 
2019, coverage in the provinces  will range from a low of 47   percent in Prince 
Edward Island to a high of 90   percent in New Brunswick (Dobson, Winter, 
and Boyd, 2019). middle class, who are facing stagnating wages in the 
aftermath of the global financial crisis.
 These are common concerns in many countries. In the 
case of the United States, for example, Wheeler (2008) 
considered the  factors  behind state- level support for 
and opposition to high taxes on fossil fuels. He docu-
mented very similar views. The work of Nora Lustig 
and collaborators analyzes a similar concern for the 
impact of indirect taxes on the disposable incomes of 
the poor. Even if the rich consume far more energy per 
head than the poor, the weight of energy- intensive 
sectors in the consumption of the poor is often higher 
than for the rich.  There is no guarantee that the poor 
 will benefit from any generalized expansion in public 
ser vices that might be funded out of higher consump-
tion taxes (Inchauste and Lustig, 2017; Lustig, 2018); 
even if they did, the net result would be to reduce the 
real disposable incomes of very poor  people. Digital 
technologies offer governments the opportunity to 
move  towards efficient pricing with equity through a 
tax- and- transfer mechanism flexible enough to pro-
tect the interests of vulnerable groups.
The 2017 Carbon Pricing Watch Report documents a 
wide range of CO2 tax rates, with a few being very high 
but most at modest levels. Seventy- five  percent of the 
covered emissions  were at prices  under $10 per ton, 
but quite a number exceeded this level by a substantial 
margin. At the same time, the UN Global Compact 
called for a minimum rate of $100 per ton by 2020 to 
be on track for a temperature pathway of not more 
than 1.5–2.0 degrees Celsius of warming. Studies have 
suggested a wide range of tax rates and tax trajectories, 
with initial taxes increasing from around $10 per ton 
to as much as $100 per ton in the case of the modeling 
of the Carbon Tax Center (Handley, 2008). In consid-
ering the distributional impact of green taxes and how 
to compensate for them, it is therefore reasonable to 
think about a potential carbon tax range of $10– $100 per 
ton with a base scenario of around $20.35
35. The impact also depends, of course, on the share of emissions covered by 
a carbon tax regime. This can vary considerably; for the example of Canada, 
following the implementation of the carbon tax federal backstop on April 1,

+1—$12.50 per head.38 This is modest relative to central 
bud getary spending on India’s large and complex sys-
tem of social benefits and subsidies, which amounts to 
around $50 per person.
The level of compensation required to return the pro-
ceeds of green taxes to  people uniformly across all 
income groups is therefore not negligible. However, 
 unless the carbon tax is raised to very high levels, it is 
well within the range of social transfers already seen in 
many lower-  and middle- income countries. For mod-
est carbon tax rates, the levels of compensation may 
not be sufficiently high to warrant introducing a sepa-
rate compensation scheme, so that it might be more 
feasible to graft additional financing onto existing pro-
grams. For high carbon taxes and “oil to cash” reforms 
in producing countries that maintain deep price subsi-
dies, the situation is dif fer ent. The implied levels of 
uniform compensation are large enough to warrant a 
distinct “dividend” program, especially if the intention 
is to aim for uniform compensation rather than to 
build on existing targeted programs (Moss, Lambert, 
and Majerowicz, 2015).
Some country experiences39
Can digital technology, especially ID and payment sys-
tems, be leveraged to improve government’s capacity 
to move from generalized fuel price subsidies to indi-
vidualized compensation?  Will this reduce price dis-
tortion, improve efficiency, and enhance equity? How 
can  these reforms be made sustainable? We consider 
 these questions in the context of the experiences of 
Bolivia, Nigeria, Iran, and India— four countries that 
have attempted to introduce fuel subsidy reforms at 
scale, with varying degrees of success, as we  shall see 
below.

39. This section draws heavi ly on Mittal, Mukherjee, and Gelb (2017) and Gelb 
and Mukherjee (2019).poorer cohorts of society.36 Direct financial transfers 
offer the only feasible way to insulate the poor from 
the impact of green taxes on their disposable income.
How large might such transfers be, and how do they 
compare with the “oil to cash” payments that have 
been advocated for fuel- exporting countries? We can 
take the example of Bolivia, which provides substantial 
fiscal and economic fuel subsidies to its citizens. 
Laserna (2018) estimates that domestic oil and gas 
prices are set at around 50   percent of border price lev-
els and that the average implied subsidy per Bolivian 
 house hold would be around $300.37 Adding a green 
tax of $20 per ton of CO2 to the reference price of fuel 
would increase the compensation by around $17 per 
head, to around $360 for an average  house hold. For an 
energy exporter like Bolivia, the compensation for a 
green tax at this level would therefore not be too large 
relative to the average energy subsidy already received 
by the population.
To offer other (rough) estimates, fossil fuels represent 
around 40   percent of total energy consumption for 
lower- income sub- Saharan Africa. This is equivalent to 
around 70 gallons per head per year; green taxes of 20 
cents per gallon would then amount to a uniform 
charge of $14 per person per year, somewhat less than 
for Bolivia. Applying this charge to Tanzania, it would 
come to around $70 per year for an average  family. 
This is about the same level of compensation as pro-
vided by the basic unconditional tranche of the TASAF 
PSSN program, although total transfers  under this 
program can be considerably higher. A similar calcula-
tion for India suggests an average green tax charge of 
36. Even in high- income countries, replacing income taxes with natu ral 
resource– based tax revenue can have adverse consequences if this unstable 
source of income is relied upon too heavi ly (and carbon taxes are designed to 
reduce consumption of the taxed resource). A dramatic example is found in 
Alaska, where oil revenues constituted around 85   percent of the state bud-
get, and low oil prices are leading to steep cuts in government ser vices (Ban-
chero, 2019).
37 . This makes the simplifying assumption that all the subsidy is divided 
among  house holds, with none allocated to help firms adjust to the new price 
levels. This may not always be the case. In Iran, for example, a significant 
proportion of the fiscal savings was allocated to improve firm- level energy 
efficiency.

—+1public works, vocational training, and other initia-
tives. However, SURE- P did not offer transparent mon-
etary compensation for higher fuel charges. It suffered 
from a lack of credibility and from perceptions of cor-
ruption and mismanagement similar to  those that 
reflected the prob lems with the fuel subsidy regime 
and with public spending in general. It was discontin-
ued by the Buhari government as soon as it took office 
in May 2015 on a strong program of anticorruption.
The “Occupy Nigeria” protests following the removal 
of the fuel subsidy  were largely or ga nized by text mes-
sages and social media posts, eventually leading to a 
rollback of the reforms. Nigeria’s more recent achieve-
ment in shifting from subsidies to “price moderation” 
 under intense fiscal pressure is not likely to be sustain-
able if oil prices increase  going forward.
Iran: Building on capacity to reform
Iran’s radical reforms in 2010, aimed at eliminating large 
fuel subsidies and replacing them with cash transfers 
to  house holds, have generally been deemed to be a 
success. Fuel subsidies had been in place for nearly 
four de cades. Although they  were widely regarded as 
inefficient and inequitable, they had proved po liti cally 
difficult to remove. Iran was the first country to insti-
tute a system of oil- to- cash transfers at a national 
scale, moving to individualize the subsidy at the 
 house  hold level and transfer it directly to benefi-
ciary bank accounts— with the transfer vis i ble to recip-
ients before the price hike to boost credibility. In the 
pro cess, the government was able to leverage Iran’s 
strong civil registration system to identify beneficiaries 
and capacity in the banking system to expand financial 
access to make the transition to the new system rela-
tively smooth and effective. Digitization played an 
impor tant role in the implementation of the reforms, 
especially in the banking sector. Banks upgraded their 
payments infrastructure and collectively opened nearly 
16 million new accounts to enable all eligible  house holds 
to access their transfers.Bolivia: Capability without reform
Bolivia’s case shows that while digital identification 
and payment systems can be used as a tool to reform 
fuel subsidies, government capacity is not necessarily 
the binding constraint. As in many other countries, the 
primary constraint is po liti cal. A significant exporter 
of natu ral gas, Bolivia made efforts to rein in fuel sub-
sidies by increasing gasoline prices in December 2010 
following the global financial crisis and collapse of 
world energy prices. Protests erupted across the coun-
try, forcing the government to quickly back down and 
restore the status quo.
 There has not been a reform episode since then, even 
though the country has good capacity to move  towards 
direct compensation payments. Bolivia has for many 
years implemented large- scale social transfers effec-
tively, taking advantage of a widely held biometric ID 
system to identify beneficiaries and high rates of finan-
cial inclusion to pay them, except for a relatively few 
beneficiaries living in remote Andean locations.
Nigeria: Reform effort without capability?
Nigeria has a long rec ord of attempting to reform fuel 
price subsidies, most clearly when impelled by severe 
fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. However, 
among its other difficulties, it lacks the capacity to 
offer credible mechanisms to cushion the impact of 
higher prices, particularly on the poor. The most sig-
nificant reform, introduced in 2012, failed in large part 
due to the government’s inability to manage the fallout 
of the price decontrol policy that led to popu lar pro-
tests fueled by the spread of digital communications, 
especially mobile phones.40 To boost the popularity of 
the reform, the government instituted the Subsidy 
Reinvestment and Empowerment Program (SURE- P) 
to increase bud get allocations to social sectors, includ-
ing through programs for maternal and child health,

pop u lar ized through an intensive public infor-
mation campaign creatively using social media 
and mobile technology to reach the intended 
audience.
■ Fi nally, the government launched a nationwide 
program to issue 80 million new LPG connec-
tions to poor rural  women through the Ujjwala 
program, thereby providing them access to clean 
cooking fuel. In de pen dent reports indicate 
widespread support for the program and posi-
tive impact on  women’s health and well- being in 
general (Giri and Aadil, 2018; Jain et al., 2018). A 
more detailed description of the reforms and 
evidence of its impact is provided in Box 4.1.
 Towards more efficient and 
equitable subsidies: PaHaL  
and Ujjwala
India has long suffered from inefficient and inequitable 
fuel subsidies. According to estimates, in 2014, only 
about half of India’s 250 million  house holds had access 
to clean LPG cooking gas. Most of the LPG subsidy was 
captured by higher- income groups, mostly urban resi-
dents. The system was also riven with corruption and 
inefficiency. Duplicate connections, ghost beneficiaries, 
and significant diversion of subsidized domestic LPG 
 towards commercial use led to incon ve nience for genu-
ine beneficiaries. The subsidy also came at a significant 
fiscal cost (US$5.4 billion, or 2.8   percent of fiscal reve-
nue in 2013) and fiscal uncertainty due to volatile inter-
national energy prices. Due to  limited LPG connections, 
the poor  were excluded from the LPG distribution net-
work and had to use firewood to cook, leading to severe 
health prob lems, especially for  women.
Starting in 2013, the PaHaL program reformed this sys-
tem. Instead of paying a subsidized price for LPG cylin-
ders, beneficiaries paid the market price and the 
government transferred the subsidy directly into their As the reforms became embedded in the system, the 
government used “soft targeting”— encouraging richer 
 house holds to opt out of the subsidy voluntarily— 
following it up with “hard targeting” as data improved— 
eliminating  house holds by setting an income ceiling 
for benefits. It thereby achieved the twin objectives of 
reducing price distortions and improving equity in the 
distribution of fuel subsidies.41
India: The reform of the LPG system
India’s 2013 reform of LPG cooking gas subsidies used 
some similar approaches (Mittal et  al., 2017). One 
impor tant difference is that the government sought to 
encourage the use of LPG as a clean cooking fuel in 
place of biomass. The positive externalities, including 
better health for  women, reduced deforestation, and 
lower carbon emissions than other available options, 
argued for an efficient price that was lower than full 
market price rather than above it. The prob lems  were 
how to avoid the appropriation of the subsidy by deal-
ers (who could divert subsidized cylinders to busi-
nesses willing to pay market prices) and to focus the 
subsidy on poorer consumers. The LPG reform 
involved a four- pronged approach.
■ First, it was necessary to remove duplicate and 
non ex is tent beneficiaries from the existing list 
of  house hold LPG customers.
■ Second, the reform eliminated the dual pricing 
mechanism by setting the same market price for 
all  house hold and commercial LPG consumers. 
House holds receive the subsidy directly into their 
bank accounts upon delivery of the cylinder, up to 
a maximum of 12 per connection per year.
■ Third, higher- income  house holds  were encour-
aged to voluntarily opt out of the subsidy by 
41. In 2019,  under extreme fiscal pressure, Iran again sought to implement a 
large increase in fuel prices. In contrast to the 2010 reforms,  there was  little 
prior communication or arrangements to implement a credible compensa-
tion system. The result was massive social unrest and a scramble to put in 
place some offsetting transfers.

—+1Building on the success of PaHaL and the savings, in 
2016 the federal government announced a program 
(Ujjwala) to provide 50 million poor rural  women with 
LPG connections within three years. Aadhaar is now 
mandatory to obtain a new LPG connection, so new 
applicants can be checked against existing beneficiary 
lists to eliminate fraud. Moreover, many of the Jan 
Dhan accounts  were opened by rural  women to receive 
the subsidy, giving them greater agency in the receipt 
of the cash transfer.
In de pen dent assessments of the Ujjwala program indi-
cate a significant positive impact on adoption and use 
of LPG, especially in rural areas. A recent survey con-
ducted in six states by the Center for Energy, Environ-
ment, and  Water (Jain et  al., 2018) indicates that the 
share of  house holds using LPG as their primary cook -
ing fuel increased from 14 to 37   percent in 2015–2018 
and that Ujjwala accounted for 43   percent of all new 
rural LPG connections. Greater penetration of LPG in 
rural areas has also increased demand—83   percent of 
 house holds that do not have an LPG connection are 
interested in  doing so and are willing to pay for it. Ujj-
wala beneficiaries are  women, per the eligibility crite-
rion of the program. They receive the subsidy directly 
in their bank accounts, increasing their agency over 
the transfer (Jain et al., 2018).
Against the backdrop of widespread concern for the 
negative externalities from fossil fuel consumption, 
the gender, health, and environmental impact of Ujj-
wala offers a useful example of the flexibility afforded 
by digital technology in dealing with positive social as 
well as environmental externalities. Cooking is almost 
exclusively done by  women, who are also responsible 
for collection of firewood and biomass, especially in 
rural areas. The health and environmental externali-
ties are not insignificant. Reduction in exposure to 
indoor air pollution through the use of clean cooking 
fuels reduces tuberculosis incidence by half, with most 
of the health benefit accruing to  women (Singh, 
Kashyap, and Puri, 2018). With greater access, avail-
ability, and use of LPG, reliance on firewood and bank accounts when they paid the dealer to deliver the 
cylinder. This system is effectively a voucher, delivered 
on a verified purchase, as opposed to an unrestricted 
transfer that could be used to purchase any commod-
ity, as in the case of the monthly cash transfers that 
replaced gasoline subsidies in Iran. Payment was con-
firmed by text messages (SMS) sent to mobile phones. 
Customers could track their deliveries, rate their dis-
tributors, and change them if dissatisfied.
On the implementation side, the program created a 
clean list of beneficiaries, removing some 25 million 
false and inactive recipients. Dealers could no longer 
profit from diverting subsidized cylinders, and wait 
times for refills for genuine  house holds decreased. 
The reform also led to fiscal savings, although the 
quantum is open to debate. With the subsidy individu-
alized to identified  people and  house holds, nearly 10 
million LPG consumers voluntarily relinquished it 
through the government’s GiveItUp campaign. Among 
other incentives, this offered a placing on a digital 
“Roll of Honor” linked to the name of a poor  family 
whose subsidy had been made pos si ble by the volun-
tary withdrawal. Further targeting mea sures  were 
then taken, first to exclude  house holds earning enough 
to file a tax return, and second, to require beneficia-
ries to submit a legally binding declaration that their 
 house hold income was not above the cutoff level.
The implementation strategy appropriately leveraged 
the ID- payments- mobile framework. The first phase of 
de- duplication relied on name and address matching, 
as penetration of Aadhaar had not yet reached satura-
tion in many states. As Aadhaar coverage increased, 
beneficiaries  were encouraged to provide their unique 
ID numbers and as well as Aadhaar- linked bank 
accounts and mobile numbers, to the program data-
base. Unique identification has been key in the trans-
formation of the subsidy regime. Surveys indicate high 
rates of customer satisfaction with the changes, largely 
 because eliminating the incentives for dealers to 
divert cylinders had slashed delivery waiting times for 
 house holds.

+1—Reforming fertilizer subsidies: 
Digital ID and payments for 
sustainable agriculture
Subsidies on fertilizer—an essential input into agricul-
tural production— are often motivated by the objective 
of ensuring food security and reducing dependence 
on imports and external assistance. As for fuel, gov-
ernments often provide generalized price subsidies to 
producers as well as to consuming farmers, which 
greatly distort the market pricing mechanism. Lower 
fertilizer prices are supposed to benefit farmers but 
can also result in severe overuse, thereby creating neg-
ative externalities vis- à- vis soil health, food safety, and 
access to  water (Jayne and Rashid, 2013). Low adminis-
tered prices may be po liti cally appealing, but they fail 
to account for the usage of valuable natu ral resources, 
thereby making it difficult to achieve several SDG goals 
related to protection of the environment and sustain-
able use of natu ral resources, as described in Chapter 1 
(Box 1.1).
Fertilizer subsidies suffer from significant inefficiency, 
inequity, and misallocation of public resources. As we biomass declines. This should provide another positive 
externality, especially in fragile environmental zones.
Digital technology cannot solve the prob lem of fiscal 
sustainability, but it offers a flexible menu of options 
to help address it. Even as affordability remains a con-
tinuing barrier to uptake, especially for poor families, 
concern is mounting over increasing fiscal allocations 
to the subsidy. One approach could be to rebalance the 
LPG subsidy in  favor of the rural poor by reducing the 
number of  free cylinders from 12 per year to six, which 
is close to the average consumption level but still 
higher than the average for poor consumers. Another 
is to reduce the transfer to non- Ujjwala PaHaL benefi-
ciaries, tapering the subsidy to less- poor groups or 
eliminating it altogether for  these groups while 
increasing the subsidy to the very poor.42 Any of  these 
approaches, or a combination, would satisfy the objec-
tive of efficient pricing (at the margin) with increased 
equity.
42. In a policy brief, the Collaborative Clean Air Policy Center proposes 
increasing the subsidy to 73 million poor  house holds so that the cost of a cylin -
der would be 4  percent of monthly expenditures. https:// static1 . squarespace

resources and reducing land productivity, 
something that the SDGs seek to mitigate.
(iv) Infrastructure and capacity: Using ICT and pay-
ments presupposes the existence of both 
financial and digital infrastructure in rural 
areas. This is not the case in most countries. 
While it is undeniable that mobile technology, 
including mobile money, has penetrated sig-
nificantly in parts of rural Asia and Africa, 
 there are still large gaps in connectivity, finan-
cial access points, and digital literacy among 
the rural poor, especially  women.
Notwithstanding  these challenges, several countries 
have implemented fertilizer reforms using digital 
technologies with the objective of moving  towards effi-
cient pricing with equity. We explore three cases.
Nigeria
In Nigeria,43 the government initiated a new fertilizer 
distribution scheme in 2012 called E- Wallet  under the 
Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS). The 
main innovation was the use of mobile technology to 
transfer fertilizer subsidies from the government 
directly to farmers, bypassing middlemen, who fre-
quently used fraudulent documents to collect subsi-
dized fertilizers from government stores to sell at 
market rates. The government was removed from the 
direct procurement and distribution of fertilizer. The 
scheme was implemented with the collaboration of 
the federal government, state ministries of agricul-
ture, supply chain man ag ers (SCMs), and a private- 
sector digital platform builder/operator.
Registered farmers received E- Wallet vouchers 
through their mobile phones and used them to buy 
inputs at designated agro- dealer redemption centers. 
Farmers received two 50-kg bags of fertilizer (one bag 
of urea and one bag of NPK) at half the market price, 
with the payment being made in cash directly to the 
43. This case is based on Onyekwena et al. (2018).have seen in the case of fuel, reforming fertilizer subsi-
dies is not an easy task. Farmers are an influential 
po liti cal lobby; corruption in fertilizer procurement 
and distribution creates vested interests opposed to 
changes in the status quo. However,  these challenges 
are not insurmountable. The framework of individual-
izing the subsidy that has been successful in the case of 
LPG in India can be applied in this case as well. Si mul-
ta neously,  there are additional challenges that policy -
makers need to take into account as they move 
from  price subsidies to individualized transfers for 
fertilizers.
(i) Absence of a beneficiary database: Unlike the case 
of LPG in India or fuel- consuming  house holds 
in Iran, where the beneficiary profiles are well 
defined and lists digitized, often no such data-
base exists for farmers. Determining benefi-
ciaries on the basis of land owner ship would 
almost certainly exclude tenant farmers, 
sharecroppers, and  others who are infor-
mally engaged in agriculture. Moreover, land 
rec ords are often outdated and inaccurate, 
increasing the chances that subsidies  will be 
misallocated.
(ii) Heterogeneity: The farm sector is extremely 
heterogeneous— there are multiple inputs and 
multiple products; the demand for inputs such 
as fertilizers and seeds varies across crops, 
time, and space. This makes it difficult to arrive 
at a base allocation for a “representative” 
farmer and to target efficiently.
(iii) Environmental externalities: The challenge of 
determining the optimal transfer is further 
compounded by changing weather patterns, 
differential soil quality, and availability of 
 water resources. If equity is the main policy 
goal, farmers who own more productive land 
and have better access to  water should theo-
retically pay more for fertilizer than  those with 
lower soil quality and  water resources. How-
ever, cheaper fertilizer in the second case may

Zambia’s Farmer Input Support Program (FISP, for-
merly known as the Fertilizer Support Program) has 
been an integral part of its agricultural policy since 
2002, receiving up to 50   percent of the government’s 
agricultural bud get.44 In this program, the govern-
ment assumed the responsibility of distributing farm-
ing inputs to small- scale farmers to incentivize the use 
of fertilizer and increase agricultural output.
However, FISP was plagued by several issues that 
 limited its effectiveness as a tool to increase farm pro-
ductivity, ensure food security, and reduce poverty, 
including frequent delays in allocating bud getary 
resources, mounting costs of procurement, and cor-
ruption in the fertilizer distribution system. In a bid to 
transform FISP and address its mounting inefficiencies 
and in effec tive ness, the government launched the 
Electronic Voucher Farmer Input Support Program 
during the 2017/2018 farming season.
The FISP e- voucher program transfers approximately 
US$170 to each of 1 million farmers per season 
through a government- issued payment card (voucher 
scratch card) linked to the beneficiary’s National Reg-
istration Card (NRC) number. The cards are redeemed 
at retail agro- dealer outlets by entering the voucher 
and NRC numbers through their cell phones, enabling 
the holder to purchase agricultural input supplies of 
their choice at the market price, up to the allotted 
amount. On confirmation of the transaction, the 
agro- dealer receives an instant payment to their 
online bank account, thereby closing the payment 
loop electronically.
The FISP e- voucher program provides another example 
of bringing together ID, mobile technology, and finan-
cial accounts in an integrated manner to move  towards 
a more efficient pricing system. However, the scheme 
suffered from several challenges on the implementa-
tion side that have led to its partial rollback—40   percent 
44. For more detail on Zambia, see Chikobola and Tembo (2018). We are 
grateful to Mupwaya Mutakwa for very useful conversations and for access to 
his unpublished thesis (Mutakwa, 2018), available on request.agro- dealer, who also could redeem the voucher. Ben-
eficiaries also received one  free 25-kg bag of rice or 
20-kg bag of maize seeds. The federal and state govern-
ments shared the fiscal cost of the subsidy equally.
Most stakeholders, especially farmers, perceived the 
program to be a success. A survey of 213 farmers con-
ducted through a field questionnaire and by phone 
found considerable support, with over half of the 
respondents reporting that E- Wallet was better than 
the previous system. The main reasons  were con ve-
nience (timely access to fertilizers during farming sea-
son) and control (getting the desired type and quantity 
of fertilizer). Some farmers reported that the price was 
also lower, possibly due to the elimination of middle-
men and improvements in the supply of fertilizer to 
the market.  There seemed to be a fairly broad consen-
sus that farmers actually benefited from the scheme 
and that reducing the influence of middlemen led to 
less fraud and corruption in the distribution of 
fertilizer.
While the survey paints a hopeful picture, the E- Wallet 
system was not without challenges. On the technical 
side, nearly a quarter of the survey respondents indi-
cated that the system was not effective, especially for 
areas that had poor mobile network coverage. Net-
work breakdowns  were frequent, and the E- Wallet 
platform provider was unable to effectively cover all 
redemption centers in remote rural locations. This 
eventually led to offline redemption of inputs; corrupt 
practices ensued, denting the credibility of the reform. 
 Because Nigeria lacks an effective ID system,  there 
 were difficulties identifying beneficiaries, resulting in 
some duplicate and ineligible entries. The equal allo-
cation of subsidized bags regardless of size of land-
holding, type of soil, and cropping pattern led to the 
provision of inputs to heterogeneous farmers without 
taking into consideration their  actual needs. From 
2015 onwards, the system was rolled back  after the 
change in the administration, officially for technical 
reasons but reputedly also in response to pressures 
from interests seeking to regain control of the distri-
bution system.

—+1allocation based on the size of the landholding, the 
quality of soil, and the crop. It was expected that this 
would help farmers to rationalize fertilizer use, thereby 
reducing negative environmental externalities, espe-
cially soil degradation and depleting  water resources. 
The longer- term objective was to fix base fertilizer allo-
cations and move  towards market pricing, with the 
option of transferring the compensatory subsidy 
through bank deposits in cash to individual farmers.
This ambition has been significantly scaled back as a 
result of field- level assessments and an iterative pro-
cess of learning from a series of pi lots that have been 
progressively scaled up from 2016 onwards. Initial 
results of full- scale pi lots in two digitally advanced 
districts— Krishna and West Godavari in Andhra 
Pradesh— indicated significant delays in distribution 
due to the difficulty in linking land rec ords and soil 
health cards to Aadhaar. Farmers did not put much 
store in the soil health cards. Moreover, the system 
required strong and stable data connectivity, which 
was a challenge in both the districts. Aadhaar authen-
tication success rates  were also unacceptably low in the 
dust- filled environments of the distribution centers, 
resulting in manual overrides and reversion to paper- 
based rec ords, thus defeating the purpose of the use of 
technology in the reform pro  cess.
 These lessons have been taken on board to redesign 
the program. Further pi lots in 14 districts carried out 
in mid-2017 required only Aadhaar authentication to 
complete the sale. Farmers could buy unlimited quan-
tities, but the subsidy amount was highlighted in their 
receipt to raise awareness of the cost to the govern-
ment— a “nudge” to rationalize fertilizer use. At the 
same time, the government concentrated its efforts to 
improve authentication success rates as it prepared 
for a national rollout in April  2018. Evidence from 
field assessments indicates that this has indeed suc-
ceeded; Aadhaar authentication rates increased from 
41  percent in September  2016 to 99   percent in Octo-
ber  2018 (Figure  4.3) (Giri et  al., 2019). This sets the 
stage for strengthening the system for determining base 
subsidy allocations, introducing more sophisticated of e- voucher beneficiaries  were returned to the manual 
system for the 2018/2019 farming season. The major 
reasons for the decision  were (a) poor connectivity and 
mobile network coverage, (b) delays in scratch card pro-
duction and distribution, (c) farmers losing their cards 
and not being able to use PINs, and (d) supply con-
straints faced by agro- dealers in serving the demand 
from farmers.
Although the government has cited technical chal-
lenges as the reason for the rollback,  others have spec-
ulated that it lacks the po liti cal  will to take on the 
vested interests who benefited from the  earlier system. 
As in the case of Nigeria, sustaining change is a chal-
lenge when reforms disrupt the status quo.
India
India’s45 fertilizer consumption per acre of arable land 
in 2014 was over three times the level in Zambia and 15 
times the level in Nigeria. Its approach to fertilizer sub-
sidy reform has been dif fer ent; instead of implement-
ing “hard targeting” of beneficiaries and an e- voucher 
system, its reform has been based on “soft targeting” 
through biometric authentication at the point of sale, 
with the objective of reducing the demand for fertil-
izer and increasing “subsidy salience”— the recognition 
by farmers that the government spends significant fis-
cal resources to benefit them. On the supply side, the 
government moved from general subsidies to fertilizer 
companies to compensating them for low prices on 
the basis of the amount sold in their retail outlets, veri-
fied through successful Aadhaar authentication. The 
aim has been to reduce the diversion of subsidized fer-
tilizer to the open market.
The initial design was ambitious. It involved linking the 
beneficiary’s Aadhaar number to their land owner ship 
rec ords and soil health cards evaluated at a large num-
ber of locations. Farmers  were expected to undergo 
biometric authentication at fertilizer distribution points. 
The system would determine an indicative fertilizer 
45. This case is based on Giri, Thapliyal, Rautela, and Sharma (2019).

—+1subsidies. Some cases have used “cash” compensation 
through bank accounts,  others a voucher mechanism 
tied to a baseline consumption allocation. Not all cases 
have had the preconditions for success. While India’s 
LPG reform has been very successful, the fertilizer 
reforms in Nigeria and Zambia suffered from a range 
of technical prob lems, including supply- side con-
straints,  limited connectivity, weak identification of 
beneficiaries (Nigeria), and the inability of some farm-
ers to work with PINs and ID numbers (Zambia). 
Although India appears to have solved its authentica-
tion challenge, it has not yet been able to put teeth into 
its fertilizer reforms by mapping out a set of base allo-
cations based on the area, quality, and use of farmers’ 
landholdings.
A third lesson is that having the capacity to reform 
does not mean that  there is the po liti cal  will to do so. 
As shown by the case of Nigeria, lack of capacity and 
credibility can stymie reforms but, as in Bolivia, having 
the capacity to reform does not mean that reforms  will 
be taken up. The politics of subsidy reforms is fraught; 
re sis tance can be expected from both the beneficiaries 
of the existing system and from vested interests, such 
as administrators, dealers, and suppliers, who have 
been able to take advantage of opportunities for leakage 
and diversion. In some cases, digital media have been 
used to strengthen movements and co ali tions against 
reform. Sequencing is key, including well- targeted 
communications.
Fi nally, the cases show the importance of sustained 
effort, feedback, and adaptability. India’s LPG reforms 
had to be recalibrated several times before becoming 
effective; the recalibration of its fertilizer reforms is 
still ongoing.targeting mechanisms, and moving to an e- voucher– 
based system in  future iterations of the reform pro  cess.
Lessons from the cases
Using insights from country case studies, this chapter 
has provided an overview of several efforts to shift 
from generalized price subsidies  towards market or 
efficient prices together with better- managed, more 
equitable, individualized direct transfers, highlighting 
the role of digital technology ( Table 4.1). Fuel and fer-
tilizer are not the only candidates for such reforms, 
but  these two sectors are extremely relevant for sev-
eral SDGs, especially  those related to sustainable use of 
natu ral resources, environmental protection, and 
combating climate change.
A first lesson is that, while they do not solve all prob-
lems, digital mechanisms offer new ways to reform 
price subsidies and implement efficient pricing. They 
expand the policy possibility frontier, helping govern-
ment to know the identities of beneficiaries, to com-
municate with them, and to pay them efficiently, 
accountably, and without leakage. They increase flexi-
bility to improve the efficiency of targeting and expand 
access for vulnerable groups, especially poor  women. 
They may not solve the prob lem of fiscal sustainability, 
but they provide a wider range of options to respond 
to it in an equitable manner. Digital communications, 
including through social media, provides govern-
ments with the opportunity to spread awareness and 
build supporting co ali tions for reform, for example, 
through stressing the improvements in equity.
A second lesson is the variable way in which technol-
ogy has been used—or not used—to reform price

+1—Yemtsov, 2017). As outlined in Chapter 1, programs can 
be unconditional (universal basic income), categori-
cally targeted (to poor  women or old age pensioners), 
or conditional (an education grant subject to school 
attendance). The modalities through which social 
transfers are delivered can include in- kind provision 
of certain products or ser vices (food rations or medical 
supplies); vouchers linked to the purchase of par tic u-
lar goods (essential foodstuffs or fertilizers, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 4); and cash transfers, provided as 
physical cash or through a range of financial instru-
ments (see Box 5.1).
 There are many policy debates in this area, often 
around the two dimensions of (a) conditionality and 
(b) the choice between delivery modalities of in- kind, 
voucher, or cash. We do not attempt a full survey of the 
extensive lit er a ture on  these complex questions. On 
the in- kind versus cash debate for food assistance, for 
example, a cross- country review suggests that the rela-
tive effectiveness of programs designed to ensure food 
security may, on average, be similar for cash assistance 
and in- kind transfer programs (Gentilini, 2016a, 
2016b). However, relative efficiency, as mea sured by the 
cost of reaching beneficiaries, is usually greater for 
cash transfers than in- kind provision, with the latter 
being more expensive to administer compared to giv-
ing  people cash. However, context  matters, and in- kind 
provision continues to be an impor tant component of 
social protection in many low-  and middle- income 
countries. In addition to concern about the possibility 
of market failure, in- kind may be preferred  because 
programs encompass a wider set of objectives, such as 
supporting commodity production through guaranteed Social protection features prominently in the SDGs, 
especially  those related to ending poverty and hunger, 
achieving gender equality, and  women’s empower-
ment.  These include:
Goal 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social 
protection systems and mea sures for all, including 
floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of 
the poor and the vulnerable.
Goal 1.4: By 2030, ensure that all men and  women, 
in par tic u lar the poor and the vulnerable, have 
equal rights to economic resources, as well as 
access to basic ser vices, owner ship and control 
over land and other forms of property, inheritance, 
natu ral resources, appropriate new technology, 
and financial ser vices, including microfinance.
Goal 2.1: End hunger and ensure access by all 
 people, in par tic u lar the poor and  people in vul-
nerable situations, including infants, to safe, 
nutritious, and sufficient food.
Goal 5.a: Undertake reforms to give  women equal 
rights to economic resources, as well as access to 
owner ship and control over land and other forms 
of property, financial ser vices, inheritance, and 
natu ral resources, in accordance with national laws.
Goal 5.b: Enhance the use of enabling technology, in 
par tic u lar information and communications tech-
nology, to promote the empowerment of  women.
Social protection systems vary greatly in scope and 
scale; they are not static, but respond to po liti cal deci-
sions, donor preferences, administrative capacity, and 
technological innovation (Alderman, Gentilini, and Chapter 5.

tions of ID, mobiles, and payment systems can improve 
ser vice delivery, then consider three cases of transfer 
systems using dif fer ent approaches— smartcards, bank 
transfers with biometric authentication, and mobile 
money. We then address the use of digital systems to 
improve the efficiency of in- kind transfers, in this case 
of food rations, and follow with a brief focus on two 
common cross- cutting goals:  women’s empowerment 
and financial inclusion. The chapter concludes with a 
summary of lessons and recommendations.
Role of digital technology
Many lower- income developing countries have a long 
history of personalized social transfer systems operat-
ing at the communal level and relying heavi ly on local 
pro cesses to identify recipients and make payments. 
One such example is the Tanzanian Social Action Fund 
(TASAF), which was set up in 2000 to pursue collabora-
tive efforts on poverty reduction programs. TASAF 
reached some 1.1 million poor  house holds in 2017 , 
paying in cash at bimonthly communal meetings.46 
Another notable program is the Productive Social 
46. For a description of TASAF and an assessment, see http:// ispatools . org 
/ tools / ISPA - Country - Report -  Tanzania - PWP  . pdf.procurement, stabilizing price fluctuations, and influ-
encing preferences. Advocates of in- kind programs 
also note that ration programs are more difficult to 
dismantle than cash transfer systems. They are highly 
vis i ble and have long- term procurement and distribu -
tion arrangements that engage many power ful inter-
ests. In contrast, cash transfer programs are more 
subject to the whims of annual bud gets, and their real 
value can be slowly eroded by inflation.
We do not take a strong stand on the modality of deliv-
ery of social protection, focusing instead on how digi-
tal ID, payments, and mobile technology can be 
leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of such systems. In the case of food subsidies, for 
example, digitization makes it pos si ble to provide an 
electronic voucher through smartcards and mobile 
phones or to provide an equivalent cash transfer 
through bank or mobile money accounts. At first sight, 
this argues for a shift away from in- kind provision 
 towards vouchers or cash transfers. However, at the 
same time, cases show how digital technology can 
make the supply and distribution of food rations more 
efficient and accountable and, at least on the customer- 
facing side, help to increase choice of ser vice point, 
and possibly also facilitate flexible choice over the 
modality of support.Box­5 .1 .­A­ taxonomy­of­ transfers
The lit er a ture on transfers can be confusing, par-
ticularly on the use of the term “cash.” For greater 
clarity, in this section we break social transfers into 
three broad categories: in- kind benefits, vouchers, 
and cash transfers. The last are then divided into 
physical cash payments, payments through finan-
cial instruments such as checks and money  orders, 
and payment through digital mechanisms.  These 
could include, for example, smartcards or trans-
fers into mobile money accounts.In-kind Cash VouchersSocial transfers

+1—interests.48 Disparate data systems, often with conflict-
ing information, must be integrated without excluding 
genuine beneficiaries. Even with the best communica-
tions efforts, many  people  will have  limited under-
standing of the new systems. Some  will not be able to 
use them effectively, requiring protocols for managing 
exceptions and speedy dispute resolution. The incen-
tives of local officials and ser vice providers on the 
ground  will change. Typically, they  will have less auton -
omy and perhaps fewer opportunities to benefit per-
sonally from their positions; this raises the risk that 
their incentives to deliver ser vices  will be compro-
mised. All  these challenges and transitional frictions 
make it even more impor tant that, once fully imple-
mented, the new digitally enabled systems perform 
better than the old ones.
The impact on beneficiaries, and on citizens more 
broadly, depends on  whether, and how,  these tech-
nological tools are harnessed for better and more 
efficient governance. Examples from many countries 
show a wide range of both benefits and risks as they 
endeavor to deliver social protection more efficiently 
(Gelb and Diofasi Metz, 2018). This, in turn, makes it 
even more impor tant to be clear on the prob lems—  
what they are, and how digitization  will solve them—  
and to monitor implementation carefully.
Cash transfers
As noted previously,  there is already a large lit er a ture 
on the use of digital technology for G2P payments 
(examples include Aker, Boumnijel, McClelland, and 
Tierney, 2016; Banerjee, 2015; Fiszbein et  al., 2009; 
Gelb and Decker, 2011; Gelb and Diofasi Metz, 2018; 
Gelb, Mukherjee, and Navis, 2018; Klapper and Singer, 
2014, 2017; Radcliffe, 2016; and  others). By and large, 
the effects of moving away from physical cash seem to 
be favorable, giving recipients greater control over 
48. For example, local po liti cal committees and officials play a role in deter-
mining eligibility for benefits in Pakistan ( union councils) and in Andhra 
Pradesh (Janmbhoomi committees) (Aadil et al., 2019).Safety Net Program (PNSP) in Ethiopia, which supports 
some 8 million  people. Such programs may include 
several components such as cash transfers and public 
works. Sometimes they are combined with compo-
nents to strengthen communal processes—to spread 
information, for example, on public health issues or to 
build the capacity of local administrations and increase 
trust.47
With  people more mobile and urbanized, and less 
attached to traditional communities,  these approaches 
are steadily being superseded by alternative, less per-
sonalized delivery mechanisms, including through the 
use of digital technology for identification and pay-
ments (Radcliffe, 2016), to help target beneficiaries 
(Chapter 4) and also to monitor implementation. The 
costly, and sometimes difficult, changes in administra-
tive pro  cesses and delivery mechanisms are motivated 
by the objectives of making governments more inclu-
sive and efficient, reducing diversion while at the same 
time providing greater control to beneficiaries and 
con ve nience in accessing their entitlements. One cri-
terion for the success of digital reforms is therefore 
 whether the delivery of public ser vices, subsidies, and 
transfers has or has not improved from the perspec-
tive of beneficiaries— particularly  those belonging to 
the most disadvantaged groups. This is also impor tant 
in building wider support for digital reforms, increas-
ing po liti cal viability, and ensuring continuity over the 
medium and longer term.
Governments face complex challenges in making  these 
changes. They must address issues of identification, 
the targeting of beneficiaries, and delivery mecha-
nisms in a coherent way. Even if the delivery of bene-
fits is digitized, the se lection of  people into beneficiary 
rolls may remain heavi ly influenced by local po liti cal 
47 . Local capacity- building has been a focus of TASAF in addition to social 
protection. Evans, Holtemeyer, and Kosec (2019) report on a program that 
relied on the popu lar election of community management committees. They 
find that this increased trust in leaders and improved perceptions of govern-
ment responsiveness to citizens’ concerns and the honesty of leaders. One 
indicator that governance may have improved is that rec ords from school 
and health committees are more readily available in treatment villages.

—+1Smartcards for employment guarantee 
payments in Andhra Pradesh50
In 2006, the government of Andhra Pradesh, a state in 
southern India, launched a biometric smartcard sys-
tem to pay workers in India’s National Rural Employ-
ment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), which provides 
rural  house holds with 100 days of paid employment 
annually. Payments  were previously distributed pub-
licly in physical cash at village- level meetings in the 
presence of local officials and the beneficiaries, a 
method used by many other programs such as in 
TASAF in Tanzania and the PSSN in Ethiopia. By trans-
ferring wages directly to recipients’ bank accounts and 
verifying their identities using fingerprint readers at 
the time of disbursement, the system was intended to 
ensure that (a) only genuine workers  were paid, (b) 
they could withdraw their wages con ve niently from 
customer ser vice points located in each village, and (c) 
“leakage” of public expenditure would be eliminated 
and accountability of local officials involved in pro-
gram implementation would be increased.51
Digital technology was embedded in the program at 
three points: obtaining biometric data (fingerprints 
and photo graph) of registered NREGS workers to pro-
duce smartcards, transferring wages electronically to 
workers’ bank accounts, and deploying fingerprint 
and smartcard readers at the withdrawal point. This 
intervention was studied intensively over a period of 
two years (Muralidharan et al., 2018a) using a random 
assignment of 296 subdistrict locations and comparing 
the impact on payment logistics, leakages, and pro-
gram access across treatment subdistricts, which used 
smartcards, and control subdistricts, where smart-
cards  were introduced  after the evaluation.  After 
two years, two- thirds of the villages in the treatment 
group  were actually using smartcards and half of all 
50. This case draws on Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2016, 2018a).
51. It should be noted that this was by no means the first use of such tech-
nologies to deliver social payments in a development setting. The earliest 
example known is from the mid-1990s: the payment of social pensions in 
rural Kwa- Zulu- Natal, South Africa, using mobile ATMs linked to biometric 
fingerprint readers (Gelb and Diofasi Metz, 2018).entitlements, improving timeliness and con ve nience 
of transfers, and generating fiscal savings by cleaning 
beneficiary lists and streamlining targeting. However, 
some studies also flag  factors that may cause recipients 
to prefer physical cash, including low levels of literacy 
and the transaction time and costs of cashing out 
financial payments.49
Some of the issues in this area  were discussed in Chap-
ter  3, including the use of special- purpose payment 
mechanisms versus deposits into general- purpose 
bank or mobile accounts. While many, though not 
all, transfer programs appear to have transitioned 
away from physical cash, less than half appear to 
pay  through general- purpose accounts able to offer 
 ser vices such as savings or payments. Special-  and 
general- purpose payment modalities offer similar 
advantages from the perspective of public finan-
cial  management. With unique identities assured by 
a  strong ID system and suitable authentication of 
the beneficiaries, payments are accurate and can be 
traced and audited. However, special- purpose vehi-
cles do not offer the same support to increasing finan-
cial inclusion, on the demand side by stimulating 
beneficiary choice and on the supply side by support-
ing the extension of infrastructure and ser vice net-
works through delivery commissions on payments. 
General- purpose payment mechanisms therefore 
offer advantages, but  there can also be  factors that 
argue for special- purpose payment vehicles in some 
cases, at least for an interim period.  These could 
include a still- undeveloped financial system with 
inadequate density of cash- out points or a lack of agency 
of beneficiaries (particularly  women) to use general-  
purpose systems. Some programs use a mix of mecha-
nisms. We draw insights from four cases, focusing on

related to enrolling beneficiaries into the program, 
thereby reducing its scale and overall impact.
 Women, transfers, and biometric  
authentication in Pakistan
Pakistan has a long history of using a combination of 
biometric authentication and smartcards to deliver 
social transfers to displaced  people and refugees, to 
victims of flooding, and, since 2008, to poor  women 
 under the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), 
which provides transfers to some 5.3 million poor 
families. Technology has helped to deliver  these bene-
fits, including through ensuring that the beneficiaries 
are unique. Conversely, social programs, notably BISP, 
have been a major demand- side driver for registration 
into the ID system, particularly for  women, and to help 
update the social data used in targeting (Malik, 2014). 
This is consolidated into the National Social and 
Economic Register (NSER), a joint initiative of the 
National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) 
and BISP. The NSER includes information on some 
90  percent of Pakistan’s  house holds; it is updated peri-
odically and can also be revised using information col-
lected in the course of delivering social benefits. For 
example, a massive 2010 program to provide flood relief 
through smartcards (the Watan program) uncovered 
individuals who needed to be registered, and cases 
where data on  family structure had not been updated.
As discussed in Chapter 2, Pakistan has one of the wid-
est gender gaps in access to mobile phone owner ship 
and financial inclusion. Only 7   percent of  women had 
financial accounts in 2017 ,  little up from 3   percent in 
2011. This reflects widespread social and economic 
constraints on  women imposed by Pakistan’s patriar-
chal society. Increasing the rate of  women’s ID regis-
tration, for example, has required NADRA to innovate 
by introducing female- only registration units; without 
this, many  women would not have been permitted to 
register. The low literacy levels of  women have posed payments  were made using the new system. Incom-
plete implementation was mostly due to the challenges 
of enrolling beneficiaries and linking smartcards with 
bank accounts that, in many cases,  were the first 
accounts held by the beneficiaries.
Even with partial implementation, the smartcard 
intervention showed several positive impacts on the 
efficiency of program delivery. First, the time taken to 
receive and collect wages went down. Bank transfers 
reduced the lag between completion of work and 
receipt of wages by 6–10 days, and workers spent 
20  percent less time in withdrawing their wages com-
pared to the  earlier system of physical cash distribu-
tion at public meetings. Second, the study estimated a 
41  percent decrease in the leakage of NREGS funds in 
treatment subdistricts, but no such evidence for the 
control group, suggesting that biometric authentica-
tion reduced the opportunity to divert cash to ficti-
tious workers on the muster roll. Third, beneficiaries 
overwhelmingly supported the new system. Ninety 
 percent of NREGS participants surveyed  after the 
intervention was carried out preferred smartcards to 
the old system, largely due to the con ve nience of col-
lecting their wages and reduced corruption.  There was 
no evidence of exclusion of vulnerable groups due to 
the introduction of technology. Fi nally, the interven-
tion had a high rate of return on investment. Savings 
to the government from reduced corruption  were esti-
mated at $34.5 million annually, against a one- time 
cost of $4 million to set up the smartcard infrastruc-
ture. The intervention was estimated to pay for itself 
even if one only considered the savings in the time cost 
for beneficiaries to access their wages.
The Andhra Pradesh smartcards case is an example of 
an appropriate use of technology to improve effective-
ness at scale. It showed that use of electronic bank trans-
fers and biometric authentication at cash disbursement 
points using a specific- purpose smartcard can improve 
con ve nience and reduce corruption without excluding 
vulnerable  house holds. But the logistics of introducing 
new technology and payment mechanisms can be diffi-
cult. Several of the subdistricts that  were initially chosen

—+1failure  were guided on the action they needed to take 
for their next visit. Only around half of the beneficia-
ries expressed satisfaction with the overall experience 
of obtaining their benefits. Nevertheless, a significant 
majority (88   percent) expressed a preference for receiv-
ing payments  after biometric verification, almost all 
 because of the belief that this approach enabled them to 
receive the payments themselves. Only 6   percent  were 
opposed to the new system.
Pakistan’s experience raises questions about how best 
to design digital delivery systems to serve severely dis-
advantaged groups. Despite the difficulties, BISP pro-
grams appear to have had significant positive effects in 
reducing severe poverty and malnutrition, as well as 
helping to improve the status of  women in the  house hold 
(Cheema et al., 2016). In addition, the increased enroll-
ment of  women by NADRA has been an impor  tant step 
 towards enabling them to participate more broadly in 
economic activity and to vote in elections. However, the 
transfers have not led to broader financial inclusion; 
the accounts set up to pay benefits have been transmis-
sion accounts and have not offered payments, savings, 
or other ser vices. Neither has the program had much 
impact in supporting wider owner ship of mobiles, 
another step that could open the way to greater in de-
pen dence and autonomy for  women.
Moves are  under way to broaden the range of ser vices 
available through the accounts and to build on the 
transfer system to reduce the gender gap, including in 
the growing area of mobile digital payments.  There is 
much room for improvement—in 2017 , 29   percent of 
men had made or received a mobile payment, com-
pared with only 5   percent of  women. As confirmed by 
the analy sis in Chapter 2, which finds access to mobile 
an impor tant correlate of the gender gap in financial 
inclusion, this is a productive agenda for the  future.52 
At pre sent, however, Pakistan’s experience suggests that 
active mea sures  will be needed to support severely con -
strained and disadvantaged beneficiaries to help them 
52. Even when  women have access to a mobile phone, it is not likely to be 
registered  under their own name; individuals can register up to five voice 
connections and three data connections  under a single NADRA ID.an additional challenge to the delivery of social bene-
fits, including through digital mechanisms. As a result 
of the restrictions placed on them,  women have 
 limited agency to operate in de pen dently.
BISP has experimented with several approaches to dis-
tributing social transfers, including cash deliveries to 
homes through the post office, disbursements through 
smartcards, payments through mobile banking, and 
the Benazir debit card.  Under this last approach, imple-
menting partner banks (IPBs) have used BISP’s data to 
issue debit cards to beneficiaries. They are then able to 
withdraw their transfers at ATMs on a quarterly basis.
All  these methods have experienced difficulties (Inno-
vative Development Strategies, 2017). Post office pay-
ments have been misappropriated by functionaries 
and  others, and unlawful commissions have been lev-
ied as a condition of delivery. A survey found that, 
while travel time and costs to access the grants  were 
low, the average payment actually received was less 
than 60   percent of the intended payment (Cheema 
et al., 2014). Beneficiaries have been denied smartcard 
payments and subjected to extortion as a condition to 
cash out their entitlements, and mobile banking ben-
eficiaries have been similarly harassed. While the debit 
card mechanism was designed to minimize  human 
interaction, many  women lacked proximity to ATMs or 
the capability to use them. In Baluchistan, for exam-
ple, only 23   percent of beneficiaries withdrew their 
allowances themselves from ATMs, and only 25   percent 
from other points of ser vice. Extortion was again pre-
sent, and, in addition to social constraints, lack of lit-
eracy was a constraining  factor.
Recognizing the difficulties, BISP moved  towards a bio-
metric verification system for cashing out payments, 
with pi lots in early 2016, followed by wider implemen-
tation. An initial assessment of this approach  later in 
the year revealed numerous difficulties. Many benefi-
ciaries  were poorly informed about the new approach. 
Travel times, waiting times, and costs to collect the sti-
pends  were considerable, and only 74   percent reported 
that their biometric verification had been successful.

delivery modes from 2009 to 2019.
Traditionally, gram panchayat (village government) 
offices had distributed monthly pensions directly, but 
the pro  cess was marred by complaints about lack of 
timeliness of payments, bogus beneficiaries, and petty 
corruption. From May  2009, the system changed to 
direct deposits into a designated private bank, requir-
ing beneficiaries to open accounts in order to receive 
their pensions. In 2015, pension distribution shifted to 
post offices, a change that was preceded by a major 
increase in the amount of the pension from Rs.200 to 
Rs.1,000 in the previous year, following the election of 
a new government.54 However, the 2   percent commis-
sion charged by the postal department was considered 
too high by the state government. Within six months 
of initiating the change, the government shifted back 
to direct benefit transfers to Aadhaar- linked bank 
accounts (DBT), resulting in uncertainty and disrup-
tion of the system. The intention was to enable pen-
sions to be withdrawn close to home through mobile 
business correspondents (BCs). But the negotiated fee 
structure, a commission of only 0.2   percent, left BCs 
inadequately incentivized to serve pensioners. Limits 
on the float that any BC was able to take out at one time 
severely  limited the number of pension payments that 
could be made before the need for a long trip back to 
the bank to replenish the float. This resulted in incon-
ve nience, especially to the el derly and infirm, who 
would need to visit sometimes- distant bank branches 
to cash out.
One option could have been to renegotiate the com-
mission to the BCs to a level that would have provided 
adequate incentives. But in January 2018, the govern-
ment made a further, and most recent, change: it 
reverted back to the earliest system of direct pension 
distribution from panchayat offices, but this time 
requiring Aadhaar authentication at the point of pen-
sion delivery, using technology to verify physical cash

systems, and to assert their interests in the interim.
Pensions in Andhra Pradesh
Noncontributory social pensions are an impor tant ele-
ment of social protection systems in many countries, 
often with the objective of reducing poverty in old age 
and providing a social protection floor for the most 
vulnerable sections of the population, especially 
 widows and the physically challenged (Barrientos, 
2009). In low- income countries,  these payments have 
traditionally been delivered in physical cash to benefi-
ciaries listed  under the program,  either at their door-
step or at a local government office. Payments  were 
often delayed or not paid in full, causing hardship to a 
particularly vulnerable section of the population.
Over time, lack of strong verification and authentica-
tion mechanisms has meant that beneficiary lists have 
come to include duplicates and non ex is tent persons, 
providing opportunities for corrupt practices and 
siphoning off public funds from social pension pro-
grams.53 With greater use of unique digital identifica-
tion and digital payments, many programs have been 
moving  towards direct transfer of pensions to bank 
accounts on the basis of verified beneficiary lists and 
authenticated transactions.
India’s social pension system provides a monthly sub-
sistence payment to persons who qualify for old age, 
 widow, or disability benefits per the norms of the 
National Social Assistance Program. State governments 
can supplement the base amount provided by the 
national program and can determine the mode of 
delivery. Compared to other states, Andhra Pradesh 
maintains a generous social pension system, with the 
state government providing additional funds from 
its own bud get. It offers another in ter est ing case of 
experiments with dif fer ent delivery mechanisms: 
53. The government of India claims to have eliminated nearly half a million 
duplicate, non ex is tent, and ineligible pension beneficiaries following the 
introduction of direct benefit transfers. See https:// dbtbharat . gov  . in / page

—+1complaints, innovations discussed in Chapter 6 in the 
context of real- time digital governance. A portability 
option had been introduced, enabling pensioners to 
be paid at any panchayat office in the state, but few 
seemed to be aware of it.
The reversion to direct payment appears to run 
 counter to the India- wide trend  towards payment 
through bank accounts. In this case, it appears that the 
banking channel was not working as effectively as 
expected; not all villages  were served by BCs, and the 
low pension delivery fee negotiated between the state 
and the banks provided insufficient incentive for them 
to effect last- mile delivery to pensioners. In addition, 
if biometric authentication failed—an event more 
likely for the el derly, who have greater difficulties in 
providing high- quality fingerprints— the VRO would 
be on hand at the panchayat office as a mandated 
backup to authenticate on behalf of the pensioner.
Andhra Pradesh’s experience provides a useful reminder 
that digital reforms benefit from being flexible and 
adaptable depending on the context and beneficiary 
experience with the new systems. This can be achieved 
by building effective monitoring and feedback into the distribution. To minimize the risk of exclusion, local- 
level village revenue officers (VROs)  were authorized 
to authenticate on behalf of beneficiaries unable to do 
so themselves.
Aadil et al. (2019) conducted a survey of pensioners in 
Krishna district to ascertain their perceptions and 
experience with dif fer ent delivery modalities. Respon-
dents expressed strong preferences for the panchayat 
system. Eighty- six  percent preferred it to the bank/BC 
delivery method. For  those who had experience of the 
post office system, the reaction was similar: 84   percent 
preferred the panchayat- based cash distribution. Pen-
sioners valued the predictability of disbursements and 
receiving the correct amount as the major  factors for 
preferring the new system. They noted that officials 
would also visit the homes of disabled pensioners to 
serve them.  There  were only a few complaints regard-
ing irregular panchayat office hours and the need to 
make multiple visits. Very few reported pension skim-
ming by officials or other corruption, practices that 
had been complained of  under the previous pre-  
Aadhaar manual system. The main reason for this 
improvement appears to be the systems set up to 
survey beneficiaries of social programs and elicit

+1—In Bangladesh, the country’s thriving mobile financial 
ser vices (MFS) sector has played a key role in support-
ing the government’s policy to transfer benefits digi-
tally instead of as physical cash payments. One of the 
most significant applications is the Primary Education 
Stipend Program (PESP). Started in 2001 in its pre sent 
form, the objective of the PESP is to increase educa-
tional participation— enrollment, attendance, per sis-
tence, and per for mance of primary school– age 
 children from poor families—in both urban and rural 
areas. The program provides a stipend of taka 100 
(US$1.20) per month per child to  mothers in need of 
financial support, conditional on their child’s school 
attendance.
Disbursement of the stipend has traditionally been in 
the form of physical cash distributed from a desig-
nated school in the vicinity of the beneficiary’s resi-
dence. Consistent with the priorities of the 2011 “Digital 
Bangladesh” strategy,55 in June  2017 the government 
moved to transfer the stipends for nearly 13 million 
 children enrolled in the program directly to mobile 
banking accounts for their nearly 10 million  mothers. 
Although the mobile money market leader was bKash, 
a subsidiary of BRAC bank, the government chose to 
use SureCash, a public- sector MFS com pany.56 How 
has this move from physical cash to digital affected 
beneficiaries? How do they perceive the new system 
vis- à- vis the previous one? What challenges do they 
face in accessing the stipends? Do  mothers have more 
control over the funds than before? Are they able to 
navigate the new digital environment, especially  those 
who do not own mobile phones and have  limited digi-
tal literacy themselves?
Gelb et  al. (2019) report on a field survey using both 
quantitative questionnaires and qualitative assess-
ments, with separate modules for school headmasters 
and  mothers whose  children are enrolled in the 
program. The conclusions are broadly positive. An

ing one of the largest state- owned banks.program design, including through increasing benefi-
ciary choice and voice.  These are areas where Andhra 
Pradesh has been a leader, as discussed in Chapter 6. 
Its experience also shows that incentives need to be 
adequate through the full delivery chain for this to be 
effective. Setting aside the desirability of leveraging 
government payments to encourage the buildout of 
multipurpose financial infrastructure, it is not clear 
that the incremental costs of direct payments through 
panchayat offices is less than the level of bank commis-
sions needed to incentivize pension delivery. As gov-
ernments seek to use technology to make social 
pension payments more efficient, attention to the eco-
nomics of last- mile delivery is critical, including access 
to banking correspondents or other ser vice points and 
the capacity of recipients to transact through new digi-
tal mechanisms.
Education scholarships via mobile money  
in Bangladesh
Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) continue to be an 
impor tant strategy to improve  human development 
outcomes in many developing countries. While some 
well- known CCTs, such as Bolsa Familia, have trans-
ferred funds through smartcards,  until recently many 
programs in poor countries have used physical cash as 
the main mode of payment, disbursed at schools or 
health centers  after verification of eligibility and certi-
fication of compliance with the conditionalities of the 
program. Physical cash payments place a significant 
administrative burden on frontline ser vice staff and 
can also open up opportunities for clientelism and 
corruption. They also risk allegations of financial 
impropriety, which may be difficult to disprove if false.
With the rapid spread of mobile phones across the 
developing world, governments are increasingly using 
mobile money to transfer CCTs. Since  women are des-
ignated as beneficiaries of many of the programs, this 
can also have positive spillovers for financial inclusion 
and reducing the gender disparity in access to mobile 
phones, as noted in Chapter 2.

—+1cash- outs of mobile money normally incur fees. The 
government is working  towards a choice architecture 
to enable recipients to choose their payment ser vice 
provider; this  will require resolving the tension 
between providing incentives for agents while not 
burdening poor beneficiaries with delivery charges 
(Chapter 3).
The survey confirms the importance of digital literacy. 
 Mothers with the ability to read and write SMS have 
significantly better opinions of the new system than 
 those unable to do so; they prob ably have more confi-
dence that the payments are correct  because they are 
able to check on them (Figure 5.2).57  Mothers who do 
not own a mobile phone themselves are also more 
likely to say the new system is worse. Owner ship of a 
mobile phone is related to having more control over 
the stipend transfer: two- thirds of  mothers who own 
mobiles reported having greater control over the sti-
pend, compared to 57   percent of  those who do not. As 
in the case of Pakistan, though apparently to a less sig-
nificant degree, having male  family members control 
access to the benefits reduces the ability of the  mothers 
to operate with autonomy. This points to the challenge 
of inclusivity, both in access to mobile technology and 
in the use of digital mechanisms.
57 . The relationship is statistically significant at the 95   percent confidence 
level using a Fisher’s exact test. Other digital applications, such as interactive 
voice technologies, could possibly help to bridge the capacity gap.overwhelming majority of both  mothers and head-
masters prefer the new system. For  mothers, greater 
con ve nience in access to funds and more control over 
them are the main reasons for their stated preference, 
with the major  factor being the flexibility to withdraw 
money at a con ve nient time and location, rather than 
having to travel to a school on a specified day and wait 
in line to be paid. Rural  mothers are more likely than 
urban  mothers to say the new system is better.
The program has had a substantial impact on financial 
inclusion, at least in terms of owner ship of mobile 
money accounts. Only 31   percent of the  mothers had 
any other mobile money account. Views are mixed on 
the se lection of ser vice provider; just over half of the 
 mothers who had a bKash account would prefer to 
receive the stipend in their existing account, but the 
 others are happy using SureCash. The use of SureCash 
as the sole distribution channel might impose some 
additional incon ve nience from the perspective of 
wider use of financial systems. bKash and SureCash 
are not interoperable, and the former has far wider 
ac cep tance among the general population. However, 
virtually none of the recipients has graduated to  doing 
more with their mobile accounts than cashing out the 
grant; over 90   percent cash out all the stipend they 
receive. This suggests that  limited interoperability is 
not at the level where it is an overwhelming  factor in 
preference for the new system. Perhaps more impor-
tant for the beneficiaries is that they do not pay any 
cash- out fee for using their special accounts, whereas a positive

+1—average of 20.4   percent of the population, compared 
to 7 and 3.1   percent, respectively, for unconditional 
and conditional cash transfers, and 2.3   percent for 
social pensions. Taken together, food assistance pro-
grams reach nearly 1.5 billion  people worldwide 
(Alderman et al., 2017).
As explained in Chapter  1,  there is a large lit er a ture 
that compares cash transfer programs with food sup-
port programs,  whether through vouchers or in- kind 
provision. The aim  here is not to come to a conclusion; 
it is, rather, to consider how digital ID, mobiles, and 
payments can increase the capacity of governments to 
implement in- kind ser vice and benefit programs. This 
area has been less intensively studied than cash trans-
fers, but, used appropriately, the same technologies 
can help to tackle leakage and corruption in in- kind 
programs by digitizing beneficiary databases and sup-
ply chains and authenticating delivery. Beneficiaries 
can be empowered to choose their ser vice providers 
and to offer feedback through digitally enabled griev-
ance redressal systems. However,  these gains are not 
automatic; they depend on the way in which the 
reforms are implemented as well as their objectives.
 These princi ples can be applied to a range of in- kind 
ser vices. One example is the work of Simprints in Ban-
gladesh to track and confirm the delivery of maternal 
health ser vices by community health workers (Storis-
teanu, Norman, Grigore, and Norman, 2015). Without 
such a monitoring mechanism it is difficult to know 
 whether ser vices have actually been rendered to the 
intended beneficiary or, indeed,  whether the health 
worker has had contact with her. It is also difficult to 
provide continuity of care and to match up visits to 
patients with the treatment priorities indicated by 
health rec ords.
With differing reforms of its food ration system across 
several states, India provides a laboratory for address-
ing the use of digital mechanisms for in- kind pro-
grams. India’s public distribution system (PDS) has 
been in place for over half a  century and reaches nearly 
800 million beneficiaries— two- thirds of the country’s For headmasters, digital transfers reduce the staff time 
spent on administration of physical cash distribution; 
they also reduce the risk of allegations of financial mis-
management that might be levied against them, even if 
no impropriety has occurred. Their views are there-
fore very favorable.  There  were drawbacks: 28   percent 
noted receiving complaints when  there  were prob lems 
with the payments, and one in five mentioned difficul-
ties correcting  mistakes. Nevertheless,  there was over-
whelming consensus that more transfers should be 
done through mobile payments. This appeared to 
reflect more their own experience than strong views 
on the impact on  mothers and students; only a third 
held the view that the new system increased  children’s 
attendance.
To summarize, the digitization of PESP payments has 
been a win- win for both  mothers and headmasters. 
For the  mothers, it is more con ve nient to withdraw 
cash through agents whenever they choose to do so. 
 There have been gains in closing the financial inclu-
sion gender gap, at least in terms of expanding access 
to accounts; over time, this opens up the possibility 
that the  mothers  will use more financial ser vices in the 
 future. This is a long haul but would be facilitated by 
choice of payment ser vice provider and interoperabil-
ity between mobile money providers and the banking 
system. The main constraint to still more beneficial 
impact appears to be uneven access to digital devices 
and the capacity to operate them. Bangladesh, like other 
poor countries,  will need to grapple with this prob lem 
as it seeks to move its administration of G2P transfers, 
and programs more generally, into the digital era.
Reforming in- kind transfers through 
technology: The case of PDS in India
While cash transfer programs have undoubtedly 
become more impor tant for social protection systems, 
in- kind and voucher- based food assistance is still an 
impor tant modality in low-  and middle- income coun-
tries. Based on administrative data from 108 countries, 
the World Bank estimates that  these programs cover an

—+1management, and the use of Aadhaar authentication. 
 There have also been a number of pi lots to reform the 
system, moving away from in- kind provision  towards 
cash transfers or vouchers, with varying results.58
Post- NFSA, states had differing motivations for digiti-
zation. One was to create a clean beneficiary list by 
removing duplicate ration cards and fake and non ex is-
tent entries through Aadhaar seeding. Second, due to 
the fiscal constraint imposed by the center, many 
states had to reduce the number of  house holds that 
 were eligible  under the  earlier system. House holds 
that  were deemed eligible had to list each member of 
the  family in order to obtain the individual- based enti-
tlement— a pro  cess that also involved linking their Aad-
haar numbers to the  family ration card. Third, several 
states have engaged digital technology to improve the 
program in other ways, to reform supply chains, to 
deploy Aadhaar authentication at the point of ser vice, 
aiming to reduce losses due to leakage from the fair 
price shops, and to empower beneficiaries through 
enabling portability and soliciting feedback. Three 
states have been studied in some detail: Jharkhand, 
Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh.59 To better under-
stand the effects of digital technology, we compare 
their experiences.
Jharkhand
PDS in Jharkhand has been notorious for its ineffi-
ciency and corruption. According to some estimates, 
in 2004–2005, almost 85   percent of food grains  were 
siphoned off before reaching the FPS (Drèze and 
Khera, 2015). Inspired by PDS reforms in the neighbor-
ing state of Chattisgarh (Alderman et  al., 2017), from 
58. For a review of several cases, including a more detailed assessment of the 
pi lot to replace food price subsidies with cash transfers in Nagri, Jharkhand, 
see Giri, Rautela, Sharma, and Sampath (2019). That pi lot faced a number of 
difficulties: beneficiaries faced high transaction costs to access their subsi-
dies; dealers, too, found the new system more demanding. The pi lot was ter-
minated following the assessment.
59. The 2019 State of Aadhaar report provides a broad survey- based perspec-
tive on Aadhaar and its use. It found that 95   percent of adults had Aadhaar, 
92  percent expressed satisfaction with it, and 80   percent felt that it had 
improved the reliability of access to food rations, social pensions, or work- 
based social payments. Updating personal information and correcting errors 
emerged as the main difficulties (Totapally et al., 2019).population and over half of the global coverage of food 
programs. As with other social protection schemes, 
PDS has under gone periodic reform, most recently 
with three major changes: (a) the enactment of the 
National Food Security Act (NFSA) in 2013, followed by 
(b) the digitization of ration cards and (c) the move to 
distribute food entitlements through biometric 
authentication at the distribution points in states that 
decide to do so.
The impact of the three initiatives has been significant. 
PDS has traditionally been a family-  based entitlement, 
but the NFSA changed the modality to an individual- 
based system. To comply with the NFSA provisions, 
erstwhile below poverty line (BPL), above poverty line 
(APL), and Antodyaya Anna Yojana (AAY, the most des-
titute) families had to be reclassified into priority 
 house holds (PHH) and non- PHH categories, with AAY 
 house holds automatically included in the revised list 
of beneficiaries. Only PHH and AAY  house holds are 
eligible for assistance in terms of the  legal entitlement 
specified  under the Act. The central government pro-
vides funds to finance the cost of the food subsidy, with 
state- level coverage limits set at 75 and 50   percent of 
the rural and urban population, respectively. States 
that decide to cover a greater share of the population 
can top up the cost of PDS provision using their own 
bud getary resources.
This reclassification exercise coincided with the latter 
two initiatives. Digitization of ration cards and “seed-
ing” of Aadhaar numbers into the beneficiary lists have 
been carried out in almost all states. Some use Aadhaar 
authentication only, equipping FPS with biometric fin-
gerprint readers and drawing up protocols for the 
management of cases where authentication fails so 
that beneficiaries are not denied their  legal entitle-
ment.  Others use an electronic point- of- sale machine 
(ePOS) without Aadhaar or continue with the old man-
ual system of distribution, but on the basis of digitized 
ration cards. Within the overall policy and financing 
framework determined by the center, states in India 
therefore have considerable flexibility in PDS delivery, 
especially with regard to coverage, supply chain

+1—who could provide alternative authentication options. 
This prob lem was particularly acute for the el derly and 
the physically challenged. Despite directives from the 
central government that technology failure should not 
lead to denial of benefits,  there was  little evidence of 
the use of backup alternatives, such as iris and mobile 
OTP when fingerprint- based Aadhaar authentication 
failed. The estimated exclusion rate was five times 
higher for  those FPS using online authentication com-
pared to the “offline” system where beneficiaries  were 
allowed to access their food rations without it.62
As mentioned above, leakage of food grains from FPS 
has been a major source of corruption. Since  there is 
always some slack between total beneficiaries and 
 those who actually take rations, almost  every FPS 
would have unclaimed stocks left over at the end of the 
month that could be sold off in the open market. Accu-
rate knowledge of sales to beneficiaries from Aadhaar 
authentication rec ords enables stocks and flows to be 
reconciled, so that deliveries replenish stocks only as 
much as needed. In August  2017 , the Jharkhand gov-
ernment de cided to initiate “stock reconciliation” by 
deducting the closing balances it had estimated the 
dealers had accumulated out of their allocations in the 
months following the introduction of ePOS machines. 
Data suggested that the diversion had, indeed, been 
large; indeed, the cumulative balances estimated over 
several months  were so large that they amounted to 
almost an entire monthly allocation. However, more 
often than not,  these  were notional balances. The 
 actual stocks had long been sold off in the market.
The abrupt introduction of the stock reconciliation 
policy— based on the contradictory premise that sup-
plies known to have been diverted  were actually 
available— therefore provoked a crisis. With a sudden 
cut in deliveries, dealers could only distribute a fraction 
of the entitlement to beneficiaries. In the worst- case sce -
narios, they excluded them completely. Unrealistic 
implementation of the policy therefore dealt a serious 
62.  Under the offline system, transactions are recorded on the ePOS 
machines along with Aadhaar numbers. Beneficiaries get an electronic 
receipt and data uploaded when network connection is available.the mid-2000s, successive governments in Jharkhand 
undertook mea sures to improve the functioning of PDS, 
which provided food security to over 80   percent of the 
rural population of one of the poorest states in India.
The most recent phase of the reform, following the 
implementation of NFSA in 2014, tried to tackle both 
the demand-  and supply- side prob lems with a heavy 
focus on saving public resources. On the demand side, 
Jharkhand rolled out digitized ration cards and intro-
duced electronic point- of- sale machines at FPS to dis-
tribute food grains to beneficiaries on the basis of 
Aadhaar authentication. On the supply side, it intro-
duced a system of stock reconciliation at the FPS level 
to reduce leakage of food grains at distribution points, 
on the assumption that the technology- based moni-
toring system would improve the overall efficiency of 
PDS in the state. Unlike the reforms in Rajasthan and 
Andhra Pradesh (below),  there was no move to widen 
the low dealer margins to compensate for the antici-
pated effect of tightened controls on the ability to 
divert rations to the market.
In de pen dent research did not find evidence of any sig-
nificant improvement in the efficiency of PDS follow-
ing the digital reforms (Drèze, Gupta, Khera, and 
Pimenta, 2018).60 Digitization of ration cards did not 
seem to find much redundancy in beneficiary rolls— 
they seem to have already been cleaned.  There was also 
no significant impact on diversion by dealers—as 
before, beneficiaries received around 10   percent less 
than their allocation and did not have the bargaining 
power to prevent dealers from diverting rations in the 
absence of an effective grievance redressal system.
At the same time, the studies highlight an increase in 
exclusion due to authentication prob lems. Connectiv-
ity is a challenge, especially in the remote, forested 
areas of the state. Smaller  house holds (often also the 
poorest) did not have enough POS- able members61 
60. In a forthcoming study, Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar also 
investigate the Jharkhand case, having summarized their main findings in 
2018 in Muralidharan et al. (2018b).
61. No POS- able member available refers to when no member whose biomet-
rics usually works on an ePOS machine is available to collect the ration.

—+1issues a  family card that lists individual members along 
with their Aadhaar numbers. It also captures other 
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics dur-
ing the registration pro  cess, thereby creating a com-
prehensive database for residents of Rajasthan, 
following the princi ple of “one  family, one identity.” 
 Women are designated as the heads of  house holds for 
benefit purposes, with financial transfers directed to 
their Aadhaar- linked bank accounts— a symbolically 
impor tant step for a famously patriarchal state.
From a state- level survey and focus group discus-
sions, most  house holds found enrollment into 
Bhamashah relatively easy (Gelb et al., 2018). But digi-
tization errors, mostly in the form of manual data 
entry errors during enrollment, caused difficulties 
for many existing beneficiaries. Moreover, the digiti-
zation pro  cess interacted with the shift  towards 
applying the NFSA, which sowed confusion and anxi-
ety. Starting in 2012, local workers and officials had 
assisted the government in digitizing ration cards; in 
the pro  cess, the number of eligible BPL beneficiaries 
had reached 53 million compared to the NFSA limit of 
44.6 million. The government then conducted a 
large- scale verification exercise in parallel with the 
Bhamashah registration pro  cess and eliminated 
approximately 9 million  house holds. The combina-
tion of errors and the influence of local politics dur-
ing the verification pro  cess prob ably resulted in 
significant exclusion of legitimate beneficiaries, or at 
least of  people who believed themselves to be eligible 
for programs.
On the delivery side, as in Jharkhand, the new system 
requires beneficiaries to biometrically authenticate 
themselves at the FPS and directly interact with the 
new technology- enabled framework. In contrast to 
Jharkhand, dealer margins  were increased several- 
fold to roughly 5   percent of the market prices of the 
ration products from their previously very low levels, 
to compensate for the smaller degree of diversion 
expected from the new system. Without this increase, 
many dealers would have ceased to be in the business 
of distributing rations.blow to the per for mance of the Aadhaar- based system. 
It was quickly abandoned without having had any sig-
nificant impact on fiscal savings.
As a result, both studies found significant opposition 
to the adoption of biometric authentication. Even 
before the confusion over stock reconciliation, over 
half of the beneficiaries surveyed by the two studies 
had responded that the new system was less con ve-
nient than the previous one and that it should be dis-
continued.63 The same view was echoed by the FPS 
dealers— a majority of  those surveyed felt that the 
ePOS system had made their jobs more difficult and 
had worse outcomes for the beneficiaries at the same 
time.
The Jharkhand experience shows that without a clear 
vision, appropriate design, proper implementation, 
and realistic baseline assumptions, technology itself is 
not a panacea. Improving efficiency and beneficiary 
experience requires identifying relevant prob lems, 
addressing them carefully, and continuous effort to 
make the system work better. It also shows that without 
a focus on improving beneficiary experience and imple-
mentation, more rigorous authentication requirements 
and reliance on connectivity can lead to additional bar-
riers to ser vice delivery. This is an impor tant lesson for 
other cases, especially when compared with Andhra 
Pradesh, where we find evidence of both better benefi-
ciary experience and fiscal savings (see below).
Rajasthan
PDS reform in Rajasthan is one component of the over-
all digitization and reform of the social protection 
delivery system known as the Bhamashah program. As 
far as we know, it is the first nuclear  family– level iden-
tity system in India, conceptualized by the Rajasthan 
government in 2008 and rolled out at scale from 2014 
onwards. The Bhamashah scheme registers each 
nuclear  family with a unique  family ID number and 
63. The figures are 55   percent against the new system in Muralidharan et al. 
(2018b) and 64  percent against it in Drèze et al. (2018).

+1—(as further discussed below), this suggests a good deal 
of support for digital governance more broadly.
The most impor tant determinant of negative percep-
tion appears to relate to the beneficiaries’ experience 
with the biometric authentication pro  cess. Responses 
suggest that barely a quarter of the beneficiaries are 
authenticated on the first attempt, although 96   percent 
said that they  were usually authenticated in four 
attempts or less. The option to use a mobile OTP does 
not seem to have been used frequently; however, not 
one of the four respondents who cited the use of the 
OTP rated the new system as worse.
In response to the question of what happens if authen-
tication fails, 82 out of 535 respondents stated that they 
would be “denied rations.” However,  there is no rela-
tionship between “denied” and the number of finger-
print authentications needed; many answered “denied” 
even when they said that authentication works  after 
one or two attempts. This suggests that some answered 
the question as a hy po thet i cal “what if.” Some who cite 
“denied” also consider that the new system is better 
than the old one, and many consider it neither worse 
nor better. Respondents could check several responses 
in addition to “denied,” such as “bring another  family 
member” or “come back another day,” suggesting that Evidence from two field surveys suggests that the 
introduction of technology has improved the percep-
tion and experience of the majority of beneficiaries 
vis- à- vis their access to PDS entitlements, but that 
exclusion remains a challenge. Gelb et  al. (2018) find 
that just over 40   percent of PDS beneficiaries prefer 
the new system to the old one, 12   percent find it worse, 
with the rest not expressing a preference  either way. 
Figure 5.3 lays out the reasons cited by respondents for 
preferring the new PDS system.  These findings are cor-
roborated by the State of Aadhaar report (Abraham 
et al., 2018), which found that two- thirds of rural PDS 
beneficiaries in Rajasthan supported the use of Aad-
haar authentication, thereby expressing strong prefer-
ence for the digital reforms.
Why do they express  these views? In both studies, 
almost all of  those who preferred the new system cited 
increased agency— that  under the new system no one 
was able to take their rations. This does not, of course, 
prove that rations  were actually diverted  under the old 
system (the studies did not actually mea sure changes 
in how much they received), but it indicates concern 
that  under the previous system some part was not 
reaching the entitled beneficiaries. The second most 
frequent reason cited was satisfaction with using new 
technology. Despite frustrations with the new system No one takes my ration on my behalf

—+1offered almost universal access to food rations to its 
residents irrespective of their economic status, and 
this policy has continued through the period of digital 
reforms. In contrast to Jharkhand and perhaps also to 
Rajasthan (as seen in the response to the introduction 
of the NFSA), the prime driver for Andhra’s reforms 
has not been to save money by cutting welfare rolls. It 
has, rather, been to improve the efficiency of the sys-
tem, and to derive savings from  doing so. In order to 
accomplish this, Andhra’s digital reforms have con-
formed to a set of princi ples:
Full coverage: Aadhaar is held by virtually all resi-
dents and integrated into all public programs, 
effectively making it mandatory to receive any 
kind of ser vices, subsidies, and transfers.
User choice via portability: Beneficiaries can collect 
their food rations from any ser vice point in the 
state; the objectives are to enable them to shift 
 towards better ser vice providers and to facilitate 
mobility. This would not be pos si ble without stock- 
flow reconciliation as it would open up a gaping 
hole for dealers to divert delivered rations to the 
market. Accurate deliveries from ware houses to 
ser vice points are essential for reconciliation to be 
effective; to achieve this, Aadhaar verification of 
grain deliveries has been introduced throughout 
the PDS supply chain.
Accountability for ser vice access: This includes the use 
of iris scanners as a backup and clearly mandating 
the village revenue officer to authenticate as a 
 human backup on behalf of beneficiaries if tech-
nology fails.64
User voice through real- time feedback: Real- time 
administrative data on ser vice delivery, including 
the details of all transactions, is complemented by 
a feedback mechanism to identify prob lems 
through timely beneficiary surveys. As further dis-
cussed in Chapter  6,  these efforts have evolved 
64. This introduces a degree of administrative discretion which Andhra is 
trying to further limit through the use of face recognition for the few cases 
unable to be authenticated through fingerprints or iris scans.“denied” may, in some cases, have been interpreted as a 
temporary delay in obtaining rations. Nevertheless, 
 there is a clear and significant relationship between 
“denied” and the view that the new system is worse, 
suggesting that the response does indeed, at the very 
least, reflect a negative experience for many.
Results from the State of Aadhaar report point to similar 
conclusions. They estimate a monthly exclusion rate of 
9.9   percent, of which 2.2 percentage points  were due 
to Aadhaar- related reasons (authentication failures, 
prob lems with Aadhaar seeding,  etc.). This suggests 
that the predominant reason for exclusion is nonavail-
ability of the ration, a legacy prob lem that needs to be 
addressed separately. Nevertheless,  there does appear 
to be some evidence of technology- based exclusion. 
The Rajasthan example is a case where digital reforms 
have, in general, improved control and agency as per-
ceived by most beneficiaries, but  there is still an issue 
of ensuring accountability for ser vice, including by 
implementing rapid exception- management proto-
cols when technology fails.
Andhra Pradesh— Krishna District
The state of Andhra Pradesh is recognized as a leader in 
using technology to improve the delivery of public ser-
vices, programs, and subsidies. Many of its innovations 
 were pi loted in Krishna district, which has been visited 
by development agencies and del e ga tions from many 
countries. Aadil et al. (2019) report on a field survey of 
 house holds and FPS representatives at the district level 
to ascertain the perception and experience of digital 
reforms in PDS for both beneficiaries and ser vice pro-
viders. This case provides an insight into the function-
ing of digital reforms in a district at the frontier of 
administrative and technological capacity, with les-
sons for other states in India and globally.
Compared to most other states in India, Andhra 
Pradesh maintains a generous social protection system 
with significant bud getary allocations to augment 
transfers from the central government. PDS is a case in 
point— although a comparatively rich state, it has

+1—most dependent on the system for food tend to rate the 
digital PDS a  little less favorably, but no subgroup 
majority considers the new system as worse.
In sharp contrast to Jharkhand and Rajasthan, the 
backup systems for managing technology failures 
appear to be working. Two  percent of respondents 
reported being denied rations at some point due to 
biometric authentication failure.  These results may 
appear a  little higher than  those in the 2018 State of 
Aadhaar report, which reports average monthly exclu-
sion from PDS in Andhra Pradesh at 1.1   percent, of 
which 0.8  percentage points are due to Aadhaar- 
related reasons only. However, follow-up questions 
ascertained that almost all of  these cases saw their 
prob lem resolved speedily, mostly through the actions 
of the VRO. Exclusion did not emerge as an issue  either 
in focus group discussions, and  these flagged several 
other policies to limit exclusion, including allowing 
infirm beneficiaries to nominate someone to pick up 
rations on their behalf or the delivery of food grains at 
their doorstep. Assigning clear accountability for 
delivery to local officials, together with the beneficiary into a real- time governance system (RTGS) that 
aims to track all digital transactions in real time.
In the survey results of Aadil et al. (2019), 70   percent of 
beneficiaries responded that the new system was better 
than the previous one, while 28   percent viewed it as 
worse; in contrast to Rajasthan, very few respondents 
 were indifferent between the two systems. Both groups 
cited the elimination of diversion of rations and the 
timeliness of delivery as gains, with some noting 
improvements in the weighing system due to the intro-
duction of electronic scales linked to transactions. Fig-
ure  5.4 shows the perceived improvements and 
prob lems with the new digital systems by  whether 
respondents thought the new systems are better or 
worse overall. Beneficiaries are clearheaded about the 
trade- offs of the new system, pointing out a similar set 
of benefits and faults regardless of their overall percep-
tion. As in Rajasthan, the main  factor driving views of 
“worse” was difficulties experienced with the biometric 
authentication system,  either mismatches or connec-
tivity prob lems. Preferences do not differ appreciably 
across gender, age, and other characteristics.  Those Rations don’t

—+1fiscal savings, at least in the case of PDS. The available 
evidence points to some areas of continuing difficul-
ties; remote biometric authentication is still uneven, a 
concern considering the sustained efforts that Krishna 
and Andhra Pradesh have made to improve connectiv-
ity and per for mance in this area. Not all aspects of 
Andhra Pradesh’s reforms may be easily replicable by 
other jurisdictions; as further discussed in Chapter 6, 
it embarked on its digital reforms from a relatively 
favorable position in terms of institutions and capac-
ity. However, it does appear to offer a good example 
of a technology- savvy government using high- level 
goals to drive the application of digital technology to 
improve ser vice delivery.
Transfers to promote financial 
inclusion and  women’s 
empowerment
An emerging body of evidence indicates that designat-
ing  women as beneficiaries of financial transfers 
enhances their bargaining power within  house holds, 
ultimately resulting in better outcomes for both for 
them and their families (Almås, Armand, Attanasio, 
and Carneiro, 2015; Cheema et  al., 2016; Skoufias, 
Unar, and de Cassio, 2013). Decision making within 
 house holds is not unitary— men and  women have 
dif fer ent preferences  shaped by both control over 
resources and social norms (Attanasio and Lechene, 
2014). Transfers that are targeted  towards  women rep-
resent access to resources and a degree of agency over 
them, instruments to enhance empowerment, with 
the hope that over time this  will help change social 
norms that restrict  women’s economic opportunities 
standing in the society more generally.
 There is also emerging evidence that the use of digital 
mechanisms to deliver the transfers can increase 
 women’s agency. In a randomized controlled trial in 
Madhya Pradesh, India (Field et  al., 2016),  women’s 
wages from the National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Scheme  were deposited directly into a subject group of 
workers’ individual bank accounts instead of into  those feedback mechanisms discussed in Chapter 6, appears 
to have been working to ensure that technology failure 
did not lead to denial of rations.
On the supply side, virtually all dealers endorsed the 
digitized supply- chain reforms  because they now 
received the correct amounts of grain.65 Even though 
their margins had been increased several- fold, many 
considered that the reforms had reduced their 
incomes. Portability was strongly endorsed by both 
beneficiaries and dealers; 12   percent of beneficiaries 
had taken advantage of it,  either to get better ser vice or 
for geographic flexibility, while most dealers had 
served customers from outside their mandals. Most 
dealers cited the possibility of attracting more custom-
ers  because  these now had the option of collecting 
their rations from any FPS, not just the one near their 
place of residence.
Based on official data on PDS beneficiaries and stock 
management, digitization appears to have led to sub-
stantial fiscal savings. Even while maintaining gener-
ous access to the PDS system, seeding rolls with 
Aadhaar resulted in the elimination of duplicates and 
ghosts. Gains also came through stock- flow reconcilia-
tion, which prevents dealers from diverting unclaimed 
rations. Together, and  after allowing for the increase in 
dealer margins to compensate them for reduced 
opportunity to gain from diversion, the digital reforms 
are estimated to have saved about 33   percent of the 
cost of the program. The cost of the devices required to 
digitize the PDS system, including the supply chain, 
would be covered by about two months of  these savings. 
This does not cover all costs of setting up and operating 
the new approach (and some components, such as the 
call center, ser vice many programs), but the compari-
son suggests that overall savings are considerable.
The overall picture that emerges from this case is 
highly favorable. Digital technology has provided some 
impor tant benefits, in terms of both efficiency and 
inclusion. It also appears to have led to substantial 
65. Andhra Pradesh, as elsewhere, saw some turnover of dealers with the 
introduction of the new system; some exited, while  others  were recruited.

terms of financial inclusion, but many depended on a 
male relative with a mobile phone to access education 
supplements for their  children. The Bhamashah pro-
gram also spurred a major step  towards financial inclu-
sion for  women; nearly two- thirds of the surveyed 
 women heads of  house holds (Gelb et  al., 2018) had 
opened a new account in response to the government 
policy. By the time of the survey, many had started to 
transact on their accounts by withdrawing funds, 
although they  were often accompanied by a male  family 
member due to transport difficulties or  because they 
 were not sufficiently literate to undertake financial 
transactions on their own. As in Bangladesh, digital lit-
eracy was a serious constraint: 80   percent of  women 
heads of  house holds could not read or write text mes-
sages or even make a call using mobile phones, which 
 were still overwhelmingly seen as the province of men.66
Moving from government transfers to private digital 
payments, few of the  women in  these programs had 
made the progression  towards transacting on their 
financial accounts beyond receiving transfers and 
cashing them out. Evidence from  Kenya suggests the 
potential of further steps  towards deepening the use of 
financial accounts (Chapter 3).  Kenya has been at the 
forefront of the digital financial inclusion revolution, 
with 82   percent of adults reportedly owning a financial 
account. This has largely been driven by the success of 
M- PESA, which provides one of the most extensive 
mobile money platforms anywhere in the world. Its 
impact has been significant, especially for  women. 
Suri and Jack (2016) estimate that access to M- PESA, 
including its extensive agent network, which has 
greatly increased access to ser vice points, reduced 
extreme poverty in  Kenya, lifting an estimated 194,000 
 house holds (2   percent of  Kenyan  house holds) above 
the extreme poverty threshold.  These impacts are 
driven by improvements in financial resilience and 
increased savings and are significantly larger for 
66. In the analy sis in Chapter 2, access to mobile phones was one of the more 
impor tant endowment- related  factors associated with the male– female 
financial inclusion gap.of their husbands, with a subsample also receiving 
basic training on how to operate their accounts. One 
year  later, the  women who received direct deposits 
into their own accounts plus account training had 
increased their participation in both the public-  and 
private- sector  labor markets despite  there having been 
no change in market wages. Directing payments into 
women- held accounts improved incentives for them 
to participate in the NREGS workfare program. This, in 
turn, affected social norms concerning  women’s work 
more broadly, promising to unlock the economic 
potential of  women beyond the NREGS program itself.

structure, the rapid spread of mobile money with 
extensive agent networks reaching into many rural 
areas has increased access to cash- out points, provid-
ing governments with a new channel to disburse funds 
to  women. A study in Niger on transfers to  house holds 
as part of a drought relief effort (Aker et  al., 2016) 
showed that switching from physical cash transfers to 
digital transfers led to increases in mea sures of 
 women’s empowerment, including more discussion 
within the  house hold on how they would be spent, and 
ultimately to higher diversity in diets and more meals 
consumed by  children. Program recipients, all of 
whom  were  women, reported that the mobile transfer 
was less observable to other  house hold members than 
physical cash. The study also found that the mobile 
money recipients  were more likely to obtain the trans-
fer on their own, to travel to weekly markets, and to be 
involved in selling  house hold grains than their physi-
cal cash counter parts. The results, taken together, sug-
gest that the mobile transfer technology had prob ably 
increased  women’s bargaining power within the 
 house hold while improving nutritional outcomes.
While  these initiatives have increased  women’s agency 
and control over resources, unequal capabilities and 
access to mobile technology, as well as social norms, still 
dictate  whether and how poor  women are able to nego-
tiate the new tools and navigate the digital ecosystem.

how technology has been used and with what results.
In considering this, it is particularly impor tant to take 
into account the experience of beneficiaries, especially 
the poorest and most disadvantaged. Mea sures of 
administrative efficiency and fiscal savings are also 
useful, but single- minded emphasis on this area risks 
an imbalance in the application of digital technology 
that can result in more, rather than less, exclusion and 
deterioration of ser vice quality.
On financial transfers, the cases involve a variety of 
transfer modalities. They are generally favorable, with 
some offering evidence of multifaceted gains.  These 
can be in the form of beneficiary experience (AP 
smartcards and pensions, Bangladesh education sup-
plements, Pakistan BISP payments), less leakage (AP 
smartcards), or lower administrative costs and less risk 
for providers that they  will wrongfully be accused of 
corruption (Bangladesh). One impor tant issue, flagged 
especially in the case of pensions in Andhra Pradesh, is 
the importance of ensuring adequate last- mile incen-
tives to deliver benefits through the financial sector. 
Without this, beneficiaries may prefer to receive phys-
ical cash. Another impor tant point is the importance 
for beneficiaries of having at least a base level of liter-
acy and capacity to work with digital systems.
The cases also offer some insights into the trade- offs 
between using specific social protection delivery mech-
anisms versus general- purpose accounts that can be 
used more widely to increase digital and other financial 
payments across the economy. While both have similar 
benefits from a public financial management perspec-
tive, the latter are clearly desirable in princi ple and as a 
longer- run objective. However, the cases suggest that 
specific mechanisms may be needed in some cases and 
that the path from receiving social transfers by digital 
means  towards wider payments, savings, and credit  will 
be a long one for many beneficiaries.
Turning to in- kind programs, the results of introducing 
digital technology depend on both the design of reforms 
and their implementation.  Table  5.1 summarizes the female- headed  house holds. This could be for several 
reasons: M- PESA allows individuals more privacy in 
their financial transactions, which, in the case of 
 women, may have increased their control over funds 
sent directly to them from friends and  family. Having 
a mobile money account also makes it easier for 
 women to save as well as to shift from subsistence to 
income- generating activity; they can receive payments 
from customers directly into their M- PESA accounts, 
increasing their control over their income and bar-
gaining power within the  family.
Fi nally, while we have focused  here on the roles that 
digital technologies can have in boosting  women’s 
empowerment, they are not the only marginalized 
group or identifying  factor facing extra challenges to 
financial inclusion. Applying an intersectional lens to 
this question reveals that other barriers can si mul ta-
neously impede uptake of the mediating technologies 
as well as dampen the positive impacts of them. For 
instance, ethnolinguistic minorities may find it diffi-
cult to navigate a majority- language payment plat-
form, while differently abled  people may be unable to 
access the ser vice entirely without assistance. Likewise, 
certain religious minorities may have fundamental 
objections to the use of digital technology (Malik, 
forthcoming 2020). Technology has a role to play in 
including  these groups, but  will require deliberate, 
human- centered design approaches to ensure  these 
groups are fully included.
Lessons from the cases
The cases covered in this section offer lessons in how 
the use of digital technology, particularly in the areas 
of ID, mobiles, and payments, can contribute  towards 
improving systems of social protection and increasing 
capacity to achieve several impor tant SDGs. As already 
stressed, the objective has not been to go deeply into 
policy debates on the optimal type of social protection 
system—on conditionality, and  whether assistance 
should be through financial transfers, vouchers, or in 
kind. It has, rather, been to look across a diverse set of 
587-84331_ch01_4P.indd   85 2/12/20   2:15 PMCitizens and States86

+1—technology is only a mechanism; its effect depends on 
the purposes to which it is applied and how it is applied; 
it does not in itself create the po liti cal drive to improve 
ser vice delivery. However, once engaged for this pur-
pose, it can improve the delivery of in- kind benefits in 
impor tant ways.
Fi nally, considering the cross- cutting goals of financial 
inclusion and  women’s empowerment, the cases indi-
cate both the potential of technology and its limita-
tions. Channeling benefits to  women and through 
financial payments mechanisms rather than physical 
cash can offer many advantages, including more con-
ve nience and privacy for beneficiaries, less corruption 
and diversion, and a more accountable delivery chain. 
 These benefits may be particularly valuable to  women, 
who appear to benefit more widely from their increased 
agency, including in the area of intra house hold deci-
sion making. At the same time,  there are limits to what 
can be achieved. Many beneficiaries lack access to 
mobile technology or the digital and financial literacy 
needed to transact on their accounts, so that comple-
mentary mea sures are needed in  these areas. Even with 
payments through general- purpose accounts, many 
beneficiaries  will be slow to transition from cashing out 
their benefits to deeper financial inclusion.
Intensive onboarding and continuing support, includ-
ing education and digital and financial literacy training, 
 will be necessary to unlock the potential of technology 
for marginalized groups. Without  these active interven-
tions, digital systems and payments may do  little to 
reduce existing vulnerabilities. In this area, accelerated 
use of the JAM trinity should be seen as one of several 
building blocks for social and economic pro gress.studies of food rations in three Indian states. In two of 
them, survey responses suggest that, on average, bene-
ficiaries’ experience has improved, with respondents 
citing more control over their entitlements and less 
ability of providers to divert their rations. In the third it 
deteriorated, with additional difficulties and costs of 
digital authentication for both beneficiaries and ser vice 
providers. In two of the three cases  there appears to 
have been at least some increase in exclusion as well as 
incon ve nience to some beneficiaries.  There  were also 
start-up prob lems, for example, in reconciling dif fer ent 
data sets in Rajasthan, which was not made easier by 
combining the digitization of beneficiary rolls— already 
a complex process— with aggressive efforts to cut the 
rolls to conform with the guidelines of national policy.
Several differences stand out when comparing the best-   
and worst- performing programs. Reforms in Andhra 
Pradesh set out to improve efficiency and ser vice rather 
than simply to save fiscal revenues; that they appear to 
have also achieved savings has been a by- product of 
efficiency improvements. Andhra’s reforms embodied 
several clear princi ples: access, clear accountability, 
including in cases of technology failure, and empower-
ing beneficiaries through choice and voice (Chapter 6). 
In addition, ser vice margins  were widened from their 
previously low levels to reduce the need of providers to 
rely on diverting rations to stay in business. Reforms in 
Jharkhand  were driven by the desire to save resources 
and embodied none of  these features. Authentication 
failures  were not followed up by prescribed procedures 
to ensure that legitimate beneficiaries  were served. 
Dealer diversions continued as before, with no mecha-
nism for empowering beneficiaries to resist or report 
ser vice failures.  These cases point again to the fact that ­ Table­5 .1 . ­Comparison­of­Aadhaar-­ based­PDS­reforms­in­India

—+1po liti cal  factors. Effective use of feedback mechanisms 
provides an opportunity to re orient existing ser vice 
delivery systems as well as shape new ones.
Feedback mechanisms available to citizens to report 
the quality of public ser vices they receive are often 
perfunctory at best, with no clear lines of accountabil-
ity or time line for the redressal of grievances. With 
digitization, this aspect of the citizen– state relation-
ship can change rapidly. Several cases show that digital 
governance systems, appropriately designed and 
implemented, can incorporate three interventions to 
help improve beneficiary experience with public ser-
vice delivery (Figure 6.1). The first stems from individ-
ualizing subsidies and benefits, making them portable 
and enabling beneficiaries to choose between provid-
ers. This may not always be practicable, but where it is, 
it reduces asymmetry in power relationships and pro-
vides a market- based indicator of per for mance. The 
second involves the use of the vast quantity of real- 
time administrative data that digital delivery systems 
can generate to reduce the transaction costs of access-
ing information and monitoring implementation. The 
third is to solicit views from beneficiaries to help sup-
port accountability at appropriate levels and comple-
ment the administrative data to help enforce ser vice 
delivery standards.
We do not attempt an exhaustive review of the large 
lit er a ture on how countries can achieve better ser vice 
delivery outcomes.67 Our objective is to consider how 
countries can use digital technology— including the 
67 . For an early but comprehensive review, see World Development Report 2004: 
Making Ser vices Work for the Poor (World Bank, 2003).Improving the efficiency, quality, and impact of public 
ser vices is one of the most critical challenges of public 
policy. As governments around the world use digital 
technology to reform governance and ser vice deliv-
ery,  these new systems should not only increase effi-
ciency but also empower citizens by providing users 
choice, amplifying their voices to enable them to par-
ticipate more effectively in the development pro  cess, 
and enhancing the accountability of ser vice providers. 
 These objectives are consistent with the SDG goals of 
promoting peaceful and inclusive socie ties and build-
ing effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions, 
noted below:
Goal 16.5: Substantially reduce corruption and 
bribery in all their forms.
Goal 16.6: Develop effective, accountable, and 
transparent institutions at all levels.
Goal 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participa-
tory, and representative decision making at all 
levels.
The SDGs also provide indicators that governments 
can use to track pro gress  towards the goals:
Target 16.6.2: Proportion of the population satis-
fied with their last experience of public ser vices.
Target 16.7 .2: Proportion of population who believe 
decision making is inclusive and responsive.
Ideally, ser vice delivery mechanisms would incorpo-
rate the SDG princi ples and goals from their inception. 
However, many do not; legacy systems are also difficult 
to overhaul completely, due to administrative and Chapter 6.

+1—efforts to build on digital technology to strengthen cit-
izen feedback,68 and many governments have taken 
steps to incorporate the use of digital technology, 
including payments, into ser vice delivery. However, 
few government programs have yet harnessed the 
potential of the vast amount of information generated 
by digital systems to assess ser vice quality and empower 
citizens.
Feedback systems,  whether through surveys, social 
audits, scorecards, or other mechanisms, have a long 
history. They are a critical ele ment in the “short route” 
of accountability between clients and ser vice provid-
ers.69 Sometimes they are in effec tive; they might 
require effort on the part of citizens; long delays in 
soliciting inputs or slow responses to grievances and 
prob lems may discourage submissions. Feedback gath-
ered through some mechanisms may not be suffi-
ciently granular or tailored  towards individual ser vice 
interactions; prob lems may not be assigned to the 
appropriate level of administration for attention and 
68. One example is Ushahidi (https:// www  . ushahidi . com / ), an organ ization 
originally set up to map vio lence in  Kenya  after the post- election vio lence of 
2008. Another is FixMyStreet (https:// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / FixMyStreet 
. com), a platform to help  people inform local authorities of potholes and 
other prob lems needing attention. Dodge et al. are also studying the effec-
tiveness of personal tools for administrators to track payments in real time:

where, through elections and other mechanisms, citizens influence policy-
makers who, in turn, manage and influence the ser vice providers. See World 
Bank (2003).combination of digital ID, payments, and mobile com-
munications—to implement feedback systems that 
improve the design, efficiency, quality, and experience 
with public ser vices, helping providers achieve the 
SDG goals listed above.  After considering how digitiza-
tion can improve on analog pro  cesses, we examine the 
new, information- based approach in the context of 
India’s LPG cooking gas subsidy reform. We then con-
sider the case of Andhra Pradesh, where digital pro-
cesses are being used more broadly to support a 
real- time governance framework that incorporates 
both real- time administrative data and citizen feed-
back. We conclude with some reflections on the les-
sons from  these cases, including some cautions and 
limitations, when we come to consider their applica-
bility in a wider context.
Feedback loops
The growing use of digital technologies, including 
mobile connectivity and the internet, offers new 
opportunities to institute a range of scalable feedback 
mechanisms that are far speedier, and prob ably less 
costly, than traditional approaches. Rapid, more gran-
ular feedback can help in the early design phases as 
well as in the reform of legacy systems where major 
redesign may be costly. Bottlenecks can be alleviated 
and accountability improved, often without the need 
to fully replace the system. Some NGOs have pioneered Service Delivery

—+1Some critical success  factors  
for feedback
As for other areas of technology, digital feedback 
mechanisms are only tools. The enabling environ-
ment, design, incentives to participate, and the moti-
vation and capacity to respond are critical to the 
success of any feedback loop.
Commitment
Feedback systems  will have  little impact in cases where 
 there is no high- level commitment to improve ser vice 
delivery or inadequate resources and capacity to 
respond to prob lems. If adverse feedback is treated as 
a sign of individual or orga nizational failure, it  will 
prob ably be suppressed. High- level po liti cal leader-
ship should convey a clear message to both providers 
and clients that feedback is valued, and its relevance 
should be demonstrated by vis i ble improvements in 
ser vice quality. Commitment can be demonstrated by 
linking feedback levels to incentives for ser vice pro-
viders. At the same time, delivery agents need to be 
brought on board while putting in place per for mance 
metrics and incentives for better ser vice, especially 
when, as is likely, reduced bureaucratic discretion 
constrains opportunities for diversion and corruption, 
enhancing re sis tance to change.
Transparency
The transparency of feedback to all stakeholders, both 
internal and external, can help to avoid the suppres-
sion of negative information and can also be taken as a 
signal of commitment. Transparency should extend to 
information on the resolution times for complaints.
Learning
 Going beyond grievance redressal, learning organ-
izations put in place pro  cesses to analyze informa-
tion, identify actionable improvements in business 
 pro  cesses, and shape the long- term ser vice design resolution. They may also be  limited in terms of being 
representative across geography or time. They may not 
pick up large variation in per for mance and feedback 
across locations and between discrete mea sure ments.
Digital feedback loops can be more than a computer-
ized version of existing analog pro  cesses. By leveraging 
technology, they enable the collection of large volumes 
of data in almost real time, including crowdsourcing 
suggestions and ideas at the planning stage. Data col-
lection and analy sis can be far timelier and more 
transaction- specific than that from retrospective 
audits based on paper- based rec ords or periodic field 
surveys. Reporting costs and burdens can be eased by 
using a range of response modalities, including text 
messages and robocalls. Handheld voting devices and 
audience response systems can offer individuals the 
opportunity to express their views while preserving 
their anonymity and ensuring that the opinions are 
submitted by genuine clients.70
Speed is a  great benefit. On the user side, rapid feed-
back and response is impor tant to encourage further 
involvement.71 On the provider side, more timely 
information, including from administrative data, can 
help to correct shortcomings while preempting fre-
quent bureaucratic obfuscations of ex  post audits— 
that the prob lems exposed are old ones, that they had 
been recognized before the audit, and that corrective 
action has already been taken.
70. Academic lit er a ture on the use of mobile feedback for real- time gover-
nance dates back about 15 years. Janssen and van Veenstra (2005) describe 
five stages of technical systems architecture that would be needed to imple-
ment a real- time governance system. El Kiki and Lawrence (2006) subse-
quently described the potential benefits from a real- time mobile government 
model using mobile technology to deliver public ser vices. Song and Corn-
ford (2006) describe a mobile governance pi lot proj ect by the Beijing city 
government that equipped officials with mobile phones to relay citizen 
issues directly back to a supervision center. While this was an officially medi-
ated feedback mechanism, follow-up for each individual report was con-
firmed by a photo taken on the mobile phone.
71. Ringold, Holla, Koziol, and Srinivasan (2012: 85) note that the public 
needs to expect a response in order to find complaining worth their time, 
especially for the most vulnerable beneficiaries, who “may not believe they 
are entitled to complain.” Alsaadi, Ahmad, and Hussain (2018) used focus 
groups and surveys to examine mobile government applications in the 
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman and found that users priori-
tized real- time responses over other ser vice characteristics.

with ser vice) combined with passive feedback through 
a toll- free telephone number or website.
Richness
Feedback can range from a  simple number code (SMS 1 
for yes, 2 for no) to a text message through to richer 
media such as audio or video files. Increasingly, social 
media (Facebook, Twitter) and messaging platforms 
(WhatsApp) enable rich feedback; they have become 
power ful interfaces between citizens and states. 
Increased digital capacity in public systems signals a 
richer range of options in the  future, with correspond-
ing opportunities for learning and improving the 
delivery mechanism.
From princi ples to practice
India has become a laboratory for digitization, with 
reforms to a wide range of ser vices and benefit pro-
grams. Two recent programs offer insights into the use 
of feedback mechanisms.
Consumer choice and voice in India’s LPG 
cooking gas subsidy reform73
India’s system of cooking gas subsidies has long been 
plagued by diversion and inefficiency. As described in 
Chapter 4, starting in 2013, Proj ect Lakshya74 and  later 
PaHaL introduced wide- ranging reforms in the alloca-
tion, distribution, and delivery of the cooking gas sub-
sidy. Instead of paying a subsidized price for LPG 
cylinders, beneficiaries paid the market price and the 
government transferred the subsidy directly to their 
bank accounts  after purchase. Savings from the reform 
facilitated the rollout of LPG to poor rural  women (the 
Ujjwala program75). Dealer margins  were increased as 
part of the reform to reduce re sis tance due to higher 
73. This section draws heavi ly on Mittal et al. (2017).

75. https:// pmuy  . gov  . in / .approach. This objective becomes more feasible with 
the large real- time data sets generated through digi-
tized transactions coupled with tools such as data 
analytics.
Accessibility and safeguards
Even as digitized systems can reduce transaction costs 
for many  people, they can also raise barriers for some. 
Requiring access to mobile data or the internet can 
exclude the poor and marginalized, biasing the distri-
bution of feedback providers. Cultural norms (includ-
ing gender), language abilities, and literacy levels can 
also constrain access. To overcome  these capacity and 
resource challenges, digital feedback loops can allow 
feedback to be sent through trusted intermediaries 
(including reputable NGOs) as well as directly by citi-
zens. Data analy sis can also help to reconcile privacy 
concerns with the need to provide metrics of ser vice 
per for mance.72
Choice, voice, and control
Corrective action can be in the hands of the ser vice 
provider or of citizens themselves. In provider- controlled 
systems, feedback can form the basis for corrective 
action only if the ser vice provider chooses to act on it. 
In citizen- controlled systems, consumers are empowered 
to take action, including by changing their ser vice pro-
vider. While portability across ser vice providers may 
not always be practicable (in sparsely ser viced areas, 
for example), it provides a power ful signal by fostering 
competition among delivery agents.
Proactivity
In passive systems, citizens must initiate the feedback 
pro cess; in active systems, the ser vice provider (includ-
ing the government) reaches out for feedback. Systems 
can involve a combination of active and passive— for 
example, automated post- service calls to all clients 
72. This trade- off and the use of data analytics are discussed in https:// aipeqs 
. github . io / website / tprc . pdf.

—+1opportunity for social audit. The online portal was 
hosted in several local languages to ensure that the 
feedback mechanism was widely accessible to  people 
who  were not conversant in En glish, thereby making 
the system “inclusive by design.”
The feedback loops in the new LPG system have 
increased consumers’ voice and the accountability of 
distributors, and improved ser vice delivery. Not sur-
prisingly, the combination of subsidy reform from 
prices to cash transfer (reducing leakage and diver-
sion) and user empowerment appears to have led to a 
major improvement in the timeliness of deliveries. In 
user surveys, this has emerged as the leading  factor in 
support for the reform.78 No more do families need to 
wait for extended periods before their cooking gas cyl-
inders are refilled.
 Towards real- time governance:  
The Andhra Pradesh experience
As discussed in Chapter 5, the state of Andhra Pradesh 
(AP) in southern India has emerged at the vanguard of 
using technology to reform ser vice delivery, and with 
generally good results, as indicated by beneficiary and 
user surveys. Its approach includes the princi ple of 
universal access— efforts to make Aadhaar available to 
all and to integrate it into all programs and adminis-
trative departments—as well as the princi ple of clear 
accountability to rectify cases of technology failure. At 
local levels, each community has a village revenue offi-
cer, the lowest level of the administrative ser vice, who 
is authorized to deal with public resources and pay-
ments.  These VROs are mandated to deal with the (few) 
exceptions and cases of technology failure, ensuring 
that the digital reforms do not lead to exclusion of gen-
uine beneficiaries. In addition, it includes the same 
two ele ments as the LPG reform— choice, or the porta-
bility of benefits, and voice, with mechanisms to solicit 
the views of beneficiaries on the quality of ser vices 
78. In a survey of beneficiaries in Rajasthan, almost half found the new sys-
tem better, while only a few considered it worse; see https:// www  . cgdev  . org 
/ publication / what - a - new - survey - aadhaar - users - can - tell - us - about - digital  
- reforms - initial - insights.implementation costs and the elimination of opportu-
nities for diversion.
Beyond the use of digital matching and ID to de- 
duplicate beneficiary rolls and eliminate ghost con-
sumers, digital technology has been instrumental in 
several ways. One involved the GiveItUp program, 
which encouraged richer consumers to give up their 
subsidies to help finance assistance to poor  house holds. 
The names of  those who volunteered  were inscribed 
on a “digital roll of honor,” each linked to the name of a 
poor consumer whose subsidy had been facilitated. 
Some 10 million gave up their subsidies; the public 
nature of this exercise then made it pos si ble to lever-
age it to eliminate subsidies to  those rich enough to file 
tax returns (“Your neighbors gave up their subsidy— 
why not you?”). Consumers  were informed of the 
delivery of each cylinder and received a text message 
upon the transfer of the subsidy to their designated 
beneficiary bank account. They could now track their 
subsidy and deliveries by SMS and online portals.76 
Consumers  were also invited to rate the ser vice of their 
distributor, with ratings on five ser vice par  ameters. At 
the same time, dealers  were also rated based on deliv-
ery times through automated management informa-
tion system data collected by the public- sector oil 
marketing companies, on a five- star scale.
Portability across LPG distributors provided another 
mechanism to reinforce accountability for efficient 
cylinder delivery. Consumers could shift to another 
dealer, taking cognizance of logistical constraints.77 
Together with public information on per for mance, 
this reversed the consumer– dealer power equation in 
 favor of the beneficiaries. The “star ratings”  were fur-
ther linked to incentives by tying them to decisions on 
the renewal of dealerships.  These ratings  were trans-
parently made available to the public as well as to other 
distributors, improving transparency and providing 
76. www  . mylpg . in.
77 . In some rural areas where distribution centers are sparse, the Ujjwala 
program has moved  towards licensing mini- distributors, local businesses 
capable of servicing a more  limited number of customers than the large- 
scale ones traditionally associated with the LPG program (Jain et al., 2018). 
This is intended to create a denser distribution network.

+1—options of both banks and administrative government 
offices, further reducing travel cost and incon ve nience, 
especially impor tant for the el derly. Customers can 
“vote with their feet,” making them less vulnerable to 
exploitation by frontline providers, sending market- 
based feedback signals to ser vice providers.
Turning to the second loop, several states in India— 
such as Rajasthan— now collect real- time data on pro-
gram delivery that can be used to drill down to the 
level of districts, subdistricts,81 and individual provid-
ers.82 Andhra Pradesh has gone beyond digitally 
recording administrative data to actively analyzing it 
to increase efficiency and accountability and to reduce 
exclusion. A central hub collates all ser vice delivery 
data generated through Aadhaar- based transactions in 
real time, analyzes the data, and provides dashboards 
for monitoring implementation. This can include, for 
example, the rec ords of beneficiaries’ efforts to authen -
ticate, and  whether  these  were followed up by mea-
sures to ensure that benefits  were received. In one case 
cited in the survey, a dealer was contacted about 10 
minutes  after a failed fingerprint authentication effort, 
asked why no rations  were provided, and instructed to 
reach out to the beneficiary and apply the appropriate 
protocol— iris scan, other form of identification, or 
referral to a VRO—to rectify the situation. This may not 
represent a routine use of data, but it demonstrates 
the power of real- time administrative information to 
pinpoint ongoing prob lems with the system.
On the third loop, actively soliciting user views on ser-
vice quality and efforts to resolve grievances is at the 
foundation of AP’s real- time governance framework. 
Each beneficiary must agree to be part of a quality sur-
vey pro  cess and receives a feedback robocall on ser vice 
quality  every time they access a ser vice. In the case of 
the food ration system, this would imply around 10

stantially shorter delays in the payments pro  cess. https:// www  . poverty

“ whole of government” approach that aims to hold 
public officials accountable in a direct and rapid man-
ner, and that possibly represents the frontier of real- 
time governance approaches in developing countries 
 today.
In implementing this approach, AP starts with a nota-
ble advantage  because it can draw on Aadhaar as the 
foundation for its digital governance framework. The 
fact that Aadhaar is de facto mandatory to receive any 
public ser vices, subsidies, or transfers, and that 
authentication is online, makes  every beneficiary and 
each transaction trackable in real time at the individ-
ual level. This immediacy of administrative data feed-
back might be more difficult to secure in less online 
environments.
The first digital feedback loop component introduced 
by AP uses the power of uniqueness and the trackabil-
ity of transactions to facilitate portability. Public distri-
bution system beneficiaries can obtain food rations 
from any fair price shop in the state. This benefits in- 
state mi grants and offers an alternative to customers 
seeking better service— both features that are widely 
appreciated by beneficiaries, according to 2018 survey 
results.79 As described in Chapter 5, portability would 
not be pos si ble without an effective system to manage 
stocks and flows of rations in real time throughout the 
system, and at the level of each of the state’s 28,642 fair 
price shops.80 Effective stock replenishment, in turn, 
requires computerization of the upstream supply 
chain, with deliveries to shops authenticated in real 
time by both  drivers and shop  owners. Social pension 
recipients, too, can now collect their benefits from any 
local government office, although many  were not yet 
aware of this at the time of the 2018 survey. A further 
stage could be to open up portability to include the 
79. Survey data suggests that portability can not only be beneficial on the 
demand side but is also preferred by most supply- side agents, who see the 
possibility to gain customers through better ser vice and also find that com-
puterization of the supply chain has eased transactional difficulties (Aadil 
et al., 2019). Dealer margins  were also increased from their previously low 
levels to compensate for the reduced ability to divert rations.

public officials accountable in a direct and rapid man-

time governance approaches in developing countries 
 today.
Preliminary lessons on the  
potential for real- time governance 
and its limitations
As noted in Chapter 1, in- kind assistance has not ben-
efited as much from advances in digital technology 
and connectivity as cash transfers. Nevertheless,  there 
are many ways in which the effectiveness and account-
ability of a wide range of ser vices and benefits could be 
enhanced, as suggested by the LPG and Andhra 
Pradesh cases. The two cases share some common fea-
tures as well as showing some differences. First, in 
terms of commitment, both the cooking gas reform 
and the real- time governance system of AP  were high- 
level proj ects, strongly endorsed and supported by the 
prime minister and the state’s chief minister, respec-
tively. Both have been able to draw on India’s digital 
infrastructure, including the Aadhaar system and 
exceptionally rapid advances in mobile communica-
tions. The fact that Aadhaar is de facto mandatory to 
receive specified public ser vices, subsidies, or trans-
fers, and that authentication is online, makes  every 
beneficiary and each transaction generate granular 
feedback in real time. Both cases have involved learn-
ing, and have provided beneficiaries choice as well as 
voice; both have been proactive in seeking feedback, 
especially AP. In terms of transparency, the ratings 
generated by the LPG systems are in the public domain, 
while the happiness indices of AP are not; they are, 
however, assembled in the real- time governance cen-
ter and available within the state government as a 
management tool.
Another point in common has been attention to the 
incentives facing ser vice providers. Andhra Pradesh 
increased dealer margins to compensate for reduced 
opportunity to divert funds, although this did not million calls per month, covering clients of  every fair 
price shop in the state.83  Those responding with nega-
tive feedback are rolled over to the second active feed-
back loop through a manual system to register 
complaints, which are then referred to the appropri-
ate administrative unit and which must be resolved 
within specified periods. At the state level, a consoli-
dated ser vice delivery data hub collects information 
on grievances and tracks their resolution within a 
specified time frame, normally expected to be 24 
hours, thereby fixing accountability and requiring a 
rapid response from the administration.
The data generated is then analyzed to rank districts, 
mandals, and villages, as well as ser vice programs, 
scoring them on “happiness indexes” of ser vice deliv-
ery, which are updated  every three hours.  These are 
not public (unlike the LPG dealer ratings) but can be 
used as a management tool by the state government to 
hold officials accountable. Lessons from feedback may 
be used to redesign delivery mechanisms to make 
them more beneficiary- centric— for example, the most 
recent shift to deliver pensions through panchayat 
offices, which many pensioners found to be more con-
ve nient than receiving pension through the banks (see 
Chapter 5).
This combination of real- time feedback and clear 
 human accountability is intended to promote integrity 
and efficiency at each level of the administration, 
thereby increasing inclusion and trust in the system. 
We do not have sufficient evidence to judge the impact 
of the real- time governance system, but its ele ments 
seem to be well appreciated on both the beneficiary 
and ser vice sides. On the beneficiary side, focus group 
comments indicate, for example, that officials are now 
far less likely to solicit bribes or make deductions from 
social payments than previously. On the supply side, 
officials appear to be well aware of the happiness rat-
ings of their districts and of their targets for improve-
ment. This approach is being further evolved into a 
83. The rate of response to  these calls was reported to be about 15   percent. 
For a typical fair price shop, this would translate into some 50–60 reports per 
month.

able reasons for collection and storage of data on 
socioeconomic programs to ensure that “scarce public 
resources are not dissipated by the diversion of 
resources to persons who do not qualify as recipi-
ents . . .  but the data which the state has collected has 
to be utilized for legitimate purposes of the state and 
 ought not to be utilized unauthorizedly for extraneous 
purposes.”86  These observations point to the potential 
trade- offs in using data as a tool for improving state 
capacity to deliver public goods and ser vices, and the 
checks and balances that need to be in place to ensure 
that  people’s fundamental right to privacy is not 
 violated.
Digital governance mechanisms based on the ubiqui-
tous use of unique identification break the delivery 
silos across sectors. Whole- of- government approaches, 
such as that being pioneered by Andhra Pradesh, 
require the ability to pool information across programs 
to provide a comprehensive citizen- based picture. This 
raises obvious concerns for data privacy, the degree to 
which users should have the right to control their data, 
and the mechanisms for them to do so. Estonia is, so 
far, the only country to implement a comprehensive 
approach  towards managing government- held data, 
but more governments, including that of Andhra 
Pradesh, are grappling with this prob lem and are begin -
ning to consider approaches to migrate  towards a com-
parable system.87
The second is the  matter of capacity. The LPG program 
was able to build on a preexisting foundation of state 
oil companies and distribution networks, which con-
tinued through the period of reform. Andhra Pradesh 
is generally recognized as a state with above- average 
administrative capacity in India. With its former capi-
tal, Hyderabad, being a major tech hub, it is prob ably 
also ahead of most other states in the digital sphere. It 
began experimenting with digitized ser vice delivery 
well before Aadhaar, for example, through the use of

87 . For an outline of recent approaches, see Koshy (2019).prevent some dealers from exiting, requiring  others to 
be recruited. Dealer margins  were also revisited for 
LPG as the program was rolled out at scale.84
The approaches developed in  these two cases are 
potentially applicable to a wide range of ser vice and 
benefit programs. The question, then, is the condi-
tions  under which such feedback mechanisms are 
likely to be helpful in improving ser vice delivery and 
governance  towards achieving the SDGs. Recognizing 
that this can be framed as a very general question, it is 
useful to highlight three features of the context in 
which  these two programs have been developed.
The first is the question of social choice, as concerns ID 
systems but also regarding the collection and use of 
extensive digital transaction data. Aadhaar is at the 
heart of India’s digital ser vice reforms. While its use for 
the provision of benefits has been approved by India’s 
Supreme Court, such a system might not be po liti cally 
acceptable in all countries, although it is also the case 
that almost all developing countries have, or have 
committed to, some form of national ID system. Some 
ele ments of the Krishna model could be adapted to 
dif fer ent identification capabilities, but it is not clear 
 whether comparable monitoring systems could be 
implemented in the absence of an Aadhaar- like ID sys-
tem using real- time online authentication at points of 
ser vice.
Related to this is the vast quantity of personally identi-
fiable data and transaction rec ords generated by such 
digitally enabled delivery systems. The Supreme Court 
of India, in its judgment on the right to privacy, 
acknowledges that digitally enabled systems “raise 
complex issues requiring delicate balances to be drawn 
between the legitimate concerns of the State on the 
one hand and individual interest in the protection of 
privacy on the other.”85 Furthermore, the Supreme 
84. An exception to this was the decision to move pension payments in 
Andhra Pradesh away from banks and  towards panchayat offices rather than 
increase the very low fees offered for delivery.

—+1health, time management, and income- generating 
possibilities. In Andhra Pradesh, together with the 
prioritization of ICT,  there has been a consistent focus 
on strengthening ser vice delivery. Ayliffe, Aslam, and 
Schjø dt (2017) offer a multidimensional comparison 
with several other states and stress the importance of 
commitment from the highest levels of government, 
which is seen as essential to overcome a range of 
power ful local vested interests. In the NREGS initia-
tive, for example, state- level po liti cal elites in Andhra 
Pradesh played a critical role in giving space to activist 
bureaucrats and civil society actors to innovate and 
experiment in areas that  were aligned with the overall 
po liti cal narrative of transparency and accountability 
(Aiyar and Walton, 2015).
 These features should not detract from the gains that 
are potentially achievable across a wide range of public 
ser vices and programs, from building effective feed-
back mechanisms, and from the role that digital systems 
can play in enhancing the speed and comprehensive-
ness of such mechanisms. They do, however, reinforce 
the point made in previous chapters, that they  will not 
transform ser vice delivery in situations where the fun-
damentals are not in place— where  there is no consis-
tent po liti cal  will to build the capacity needed for such 
systems to operate effectively or to provide stable 
funding, and  little real commitment to improving ser-
vice quality. Technology may expand the possibility 
set, but it provides no guarantee that countries or pro-
grams  will move closer to the theoretical efficiency 
frontier. However, adaptations of the approach could 
be incorporated more widely and, at least from the 
technology perspective, many countries are moving in 
the same direction.  There is ample space to adapt and 
apply the lessons in other contexts to support the 
SDGs.smartcards to pay NREGS beneficiaries, as described in 
Chapter  5. Its digital ser vice delivery systems have 
required years of sustained effort and management 
pressure to reach their current capability, including 
the time and effort to roll out the foundations of iden-
tification and connectivity needed for the reforms. 
Andhra had also been the leading state in India in 
terms of the implementation of social audits, and so 
had institutionalized the practice of client feedback 
well before the digital revolution. Similar pro gress in 
implementing digital governance might not be achiev-
able by less capable or less stable administrations.
This brings in the question of the extent to which digi-
tal technology can build new capacity as opposed to 
augmenting the impact of existing capacity.  These 
cases suggest that  there is prob ably some per for mance 
threshold effect for a real- time governance system to 
operate successfully. To offer choice to users, and also 
to strengthen the hand of government over dealers, the 
network of ser vice points should be dense enough to 
offer alternatives. The incidence of complaints should 
be manageably low, and  there needs to be capacity to 
respond. Negative feedback could other wise overwhelm 
the system, leading to long queues of unresolved prob-
lems and undermining trust in the system.
Third, and perhaps most complex, is the po liti cal 
economy of ser vice delivery— conditions  under which 
a government or ser vice authority  will prioritize 
improvements in delivery over other objectives, 
including bureaucratic discretion.  Here, too,  there is 
an impor tant parallel between the two cases. Both 
have benefited from stable funding and from strong 
support at the highest levels. India’s LPG program has 
been one of the most vis i ble schemes of the Modi gov-
ernment, with ubiquitous posters proclaiming its 
achievements and its benefits, especially for  women’s

—+1ID estimates
Dif fer ent sources provide substantially dif fer ent esti-
mates of the coverage of identification systems. One 
question is  whether to focus on registration or on the 
ability to actually prove identity, for example, by show-
ing a card. Another is  whether to focus on a par tic u lar 
system, such as a national ID, or to include alternative 
documentation. Especially in countries where national 
ID coverage is low,  people may be able to use an alter-
native type of identification, such as a voter card, to 
authenticate themselves for ser vices, but in some 
countries, voter cards are not widely accepted for uses 
beyond voting. The age at which coverage starts for 
adult citizens varies across countries. Further compli-
cating the picture, while national ID authorities may 
know the number of cards issued, especially in coun-
tries with low rates of death registration, they are 
unlikely to have a clear idea of how many cards are still 
active.
The most extensive effort to mea sure global ID cover-
age is the World Bank’s ID4D data set. For  children, this 
relies on birth registration rates reported by UNICEF 
for the age cohort 0–5 and extrapolated for older 
cohorts, and for adults on reported administrative 
data on national ID coverage or voter registrations, 
depending on the country. Findex surveys only adults 
( those over the age of 15) and reports responses on 
 whether the individual has a national ID or, as in the 
case of India, where the Aadhaar is used, a similar cre-
dential. Some countries pose par tic u lar challenges; in 
Ethiopia, for example, the kebele ID functions as the 
equivalent of a national ID but is issued in a decentral-
ized manner by some 15,000 kebeles. Comparing Fin-
dex 2017 and the 2018 ID4D database,  there are 21 
countries where the difference in adult coverage is 
greater than 20 percentage points. Findex is lower in Any effort to estimate JAM coverage  faces formidable 
challenges, both conceptually and in terms of data 
coverage. The numbers of  people covered by an ID 
system and with access to mobile communications 
and some type of financial account provide no indica-
tion of the quality of the ser vices provided by  these 
systems.
Limitations of Findex coverage
Findex is the only source that enables individual- level 
analy sis of the three components of JAM. The 2017 
survey covers 144 countries, and while it does include 
China, question gaps mean that  there is no estimate 
of its mobile money account penetration. China 
prob ably has the world’s single largest mobile money 
user base, estimated to be 527 million  people at the 
end of 2017 (China Internet Network Information 
Centre, 2018) but part of this may reflect mobile pay-
ments ser vices for  people who already have a bank 
account. Another exclusion from the 2017 data is 
Somalia, where 37 .1   percent of adults had a mobile 
money account in the 2014 round, accounting for 
80   percent of the country’s financial inclusion. By 
2017 the rate was reported to be 73   percent;  these 
rates are extremely high compared to other coun-
tries, and in all likelihood coverage has only increased 
(Altai Consulting, 2017).
In addition, 45 of the cases did not include the ques-
tion on possession of a national ID. Most of  these are 
high- income countries, but the list also includes large 
countries of interest such as the DRC, Ghana, Iran, 
Nigeria, and the Philippines. For analy sis at the indi-
vidual level, this leaves 99 countries with data for all 
three JAM components.Annex 1.

+1—The strength and reliability of connectivity and the 
speed of mobile data are also impor tant variables that 
can constrain the ser vices that mobile can provide. In 
terms of conventional criteria for financial access—  
the ability to deposit and withdraw cash, to check bal-
ances, and to make and receive payments— access to 
2G connectivity is sufficient, although 3G and higher 
facilitates more sophisticated ser vices and more con-
ve nient user interfaces via smartphones (Perlman 
and Wechsler, 2019). However, poor connectivity can 
substantially impede transactions and weaken trust 
in the system, as users have to grapple with dropped 
transactions. Time- outs can also be a prob lem, par-
ticularly with complex USSD interfaces (Cook and 
Raman, 2019).
Financial accounts
Financial accounts can also offer variable bundles of 
ser vices, as well as dif fer ent levels of con ve nience to 
their holders. This can depend on the type of account, 
as well as on the features of the system— for example, 
access to points of ser vice, and  whether it supports 
interoperable payments across all payment provid-
ers. The value of having an account also depends on 
how widely payments  will be accepted by merchants. 
Some accounts may be dormant, so that data on the 
number of  people having an account may overesti-
mate true financial inclusion mea sured in terms of 
use. On the other hand, surveys indicate that some 
 people consider that they have access through shar-
ing the account of a close  family member, so that 
data on account owner ship could understate access.
Limitations of a snapshot
On- the- ground realities are changing extremely 
quickly, and 2017 is already a long time ago in the digital 
world. The JAM picture can also change rapidly in any 
one country. Malawi rolled out its national ID in late 
2017 and 2018,  after the Findex survey. India, too, has 
seen a remarkable increase in the coverage of ID (Aad-
haar) and mobile, as well as in the proportion of its 12 cases and higher in 11 cases. For most countries in 
the first group, the difference is due to (suspiciously) 
high voter registration rates in countries with still- 
inadequate ID systems; for the second group, most 
cases are due to the converse situation.
The quality of ser vices offered by dif fer ent ID systems 
varies across countries. While over 90   percent of sys-
tems use digital technology (Identification for Devel-
opment, 2018), very few are equipped to carry out full 
or remote digital authentication,  whether through 
biometrics (India’s Aadhaar) or cards, digital certifi-
cates, and PINs (Estonia).  There is also considerable 
variation in the robustness of the credential,  whether 
it is de- duplicated and easy to use. Some countries that 
have rolled out sophisticated ID systems have yet to 
put in place an authentication ecosystem capable of 
exploiting their capabilities.
Mobile access
Mobile access can be mea sured in several dif fer ent 
ways, none of them perfect. The total global number of 
mobile subscriptions, at 7 .9 billion (GSMA, 2019b), is 
now on par with the number of  people in the world, 
but this information is of  limited value  because of 
multiple subscriptions. For some countries, the GSMA 
provides data on the number of unique mobile sub-
scribers, but this can be difficult to monitor, particu-
larly in countries with less than adequate ID systems. A 
third option, as used in Findex, is a survey- based ques-
tion on possession of a mobile phone. This could serve 
several  family members, each with their own SIM card, 
and so would be a relatively conservative access mea-
sure. Comparing publicly available unique subscriber 
data from GSMA with Findex mobile phone owner ship 
shows that GSMA estimates are almost always higher 
(Figure A1.1), and some appear to be larger than the 
size of the adult population. This could be due to failure 
to recognize multiple subscribers or to the inclusion of 
business accounts. We have settled on the Findex mea-
sure for analytical purposes  because it represents the 
most conservative and empirically verifiable estimate.

Analy  sis of JAM Data from

analy sis.
90. While Findex data are also available for 2011 and 2014, creating a time 
series would require aggregating the data at the national level, losing rich-
ness in the pro  cess. Likewise, mobile money questions  were only introduced 
in 2014, and then not universally. Therefore, we only use the 2017 microdata, 
although  there is certainly scope for  others to replicate our models using 
aggregate data in a time series.For 99 countries, Findex provides a rich set of micro-
data on access to IDs, mobile phones, and financial 
accounts, including bank and mobile money accounts. 
For 2017 , this sample covers over 109,000 observations 
and represents 4.09 billion  people.90 Not all the infor-
mation is available for 2011 and 2014, the years of pre-
vious surveys, so a detailed picture can cover only the 
most recent survey. We first apply cross- section logistic 
regressions to examine  factors associated with finan-
cial inclusion, the lagging component of the JAM trin-
ity (Figure  2.1), considering a range of personal 
attributes, as well as possession of an ID and a mobile 
phone, as  factors that can shape financial inclusion. 
Robustness checks are performed for dif fer ent coun-
try subgroups, with and without country dummies, 
and with alternative country weighting systems. The 
coefficients are significant (including when errors are 
clustered), of plausible sign, and relatively stable, sug-
gesting substantial commonalities across countries. 
Both personal attributes and inclusion in the first two 
legs of JAM are associated with financial inclusion. 
The probability that an individual  will have a financial 
account is very high when all  factors are favorable 
and very low when they are unfavorable. Using this 
approach, we then consider the relationship between 
the receipt of government transfers— and how they are 
delivered— and financial inclusion.Logistic regressions for 
financial inclusion
Our outcome variable is a dummy for  whether a 
respondent has a financial account, including  either 
a bank account with a formal financial institution or a 
mobile money account. We would expect that higher 
incomes and education levels and being in the work -
force should increase the probability of financial inclu-
sion, while  women are less likely to be financially 
included. In addition to such personal attributes, hav-
ing an ID and owning a mobile phone are likely to 
increase the probability of having an account; both are 
enablers, and ID is a general KYC requirement for both 
financial accounts and SIM registration.91 In line with 
the proposition that G2P payments can encourage 
financial inclusion, their receipt could also be a posi-
tive  factor.
Estimation approach
We use four basic logistic regression models, which 
are, in turn, estimated over three country samples.
Model 1a estimates  whether individual i in country r 
has a financial account A, regressed on dummy N for 
having a national ID and dummy P for owning a mobile 
phone. The “b” variant of each subsequent model adds 
vector C of country dummy variables.
1a) Ai,r = β0 + β1Ni,r + β2Pi,r + εi,r
1b) Ai,r = β0 + β1Ni,r + β2Pi,r + Cr + εi,r
91. We would also expect urban respondents to be more likely to be finan-
cially included, but the difficulty of consistently assigning respondents to 
rural and urban status means that this is not included in the microdata.

+1—receiving a government transfer in the last 12 months 
are positive  factors for financial inclusion, while being 
female is negative. The steady progression across 
income quintiles suggests a broadly linear relationship 
with income; the relationship between financial inclu-
sion and education level is slightly more progressive 
than linear. Even  after allowing for  these attributes, 
having an ID and owning a mobile are both positively 
associated with financial inclusion, a result consistent 
with the view that  there are synergies between JAM 
components and that the  factors that cause  people to 
have one spill over onto the  others.
The association with being female is modest, though 
slightly higher when the sample is restricted to the 
bottom tercile and LICs. This suggests that much of the 
gender variation is being captured by other associated 
attributes, such as lower levels of education or a higher 
probability of being out of the workforce, a conclusion 
consistent with the results of the Blinder- Oaxaca 
decomposition described in Chapter 2.92
As a preliminary robustness check, we cluster standard 
errors at the national level; while this reduces z - scores 
for the coefficients, they remain significant. The results 
are robust to the inclusion of country dummies and are 
also stable when the country sample is restricted to the 
lowest tercile of JAM countries or to LICs.93
Robustness check for 
country weighting
In modeling relationships of this type  there is always 
the dilemma of  whether to weight by population (thus 
approximating the global picture) or to treat each 
country as a separate and equally impor tant case. 
 Table A2.2 pre sents the Model 4 regressions both 
92. Indeed, eliminating  those variables  causes the gender coefficient to 
increase appreciably.
93.  There is some ambiguity as to  whether or not clustered standard errors 
are called for in this cross- sectional, observational context. Abadie, Athey, 
Imbens, and Wooldridge (2017) tie clustering to the sampling pro  cess and 
assignment of the treatment to groups to clustered standard errors, suggest-
ing that they apply in this case. Mc Ken zie (2017) notes that  there is also con-
fusion surrounding the use of fixed effects that parallel assignment clusters, 
as we do with country dummies.Model 2 adds dummies F for female, Y for income 
quintile, and W for being in the workforce.

2b) Ai,r = β0 + β1Ni,r + β2Pi,r + β3Fi,r + β4Yi,r + β5Wi,r + Cr + εi,r
Model 3 adds three more dummies E for education 
level (completed primary or less, secondary, and com-
pleted tertiary or more).

Model 4 includes dummy G for receiving a govern-
ment transfer in the past 12 months.

Samples
Both “a” and “b” variants of each model are applied to 
Sample A, which includes all 99 countries. Thereafter, the 
“b” variant, which includes country dummies, is applied 
to Sample B, the 33 countries in the lowest tercile of the 
total JAM index, and to Sample C, the 24 countries classi-
fied by the World Bank as Low- Income Countries (LICs). 
Observations are weighted by country according to pop-
ulations; we test the impact of weights in the Part II 
robustness check using uniform country weights.
Results
 Table A2.1 pre sents the log odds ratios for the regres-
sions. Coefficients are generally stable, and all have the 
expected sign. Although the pseudo R- squareds are 
not especially high, the attributes, taken together, 
explain a  great deal of the variation in the probability 
of having a financial account. As expected, income 
quintile, education level, being in the workforce, and

+1—who receive  either kind of transfer; unsurprisingly, the 
coefficient is very high.96 Column 29 further restricts 
the sample to  those who did not receive a transfer to 
 either a mobile phone or a bank account. For this sub-
set,  there is no positive association with financial 
inclusion; indeed, the coefficient is reassuringly nega-
tive. Clearly, the channel for the transfer  matters.
Fi nally, we return to the larger universe of observa-
tions to ask  whether the same results hold for par tic u-
lar subgroups of the sample populations— for example, 
for the poor and for  women. Column 30 restricts the 
model to the bottom two income quintiles of respon-
dents and finds a similar positive association between 
government social transfers and inclusion. Column 31 
additionally restricts this sample to  women and yields 
the same outcome, with an even stronger coefficient. 
We also find the expected associations between gov-
ernment pension transfers among  those same groups 
in final columns of the  table. The relationships hold 
across the dif fer ent samples and channels, providing 
further support for the proposition that transfers can 
be a useful tool for supporting financial inclusion.
Probabilities  under dif  fer ent 
scenarios
To appreciate the implications of the logistic regres-
sions, it is helpful to shift from estimates of log odds 
ratios to probabilities. For Models 3b and 4b in  Table A2.1, 
 Table A2.4 transforms the log odds ratios into proba-
bilities taken at par tic u lar points in the distribution. 
Each model is estimated for the full 99- country sam-
ple, for the lowest JAM tercile country sample, and for 
the LICs.
The first three rows indicate the probability of finan-
cial inclusion for an individual with par tic u lar attri-
bute sets. For the “High” profile, they have an ID and a 
96. If anything, the most in ter est ing part of this observation is that the coef-
ficient is not entirely colinear with inclusion— theoretically, we expect that 
someone receiving a transfer via a mobile phone must have an account to go 
with it, but nonetheless four  people in the entire subsample fit into this 
category.population- weighted (as in columns 13 to 16  in 
 Table A2.1) and with uniform country weights.94 Once 
again, the patterns remain stable across the dif fer ent 
specifications, samples, and models, suggesting that 
 these relationships are quite robust and generalizable 
at a global level.
A closer look at government 
transfers and financial inclusion
The Findex survey asks, among other  things, if respon-
dents received any kind of nonwage support from the 
government. It also inquires into the channels for 
 these transfer payments, although the sample nar-
rows substantially as the detail of the question is 
increased.
 Table A2.3 pre sents coefficients on the transfer vari-
ables using Model 4b and its vector of controls (includ-
ing country dummies and using population weights), 
while iterating with dif fer ent transfer variables and 
over several subsets of the overall sample. Column 2595 
compares the association with receiving a nonwage 
government social transfer with receiving a govern-
ment pension (retirement) transfer in Column 26. 
Both have similar coefficients of reasonable size. 
Twenty- eight  percent of the sample who report receiv-
ing a social transfer also say they receive a government 
pension, so that Column 27 excludes this overlapping 
group to ensure that they are not driving the associa-
tion with financial inclusion. The positive and signifi-
cant coefficient indicates  there is still an association 
between social transfers and inclusion.
 After this, the sample is further restricted with each set 
of questions. Column 28 tests  whether receiving a 
transfer via a mobile phone (social or pension) 
increases inclusion among the subset of respondents 
94. In the Findex survey, sample size can differ across countries. For exam-
ple, Morocco has over 5,000 observations, India and China have around 
3,000 each, most countries have around 1,000, and a few, like Haiti, have 
500. Moving to uniform country therefore requires weighting individual 
observations by the inverse of their country sample size. They can then be 
reweighted according to country populations to derive a population- 
weighted sample.
95. Column 25 replicates column 14 of  Table A2.1.

—+1 Annex 2: Analy  sis of JAM Data from Findex 2017intended to illustrate probabilities around the  middle 
point of the estimated logistic probability curves. As 
shown in the  table, the probability of financial inclu-
sion is very high when all attributes are positive— 
around 84   percent for the entire country sample and 
70 and 82   percent respectively for the lowest JAM ter-
cile and LIC subsamples. Having all attributes low pre-
dicts a very low probability of financial inclusion, mobile phone, are in the workforce, are male, and are 
in the uppermost income decile and education seg-
ment. For the “Low” profile, all of  these attributes are 
unfavorable. The “Mean” profile takes the average of 
the high and low profiles—in effect, an individual with 
a 50   percent probability of being  either High or Low on 
 every attribute. This is not necessarily the profile of a 
representative individual in any given country but is ­ Table­A2 .3 . ­Financial­inclusion: ­Relationship­ to­type­and­modality­­

+1—Fi nally, we consider the role of government transfers in 
promoting financial inclusion. The last two rows of 
 Table A2.4 show how receiving a government transfer 
boosts the probability of financial inclusion. This  will 
differ at dif fer ent points along the logistic curves, so 
that it is necessary to define the other attributes of the 
individual. Since we have less interest in the case of 
 people who are already very likely to be financially 
included, we consider the cases of individuals with Low 
and with Mean profiles. For the former, receiving a 
transfer is associated with a 19   percent probability of 
financial inclusion for the full country sample, com-
pared to a 6   percent probability without the transfers—  
the government transfer increases the probability by 
about 13  percentage points. For the two more  limited 
country samples, the probabilities are boosted by 9 and 
5  percentage points, respectively, prob ably  because 
more transfers are paid in cash in  these countries, but 
the effect is still pre sent. For an individual with a Mean 
profile using the full country sample, receiving govern-
ment transfers increases the probability of inclusion 
from a baseline of 35   percent to 66   percent, a gain of 
31  percentage points. For the other two subsamples, 
government transfers increase the probabilities by 29 
and 19 percentage points, respectively.between 4 and 7   percent across the dif fer ent cases. For 
the Mean profile, the probability of being financially 
included is around 39   percent for the full sample and 
25 to 33   percent for the restricted ones.  These results 
confirm that individual- level attributes play an impor-
tant role in shaping patterns of inclusion and exclu-
sion, in addition to country- level  factors.
The next two rows show probabilities with differential 
access to the other two JAM components: ID and a mobile 
phone. Row 4 shows the case of an individual with all 
unfavorable attributes but with access to ID and mobile; 
row 5 pre sents the case for an individual with other wise 
positive attributes but without access to  these compo-
nents. The effects are striking; for example, when all 
other  factors are positive, not having an ID or a mobile 
reduces the probability of financial inclusion from 
84  percent to around 44   percent; conversely, when all 
 else is negative, having an ID and a mobile is associated 
with an increase in the probability of financial inclusion 
from around 7   percent to around 34   percent. This does 
not, of course, demonstrate that further rolling out ID 
and mobile  will increase financial inclusion to a similarly 
large degree, but it does indicate the extent to which the 
three ele ments of the JAM trinity tend to be associated.­ Table­A2 .4 . ­Computed­probability­ that­an­individual­is­financially­included­­ ­

While  there may be benefits to the recipients as well 
as impor tant externalities for financial system devel-
opment, each case  will be dif fer ent and requires 
evaluating alternative delivery options on their 
merits. These large gains confirm that government transfers 
have been a power ful driver of financial inclusion, 
provided that they have not been paid in cash.  There 
is no indication that the additional income from 
transfers has induced recipients to open accounts. 
The results do not, of course, argue that all transfers
