DIGITAL BANKS: LESSONS FROM KOREA
OCTOBER 2020, NOTE SERIES NUMBER 2
Digital banks have been on the rise as digital technologies transform financial services around
the world. Under the Korean government’s new policy framework for digital banks, K Bank and
Kakao Bank successfully launched in 2017 with convenient and innovative products and
services, and brought a substantial impact on Korea’s banking sector. With their businesses
growing at a fast pace, these banks sought to increase their capital accordingly, but
encountered unforeseen regulatory issues on bank ownership which required new legislation
and regulatory efforts to get resolved. After the first three years of operation, as of July 2020,
the two banks show contrasting track records, mainly explained by differing challenges and
successes in capital increase and marketing. With digital transformation accelerating and
competition heightening, digital banks will need to become even more strategic and innovative
to continue to be successful. This knowledge note was written to take stock of Korea’s
experience with digital banks and share lessons that may be useful for financial policymakers
and market players in banking and fintech.

Introduction
Over the past decade the world has seen a rise of
digital banks. Globally, these banks now number
more than 100[ and range from fully digital retail
banks to marketplace banks to those that provide
‘banking-as-a-service’[. Some prominent names of
fully licensed and independently operating digital
banks include: Japan’s Rakuten Bank (2000), Sony
Bank (2001), and Jibun Bank (2008); Brazil’s Banco
Original (2011) and Nubank (2013); UK’s Tandem
(2013), Atom Bank (2014), Starling Bank (2014),
Monzo (2015), and Revolut (2015); Germany’s N26
(2013) and SolarisBank (2016); China’s WeBank
(2014) and MyBank (2015); Vietnam’s Timo (2015);
Australia’s Volt (2017); and Israel’s Pepper (2017).
Digital banks have grown on the back of falling
trust in the traditional banking sector after the
global financial crisis, advances in technology, and
increasing demand from customers for lower-cost,
more convenient and customer-friendly financial
services.
Korea is not an exception in this global
phenomenon. The country’s high internet
connectivity and strong ICT infrastructure coupled
with the policymaker’s bid to promote more
innovation and competition in the financial sector
brought about the launch of digital banks, or
internet-only banks, in 2017. Although digital
banks started relatively late in Korea[, the
challenges and successes of this dynamic journey
can offer interesting insights to other countries
contemplating similar measures.

2 KPMG, “Taking on the world – the rise of the challenger banks”
(January 2018)
3 CGAP, “Digital banks – How can they deepen financial
inclusion?” (February 2020)
4 There have been earlier attempts to introduce digital banks in
Korea: in 2001 Lotte, SK, and AhnLab created a consortium for a
digital bank but were unsuccessful due to regulatory constraints
and controversies about conglomerates going into the banking
business; in 2008 the government tried to amend the Banking
Act to allow for digital banks but was stopped by the global
financial crisis.
Box 1: What is a digital bank?
   
While there is no standard
definition of a digital bank, in this
note we borrow the definition from
BIS : digital banks are deposit-taking
institutions that are members of a
deposit insurance scheme, that
deliver banking services primarily
through electronic channels instead
of physical branches.
Some terms used interchangeably
with digital bank include challenger
bank, neobank, virtual bank, and
online-only bank. In Korea, the term
‘internet-only bank’ is used in official
documents.12

Lower the capital requirement: For internet-only
banks, FSC would use its discretion to reduce
the minimum capital required under the
Banking Act (the target at the time was 50%).
The rationale given by FSC is that internet-only
banks have lower risk, given that they are
allowed to outsource IT facilities. Instead FSC
would scrutinize their business plans and
ability to raise capital.
Allow the same business scope as commercial
banks: All three banking business categories
defined by Korea’s Banking Act - banking
services, incidental services[, and concurrent
business[ - are allowed for digital banks.
Allow a grace period for prudential regulations:
For capital adequacy ratios, Basel I would be
applied to internet-only banks in the early
stages of operation while Basel III is applied to
commercial banks[. The requirement of
liquidity coverage ratios would also be eased.
After the grace period, when the bank’s asset
size exceeds a certain threshold, such
requirements would be strengthened to the
level of commercial banks.
Other specific measures: i) FSC would allow all
banks to employ non-face-to-face identification
methods[ (e-KYC) effective December 2015; ii)
internet-only banks would be allowed to
engage in the credit card business; and iii)
internet-only banks would be allowed to
outsource their IT facilities.
5 Under the Banking Act, a “non-financial business operator” can acquire up to 10% of a bank’s total shares for investment purposes
//(for which FSC approval is required) but may not exercise voting rights for shares exceeding 4% of the total bank shares. This
//provision was included in the Banking Act to be aligned with the principles of the Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial
//Industry, enacted in 1991 to prevent conglomerates from taking ownership of a bank and using the banking system to their
//advantage.  
6 Guarantee of debts or takeover of notes, mutual savings, factoring, custody activities, collection and payment as an agent, payment
//related to electronic commercial transactions as an agent, etc.
7 Bancassurance, pension, debit/credit cards, trust, investment advisory, brokerage of mutual funds, etc.
8 Basel III is applied to the two digital banks starting from CY2020.
9 A combination of 2 or more of the following methods must be used: (i) verification using copy/photo of ID card, (ii) verification via
//video call, (iii) confirmation during physical delivery of bank cards, and (iv) verification through existing bank accounts.Enhancing competition in the
financial sector through
innovative business models
Ease the shareholding restrictions: Korea’s
Banking Act limits a non-financial company’s
voting rights in a bank to 4 percent[, restricting
the entry of ICT and other non-financial
companies in the banking business. The
masterplan aimed to ease these restrictions
for internet-only banks (the target at the time
was to allow up to 50% of voting rights).In January 2015, Korea’s financial regulator, the
Financial Services Commission (FSC), and financial
supervisor, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS)
jointly announced a masterplan to support the
convergence of finance and technology (see Annex
1), against the backdrop of the global trend of
rapid development of technologies and
disruptions in the financial sector. Establishing the
Korean model of digital banks was one of the main
tasks included in this plan, which was followed by
a more detailed plan in June 2015. The primary
motivation of the authorities behind this
plan was to promote more innovation and
competition in the banking sector, by
lowering the entry barriers and minimizing
excessive ‘ex-ante’ regulations. To this effect
the following key measures were identified in the
detailed plan for digital banks:DIGITAL BANKS IN KOREA

https://www.fnnews.com/news/201908271808012883)Launch of the first digital
banks: K Bank and Kakao Bank
K Bank became the first internet-only bank in
Korea, licensed in December 2016 and launched
in April 2017. Kakao Bank followed soon,
receiving its license in April 2017 and launching
operations in July 2017. The banking license given
to K Bank was the first in 24 years since 1992;
Korea’s banking scene had been quite static after
the large-scale mergers and acquisitions around
the Asian financial crisis. Thus there was
expectation that the emergence of two new banks
would spur competition in the banking sector (see
Annex 2 for an overview). Table 1 summarizes the
capital structure of the two digital banks at the
time of launch.
The respective driving forces behind these banks
were KT and Kakao. KT Corp[ is Korea’s oldest
telecommunication carrier, and Kakao Corp] is the
country’s leading social media and information
technology company. However, as per the Banking
Act, KT and Kakao were able to exercise only 4% of
voting rights in their respective banks, as
described in the previous section.Start with a pilot operation of 1 or 2 digital
banks under the existing Banking Act, and
Later grant additional licenses for more
diverse types of digital banks after the Banking
Act is amended or a new law is legislated with
eased restrictions on shareholding by non-
financial companies.The financial authorities took a two-track
approach to the introduction of digital banks
in Korea:

2.
Impressive customer acquisition
and growth
Kakao Bank and K Bank acquired close to 5 million
and 0.6 million mobile banking users respectively
in 2017 alone. Kakao Bank had over 2 million new
customers signing up in the first 2 weeks of its
operation, thanks to the extreme popularity of
Kakao’s mobile chat application ‘KakaoTalk’ which
they used to advertise the new bank. K Bank
lagged far behind, failing to leverage the 20-
million-large customer base of KT. As of December
2019, Kakao Bank had 11.3 million customers,
amounting to 22% of the country’s entire
population, while K Bank had 1.2 million. Given
their short track record, it is noteworthy that these
new banks were able to acquire customers
comparable in number to the mobile banking
users of long-established incumbent banks].. The
deposits and loans of the two banks also grew in
proportion (see Figure 1).10

The impressive early growth of the two digital
banks had them named among the “Top 50 digital
banks in 2017” by Financial IT, and likewise other
major industry watchers paid much attention to
the rise of these late bloomers among global
digital banks.

New products and customer-
friendly services
Faster e-KYC and easier onboarding: Both
banks took advantage of the removal of the
requirement for the publicly certified digital
signature system for internet banking[ and
replaced it with a much simpler security system. K
//Bank introduced various biometric instruments
like iris and facial recognition to enhance
accessibility, and Kakao Bank allowed fingerprint
and pattern recognition for login, and a single
password for all transactions. Opening an account
at one of these banks can be done under 10
minutes.
Around the clock customer service: As for
customer service, they provided chat-bots and the
like to respond to customer inquiries 24 hours a
day. 
 
Innovative and targeted services aligned with
customer needs: Kakao Bank introduced products
like mobile housing deposit loans, ‘get together

13 Korean National Public Key Infrastructure (NPKI), used for user authentication and transaction confirmation, was introduced in 1999
by the Digital Signature Act which stipulates that where an electronic signature is required, one must use a certificate issued by an
NPKI-accredited certification authority. The regime has long been criticized for going against the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic
Signatures and for its inconvenience and security vulnerabilities. The requirement applied to all internet banking, e-commerce and e-
governments in Korea, until FSC amended relevant regulations to abolish the requirement in 2015 for internet banking. The authorities
took one step further to completely abolish the NPKI certification regime by amending the Digital Signature Act (effective November
2020).13DIGITAL BANKS: LESSONS FROM KOREA PAGE | 06
two digital banks accounted for 22% of all loans
that had lowered rates upon customer request.
The digital banks have removed most fees such as
ATM fees and fund transfer fees, and Kakao Bank
lowered foreign wire transfer and remittances fees
to 1/10 of incumbent banks for select countries.
Could digital banks have been more versatile?
Some argue that the products and services of
these digital banks have not been as innovative as
expected. Neither bank has been able to fully
expand to other business areas allowed by the
Banking Act, due to limitations in capital adequacy
and lack of experience with financial products.
Banking business categories defined by Korea’s
Banking Act comprise banking services, incidental
services[[, and concurrent business[]. Among these
three banking business categories, the digital
banks have offered products mainly in the first
category, banking services, and to a much lesser
extent in the other two categories. However, this
may also be changing: Kakao Bank has already
issued 12 million debit cards by offering attractive
cashback rewards and has recently started to issue
credit cards in partnership with incumbent credit
card companies. It has also partnered with
securities firms to offer account opening services
for securities transactions. 
14 Loans to individuals with a credit rating of grades 4 to 7 (out of a scale of grades 1 to 10), typically self-employed individuals or young
people entering the job world, are referred to as “medium credit loans” in Korea.
15 Guarantee of debts or takeover of notes, mutual savings, factoring, custody activities, collection and payment as an agent, payment

credit score service’. It also launched products such as
‘Safebox’ which guarantees daily interest accrual, and
26-week-installment savings or ‘piggy banks’ that make
saving a fun challenge for users. K Bank introduced
services like ‘my neighborhood ATMs’ utilizing its
shareholders’ large network of convenience stores and
pay phone booths to have ATMs installed and used. It
also offered savings products with special rewards from
their affiliates, such as monthly music-player service
vouchers.
Rapid loan processing and use of alternative credit
scoring systems: Both banks introduced microloans of
under 2,500 USD that could be processed very quickly.
For example, Kakao Bank’s microloans for thin filers like
college students can be approved within 60 seconds,
and other microloans are approved within an hour.
Loans in larger amounts are also processed much
faster than traditional banks, enabled by smartphone
transmission of photos of IDs and employment
certifications. Both banks have also been active in
providing loans to the medium credit[[ market. K Bank
has provided on average 33% of its unsecured loans as
medium credit loans, compared to 10% in the case of
other commercial banks. This was made possible
through the alternative Credit Scoring System (CSS)
developed by KT, leveraging its telecom user database
using de-identified data to assess borrowers’
creditworthiness. Kakao Bank has also developed a
differentiated CSS and has been able to provide
medium credit loans worth nearly KRW 1 trillion in
2019. Both banks have focused on household loans but
plan to expand lending to SMEs and entrepreneurs in
2020.
Proactive and competitive pricing of products and
services: Both digital banks are aggressively pricing
their products, i.e. higher deposit rates and lower loan
rates. K Bank was the first bank in Korea to accept
consumer requests to lower borrowing rates if their
credit rating improves, in response to the new option
granted by the financial authorities. In 2018, the
//////////Financial performance:
mixed results
After three years since launch, the financial
performance of the two digital banks show quite a
contrast. Early-stage investments on IT and
marketing along with aggressive pricing have
taken a toll on the banks’ profitability. However,
Kakao Bank was able to turn this around and
record profit for the first time in 2019 (Table 2).1415 16KOREA OFFICE INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY NOTE SERIES PAGE | 07

profitability is also suffering much more than
Kakao Bank (Table 3).

rapidly, the share of these digital banks in Korea’s
banking assets is still very small. Till end-
December 2018, Kakao Bank and K Bank
collectively accounted for 2% or less of the
retail/consumer loans of domestic commercial

countermeasures
Legal and regulatory challenges
The biggest initial challenge faced by Korea’s
digital banks was the constraint in their
ability to increase capital due to regulatory
restrictions. To preempt conglomerates from
taking ownership of a bank and using the banking
system to their advantage, Korea’s legal
framework[] restricted non-financial shareholders
from holding more than 4% of voting shares in any
bank. This became a major barrier for the digital
banks as they were unable to add sufficient capital
to maintain the capital adequacy required to grow
their business. KaKao and KT, holding 10% and 8%
in their respective banks, had serious limitations in
shareholding and exercising voting rights.
More than a year after the first two digital banks
had been launched, the National Assembly finally
passed new legislation, namely the Act on Special
Cases Concerning Establishment and Operation of
Internet-only Banks (hereinafter “Special Act on
Internet-Only Banks”). The Special Act came into
//////effect in January 2019, raising non-financial
businesses’ voting share limit to 34%. Table 5
summarizes key differences between the Banking
Act and the Special Act on Internet-Only Banks.
However, obstacles continued despite the
new law. In March 2019, Kakao and KT attempted
to increase their share in Kakao Bank and K Bank
respectively to 34% after the enactment of the
Special Act on Internet-Only Banks but
encountered an unforeseen obstacle. The
provisions on major shareholder (holding more
than 10%) qualification disallowed any company
with a record of violating financial, fair trade, or
tax -related laws during the previous 5 years to
become a major shareholder of a bank. Kakao and
KT each had previously violated the Monopoly
Regulation and Fair Trade Act. Fortunately for
Kakao Bank, Kakao’s case was resolved by an
authoritative interpretation of related laws (by the
Ministry of Government Legislation), and KaKao
was approved to become a major shareholder in
July 2019. However, KT’s case did not merit such
regulatory treatment and K Bank had no choice
but to suspend new operations from April 2019
due to insufficient capital. Table 6 shows the
shareholding of the two banks at the end of
2019.///////// 
17 Banking Act (1950 and as amended thereafter) and the Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry (1991 and as
amended thereafter)17KOREA OFFICE INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY NOTE SERIES PAGE | 09
A year after K Bank suspended new operations, the
Special Act on Internet-Only Banks was amended in
April 2020 to ease the provision regarding violation of
the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. K Bank
finally saw light at the end of the tunnel: KT was allowed
to become the majority owner of K Bank but decided to
have its affiliate BC Card take this position. At the end
of July 2020, K Bank is recapitalized with additional
capital of KRW 400 billion (total KRW 900 billion) and BC
Card (34%), Woori Bank (19.9%), and NH Investment &
Securities (10%) as its largest shareholders, ready to hit
the ground running.

Despite widespread adoption of online banking in
the country, digital banks struggle to achieve
primary bank status. Incumbent banks are quickly
catching up with digital banks in terms of customer
convenience, and a large proportion of users are loyal
to the brick and mortar banks that have been an
important part of their lives. Most customers are using
digital banks as a secondary or tertiary account[] and
having their salaries paid into incumbent banks.

Digital banks also face competition from
payment service providers backed by big
techs. Naver, the country’s No.1 internet portal,
has spun off a financial subsidiary to operate
Naver Pay, the mobile payment platform of 30
million users. Naver Financial is set to expand its
products to banking-as-a-service, insurance and
securities through partnerships with financial
companies. Another fierce competitor is Toss, the

users. Naver Financial is set to expand its products

largest fintech startup with 17 million users,
operated by Viva Republica Ltd. Toss is planning to
start a securities brokerage service by 2020 and
start a digital bank by 2021 (see Box 2). In defense,
Kakao Bank is seeking synergy with Kakao Pay,
which boasts 33 million users and has already
launched a securities brokerage service.
The competition will only increase with the
new opportunities on the horizon. The recent
amendment of the three major data laws of
Korea[] (effective July 2020), which had previously
stood in the way of proactive data utilization, has
opened doors for the fintech industry. The eased
data laws aim to (i) minimize redundant regulatory
activities and confusion from previously
overlapping regulations and multiple supervisory
bodies, and (ii) develop a data economy by
introducing the concept of ‘pseudonymised[] data’
and setting a legal basis upon which data may be
utilized more flexibly. Digital banks and fintechs
are now able to develop more innovative and
customized products and services. Given these
new changes, it will be key for the two digital
banks to collaborate effectively with their
shareholders of which several hold huge
databases, to fully harness the power of data.

Toss Bank is slated to become the third digital
bank in Korea, led by the fintech unicorn Viva
Republica. Their mobile simple transfer
application ‘Toss’ which launched in February
2015 is often named among the top fintechs
in the world, and currently boasts Monthly
Active Users of 17 million, one third of Korea’s
entire population. Toss started with simple
transfer services but soon adopted a
marketplace strategy, expanding its services to
mini insurance, customized recommendations
for loans, account opening and other services,
through B2B partnerships with financial
companies. 
   
The Toss Bank consortium received
preliminary approval for an internet-only bank
in December 2019, and has shareholders led
by Toss (34%), KEB Hana Bank (10%), Hanwha
Investment & Securities (10%), KBiz (Korea
Federation of SMEs) (10%), E Land World (10%)
and others, with a capital of KRW 250 billion.
Toss  Bank has started building its IT systems
and is aiming to receive the full banking
license and launch services by 2021. Toss
Bank’s key strategy is to focus on financially
excluded medium credit individuals and small
businesses as its target segments.19

factor in competition in the banking and payment
sectors. As can be seen in the Figure 2, Kakao
Bank is leading in the competition of mobile
banking applications, but incumbent banks are
running closely behind.
Digital banks are also contributing to
expanding credit to the underserved. Korea is
generally considered an ‘overbanked’ society in
terms of savings and payments, but in access to
credit there are still some underserved segments.
Individuals with a credit rating of grades 4 to 7
(out of a scale of grades 1 to 10), who are typically
self-employed individuals or young people
entering the job world, have suffered from lack of
affordable credit. Because their income or sales
are not easily tracked, banks have had challenges
in assessing their creditworthiness. Incumbent
banks have traditionally focused on high income /
high credit individuals or relied on collaterals in
their lending and thus have not actively targeted
this market, commonly referred to as “medium
credit lending” in Korea.KOREA OFFICE INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY NOTE SERIES PAGE | 11

lending rate
for medium
credit (2018)Table 7 shows the latest available data on the
supply of medium credit lending in Korea.
Digital banks have capitalized on this opportunity,
as described in a previous section. Kakao Bank
provided KRW 978.5 billion worth of medium
credit lending in 2019, which is larger than the
total of such lending extended by all banks in 2018
as well as in previous years. K Bank also plans to
jump into this race with their sophisticated CSS
that has a longer track record than that of Kakao
Bank. Digital banks have a comparative advantage
in this market segment as they are able to offer
lower rates than incumbent banks, not to mention
credit card companies and mutual savings banks.
Due consideration should be given to the
preconditions that enabled the successful
launch and early growth of digital banks in
Korea's case. Korea was already enjoying high
internet connectivity at affordable prices, strong
ICT infrastructures, and good technological
capacity of human resources before the time of
the launch. On the demand side there were tech-
savvy customers who hungered for faster, more
convenient, and enjoyable financial services that 
 ///////LESSONS LEARNEDmost incumbent banks were not offering as they
were becoming rather complacent. Last but not
least, there were financial policymakers who
sought to boost competition by encouraging new
banks and followed through persistently with this
policy objective.     
The twist and turn of Korea’s digital banks
underline, among other things, the importance
of aligning the legal and regulatory
framework with new policies in a timely
manner. Despite strenuous efforts from the
financial authorities to remove the regulatory
barriers blocking innovation in the banking sector,
the myriad of Korea’s different laws and
regulations and their interplay proved this to be
very challenging. Also, the authorities’ efforts to
resolve this issue by treating digital banks
differently or preferentially sparked debates on
fairness among scholars, lawmakers, and
practitioners. The regulatory uncertainty and the
long time it took for the regulatory issues to be
resolved weighed down heavily on K Bank
especially and ended up stunting its growth.
Related to this point is the unchanging
significance of capital adequacy for a bank.
However new and innovative a digital bank may be,
as long as it remains a bank that intermediates 
 ////KOREA OFFICE INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY NOTE SERIES PAGE | 13
retail deposits, it must comply with capital
adequacy requirements to protect the depositors.
The two digital banks and the newcomer must be
prepared to bear the heavy frontload investments
to acquire customers, typically through aggressive
promotions and marketing. They should also plan
carefully on how to increase bank capital
sufficiently and in a timely manner to sustain their
growing business.
It is also clear that relentless innovation was
and will remain the name of the game. It is
true that Kakao Bank had relatively less regulatory
issues than K Bank, but more importantly Kakao
Bank was able to attract a much larger number of
customers by having good strategies to approach
them and diligently developing new and innovative
products and services that gained popularity. K
Bank, on the other hand, failed to leave a strong
impression on the quickly changing minds of the
young generation. Whether or not K Bank will be
able to step up and make a grand comeback
remains to be seen. It will also be interesting to
see whether Kakao Bank can continue speeding up
innovation in the face of rapidly increasing
competition.
Digital finance is no longer a want but a
must, as we are witnessing increasingly in this
COVID-19 environment. Not only digital banks but
also conventional banks have no choice but to
push forward on the path of digital
transformation, changing their business and
operating models so that they can better tailor to
the latest demands of customers and push their
employees to work in completely new ways. The
dynamic experience of Korea’s first generation of
digital banks can serve as a good reference for
many banks, fintech firms, and policymakers
around the world in designing their own digital
finance strategies.DIGITAL BANKS: LESSONS FROM KOREA PAGE | 14
