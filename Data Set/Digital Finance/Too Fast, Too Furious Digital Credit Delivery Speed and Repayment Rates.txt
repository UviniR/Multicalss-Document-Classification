11 Introduction
The digital credit market has recently emerged as a source of fast, automated, remotely
provided, short-term loans for millions of people in low- and middle-income countries (Fran-
cis, Blumenstock, and Robinson, 2017). Data harvesting and analytics have enabled digital
credit providers to assess consumers’ creditworthiness and ability to repay without requir-
ing any collateral to secure loans (Björkegren and Grissen, 2018). Thus, digital credit has
the potential to help households cope with unexpected shocks and reduce liquidity con-
straints for investments (e.g., Karlan and Zinman, 2010; Morse, 2011). Indeed, Bharadwaj,
Jack, and Suri (2019) ﬁnd that digital credit in Kenya has improved household resilience to
negative shocks. Furthermore, the fast speed of loan provision allows borrowers to act on
time-sensitive opportunities to a much greater degree than in the past.
While the speed and ease of access to digital credit makes these loans very appealing,
many borrowers struggle to repay them (Carlson, 2017). Digital credit can exacerbate self-
controlproblems, causingoverindebtednessanddefault(SkibaandTobacman,2019), making
it harder to pay bills (Melzer, 2011) and reducing access to future loans if defaulters are
reported to a credit bureau (as is the case in our study).1In addition, anecdotal evidence
shows that borrowers do not fully understand the terms of their loans (e.g., Mazer and
Fiorillo, 2015; McKee, Kaﬀenberger, and Zimmerman, 2015) and may use them to ﬁnance
unproductive, time-sensitive investment and consumption opportunities such as gambling
(Malingha, 2019). This is particularly important, given that the industry suﬀers from high
default rates (27% in our data). Hence, it is not surprising that policy makers have started
to advocate for consumer protection measures targeting the digital credit market (Donovan
and Park, 2019).
In this paper, we study the role of the speed of delivery of digital loans on repayment.
1Evidence from the credit card market shows that less-sophisticated borrowers may be susceptible to
overborrowing, penalties, and backloading repayments (Meier and Sprenger, 2010; Heidhues and Kőszegi,
2010).To date, this policy-relevant issue has not been studied, despite the continuous growth of
this market. We address this knowledge gap with a unique administrative dataset of digital
loans and quasi-experimental variation in the time it takes for a loan to be deposited into
the borrower’s bank account. Speciﬁcally, our data consist of loan records from the full set of
approvedclientsfromadigitallenderoperatinginMexicooveraseven-monthperiodin2018-
2019. Theserecordsincludebothloanapplicationtimestampsanddisbursementtimestamps,
which we use to measure loan delivery speeds. The quasi-experimental variation in delivery
speeds comes from the fact that the company disburses loans in batches, a process that
occurs only two to four times during the day. Loans added ﬁrst to a new batch remain in
the batch longer than those added last, leading to systematic diﬀerences in processing times
between loans. Our empirical strategy identiﬁes the discontinuous changes in processing
times created each time an existing batch is disbursed and a new batch is opened. Crucially,
disbursement times are ex ante unknown to borrowers, and they change daily. Thus, there
is no concern that clients can time their applications for faster service. However, unlike the
standard regression discontinuity (RD) setup, we do not observe the precise moment a batch
is closed; we construct proxies for these cutoﬀ times using a machine-learning technique
applied to our disbursement and application submission time data.
On average, for all borrowers, loans submitted just after one of these proxied cutoﬀs face
an additional delay of 9.81 hours, roughly doubling the total amount of time it takes to
obtain a loan. We ﬁnd that the delay induced by missing a batch cutoﬀ increases repayment
by 5.6 percentage points, corresponding to a roughly 8% increase relative to similar loans
that do not experience the extra delay. These point estimates translate to a 21% reduction in
the likelihood of loan default when loan delivery is slowed down. This ﬁnding is in line with
estimates found in other types of ﬁnancial market interventions within the microﬁnance liter-
ature.2While our ability to explore mechanisms is constrained by the sparse administrative

1data we have access to, suggestive evidence points to behavioral biases and intrahousehold
bargaining as potential mechanisms of these eﬀects.
Our results are related to recent studies in economics showing that waiting periods with-
out any choice restrictions can aﬀect behavior (Imas, Kuhn, and Mironova, 2016; DeJarnette,
2018; Brownback, Imas, and Kuhn, 2019; Thakral and Tô, 2020). Waiting periods are al-
ready used in settings in which myopia and impulsivity are perceived to be particularly
harmful. For example, many U.S. states require waiting periods prior to the purchase of
ﬁrearms (Koenig and Schindler, 2018; Edwards, Nesson, Robinson, and Vars, 2018). They
are also implemented in negotiations (Brooks, 2015) and conﬂict resolution (Burgess, 2004).
Our study also relates to the more traditional literature on behavioral biases in consumer
ﬁnancial choice. Behavioral biases induce agents to engage in suboptimal behavior, such
as reducing earnings from investments (e.g., Duﬂo, Kremer, and Robinson, 2011; Kremer,
Lee, Robinson, and Rostapshova, 2013) or reducing savings (Dupas and Robinson, 2013). A
common solution to these biases is to design ﬁnancial products that impose restrictions on
agents.3
2 Setting
Our sample consists of loans from an online digital lender in Mexico. The loan amounts
range from 1,500 to 3,000 Mexican pesos (approximately USD 75 to 150),4and the loan
terms vary from seven to 30 days. The APRs reach up to 478.8%. The characteristics of
(2013) ﬁnds that providing a repayment grace period reduces repayments by 6 p.p. (a 370% change relative
to mean default); Feigenberg, Field, and Pande (2013) varies MFI group meeting intensity and ﬁnds that
more frequent meetings increase repayments by 5.1 p.p. (a 72% decrease in mean default); Karlan, Morten,
and Zinman (2015) likewise ﬁnds a 3.7 p.p. decrease in loans with unpaid balance after 30 days when
borrowers are sent SMS reminders (a 27% reduction).
3Examples include commitment savings accounts (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin, 2006), and frequent ﬁxed
payments for microﬁnance borrowers (Bauer, Chytilová, and Morduch, 2012; Field et al., 2013).
4The exchange rate during the study period is approximately USD 1= MXP 20.
2this loan product are comparable to those of other digital lenders in the market. Potential
borrowers interact with the lender using a browser on a smartphone or a computer. The
lender’s home page prominently reports the interest rate and other costs, including taxes
and fees, at the bottom of the window. Potential borrowers are advised that they can get a
loan in “minutes.”
2.1 Loan application and delivery process
Users start their application by selecting the amount and term of the loan. Applicants
need to satisfy the following requirements to obtain a loan: proof of citizenship (a photo
of the national identiﬁcation card); age between 20-65 years; a photo taken from a phone
or computer camera; regular income (from a credit report); cellphone number and e-mail
address; and a bank account. For ﬁrst-time applicants the digital lender pulls the applicant’s
credit history from a credit bureau.
Loan application and preapproval occur online during a single browsing session. Suc-
cessful applicants are notiﬁed that their loans have been preapproved and will be issued
once they have been processed. Borrowers undergo veriﬁcation, which, for ﬁrst-time clients,
includes a call from a customer service representative.
Processed loans are entered into a spreadsheet, which serves as a delivery queue. Loans
accumulate in the queue until an employee sends the whole batch to the lender’s bank for
processing. Once the bank receives a batch, all loans in the batch are disbursed immediately
to borrowers’ bank accounts. Loans can be repaid anytime after they have been deposited,
but the repayment amount includes interest for the full approved duration of the loan.
32.2 Sample
Our sample consists of 11,512 approved loan applications from 7,206 unique borrowers, with
loans disbursed between November 2018 and May 2019.5Forty-eight percent of the loans in
oursamplearefromﬁrst-timeborrowers. Foranyborrower, weobserveuptothreeloans. We
are given access to the following administrative data: the timestamps of all loan application
submissions and loan disbursements; the repayment status and date of ﬁnal repayment for
each loan; the borrower’s age, sex, marital status, number of dependents, and personal
income as reported in their ﬁrst loan application; and the loan sequence (whether this is the
borrower’s ﬁrst, second, or third loan). Furthermore, we have information on requested and
approved loan amounts and terms for ﬁrst-time loans but not for repeat loans.
As shown in Appendix Table A1, the borrowers are poorer than the average Mexican
worker, with a self-reported median monthly income below 1,000 pesos (52 USD). Of all the
borrowers, 45% are female, and 11% lack a credit report. On average, ﬁrst-time borrowers
receive 1,785 pesos (approximately 25% of the average monthly income). Loan processing
times, which we refer to as delays, are calculated as the time diﬀerence between loan appli-
cation submission by the client and disbursal by the bank. On average, ﬁrst-time borrowers
face a delay of 26 hours, while for repeat borrowers, it is 9 hours.
Our main outcome variable is repayment. On average, 73.3% of the loans in our sample
are repaid, which implies a default rate of 26.7%. For ﬁrst-time loans. the default rate is
32%, while for repeat borrowers, it is 22%.6A lower rate for the latter group is expected
since repeat loans are given conditional on past repayment. Appendix Table A2 shows the
relationship between borrower/loan characteristics and repayment likelihood. As expected,
5The raw data from the lender contain 15,882 loans. Of these loans, 669 had missing submission times,
and three were reported disbursed before they were submitted. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 detail the additional
steps to determine the estimation sample.
6Unfortunately, we cannot tell whether overdue loans have been partially repaid. It is possible that some
of the defaulted loans were repaid after we received the data.
4income and credit score tend to positively correlate with repayment. The term of a loan
correlates negatively with repayment, but the amount of the loan does not.
3 Empirical strategy
Our empirical strategy takes advantage of the fact that while loan applications occur con-
tinuously throughout the day, loans are disbursed in batches. We compare loans that are
submitted by clients in time to be included in a particular batch to those submitted slightly
later that do not. Crucially, borrowers are unaware of this batching process. In addition, in
any given day, there are no set times at which batches are sent to the bank for disbursal.7
Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed timeline of loan applications and disbursements to illustrate
our approach to identiﬁcation. Individuals apply for loans at diﬀerent points in time. Once
processed, loans are assigned to the existing disbursement batch. For example, loans kandl
are both processed prior to the Batch A cutoﬀ, and thus assigned to Batch A and disbursed
att2, while loans m,n, andoare approved after Batch A has been disbursed. Thus, they
are assigned to Batch B and disbursed at t4.
For each batch, we deﬁne a batch cutoﬀ as the latest point in time at which a loan
application could be submitted by a client and make it into that batch. This means that no
loans received after a batch cutoﬀ can possibly be in that batch. However, it is also possible
that some loans received prior to a cutoﬀ will end up in later batches. For example, in Figure
1, both loans landoare submitted prior to the Batch A cutoﬀ. Loan lis quickly approved
and ends up in Batch A, while loan otakes longer and ends up in Batch B.
Our empirical strategy is best illustrated by the comparison between loans landm.
These loans have been submitted by two separate clients around the same time and take a
similar amount of time to be veriﬁed. However, because they fall on diﬀerent sides of the
Batch A cutoﬀ time t1, loanlis delivered much more quickly.
7This situation also implies that the lender is not aware of these batch cutoﬀ times in advance, either.
5Figure 1:Hypothetical timeline of loan submission, veriﬁcation and disbursement
Loanveriﬁcationprocessincludesthetimebetweenapplicationsubmissionandpre-approvalbytheclientandthetimeplacement
of the approved loan into the loan delivery queue (the batch). The LBC line stands for “lower bound cutoﬀ”, as deﬁned in
section 3.1.
To implement this strategy, we ﬁrst assign every loan to the closest batch cutoﬀ (based on
its application submission time). Next, we create an indicator called PostBatch that takes
a value of one if the application was submitted after its assigned cutoﬀ. In our example,
the indicator takes the value of zero for loan land one for loan m. Then, we compute a
continuous variable labeled DistanceToBatch that represents the time of loan application
submission minus the assigned batch cutoﬀ time.
For each loan jof applicant i, we run the following regression:
Yij=1DistanceToBatch ij+2PostBatch ij+
3DistanceToBatch ijPostBatch ij+Xij+ij (1)
6whereXcontrols for individual borrower characteristics and a variety of application time
ﬁxed eﬀects (hour-of-day, day-of-week, and month). Our main outcome variable is whether
the loan was repaid. The coeﬃcient 2identiﬁes the eﬀect of missing a batch cutoﬀ under
the assumption that borrowers near the cutoﬀ (on either side) are similar in terms of ex ante
repayment/default likelihood.
To estimate Equation (1) and plot the results, we use the rdrobust suite of commands
developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, and Titiunik (2017). The commands allow for op-
timal bandwidth selection and automatically provide conﬁdence intervals robust to bias in-
duced by the optimal bandwidth selection. We also report speciﬁcations with ﬁxed two-hour
bandwidths, that exactly match our discontinuity ﬁgures. Because PostBatch is assigned at
the loan level, we do not cluster standard errors.8
3.1 Data construction
Ourempiricalstrategyrequirestheidentiﬁcationofbatchesandbatchtimes. Hereweoutline
our procedure and refer to Appendix B for additional details.
Constructing batches We do not explicitly observe the batch to which a loan is assigned,
nor we know when a batch is submitted to the bank for disbursement. In our example shown
in Figure 1, this means that we do not observe the batches’ disbursement times t2andt4. In
any given day, most loan deposit times are bunched together in time, and within a bunch,
they are disbursed within seconds or milliseconds from one another. Therefore, we use a
K-means clustering algorithm for disbursement times to reconstruct the batches for each
day.
Constructing the cutoﬀs Next, for each batch, we determine the batch cutoﬀ times
(e.g.t1andt3in Figure 1). Recall that these times represent the latest moment a loan
8See Abadie, Athey, Imbens, and Wooldridge (2017).
7processed in the same batch as the LBC loan (Panel A), in the next batch (Panel B), or in
the following batches (Panel C) as a function of DistanceToBatch and the LBC (which is
centered at zero). In total, 70% of the loans issued before the cutoﬀ are disbursed within
the same batch as the LBC loan. Because of the way the LBC is constructed, there are
no loans after the LBC time (Panel A) in the LBC batch. Panel B and, to a lesser extent,
Panel C show that the likelihood of a loan being processed in subsequent batches jumps
immediately after the LBC. The discontinuity is very sharp for repeat loans and less clearly
deﬁned for ﬁrst-time loans (see Appendix Figures A1 and A2). This ﬁnding is in line with
the expectation that there is more volatility in the length of time it takes to verify a ﬁrst-time
borrower than a repeat borrower.
3.2 Cutoﬀs and selection
Finally, we discuss three issues that arise with our approach and their solution. First, the
density of submission times after an LBC is lower than the density before it (see Appendix
Figure A3). This is not due to active manipulation by the applicants or the lender; it arises
mechanically since by deﬁnition, an LBC is the submission time of the last loan that is
included in the batch.11
Second, LBC loans are diﬀerent from other loans in that they are processed quickly. The
average delay in disbursing LBC loans is 4.4 hours, compared to 10.7 hours for applications
submitted in the ﬁve minutes prior to the LBC. One reason for this is that LBC loans are
selected on speed; if a loan is unable to be processed quickly, it is unlikely to become the
last loan to make it into a batch. Thus, it is likely that LBC loans might also be diﬀerent
along unobservables.
Third, loans submitted just after the LBC may be more diﬃcult to process than loans
11This phenomenon is similar to what Miller and Sanjurjo (2018) call “streak selection bias” in the context
ofcollectingdatatoanalyzethehothandfallacy, andcanbeshowninasimulationofourdatawithauniform
density of submission times.
9submitted just before it. If they were not, they would have been included in the batch with
the LBC loan and become the LBC themselves. Figure 2 provides a visual conﬁrmation
that loan applications submitted shortly after the LBC (within approximately the next 20
minutes) are diﬀerent from later applications: they have a lower likelihood of being processed
in the next batch (Panel B) and are more likely to be processed in future batches (Panel
C). Appendix B.3 provides additional evidence that loan applications submitted within 20
minutes after the LBC are negatively selected along observables.
We address these issues by dropping from the analysis LBC loans and all loans received
within20minutesaftertheLBC(863and512loans, respectively). Inotherwords, weemploy
a one-sided “half-doughnut RD,” where we drop only the right side of the doughnut hole.12
This process yields our estimation sample of 11,512 loans. With the half-doughnut RD, the
loan submission density and the observable characteristics of the borrower are smooth across
the cutoﬀ (see evidence in Appendix B.3). This process has the added beneﬁt of reducing
measurement error associated with proxying for the cutoﬀ as long as we do not overshoot
the true cutoﬀ by more than its distance to the LBC. As shown in the following Section our
results do not vary with the size of the half doughnut (i.e. post-LBC exclusion window).
4 Results
4.1 First stage
We begin by showing that the batching process causes loan applications submitted after
LBCs to be disbursed with longer delays. To do so, we estimate Equation (1) using the
delay length (in hours) as the dependent variable. We winsorize the delay distribution at
the 90th percentile to account for a large right tail that is not of interest: the longest delay
12Note that selection concerns are absent for the loans that were submitted before the LBC because those
loans are processed in either the same batch as the LBC or in following batches, i.e., they are not selected
based on their batching. We thus include all loans leading up to the LBC.
10Appendix Table A3 reports RD estimates using both a model that exactly matches the
speciﬁcation in Figure 3 and optimal-bandwidth models controlling for borrower demograph-
ics and application submission time ﬁxed eﬀects. In every speciﬁcation, there is a large and
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of the cutoﬀ on loan delay. We estimate that missing the cutoﬀ
increases the borrower’s wait time by almost 10 hours, eﬀectively doubling the wait time.
The increase in the delay is similar for ﬁrst-time and repeat loans (11 and 8 hours, respec-
tively), which implies a 63% increase in delays for ﬁrst-time loans and a 228% increase for
repeat loans. In addition, the induced delays greatly decreases the likelihood of same-day
disbursement. Appendix Table A4 shows that the impact of missing a batch cutoﬀ on the
likelihood that a borrower receives her loan on the same day falls by 24 percentage points.
4.2 Main results: eﬀect of delays on repayment
We now estimate the eﬀects of the delay-inducing cutoﬀ on loan repayment rates. Figure 3,
Panel B, displays the half-doughnut RD plots for loan repayment. We observe an increase in
the likelihood of repayment at the 20-minute post-LBC cutoﬀ for the full sample, ﬁrst-time
loans, and repeat loans. The corresponding regression estimates are reported in Table 1. The
speciﬁcation in column (1) matches Figure 3: it uses a two-hour bandwidth, uniform kernel,
and linear estimation. Columns (2)-(4) use optimal bandwidth selection and a triangular
estimation kernel. We allow for an asymmetric optimal bandwidth because the exclusion of
loanssubmittedwithin20minutesfollowingtheLBCcreatesanasymmetryindensityaround
the post-LBC latent cutoﬀ. Panel A shows the full sample estimates, and Panels B and C
show estimates for ﬁrst-time and repeat loans, respectively. Below each estimate, we report
the following information: the heteroskedasticity-robust p-values of the linear estimates;
the bias-correction- and heteroskedasticity-robust p-values of the quadratic, bias-corrected
estimates;13the eﬀect magnitude as a percentage of the pre-cutoﬀ mean repayment within
13The ﬁrst p-value has the advantage of pertaining to the point estimate of interest, but it does not
account for potential bias due to bandwidth selection. The second one accounts for bias due to bandwidth
12two hours of the cutoﬀ; the optimal bandwidth as determined by the rdrobust command;
and the number of observations within that optimal bandwidth.14
For the full sample, the induced delay (10 hours on average) increases repayment rates by
six percentage points, which corresponds to an 8% increase in repayment rates (equivalently,
a 21% reduction in the default rate). The eﬀect is similar in magnitude across speciﬁcations
and is always statistically signiﬁcant according to both sets of p-values. Column (4) shows
a statistically signiﬁcant 7.4 percentage point (10%) increase in repayment for repeat loans
and an almost statistically signiﬁcant 5.4 percentage point (8%) increase in repayment for
ﬁrst-time loans. The diﬀerences in estimates however, are not statistically signiﬁcant.
These results demonstrate a causal eﬀect of induced delays on repayment: a 5.6 percent-
age point increase in repayment in response to an induced additional delay of 9.81 hours
(estimates from column (4) of Panel A in Table 1 and Appendix Table A3, respectively).
Back-of-the-envelope calculations imply an increase of 0.6 percentage points per hour of
induced additional delay. Alternatively, we can directly estimate the causal eﬀect of loan
disbursement delay on repayment rates (albeit at the same margin as the crude calculation)
using two-stage least squares. We instrument for loan disbursement delay using our regres-
sion discontinuity model from Equation (1) using a ﬁxed bandwidth of two hours.15This
approach yields slightly smaller but qualitatively similar results; using the most robust spec-
iﬁcation in the full sample, we estimate that each hour of induced delay increases repayment
rates by 0.4 percentage points ( p= 0:016). Estimates are shown in Appendix Table A5.
Finally, Appendix Figure A4 shows that the estimates are robust to the post-LBC exclusion
window.
selection, but it pertains to the quadratic estimate used for bias correction, not the linear estimate of interest.
14The sample that is fed into the optimal bandwidth algorithm is held ﬁxed across speciﬁcations. The
number of observations within the optimal bandwidth varies slightly across speciﬁcations as the optimal
bandwidth changes when adding controls.
15The use of least squares implies a uniform estimation kernel.

observations within the used bandwidth. The overall sample sizes for each panel correspond to all loans within twelve hours
of an LBC. Column (2) has no control variables, column (3) controls for application submission day-of-week, hour-of-day and
month ﬁxed eﬀects, and column (4) adds borrower controls (age, age squared, sex, marital status, number of dependents, log
income, and credit score). In Panels A and C, we also add a ﬁxed eﬀect for a borrower’s sequential loan number in column (3).
144.3 Heterogeneity analysis
In Appendix Table A6, we report the impact of induced delays on repayment by marital
status (single/divorced/widowed vs. married), income (below/above median), and credit-
worthiness. We ﬁnd an eﬀect of 10.8 percentage points ( p= 0:003) for the married sample
and null eﬀects for the unmarried sample. Regarding income, we ﬁnd an eﬀect of 7.9 per-
centage points ( p= 0:011) for individuals with above-median income and an eﬀect of 2.8
percentage points ( p= 0:424) for individuals with below-median income. Additional esti-
mates show an eﬀect of 14.2 percentage points (p = 0:001) for borrowers assessed by the
lender to have a “better” or “best” credit score and of 3.3 percentage points ( p= 0:251) for
those rated “average,” “marginal,” or “none.”
In addition, Appendix Table A7 splits the sample between applications received before
and after noon. Afternoon applications remain longer in batches and are more likely to be
delayed until the next day than morning applications. The eﬀects are stronger for the former
group(7percentagepoints, p= 0:02)relativetomorningapplications(2.8percentagepoints,
p= 0:53).
4.4 Timing of repayment
Our analysis thus far has considered the eﬀect of delays on whether a loan was repaid. Now,
we study when loans are repaid. For this analysis, we rearrange our data as a panel. For
each loan in the sample, we deﬁne the time dimension as the number of days since the loan
was disbursed, ranging from zero to 356 (the latest repayment we observe). For each loan
observation day, a loan is classiﬁed as repaid or not. We estimate the eﬀect of missing a batch
cutoﬀ using our regression discontinuity speciﬁcation one day at a time. These estimates
measure the diﬀerence in repayments for each date.
Figure 4 plots the RD estimates over time. Panel A reports the estimates for the re-
payment periods 1-30 days after loan disbursement. We label the period before seven days
as the “early” repayment period because the shortest possible loan term is seven days (note
15extended repayment period corresponds to the RD estimate in Table 1.16As a ﬁnal check,
we separately analyze loans submitted between November and January from later loans.
Estimates are similar in both samples, conﬁrming that additional time to repay a loan does
not have an eﬀect on repayments.
4.5 Lender’s proﬁtability
Finally, we study the eﬀects of loan delays on future borrowing behavior and on the proﬁts
of the lender. First-time borrowers whose loans are delayed may be more likely to repay
their initial loans and, consequently, may be more likely to borrow as they become eligible to
borrow again. At the same time, they might reduce their demand for credit if they believe
the lender is too “slow”. In Appendix C, we show that there are positive but statistically
insigniﬁcant delays on the likelihood of borrowing again, on the repayment behavior of future
loans, and on the total number of loans taken. Lacking evidence of negative eﬀects of the
delay, wearguethattheoverallimpactofdelaysontheproﬁtabilityofthelenderispositive.17
4.6 Mechanisms
Several mechanisms might explain our ﬁndings. Despite the limited administrative data, we
are able to speculate about the likely channels and exclude others.
Loan declines and early repayments We ﬁrst rule out the possibility that borrowers
facing a delay decline the loan before it is issued. This could explain our ﬁndings if loan
declines are disproportionally found among borrowers with a low likelihood of repayment.
We obtained from the lender a separate dataset of successful applications that ended in the
16We do not observe the loan term for repeat loans. Hence, we do not carry out an analysis of timely
loan repayments. When we break down ﬁrst-time loans by their duration, we obtain point estimates that
are consistent with the ﬁndings in this section, but are also noisy.
17Note, however, that as we do not have information on the cost side of the ﬁrm, our welfare analysis is
limited in its ability to quantify the eﬀects of the intervention on ﬁrm proﬁts.
17client rejecting the loan prior to disbursement. For the study period, we identiﬁed a total of
557 approved loans that were rejected by the applicant prior to disbursement. These make
up 2.5% of all loans disbursed, a fraction too small to drive the results.
Asecondpossibilityisthatclientsreturneddelayedloansimmediatelyafterdisbursement.
However, Figure 4 shows that there is no diﬀerence in repayments between delayed and
immediate loans disbursed in that time period. Moreover, only 8% of all loans were returned
within seven days of disbursement.
Increased deliberation A plausible explanation for our results is that disbursement de-
lays provide borrowers with extra time to deliberate about the use of their approved loans.
Existing research suggests that waiting periods (which provide the time for deliberation)
improve the consumption choices individuals make (Imas et al., 2016; DeJarnette, 2018;
Brownback et al., 2019),18and could induce borrowers to make a repayment plan (Thakral
and Tô, 2020). In our context, increased deliberation could convince borrowers to change
the use of the loan so that they have more liquidity at the time of repayment.19Alterna-
tively, it might induce borrowers to develop a robust repayment plan. Unfortunately, our
administrative data do not contain information about the intended or actual use of loans or
about borrowers’ repayment plans.
Household dynamics As discussed earlier, the eﬀect of delays is stronger for married
applicants and for applications submitted in the afternoon, which are more likely to be de-
layed overnight. We speculate that without a delay, an individual may be able to apply
for, obtain, and use a loan without confronting their partners, while household bargaining
18Imas et al. (2016) ﬁnd that enforcing waiting periods to temporally separate the news about a new
consumption choice set from the ability to make a choice from that set leads to a substantial increase in
patient choices.
19This situation presumes a certain elasticity in the use of the loan. Evidence from the microﬁnance
industry suggests that credit use is ﬂexible and responds to the characteristics of the loan (Field et al.,
2013).
18becomes an issue if disbursement is delayed overnight. Intrahousehold negotiations could
improve repayments through deliberation (as discussed above) or through a pooling of re-
sources. Further analysis in Appendix Table A8 indicates that the eﬀect of marital status
is mediated by gender. The eﬀect of the delay for married women is 18.3 percentage points
(p= 0:002), while for unmarried women, it is -3.1 percentage points ( p= 0:464), while there
are no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences for married and unmarried men. These eﬀects point
to potentially interesting intrahousehold dynamics that merit further study but are beyond
the scope of this paper due to space and data limitations.
Time-sensitive loan needs Borrowers facing time-sensitive consumption or investment
opportunities that expire before loans are delivered might not want a loan after it is received.
Higherrepaymentscouldbeexplainedbythefactthatfundshavebeenunused. Alternatively,
delayedborrowerswithurgentneedscouldseekalternativesourcesofcreditfromotherdigital
lenders. This additional credit could provide the necessary liquidity to repay delayed loans
but at the cost of a higher level of overall debt.20
5 Conclusion
We study whether one of the primary features of digital credit—the speed of delivery of
funds—aﬀects the likelihood that a loan is repaid. To date, despite the continuous growth of
thismarket,thisquestionremainsunanswered. Thisispartlybecausedetailedadministrative
dataarenoteasilyavailable. Ourstudycombinesdiﬃcult-to-obtainadministrativedatafrom
a digital lender with a robust identiﬁcation strategy, and shows that reducing the speed of
delivery of digital loans increases the likelihood that loans are repaid by 6 percentage points.
20While we cannot directly explore credit use with our data, we can explore the role of liquidity on
repayments. We are able to rule out the earnings cycle as a confounding factor: we replicate our results
after dropping loans that are due within two days of payday (mid-month and end of month) and our results
remain very similar.
19This corresponds to a 21% reduction in the likelihood of loan default.
These ﬁndings naturally raise the question of whether regulating the speed of digital
credit disbursement, such as by imposing a waiting period on loan delivery, could protect
consumers from avoidable defaults. While our analysis is suggestive, the full answer re-
quires a careful welfare analysis. In our setting, a number of mechanisms are consistent
with our results, so it is unclear whether the overall eﬀect of delays on borrowers is positive.
On the one hand, higher repayments lead to higher credit scores and improved future loan
terms. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that consumers miss out on timely and
proﬁtable opportunities, are unable to address an immediate need, or address their need
by taking loans from other sources and increasing their overall indebtedness. We can be
more conclusive about the eﬀect of delays to the lender: proﬁts are higher for delayed loans.
Overall, our study justiﬁes further work on mandatory waiting periods for digital credit as
a potential consumer protection measure.

Notes: All estimated discontinuities are from linear models that exclude the LBC loan, and loans received within 20 minutes
after the LBC. All estimates are from speciﬁcations with a triangular estimation kernel, and an optimal bandwidth selected from
a 12-hour window around the LBC. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors of the linear estimates are shown in parentheses
below the estimates, calculated using the nearest-neighbor variance estimator with a minimum of three matches. We report both
the heteroskedasticity-robust p-values of the linear estimates, and the bias-correction- and heteroskedasticity-robust p-values of
the quadratic, bias-corrected estimates. We also report the estimated eﬀect as a percentage of the pre-cutoﬀ mean repayment
rate within the two-hour bandwidth. The optimal bandwidths –rounded to the nearest integer– are reported, observations
within the used bandwidth are reported below, and all observations within twelve hours of an LBC below that. All estimates
feature ﬁxed eﬀects for the hour-of-day, day-of-week, month of application submission, and the borrower’s sequential loan
number. All estimates feature controls for age, age squared, sex, marital status, number of dependents, log income, and credit
score. These controls drop out when they are the heterogeneous variable of interest.

35violation of smoothness at the LBC.
Additionally, there is a selection issue for both LBC loans and loans submitted just after
theLBC.ItispossiblethatloansaftertheLBCwereprocessedinsubsequentbatchesbecause
they were more diﬃcult to process; if they had been easy to process, they would have been
included in the batch with the LBC loan, and become the LBCs themselves. If processing
diﬃculty is negatively correlated with borrower quality, a failure to ﬁx these issues could
lead to biased estimates of the 2coeﬃcient in Equation (1) towards indicating harmful
eﬀects of induced delays. For example, a failure of the borrower to pick up the phone the
ﬁrst time they are called for identity veriﬁcation could be correlated with borrower quality.
The average time from submission to disbursement is 19.6 hours for loans submitted within
20 minutes after the LBC, and 17.7 hours for loans submitted 20-60 minutes after the LBC.
This supports the idea that loans right after the LBC take longer to process, and that they
could be negatively selected.
To determine how to exclude these loans, we ﬁrst consider the smoothness of the density
of the running variable above the LBC. We use the “rddensity” suite of commands developed
by Cattaneo et al. (2018) to determine where the right side of the density shown in Appendix
Figure A3 achieves smoothness, starting from the LBC; where does it shift from outlier loans
that couldn’t be processed quickly enough to be the LBC to typical loans that simply missed
the previous batch? Starting at ﬁve minutes post-LBC, we test for smoothness through
each ﬁve-minute increment above the LBC, up to one hour. We use the optimal bandwidth
approach, with bias-correction robust standard errors. Appendix Table A9 shows the p-value
associated with each test, along with the optimal bandwidth and eﬀective observation count.
The ﬁrst failure to reject is at 15-minutes post LBC, although the estimated optimal
bandwidth exceeds the given range (a test with a symmetric bandwidth of just under 15
minutes yields a p-value of 0.175). Beginning with 20-minutes post-LBC, we always reject
the null with a well-deﬁned bandwidth.
Does a 20-minute exclusion window make sense using other approaches? We now test

Notes:this bandwidth is outside the range of the data. Optimal bandwidths are rounded to the nearest integer.
Discontinuities are estimated with a quadratic ﬁt of the density and a triangular kernel. We use distinct optimal
bandwidths left and right of the cutoﬀs to allow for the larger amount of data to the right of these cutoﬀs to
improve precision. p-values are from the heteroskedasticity and bias-correction robust standard errors, calculated

directly for smoothness in a key observable –creditworthiness– through post-LBC cutoﬀs.
Using the rdrobust optimal bandwidth approach, in Table A10, we show how the assessed
credit score category of borrowers changes when a batch cutoﬀ is missed. Of the 65 p-
values in the table, only two are less than 0.05, and both of these are associated with fewer
“best” score borrowers being in the sample after the LBC –consistent with our concern
regarding negative selection in this period right after the LBC. Focusing on that credit
score category, the discontinuities at zero, ﬁve, ten, and 15 minutes post-LBC are at least
marginally statistically signiﬁcant, and we fail to reject smoothness at twenty minutes.

42Finally, in Table A11, we test for whether observable borrower characteristics are smooth
through the 20-minute post-LBC cutoﬀ, using the rdrobust optimal bandwidth approach.
Note that while these borrower characteristics are ﬁxed at the individual level (we only
observe loan amount and length for the ﬁrst loan), the unit of observation is the loan: a
particular borrower can experience both sides of the cutoﬀ. Therefore, we use the full sample
of loans. Since we fail to measure any signiﬁcant or large jump at the cutoﬀ for any variables,
we use the 20-minute post-LBC latent cutoﬀ as our preferred speciﬁcation.

Notes: Estimates exclude the LBC loan, and loans received within 20 minutes after the LBC. All speciﬁcations use a triangular
estimation kernel, and an optimal bandwidth selected from a 12-hour window around the LBC. Heteroskedasticity-robust
standard errors (calculated using the nearest-neighbor variance estimator with a minimum of three matches) are shown. We
also report the bias-correction- and heteroskedasticity-robust p-values of the quadratic, bias-corrected estimates. The reports
eﬀect size is as a percentage of the pre-cutoﬀ mean value of the borrower characteristic within the two-hour bandwidth. The
optimal bandwidths (rounded to the nearest integer) are reported along with observations within the used bandwidth. The
overall sample size for all models in the table corresponds to all loans within twelve hours of an LBC.
One test that we do not report in full is the test for density smoothness of the running
variableDistanceToBatch with loans right after the LBC excluded. This is because failure
to reject here can come either from densities that match up nicely at the post-LBC cutoﬀ,
or from an increase in the standard error in the exclusion window to the left of the cutoﬀ.
Without data in the region around the cutoﬀ, the uncertainty about the density is large. In
the main analysis, this simply reduces our power. However, in this analysis, where we are
seeking a region where we cannot reject smoothness, it may lead us to be too conﬁdent in
the selection of a smaller exclusion window.
43C Impact of delays on lender
In this appendix we explore the eﬀects of delays on the welfare of the ﬁrms. For this
discussion, we ﬁrst note that we do not have information on the cost side of the ﬁrm,
limiting our ability to quantify the impact on ﬁrm proﬁts.
First, note that the primary cost associated with a loan that has been issued is following
upwithcollectionincasetheloanisdelinquent. Assumingthatthelenderpursuesdelinquent
loans only if doing so is proﬁtable, it is likely that the increased repayment of delayed loans
increases the ﬁrms’ proﬁts.
Next, in addition to the positive, direct eﬀect of the delay on the proﬁts of the ﬁrm, there
are indirect eﬀects to consider–namely, the knock-on eﬀects of delays on the clients’ demand
for future loans. There are two potentially countering eﬀects of the delay on demand. One
the one hand, the lender oﬀers additional loans only to clients who have not in arrears.
Because delayed loans are repaid more often, the lender increases its potential client base.
On the other hand, borrowers whose loans have been delayed might be less willing to borrow
again from this lender, as the delay could be construed as a signal of low lender quality
(or simply a lender that is too “slow”.) This could depress the demand. Finally, note that
borrowers that are induced to repay and then borrow again might be “marginal” borrowers,
i.e., they have a high propensity to default on future loans.21
We study these eﬀects by measuring the eﬀect of being delayed on the ﬁrst loan on the
likelihood of borrowing again. In our analysis, we limit the sample to ﬁrst-time borrowers
whofallwithinthe2-hourbatchdisbursalwindow, andestimateequation(1)onthefollowing
outcomevariables: whethertheclientborrowedat least onemoretime; whethertheborrower
repaid the second loan (conditional on borrowing a second time); and the total number of
loans the borrower obtained from the lender. In these regressions, PostBatch iis an indicator
for the borrower having missed the cutoﬀ time at the time of the ﬁrstloan application,
21We do not consider here other second-order eﬀects of delays, such as the possibility that they negatively
impact the reputation of the lender and make acquisition of new clients more expensive.
44and the set of controls XiincludeDistanceToBatch (the number of minutes between the
submission time of the ﬁrst loan and the LBC loan); day-of-week, hour of day and month
ﬁxed eﬀects; and borrower controls.
Estimates of are presented in the table below, with and without controls. None of the
estimates are statistically signiﬁcant, although all the estimates are positive. Delays are not
aﬀecting the likelihood that borrowers take on credit in the future (columns 1 and 2), that
they repay their second loan if they borrow again (columns 3 and 4), or the total number of
loans (columns 5 and 6). It is possible that the lack of statistically signiﬁcant results is due
to the limited number of observations; note that the p-value for the total number of loans is
0.11, which is close to signiﬁcant at conventional levels.
