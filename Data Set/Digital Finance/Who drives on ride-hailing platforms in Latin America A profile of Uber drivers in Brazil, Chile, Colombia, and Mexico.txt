Who drives on  ride-hailing platforms in Latin 
America?  
A Profile of Uber Drivers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia , and 
Mexico  
 
Abstract  
Digital platforms can improve the functioning of markets characterized by coordination problems and 
high levels of fragmentation, such as  the transport ation  market. In recent years, the  adoption of digital 
platforms  across L atin America  (Latam ), notably in the ride -hailing sector , has been considerable . This 
expansion may increase  the availability of  better job alternatives for workers in the region , which is  
characterized  by high levels of informality and citizen’s insecurity . To evaluate the viability of this 
hypothesis , we explore d the characteristics of Uber drivers (UD s) by combining Uber administrative 
data with a survey  designed and applied  for this project . The characteristics  we analyze d include 
drivers ’ past and current labor profiles, labor aspirations, and financial  behavior s. We found that the 
average UD in  Latam is male, 3 8 years old , and highly educated. Most drivers have no previous 
experience in the transport ation  sector. The mean duration of use of the platform is 19 hours per week, 
and the majority of UD s use it less than 30 hours per week. The average  hourly gross income for UDs  
utilizing  the platform is three times a given country ’s hourly minimum wage, with slight disparities  by 
country, gender, and age. The main reasons cited for joining the platform are the ability to generate 
more income and have work more flexible working hours . Only 40 % of drivers  would choose to work a 
fulltime job (that provides the same total income from all sources) over driving for Uber . The majority of 
UDs are financially stretch ed or insecure  and show low levels of retirement prepared ness. H owever, 
UDs have a strong  desire to accumulate more savings , at least in the short term . Based on these 
finding s, we suggest different policy alternatives to leverage  ride-hailing platforms  to improv e the lives 
of their drivers in  Latin America , including facilitating the participation  of women  and migrants as drivers , 
promoting financial inclusion and  financial  literacy , easing  voluntary contributions to retirement products  
and exploring  alternatives to acquire coverage against multiple risks, including  paying social security 
contributions .

 I. Introduction  
I.1 Ride -hailing platforms are becoming an increasingly important alternative personal 
transportation industry. The proportion  of the adult  U.S. population that reports having 
used Internet -connected mobile apps that match them with individual drivers at least  once 
more than doubled between 2015 and 2018, from 15% to 36%.1 Globally, ride -hailing 
companies , such as Uber and Didi , completed an estimated 24 billion rides in 2018, up 50% 
from the previous year.2 Fueled by digital innovation and increased online con nectivity, the 
popularity of these services  reflects the broader rise of on -demand online platforms as 
intermediaries of supply and demand in various sectors of the economy.  
I.2 The rise of ride -hailing platforms has  derived from  a service supply model that sets 
relatively low barriers for drivers to start providing car rides through the platform. 
Upon qualifying  to drive with a platform, an individual  can spend as much or as little time 
driving  as he or she prefers over any given t ime. This flexibility makes these platforms  an 
attractive way to generat e income for many people, including those with no prior 
professional driving experience. Hall and Krueger (2018) show ed that only 20 % of Uber 
drivers  (UDs)  in the U.S. worked in the tr ansport ation  industry in their previous job, and 28 % 
did so throughout their career.  
I.3 The desire, among policymakers and researchers, to understand the broader labor 
market implications of the on -demand economy has increased  significantly . Many 
scholars have focused on analyzing  the impact of providing  services through  ride-hailing 
platforms on labor decisions. The publication of a series of driver studies have  offered 
information about the  hours of work, income, as well as the motivations and backgrounds 
of participants in the ride -hailing platform economy. Most of these focused on developed -
country markets , such as the U.S., Europe, and Australia (see, for example, Hall & Krueger 
2018, Landier et al. 2016 , and Alphabeta  2019). Meanwhile,  research focused on the labor 
market implications of ride -hailing and other on -demand platforms in less developed 
contexts  is scarce . 
I.4 Latin America  (Latam)  is one of the fastest -growing regions for ride -hailing 
companies, but there is a gap in knowledge regarding the reasons for this growth 
and perspectives on its  future.  There has been extraordinary demand for r ide-hailing 
platforms in L atam . Their business model has succeeded through a  combination of different 
elements, including geographic factors ( high levels of urbanization and demand for 
transportation  solutions ); regional characteristics of public transportation  (Latam  is the third-
largest car -owning region in the world ); and,  structural labor market conditions  (high levels 
of informality ).3  
I.5 For this report, IDB partnered with Uber Technologies , Inc. to better understand the 
characteristics of participants in the ride -hailing industry  in Latam . Although the 
platform economy has grown  significantly  in the region  in recent years,  data on the 
characteristics of individuals participating in it is very scarce. In 2018, IDB partnered with 
Uber Technologies , Inc.  to better understand the potential impa ct of on-demand platforms 
on labor markets in the region. Th is report draws on an original survey , implemented in 
collaboration with Uber , among a representative sample of 5,251 of its platform ’s drivers in

 Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Furthermore , Uber provided anonymized 
administrative data on various characteristics  (i.e., drivers ’ earnings, hours worke d), used 
to validate and complement the survey data.  
II. Latin America: Uber ’s second biggest region for  revenue  
II.1 Latam  is characterized by high levels of urbanization, a lack of efficient public 
transportation , and millions of private cars. The region has experienced virtually 
unprecedented urban growth during the last decades. By 2020, the total regional population 
will exce ed 660 million, 82% of which will be living in cities.4 This rapid urban growth has 
yielded significant challenges in the form of poor urban planning and limited mobility .5 Such 
challenges have compelled the population to rely on cars as a primary mode of conveyance, 
which has intensified congestion in all cities throughout the region. The average duration of  
an individual’s commute to work , via public transportation , is 3 to 4 hours, which represents 
a loss of a minimum of 2 hours of wages .6 At the same  time, the average mileage of cars is 
the lowest in the world (see Figure II.1).  
FIGURE II.1 TOTAL CARS AND AVERAGE MILEAGE BY REGION

II.2 These conditions have favored the network and liquidity model  required by ride-
hailing  companies to expand their service.  Ride-hailing platform s increas e their value 
when they attract new platform users and deepens engagement with existing platform users. 
Both dynamics grow the network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of the 
platform to existing drivers  and users.7 This occurred in Latin America during recent years. 
Citizens of the region  need affordable, reliable, and safe transportation.8 Platforms allow for

 route traceability , real-time verification of the driver’s location and approach,  and the use of 
electronic payments. Users much appreciate t hese characteristics, not only in the 
megalopolis of the region but also in small - and medium -sized cities. Th e expansion  of ride -
hailing platforms  has occurred over the last three  years , and Uber has taken the lead , 
covering all of the main cities of Latam . Figure II.2 shows the expansion of Uber’s coverage  
in the region  since 2013. The company started operations in that year, but , between 2016 
and 2018 , it expanded its service to midsize  and large  cities in almost every Latin American 
country .

II.3 A total of 286 million people live in 598 cities in LAC. Uber was able to expand its 
platform to cover 70% of this  universe  (34% of the cities) between 2013 and 2018.  Of 
the 15 countries in which Uber operates, only three have less than 50% coverage  of cities 
with a population of more than 100,000 inhabitants  (Dominican  Republic, El Salvador, and 
Panama). By contrast , three countries have almost full coverage  in large cities  (above 85% ; 
Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay). Table II.1 provides more details on coverage , by country and 
cities in the region.

II.4 Competition in the ride -hailing industry has been growing significantly in recent 
years , both globally and in Latin America.  Uber, as the leader in the industry,  dominated 
the ride -hailing market in Latin America during its most important  growth phase between  
approximately  mid-2015 and  late 2017 . Since then,  and following the entrance of a number 
of competitors with equivalent business models,  its overall market share , measure d in terms 
of its share of total quarterly ride-hailing app downloads,  has declined  from 74% (Q3/2017) 
to 44% in the second  quarter of 2019 (see figure II.3.A). Among the most important current 
competitors of Uber in the region ar e 99 (20% download market share),  Didi (10%) , and 
Beat (9%) (see figure II. 3.B).

II.5 The rapid expansion of Uber’s platform transformed Latam into Uber’s second most 
important region in terms of revenue. Total worldwide Uber revenue increased from 
US$3.9 billion in 2016 to 11.3 billion in 2018. This is exclusive to revenue generated by its  
so-called “core platform”, which consists primarily of ridesharing and food delivery services.9 
Latin America has played a major role in this increase, seeing revenue surge from US$0.5 
billion to 2 billion over the same period. This means that the region increased its contribution 
to the generation of total revenue from 13% to 18%, making LAC Uber’s fastest -growing 
region worldwide in that period. Figure II.4 provides more detail on Uber’s distribution of 
revenue by region over the last 3 years.

II.6 While the share of workers offering driving services through on -demand platforms is 
still relatively low across Latin America, considering the previously described trends, 
this share is set to increase markedly over the next decade. Household data from 
Mexico shows that in the 43 cities in which Uber operated as of the first quarter of 2018, an 
average of 0.1% of the employed population drove Uber at least part time.10 This compares 
with an average of 0.9% of the employed population being registered as taxi drivers and an 
average of 4% mentioning “driving” as their secondary occupation in these cities.11 The 
trends concerning the growth of the on -demand ride -hailing sugg est a significant increase 
of the share of platform drivers vs. traditional taxi drivers in the region over the next decade.  
III. The survey and complementary administrative data from Uber  
III.1 Uber and the IDB contracted with I psos  Public Affairs LLP to conduct a Web-based survey 
among a representative sample of Uber drivers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia , and Mexico 
between February and March 2019.12 These markets were selected on the basis of their 
considerable potential variation in U D characteristics , as well as their combined importance 
within the overall Latam  Uber market. The four countries accounted for  the majority of Uber ’s 
drivers  in Latin America  at the start of the survey. The final number of completed interviews 
was 5,251, with the following distribution across countries: Brazil, 1,470 UD s; Chile, 1,387 
UDs; Colombia, 1,152 UD s; and Mexico, 1,251 UD s. 
III.2 The final version of the instrument comprised five modules: demographic characteristics; 
life before Uber; experience with Uber; satisfaction with the platform; and financial behaviors 
 
10  See Annex I.  
11  Estimates using household surveys in the region.  
12 We define UDs as those providing car rides through any one or more of the following services: UberX, SUV,

III.3 The total number of respondents to the self -administered qu estionnaire was 5,251. The 
overall response rate was 9.5%, after accounting for the oversample of Chile and Brazil. 
Our results also include the sample weights, calculated by Ipsos, to achieve a balance of 
the characteristics used for the sampling process.  Uber  compared the distribution of 
characteristics  of the drivers  using the weighted sampling weights with th at of the total driver 
population of interest  and did not find  any relevant  differences  between these groups , 
including with respect to average work hours or hourly earnings .13  
i. Who are Uber driver s in Latam ? 
III.4 The first module of the survey included a series of seven questions concerning general 
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents.  
III.5 The average UD in  Latam  is male, 38 years old, and living with a partner in a four -
member household. In each of the selected countries, drivers are mainly male (94%) at a 
prime working age (25 -54 years, 83% of the sample), averaging 37.7 years of age. The 
fraction younger than 2 5 years, as well as the fraction older than 54 are 9% and 8%, 
respectively. Most of them are either married or cohabitating (65%), and their average 
household size is 3.7 members.  Table III. 1 provides a summary of UD characteristics, 
overall  and by country.

III.6 UDs have high levels of education. Around 90% of the surveyed UD s reported that they  
had either a complete or incomplete secondary education level. About half of them report ed 
having completed tertiary education (more than 12 years of schooling). This percent age was

 higher in Colombia, where 71% of all UD s had completed more than 12 years of education. 
In other words, UD s are more educated than the general population in their respective 
countries.14

III.7 Driving on the platform seems to be a particularly attractive economic activity for 
international migrants, particularly in Chile.  Around 8% of all drivers were not born in the 
city in which they drive, and approximately 4% of drivers are international migrants, here 
defined as being born in another country. Chile stands out in this regard, as more than 10% 
of its UD s were born in another country.  This fraction is significantly higher than the share 
of international migrants  in the  total population  (6.7%) .15  
III.8 Drivers are the primary income providers in their home s, and the income distribution 
of UD households in each country is similar to th at of the total population . UD 
households are  somewhat more concentrated in the middle part of the income distribution  
than households at the national level . A relatively smaller  proportion of U D households  are 
in the upper and lower part s of the income  distribution.  
ii. Life before Uber  
III.9 The second module was designed to capture the work profile of UD s before they joined the 
platform. It consisted  of 11 questions , focused on the characteristics of the job(s) they had 
or still have.  
III.10  The majority of UD s were economically active before joining the platform. A large 
proportion of UD s (73.5%) reported themselves as having been actively employed during 
 
14  According to the national household surveys, 25% of Chileans reported having more than 12 years of education, 
whereas in the case of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, this figure is 16.3%, 17%, and 16.3%, respectively.

 the month before they joined the platform. Almost half of UD s were employed full -time in 
that period ; 21% were self -employed and 9% were employed part -time. UD s who had been 
staying in the home as full -time parent s or homemaker s comprised  up 2% of the sample, 
and those who were retired, 2%16. There are significant differences by country. For example, 
UDs who  declared  they had a full -time job range d from 39% in Brazil to 57% in Chile; drivers 
who described  themselves self -employed before joining Uber made up 12% in C hile, 20% 
in Mexico, 25 % in Brazil and 27% in Colombia. Similarly, 7% were employed part  time in 
Chile, whereas around 11% held part -time jobs in Mexico and Colombia, and 9% did in 
Brazil.  
III.11  Among unemployed individuals and students, j oining the platform wa s an 
opportunity to generate income.  The share of UD s who were unemployed the month 
before starting to drive with Uber was 22% of all respondents. Brazil and Colombia ha d the 
highest share , 28% and 24%, respectively ; in Chile and Mexico , this share was 19% and 
16%, respectively. A total of 7.5% of UD s were studying the month before they started using 
Uber. This percentage was slightly higher in Colombia (9%) and Mexico (8%), and slightly 
lower in Chile (7%) and Brazil (6%). It is worth no ting here  that almost  half of those who 
identified themselves as students were  also economically active before joining the platform.  
III.12  Most UDs who were economically active before joining the platform had only one job, 
and less than half of them kept it  after  starting to drive with Uber . UDs who were  
employed before start ing to  use the platform held an average of 1.2 jobs: 89% had only one, 
8% had two, and 3% had three or more. A total  of 38% of UD s kept their previous job s. 
According to Uber’s administrative records , of these,  more than half use the platform  for 
fewer than 10 hours  per week ; 38% for an amount of time ranging between 10 and 30 hours  
per week ; and 9% spent more than 30 hours  per week on the platform . The remaining 62% 
changed their occupation or status: 29% of UD s left their job voluntar ily, 20% involuntar ily, 
and 14% report ed that their job ceased to exist.  
III.13  UDs who kept their job s after joining the platform drive half as many hours  as those 
who left their job s, and they do this mostly during weekend s. There are significant 
differences across countries. For example, Mexican UD s who left their job s after joining the 
platform averaged  27 hours per week, whereas those who kept their jobs averaged 1 6 hours 
per week. Similarly, Chilean UD s in the first group averaged 19 hours  per week, and in the 
second group, only 10 hours  per week.  
III.14  Drivers  were more likely to have a formal job  before joining the platform , relative to 
the average for the selected countries.17 The share of UD s who report ed having 
contributed to a mandatory pension scheme the month before joining the platform was 55%. 
The variation across countries  in this regard  is significant: whereas 71% of Chilean UD s 
declared  that they contributed to a pension system, only 23% did in Mexico ; UDs in 
Colombia  and Brazil  reported 68% and 58%, respectively. Another measure of informality 
is whether the person and his or her emplo yer pay contributions to a health system. In this 
case, a total of 59% of UD s were formal ly employed  the month before joining the platform, 
with significant differences by country: Chilean and Colombian UD s report ed rates higher 
than 70%, whereas Mexicans reported 55% and Brazilians , 31%.  
III.15  UDs were employed mainly in the service industry before joining the platform. The 
majority of UD s were working in “other services ” (42%). A total of 18% of UD s were working 
in the transportation sector, with this percentage ranging from 14% , in Mexico , to 21% , in 
 
16  These categories are not mutually exclusive.  
17  Formality is defined as a job in which the person or an employer makes social security contributions.

 Brazil. A total of 11% of UD s was working in the manufacturing and construction sector , and 
8% held job s in the education and health industries.   
III.16  The m ajority of UD s (60%) report ed having no previous experience in the 
transport ation  sector , and only 10% had experience as taxi drivers . This distribution 
was similar in each country. Other relevant experience  in the sector was gained by  working 
as private chauffeurs and in delivery services. UD s without previous experience as taxi 
drivers reported having more years of education : 65% of them had at least some  tertiary 
education, whereas , among those with experience, only 41% had reached t his educational 
level. Furthermore drivers in the first group were 1.2 years younge r than those in the second , 
on average .

III.17  UDs with previous  experience  as taxi drivers prefer driving on the platform. Between 
60% and 75% of UD s with experience in the taxi industry reported feeling pride about 
working with Uber. In the UDs’ opinion Uber clients are more respectful . Over 60% of UDs 
report ed that working with Uber has given them more independence and dignity, and they 
declare d having achieved a more stable income throu gh the platform. To add up all these 
dimensions for UD s with experience as taxi drivers, we created a “quality index. ”18 A higher 
index  value indicates a better perception of their experience driving with Uber , relative to  a 
previous experience as a taxi driver. This index  value was highest for Mexican UD s, followed 
by Colombian, Brazilian , and Chilean UD s.19 
 
18  The index was constructed using the five questions included to compare the experience of driving for Uber with 
previous experience driving a taxi.   This is meant to determine the level of agreement on the following 
statements: (a) I feel greater pride working with Uber; (b) The clients I meet through Uber are more respectful; 
(c) My earnings through Uber are more stable; (d) Working with Uber has given me more independence and 
dignity; and (e) I make more money with Uber. The combination o f dimensions was derived using the 
Polychoricpca command in STATA, which displays the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the principal 
component analysis eigen decomposition.  Regardless of the self -report bias, this index is indicative o f the main 
reasons for the level of satisfaction for those with experience with the two services.  
19  This average is conditional on driving during the previous 4 weeks to the survey. According to the administrative 
records of Uber, 2% of respondents did not drive during that period.

iii. Life with Uber  
III.18  The third module of the survey was designed to obtain a work profile of UD s since their 
decision  to work on the platform. It included 17 questions on issues such as job 
characteristics, willingness to seek another job, reservation wage, use of other platforms, 
current contributions to pension and health schemes, and additional insurance coverage.  
III.19  UDs use the platform 19 hours per week on average, and the majority use it less than 
30 hours a week . A total of 36% of UD s reported using the platform less than  10 hours per 
week, and 42% reported  between 10 and 30 hours a week. Only 22% use it more than 30 
hours. Mexican drivers are the exception, with  one-third us ing the platform in excess of 30 
hours during the week.

III.20  UDs older than 55  years  use the platform more heavily , relative to other age groups.  
Drivers of p rime working age averaged 19 hours a week, whereas UDs younger than 25  
years  averaged 16 and those older than 54 averaged 23 hours. The country for which  the 
percentage of  UDs older than 55 years  who were online more than 30 hours  per week  is 
highest is  Mexico (51%), whereas it is lowest  in Chile (20%).  
III.21  Half of UD s use the platform during the day, while one -third use it  primarily  on 
weekends. The distribution of hours among drivers is as follows: day , 48%; night , 18%; and 
weekends , 35%. The variation of  platform  use, according to time and age , is also significant. 
Two thirds of UD s older than 55 use the platform during the day,  whereas 46% of prime -age 
UDs use it during the day . Younger UD s (18 to 25) are more likely to use the platform during 
weekends ( 45%). 
III.22  Only 7% of UD s are female, and they use the platform 14 hours  per week, with 
significant differences , relative to  males.  These include differences in the length and time 
 
12 
 of usage. Almost 90% of women use the platform less than 30 hours a week, compared to 
77% of males. Similarly, most females use the platform during the day , compared to males 
(54% females vs. 47 % of males). There are also significant differences by country. In 
Colombia , there are  more differences between female and male UD s. Female UDs use the 
platform less than 10 hours (5 2% vs. 3 7% of males) and do so mostly during the day (60% 
vs. 48% of males). In the case of Brazil, the difference between genders manifests primarily 
in which time of day  they make use of the platform : 70% of females use it during the day, 
compared to 56% of males. In Mexico, the difference between genders is mostly a matter 
of the duration  of use : 43% of females  drive less than 10 hours per week, compared to 2 6% 
of males. In Chile, the main difference is also in hours  driven , as 60% of female UD s use 
the platform less than 10 hours, compared to  45% of males .  
III.23  Half of UD s report ed having a job. One -quarter declare d driving with Uber as their 
only economic activity, and almost one-fifth consider ed themselves unemployed and 
looking for a job.20 A total of 49% of UD s reported being employed full -time, part -time, or 
self-employed. This percentage is quite similar across the four countries, with the highest in 
Chile (5 5%) and the lowest in Brazil (4 5%). By contrast , there are important differences 
across countries regarding those who reported use of the  platform as the ir only economic 
activity. The highest levels  were in Mexico and Brazil  (33% and 29%, respectively), and the 
lowest were in  Colombia and Chile  (15% and 17%, respectively). Finally, a total of 18% of 
respondents classif ied themselves as unem ployed  and looking for a job. Within this 
category, t here was a similar share of Colombian, Brazilian , and Chilean UD s (22%, 20%, 
and 19%, respectively), whereas the share of Mexicans was the lowest (11%).  
III.24  The proportion of UD s who have full-time job s is similar to that of UDs who  are self-
employed . A total of 22% report ed having  a full-time job, and 21% consider ed themselves 
independent workers. In the first case, Chilean UD s report ed the highest rate (32%). In the 
second case, Colombians, Brazilians, and Mexicans show ed the highest share (26%, 23%, 
and 20%, respectively), whereas Chileans  showed  the lowest (only 14%). For the case of 
UDs with part -time jobs, the overall share was 9%, with the four countries having similar 
values.  
III.25  The average hourly income generated using the platform during the month before the 
interview was US$11.6,  with some  differences by country, gender, and age .21 Each 
driver determines the hours online and he can reject (or ignore) dispatches while remaining 
online . The variation in usage of the platform is reflected in the variation in earnings. The 
administrative records show a similar average hourly income in Mexico and Chile (US$12.6 
and US $12.4, respectively) and  a lower  income  in Brazil and Colombia (US$10. 9 and 
US$10.5, respectively). In terms of  gender, males make US$0.64 (6%) more than females 
in the four countr ies.22 This difference is more prominent in Brazil (US$1.45 , or 15%), 
followed by Colombia (US$0.79 , or 8%), Mexico (US$0.69 , or 6%) , and Chile (US$0.40 , or 
3%). Finally, in terms  of age, UD s between 18 and 24 earn, on average, US$0.89 more than 
the average hourly wage  of all Uber drivers . When considering individu al countries , Mexico 
and Chile  stand out . In these two countries , young UD s earn US$1.04 and US$2.53 , 
respectively,  more  than the  average  driver  in the country .  
 
20  UDs were asked to classify their labor status using the following cat egories: employed full time; employed part 
time; self -employed; student; unemployed looking for a job; long -term sick or disabled; homemaker ; retired; only 
Uber; other. These categories are not mutually exclusive.  
21  These numbers are based on administrati ve records provided by Uber Inc.  
22  This value is similar to one reported by Cook et al. (2018).

III.26  The majority of UDs included in the survey under -reported the monthly revenue  they 
generated  by driving with Uber . Comparing self -reported data with Uber ’s administrative 
data, 68% of Mexican UD s report ed a lower income, followed by Colombia (62%), Chile 
(54%) , and Brazil (50%). The median proportion s between the revenue gap (self -report ed 
revenue minus administrative income) by country are as follow s: -31% in Mexico, -24% in 
Colombia, -8% in Chile, and 1%  in Brazil.

III.27  In each country, UDs’ hourly earnings  from driving with Uber –including any 
promotion and excluding Uber ’s commission –are at least three times the national 
hourly minimum wage. In Chile and Colombia, they earn almost three times the hourly 
minimum wage. This figure  is 3.9 and 6.5 times in Brazil and Mexico, respectively. These 
differences do not consider  additional costs cove red by UD s, including fuel  costs  and 
insurance.  
III.28  Only 40% of UD s would stop driving  with Uber if they were offered  full-time salaried 
work  that provides the same total income  (from Uber and other  labor  sources) . The 
monthly salary they report to require taking  another job is more than two times  -on 
average - what the y currently make using the platform.23 UDs declared a hypothetical 
wage they would ask  for to stop driving with Uber and accept a full -time salaried job  that 
provides the same total income . The largest share of drivers who would accept a job was in 
Colombia (51%) , and the lowest was in Chile (33%). In these countries, the average monthly 
income  that they would require to make this decision is US$2, 030 and US$2, 415 
respectively, which is 3.3 times what they currently make through the platform. In Mexico, 
the minimum income they would accept is US$1,960 (2.4 times what they now make) and 
in Brazil , US$3,915 (almost 2  times what they currently mak e, using the platform ).  
 
 
23  These numbers were obtained by comparing the desired income level and the response on the income 
generated through the platform . In both cases, the income distribution was trimmed to eliminate the 99th 
percentile.

III.29  A total of 28% of Uds report ed using another rideshare platform,  in addition to Uber,  
with differences by country. The reported  income generated through those platforms 
is lower , overall, relative to  Uber. The use of other platforms varies significantly by 
country: half of the Brazilian  drivers  (99); one-quarter in Colombia (Cabify); one - fifth in Chile 
(Beat and Cabif y); and one  sixth in Mexico (Didi). Of those using other platforms, Brazilian 
and Mexican UD s report ed generating a higher  median income using Uber ( 33% more ).24 
Chilean and Colombian Uds who use other platforms reported generating the same  median  
income with both platforms .  
III.30  A third of UD s currently contribut e to a pension system, and less than half to a health 
system . Drivers reported whether they made contributions to a pension system during the 
last month. The lowest share was in Mexico (11%) and the largest in Colombia (36%)  for all 
drivers . For drivers with no other source of income aside  from Uber, the shares were lower: 
4% in Mexico and 22% in Colombia . Similarly, they repor ted whether a health system 
currently covers them. In this regard , the lowest share was in Brazil (22%) and the highest 
in Colombia (71%)  for all drivers .  For drivers with no other source of income aside  from 
Uber, the shares were also lower: 14% in Brazil and 58% in Colombia . In other words, many 
drivers are covered through other jobs, making the total level o f coverage significantly lower 
compared to the total population.25 
III.31  Less than a fifth have life insurance , and more than half have liability/accident 
 
24  The calculation was made based on  the sample of drivers who reported their income with both Uber and other 
platforms. In both cases, the income distribution was trimmed to eliminate the 9 9th percentile.  
25  The most recent comparable data of the percent of salaried workers contributing to social security (18 -64 
years old)  in the selected countries is the following :  Brazil ( 2018 ), 78%; Chile ( 2017 ), 84%; C olombia  (2018 ), 
69%; Mexico ( 2018 ), 44%.

 insurance . The survey also asked UD s about the coverage for risks related to the operation 
of the vehicle used for driving with Uber, including life and liability/accident insurance. The 
share of UD s with the fir st was meager, with Mexican drivers having the highest level (21%) 
and Brazilians the lowest (1 8%). In the case of liability/accident insurance, the share was 
significantly higher (58%), but the distribution by country was similar, with Mexico having 
the h ighest  (76%) and Brazil the lowest (48%) . 
III.32  Only half of UD s in LATAM  own the car s used to drive on the platform. A total of 53% 
reported owning their vehicle, and 22% reported using a vehicle owned by a close family 
member. Further , a total of 15% either  use a car  owned by a third party (e.g., an employer ) 
or lease the car. Mexican UD s are outlier s in this field , as 23% rent the vehicle from a third 
party.

iv. Motivation for driving with Uber  
III.33  The fourth module of the survey describes the primary motivations for driving with Uber, if 
the real experience met these expec tations , and how likely it is they keep using the platform 
in the future. It included a total of four questions.  
III.34  Earning more income and having more flexible working hours are the main reasons 
to start using the platform.  UDs were asked to think back  and reflect on the time that  they 
decided to start driving with Uber and identify critical goals that guided their decision to start 
driving with Uber. They ranked ten different alternatives from the most salient to the least 
impo rtant.26 The top three reasons were : (i) earn more income (76%); (ii) have more flexible 
 
26  These included: (1) Earn more income; (2) Maintain a stable income; (3) Have more flexible working hours; (4) 
Be my own boss; (5) Have more leisure time for myself; (6) Work with better and more respectful 
clients/passengers; (7) Work with a respectable, international company; (8) Further my personal development 
 
 
17 
 hours (6 6%); and (iii) be his/her own boss (6 3%). This distribution of reason s was similar 
across countries, with Mexican UD s showing  higher shares for all three goals.   
FIGURE III.8 MAIN REASONS TO JOIN THE PLATFORM

III.35  Personal development through use of the platform  and driving for a respectable 
international company are additional reasons to drive with Uber  that received fewer 
mentions by primary drivers . A total of 41% of respondents declared that personal 
development had a significant impact on their decis ion. In terms  of working with an 
international company, the average was also 42%, with slight difference s by country. In 
Mexico and Brazil, drivers value d this reason  more  (48%), whereas in Chile and Colombia , 
they valued it  least (36%).  
 
(soft skills, technological capacity, social interactions, etc.);  (9) Feel safe driving with the Uber platform  thanks 
to the technology; and (10) Continue earning money after losing the job. 
 
18 
 III.36  Uber Drivers are generally satisfied with their experience of using the platform, but 
they express some disappointment regarding the amount of income generated 
through its use . UDs were asked to rate the ir level of satisfaction about their experience  
driving with Uber by classifying the ten original reasons  they had for doing so . They ranked 
each reason using three possible answers  (disappointed, satisfied, and more than satisfied). 
About half of the UDs declared satisfaction with the platform in relat ion to each reason 
included on the list , one third said their experience surpassed  their expectations , and 20% 
were dissatisfied. UDs showed their highest level of dissatisfaction with regards to their 
expectation to generate a higher  and more stable income  using the Uber app.  In fact, w hen 
UDs were asked what  employment  aspects would make them accept another job and stop 
driving with Uber , 80% mentioned that earning more in come  would be one of such aspects.   
FIGURE III.9 EXPECTATIONS VS . REALITY . SATISFACTION

III.37  About 40% of UD s plan to keep driving for the foreseeable future, with one-third 
agreeing, but only until something better comes up ; 6% reported that they  plan to 
stop soon , and 13% indicated that they did not know.  This module ended by asking UD s 
whether they plan to keep using the platform : 38% plan to keep driving for the foreseeable 
future ; 34% plan to drive until a better opportunity arises;  9% intend to keep driving until 
they made a certain amount of money and 6%  claimed that they would  probably stop driving 
soon. Considering variation in these percentages by country,  52% of the Brazilian UD s plan 
to keep driving for the foreseeable future, which represents a divergence of almost 20 
percentage  points  from the UD s in Chile, Colombia , and Mexico. The percentage of t hose 
planning to stay until something  better  comes up is virtually the same across all countries. 
Meanwhile, there is considerable variation in the percentage of those who plan to stop 
driving  soon  across countries : Colombian UD s were most inclined to decl are a plan to stop  
 
19 
 soon  (11%), while Chilean and Brazilian UD s with the same expectation represented  5%, 
and Mexican UD s represented 3%. These numbers indicate that the liquidity network model 
will require additional efforts to maintain drivers.  
v.  Financial behaviors and health of Uber driver partners  
III.38  The last module of the survey was designed to assess levels of  financial access , financial 
behaviors,  financial security, and retirement plans of UD s. It consisted  of 17 questions , 
designed  to measure six different areas: (1) financial access; (2) financial security ; (3) usage 
of smartphones and the Internet; (4) savings profile; and (6)  retirement plans and interest in 
accumulating more saving s. 
III.39  UDs have high rates of access to basic  financ ial products.  A total of 72% of drivers in 
the sample report ed having primary access to a checking or savings account. This 
proportion is significantly higher than the average rate ( 61%) of financial account ownership 
among the general  populations of the four countries.27 The high rates of financial inclusion 
may not surprise, given that drivers are required by Uber to have a bank  acco unt to receive 
payments. However, UDs can also choose to use the bank account of another trusted 
person to receive Uber payments. 12% of drivers report ed having a direct family member 
as the owner of the ir Uber -linked  account, with significant differences by country  (18% in 
Mexico, 16% in Colombia,  10% in Brazil and 4% in Chile ). The corresponding  question also 
included the option to select  employers as  owners  of Uber -linked accounts28. Mexico was 
an outlier in this regard , as 18% of drivers reported using an employer -provided bank 
account for receiving payments , whereas in Colombia, Chile, and Brazil , this share  was 
relatively  small (4%, 1%, and 0%, respectively). For UD s owning a bank account, 15% 
opened it to receiv e Uber payments, alluding to the platform’s potential to serve as a 
foundation al vehicle for financial inclusion. Uber has served as a particularly potent  driver 
of bank  account opening  in Mexico , where 34% of drivers opened their account s to receive 
Uber payments .29 
III.40  One in two UD  report  not having any kind of household savings  and three in four are 
in debt . UDs were asked to indicate whether they have managed to set aside money in 
savings vehicles of varying degrees of liquidity .30 Only 47% of UDs reported having 
accumulated any kind of savings.  UDs who managed to save use mainly one vehicle ( 64% 
of UDs who save  or 30% of all UDs) , with the  majority of them preferring to save in cash31 
(70% UDs who save or 33% of all UDs ). There are significant differences in the use of cash 
as the preferred savings vehicle by country: in Colombia, the percentage of those saving in 
cash was lowest (59%  of Colombian UDs  who save ); whereas in Brazil, it was highest (74%  
 
27  See World Bank Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database . The Findex data  is representative of the 
population of individuals aged 15+ , whereas UDs included in the survey were 18 years of older . The compared 
Findex question asks about ownership of  any kind of account at a financial institution, not only savings and 
checking accounts, although these two types of accounts probably account for a large pe rcentage of accounts 
owned by the surveyed populations. If anything,  ownership rates of any account at a financial institution should 
be even higher among UDs.  
28 Categories were not mutually exclusive and UDs were allowed multiple alternative from the following list: (1) 
self; (2) direct family member; (3) employer ; (4) other; (5) DK/NA.  
29  Given the high levels of smartphone penetration and use (92% before joining the platform), i t seems feasible to 
explore other alternatives of financial inclusion t hrough mobile devices . 
30  Categor ies (savings vehicles)  were not mutually exclusive  and UDs were able to select more than one savings  
vehicle from the following list: (1) personal savings; (2) cash; (3) certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, 
bonds ; (4) pension fund ; (5) land; (6) other (please specify); and (7) none of the above .  
31  Cash includes the “personal savings” category.  
  
20 
 of Brazilian UDs who save ). Drivers who se households  have savings were asked to re port 
the main reasons for putting money aside .32 The three most salient choices were (a) to cover 
short -term emergencies (3 7%); (b) to start a business (3 4%); and (c) to buy a house, 
apartment , or land (3 4%). UDs appear to be more likely to have open loans than the general 
population of the four countries. A total of 74% of drivers in the overall sample report ed 
having debt with a financial institution or person, with this percentage ranging from a low of 
64% i n Mexico to a high of 83% in Colombia. In Chile, 75% of drivers owe money to a 
financial institution or person ; and in Brazil 73% . For Chile, and Colombia, t hese values are 
significantly higher compared to the results of a similar , general -population  surve y 
implemented in the two countries .33 
III.41  The majority of UDs live in economically vulnerable conditions , despite having 
confidence in their financial capabilities . UDs reported feeling confident that they could 
overcome any financial problem they may face. In Colombia and Chile, almost 7 in 10 
responded positively (68% and 67%, respectively), while in Mexico and Brazil, 59% and 
53% responded positively, respectively. For Chile and Colombia, these levels are in line with 
those for the general public.34 To obtain a more fine -grained picture of UDs'  level of financial 
resilience, we drew on an index of "financial security " of UDs. This index classifies each 
driver as either financially insecure, financially stretched, or financially secure.35 Figure III. 10 
shows the results . We found that only 8% of UDs can be considered as living in economically 
stable conditions (financially secure), whereas 40% and 52% are financially stretched and 
insecure, respectively. In Chile and Colombia, the proportion of financially secure, to 
stretched, to insecure, is 7% to 43% to 50% and 8% to 45% to 47%, respectively. 
Meanwhile, it is 14% to 31% to 55% and 14% to 33% to 53%  respectively, for the general 
population in th ose two countries. This suggests that UDs are more likely to live in financially 
stretched conditions but less likely to experience either more extreme financial insecurity or 
security than the overall populat ion in their respective countries. Financial insecurity is 
highest in Brazil, where 56% of UD can be considered living financially insecure lives.  
 
32  The corresponding survey question included the following options: (1) Start a business; (2) Buy a house, 
apartment, or land; (3) Finance the education of my kids; (4) Pay back debt; (5) Be able to cope with emergencies 
or other unexpected events; (6) Accumulat e funds for retirement; (7) Travel; (8) Make important purchases (car, 
furniture, etc.); (9) For inheritance; (10) other. Categories were not mutually exclusive.  
33  Chile and Colombia have analogous national -level data to allow for comparison , through the Gallup Global 
Financial Health Study 2018 . The purpose of this study was to find out how much control and influence people 
in different countries believe they have over their financial situations. More than 15,000 people were interviewed 
in 10 countries: Bangladesh, Colombia, Kenya, Vietnam, Chile, Greece, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., and the 
U.S.  
See https://news.gallup.com/reports/233399/gallup -global -financial -health -study -2018.aspx.  Only 48% of the 
general population have loans of this kin d to repay  in both Colombia and Chile.   
34  66% of Chileans and 69% of Colombians reported feeling confident that they could overcome any financial 
problem  in the Global Financial Health Survey , including through the  help of their social networks.  
35  The index, designed for the Global Financial Health Study, is based on two questions: The first question asks 
how long respondents would be able to use their savings or sell assets to cover their basic needs, s uch as  food, 
housing, and transportation, if they lost their income. The second inquires whether making repayments against 
debts does or does not make it difficult for them to pay for other things they need. The resulting index assigns 
individuals to one of three mutually exclusive categories: “Financiall y secure” are those persons who could cover 
their basic needs for more than 6 months and for whom, at the same time, making repayments against debts 
does not make it difficult to pay for other things they need. “Financially insecure” are those for whom eit her one 
of the following two conditions are met: (i) They could cover their basic needs for less than one month by only 
drawing on their savings or by selling assets; (ii) they find paying for other things they need very difficult after 
making payments aga inst their debt. Finally, “financially stretched” are those who are neither financially secure 
nor insecure.

III.42  UD’s  pressing financial concerns mean that long -term savings and retirement 
planning are not a priority for many drivers.  Only a third (3 2%) have taken concrete 
measures regarding financing their life in old age. This percentage is lowest in Brazil (21%) 
and highest in Colombia (41%). Contributions to a pension scheme are the most common 
way drivers prepar e for old age: 36% of drivers report  having made such contributions at 
least once in the past.36 Other alternatives include purchasing real estate assets or land 
(31%) and establishing a  business (26%). These low levels of retirement preparedness are 
reflect ive of a more generalized expectation among drivers to never fully retire. Almost 9 in 
10 UDs said that they plan to work , at least  part time, past the age of retirement , with minor 
variation in this percentage across countries.37 
III.43  Despite low levels of reti rement preparedness, UD s seem to have a keen desire for 
accumulating savings and improving their long -term financial security . About  40% of 
drivers report ed thinking “a lot” about how to finance their life in old age, ranging from a low 
of 25% in Brazil to a high of 54% in Colombia. This finding suggests a high degree of 
consciousness of the importance of long -term financial planning  among UD s. A possible 
explanation for the mismatch between UDs’ awareness regarding  the topic  and the lack of 
preparedness for retirement  may be found in the absence of convenient saving instruments.  
To test this hypothesis, we asked drivers whether they would be int erested in participating 
in a savings plan that allowed them to automatically save a certain fraction of the ir earnings. 
Almost 3 in 4 U Ds said that they would participate in such a project , and half reported that 
 
36  May include  contributions made before the person started to drive with Uber or in a job  the person holds in 
parallel to driving with Uber.  In any case, these levels are significantly lower than the ones observed for the 
general population in each country.  
37  This percentage is the same when only considering  drivers  younger than 65. Of those UDs who do plan to stop 
working at one point, 44% plan to cover their expenses through income from properties or a business, 31% 
through a public or private pension and 24%  through personal savings. 10% expect to have some other source 
of income (including help from family or friends, a life insurance or help from the state) once they leave the labor 
force and 20% “haven’t thought about” the matter yet.  
 
22 
 they would save the maximum amount suggested (10%) by the hypothetical option. This 
willingness was highest in Mexico (80% would want to participate, 60% would save 10%) 
and lowest in Chile (58% would want to join, 37% would save 10%). These results sugges t 
that an easy option to save may help U Ds mobilize more savings, at least for the  short and  
medium term.

 IV. Conclusions  
VI.1 This paper provides a comprehensive description of U Ds in Latin America.  The 
document is the first attempt to document the reasons for the growth of ride -hailing platforms 
from the perspective of drivers in Lat in America and its perspectives for the future. Uber has 
been able to respond to the extraordinary demand for transpor tation in  Latin America, which 
is driven by a combination of geographic factors, the characteristics of public transportation , 
the availability of millions of private cars , and structural labor market conditions. At the time 
of writing this report, Uber was available in 200 cities across 15 countries  LAC, serving  
approximately  202 million people. Based on both administrative and survey data, we provide 
a detailed profile of UD s in the region.  
VI.2 Driving with Uber is a n income source for those (mainly males ) looking for job , even 
for those employed in the formal sector . UDs are mostly  men of prime working -age with 
more than 12 years of education. They tend to be  the primary providers for households of 
four members. The majority ha d no experience in the transport ation  sector, and the ir level 
of formality (coverage of health and pensions) was above average national levels before 
joining the platform. In other words, a significant fraction of UD s uses the platform as an 
alternative mode of income generation while they seek out a new job.  
VI.3 The majority of UD s in Latin America  use the platform only for a few hours a day. 
Those who use it more h eavily are not interested in traditional jobs.  The on -demand 
economy provides a high degree  flexibility to determine hours of work per week at different 
times. In Latin America , half of UD s use the platform during the day o n weekdays, one third 
over weekends , and the rest at night. This distribution of online hours coincides with the 
reasons expressed by UD s for joining the platform: flexibility and a generat ing more  income.  
UDs do not use the platform as an equivalent of a full -time occupation , reflected by  an 
average duration of  use of 2.7 hours per day and 78% us ing it less than 4.5 hours per day. 
The need for flexible employment  options could explain the relatively low  fraction of UD s 
who would stop using the platform and take full -time salaried work  that provides the same 
total income from all  labor  sources , which stands at  40% of all UD s. Those  who would accept  
another job  demand almost twice  what they are currently making with the p latform. 
Therefore , it is highly unlikely that UD s would take  a full-time formal job in the future. Finally, 
UDs show a low valuation of social security benefits. The coverage they had before joining 
the platform was higher compared to national averages , and their current coverage is below 
that level.  
VI.4 The current profile of UD s and the increase in competition may drive high rates of 
churn. Both elements would represent a risk for the future  functioning of the network 
and the company’s liquidity model.  Only about  40% of UD s plan to use the platform 
regularly in the foreseeable future, while one-third will use it  only until something better 
comes up, and the rest will probably stop soon. This low level of loyalty makes it challenging 
to increase the scal e and liquidity in the markets of the region. Moreover , more ride -hailing 
companies are offering services in Latin America  engender ing driver supply constraints. The 
development of the industry would require better incentives for drivers to stay on the platform  
or to increase the number of people participating in the industry.  
VI.5 The results of the survey show areas of opportunity to leverage  ride-hailing platform 
infrastructure s to improv e the lives of Uber drivers  in the region  and enhance the 
functioning of the ride -hailing industry in L atin America . Ride-hailing platforms  can 
reduce the  cost of transportation and traffic in the cities of Latin America . The rapid growth  
of Uber in the region show s that this is feasible. The platform has facilitate d an occupation  
24 
 alternative to thousands of people with limited employment opportunities , including those 
with informal jobs. In this context,  the future expansion of the ride -hailing companies will 
require the involvement of mor e drivers to satisfy the growing demand . Our survey shows 
this involvement is feasible, and it would require addressing at least three areas of 
opportunity. The first is the elimination of the barriers encountered to use the platforms, 
particularly among  vulnerable groups. Women  and migrants show  limited participation rates, 
despite the benefits provided by the platform (flexibility , security  and income generation). 
The second area of opportunity consists in promoting  financial inclusion and improving 
financial literacy of drivers. Platforms can i mprove drivers’ financial decisions through a 
better connection to financial products. Platforms can provide this connection directly 
through new products or through alliances with traditional financial institutions. For example, 
better access to credit products can increase the relatively low levels of car ownership  
among drivers . Increasing drivers’ car ownership represents a business opportunity, and it 
could cultivate a relationship with the ride -hailing platforms  for an extended period.  Finally, 
the th ird area of opportunity is the protection against financial emergencies  and health risks 
and promoting  drivers’  retirement  preparedness . Drivers are interested in acquiring 
coverage against these risks, but there  do not  seem to exist proper instrument s and 
products for this purpose. Hence , there is promise in  exploring  alternative design and 
delivery models for insurance product s adjusted to the needs of  platform workers , including 
convenient ways  to contribute to existing  social security  schemes .
