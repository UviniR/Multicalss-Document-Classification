1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
  
7 
 E-COMMERCE IS A KEY GROWTH OPPORTUNITY FOR ALBANIA  
 
E-commerce – defined broadly as the sale of goods and services facilitated through  the internet – is a key growth 
opportunity for Albania. E-commerce is rapidly becoming an integral part of the global eco nomy. Sellers can benefit 
from internet marketing, 24 -hour online shopping and remote transaction settlement to reach more customers. 
Buyers, including both consumers as well as businesses that source their inputs, stand to gain through greater choice, 
convenience and market competition. With the emergence of new companies offering enabling services for e -
commerce, including technology companies, payment services and logistics, a variety of new job opportunities is 
emerging.   
The digital economy has the po tential to play an important role in overcoming key obstacles to trade. First,  e-
commerce stands to overcome the physical distance between buyers and sellers – connecting Albania’s small 
domestic economy (population of 2.9 million) with larger and more aff luent markets abroad (EU population of 512.4 
million), while connecting Albania’s still significant rural communities with its urban centers. Second, e -commerce 
stands to overcome information frictions. Few Albanian firms have established internationally r ecognizable brands. 
Online search can enable customers to nonetheless find Albanian products. Listings through internationally 
established marketplace platforms and a track record of positive online customer reviews can establish trust and 
boost future exp orts. Third, e -commerce stands to overcome the limited financial resources available to most 
Albanian companies. Since products can be sold to customers online, without requiring large upfront investments 
such as the establishment of a physical store, firm s can experiment with entering into new markets and then scale 
up at low cost.  
During the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, e -commerce has also emerged as an important pillar in the fight against 
the virus. First, e -commerce reduces the risk of new infections by limiting the need for in -person transactions. 
Second, it preserves jobs despite social distancing requirements, allowing businesses to sell to their customers 
without meeting physically. Third, e -commerce increases the acceptance of prolonged physical dist ancing measures 
among the population. The continued availability of online shopping and online services, including video chats, 
movie streaming, and online classes, likely ma kes the pandemic  lockdown measures more bearable for  Albanians .  
 
WHILE ALBANIA’S E-COMMERCE SECTOR IS EMERGING, IT LAGS BEHIND REGIONAL PEERS  
 
Albanian e -entrepreneurship is already emerging – some economic sectors, including the tourism industry and 
business process outsourcing (BPO), have been quick to embrace online markets. In recent years, Albanian hotels 
have rapidly leveraged  e-tourism to attract guests through bookings. com and similar websites.  A thriving Albanian 
industry is developing around the sale and delivery of online services abroad . This ranges from large  business process 
outsourcing (BPO ) companies all the way to individual freel ancers offering their services online . On a per -capita 
basis, the penetration of Albanian freelancers on websites such as upworks.com already exceeds that of many 
advanced economies.  
In 2020, the  COVID -19 crisis  has also led to a further big push forward f or the digitalization of the Albanian 
economy. A 2020  World Bank  Enterprise Survey  update reveals that almost 20 percent of surveyed Albanian firms 
have either started or increased online busine ss activity during the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic . In a World Bank  
8 
 survey of consumers , close to 55 percent of  Albanian  survey  respondents report having  increased their use of online 
shopping since the start of the pandemic.   
However, Albania starts from a base of limited e -commerce penetration. In the latest globally comparable World 
Bank Findex survey of 2017, only 7 percent of Albanians reported purchasing products online, as opposed to an 
average of 14 percent in the rest of the Western Balkans region an d 70 percent in the US market.1 An Albanian 
entrepreneurship ecosystem is gradually emerging that re -sells (often imported ) goods online on the domestic 
market.  Yet, f ew Albanian businesses are selling their own products online.   
 
REFORMS ARE NEEDED TO  FULLY  LEVERAGE THE DIGITAL TRADE  OPPORTUNITY  
 
This report reviews Albania’s e -commerce enabling environment and identifies 9 priority recommendations to 
help Albania better leverage the opportunities associated with digital trade. E-commerce thrives at the  
intersection of a complex multisectoral enabling environment, including (i) logistics and customs, (ii) digital 
connectivity, (iii) online payments, (iv) private sector capabilities and skills as well as (v) the e -commerce regulatory 
framework. The diagno stic reviews market constraints along each of these dimensions and proposes policy 
recommendations. Emphasis is placed on evidence -based assessments of current sector challenges - combining 
quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews with stakeh olders on the ground in Albania – as well as 
identification of policy recommendations based on international best -practice case studies. This executive summary 
highlights a selection of the key recommendations identified by the main report.  
While Albania’s  e-commerce sector is emerging, it 
lags behind regional peers … …  a complex multi -sectoral enabling environment  is 
needed for e -commerce to thrive

 In the first instance,  action is needed to support Albania’s aspiring  e-entrepreneurs.  Albania’s online entrepreneurs 
already show signs of dynamism. Government can play key role in enabling these businesses and allowing them to 
develop to their full potential. Key recommended actions that emerge from this diagnostic include:  
1. Strengthening trust  in Albania’s e -commerce companies:  This requires (i) introduction of an  e-commerce 
industry code of conduct and a recognized trustmark that  adhering businesses can display in their  webshops , 
(ii) an outreach and enforcement campaign to formalize online sellers and ensure that web shops comply with 
e-commerce regulations and (iii) implementing a consumer protection framework fit for the digital age , 
including through an online dispute  resolution mechanism  and a n information campaign  dedicated to online 
shopping . The Albania Post (iv) could introduce a simplified e -commerce parcel returns service that web shops 
can offer to their customers in case products do not meet expectations.  
 
2. Creating a business environment fit for the digital economy: in particular, (i) tax legislation and implementation 
procedures need to be amended to clarify the treatment of online sellers and online marketplaces, both in 
domestic and international transaction s. The (ii) regulatory environment needs to become more conducive to 
innovation in online payments, including through full implementation of the new payment services law and the 
use of regulatory sandboxes to explore new business models. Finalizing (iii)  the implementation of a domestic 
instant payment processing infrastructure  could bring down the costs that businesses face when processing 
online payment transactions.  
  
3. Bolstering t argeted support programs for e-entrepreneurs:  This includes establishing (i ) dedicated financing 
and training programs for aspiring e -businesses, including strengthening incubator and accelerator programs 
for startups. (ii) Regular outreach events, such as business competitions highlighting e -commerce success 
stories, can inspire  more Albanians to start their own venture. All such targeted interventions need to be 
combined with rigorous periodic impact evaluations to ensure value -for-money.  
Second, e -commerce needs to be brought to those segments of the population that are currently underserved . 
Many Albanians are still poorly connected to conventional markets, either because they live in remote village s, 
because they are discriminated against or because they face other mobility challenges, such as old age or disability. 
For these Albanians, e -commerce can open up new opportunities. Yet, it is also exactly these Albanians that often 
lack access to the enabling infrastructure needed to participate in online markets. Key recommended actions that 
emerge from this diagnostic incl ude:  
4. Broadening access to high -speed internet : In particular, Albania’s electricity transmission company (OST) has 
already connected large parts of Albania through fiberoptic cable. By  sharing this infrastructure with internet 
service providers (ISPs), Albania can significantly expand access to broadband digital services, particularly 
outside of the urban centers , without requiring significant new investments .  
 
5. Expanding access to online payments: This includes (i) finalizing  the roll -out of a “ basic payments account” 
framework  for Albania , offering features such as broad right of access for all Albanian citizens, transparent 
statement of fees and a  debit card . The (ii) Albania Post should roll out its own postal card and  expand its  e-
wallet serv ice.  
 
6. Connecting all Albanians with online business opportunities:  many Albanians still need to gain experience as 
online buyers and sellers, leveraging the opportunities available on online markets. This requires a cultural 
transition. But it also requir es gradually building knowhow. For instance, sellers need to learn how to use online 
marketing tools, develop basic processes for sending goods to buyers and identify how buyers will pay them.  
10 
 Established online marketplaces can facilitate this process, of fering a package of services that enables a smooth 
and simple transaction experience for buyers and sellers. Training programs, such as the Kosovo Women in 
Online Work (WOW) project, could be brought to Albania, teaching disadvantaged groups how to access online 
marketplaces and how to sell their products online.  
Third, the close interaction between greater regional integration and e -commerce needs to be fully exploited. For 
many Albanian customers, most of the immediate gains from e -commerce stem from access to the wide variety of 
products available on international e -commerce platforms. Similarly, Albanian e -commerce companies need access 
to international markets in order to develop meaningful economies of scale. The gradual emergence of a 
comprehensiv e regulatory framework for the digital economy in the European Union offers a natural anchor for 
reform efforts in the broader region, including for Albania. As such, unlocking e -commerce is closely connected with 
greater regional integration. Key recommen ded actions that emerge from this diagnostic include:  
7. Simplify ing cross -border  tax and customs procedures , in particular for small consignments : the costs - in terms 
of money and time  - of cross -border logistics need to be brought down. In the first instan ce, this implies 
agreement on simplified customs procedures for trade in goods with key trading partners (EU, CEFTA), including 
(i) establishment of a VAT online one -stop shop for importers and aligning the de -minimis level below which 
parcels are exempted  from import duties to the EU level, (ii) reviewing the need for scanning fee charges for 
small parcels and (iii) full implementation of electronic, risk -based, small -parcel -friendly, transparent and 
predictable customs procedures. Down the road, this impl ies the need to move forward on (iv) customs union 
with key trading partners.  
 
8. Harmoniz ing the regional regulatory environment for e -commerce:  harmonization of regulations enables 
businesses to operate across multiple jurisdictions at lower cost. Jurisdict ions need to meet international 
standards, ensuring that Albanian e -businesses are globally recognized as reliable partners.  Key outstanding 
measures for Albania in this domain include (i) developing a harmonized regime for mutual recognition of digital 
signatures, including in judicial court proceedings, (ii) joining an international dispute resolution platform, (iii) 
upgrading privacy regulations to meet EU standards and (iv) clarifying intermediary liability, including with 
respect to intellectual prope rty rights. In the first instance, a CEFTA level solution could be adopted that uses 
the EU framework as an anchor.    
 
9. Encourag ing foreign direct investment  that can catalyze growth of Albania’s e -commerce ecosystem : Pro-
active engagement with internationa l e-commerce companies is needed to encourage foreign direct 
investment, including establishing enabling services such as logistic fulfillment centers, online payment services 
and other e -commerce facilitation services in Albania. Besides directly creating  jobs for Albanians, these 
investments can play a key role in jump -starting growth of the domestic e -commerce ecosystem. Harmonization 
of regulations with international standards as well as simplified cross -border regional trading procedures can 
help to ma ke Albania a more attractive destination for such investments.  
 
REFORMS  NEED TO BE ANCHORED IN STRONG INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS  
 
Albania needs to establish institutions that can ensure that the momentum on e -commerce reform is maintained 
and that reform announcements also translate into reform outcomes. A key challenge for e -commerce reform is 
the requirement for concerted action across multiple government line ministries , closely coordinated with the  
11 
 private sector, international development partners as well as regional forums. Reform efforts are often technical 
and take time to bear fruit. In certain areas, international best practice still needs to fully mature and curr ently offers 
limited guidance. For e -commerce reform efforts to therefore be successful, strong institutional foundations are 
needed that can preserve the reform momentum despite these challenges.  
As important  step in this process, Albania has already est ablished an inter -ministerial  e-commerce working group  
to regularly review progress with implementation of e -commerce reforms and address bottlenecks , while 
monitoring new e -commerce developments and identifying new challenges that need to be tackled. At the regional 
level, the Common Regional Action Plan  2021 -24 anchors e -commerce  reform  into the broader Western Balkans  
integration  agenda .   
The Albanian e -commerce working  grou p now  needs to develop and adopt an e -commerce action plan, 
articulating actions, responsibilities and a reform timeline.  This World Bank diagnostic aims to serve as an input for 
such a government action plan. A strong monitoring and evaluation framework n eeds to track the results achieved 
by the action plan – this will require strengthening data collection and tracking the performance of Albania’s e -
commerce sector more closely going forward.  
While several existing Albanian business associations advocate on behalf of e -commerce businesses, the private 
sector  needs to become more organized . Besides advocating for a better business environment, an organized 
private sector  should encourage profess ional networking and knowledge sharing events – playing an important role 
in encouraging the development of a strong Albanian e -commerce ecosystem and defending the interests of the 
industry .   
 
EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS RELATED TO ONLINE MARKETS IS KE Y 
 
A successful transition towards online markets requires that the risks associated with e -commerce are effectively 
managed. To the extent that e -commerce displaces some of the  established local brick -and-mortar businesses, local 
communities need to be su pported to adapt to these changes. Government agencies, such as the tax administration 
and customs, will have to upgrade their procedures to manage e -businesses efficiently, fighting informality in online 
markets as well as ensuring that international e -commerce players pay their fair share of taxes in Albania. Albania’s 
competition framework will need to find a practical way to protect customers from e -commerce giants that can 
dominate online markets and limit competition. While e -commerce companies are co ntinually innovating to reduce 
their packaging and logistics footprint, the net impact of the rise of the digital economy on the environment needs 
to be closely monitored.  
 
CONCERTED PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACTION IS CRUCIAL  
 
Implementation of the 9 priority recommendations proposed by this diagnostic  can help  to create a stronger 
enabling environment for e -commerce in Albania – but, ultimately,  these measures will only com e to fruition if  
the private sector takes charge . The capabilities of companies offering enabling services for e -commerce  – including 
domestic online marketplace and warehousing infrastructure, third -party logistics (3PL) companies, i nternet  service  
12 
 provid ers, payment service providers – need to grow.  E-commerce players need to gain the trust of consumers by 
delivering a high -quality service on every transaction.  Albanian e -sellers need to develop product offerings that can 
compete on international markets  and s trengthen  their  presence on  international marketplace  platforms . Storing 
inventory  in local fulfilment centers  close to the eventual customers – this is key to ensuring quick and reliable 
delivery upon an online sale . Only if both the private sector and the government do their part can Albania’s e -
commerce sector achieve its full potential.

2. INTRODUCTION   
14 
 THE RISE OF E -COMMERCE IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  
 
E-commerce  – defined in this report as the sale of goods and services online - is creating new pathways for 
economic development . Between 2014 and 2019 , global retail e-commerce sales nearly tripled  - reaching  US$ 3.5 
trillion  by 2019 . The COVID -19 crisis has further accelerated growth of the sector. In the second quarter of 2020 , e-
commerce sales in the US , by some estimates,  increased to above 16 percent of all retail sales . Online marketplaces 
such as Amazon and Alibaba have become amo ng the most valuable companies in the world.  Taking into account 
online business -to-business (B2B) transactions – a market now estimated at  US$ 12.2 trillion  – e-commerce is rapidly 
revolutionizing  the way markets work .2 
For sellers  of goods and services , e-commerce represents a unique  growth opportunity . Through  an online sales  
channel , businesses can reach customers that may not be physically close  – whether on the domestic market or 
abroad . By offering 24 -hour online shopping  and door -to-door delivery of products , companies can offer customers 
a new level of convenie nce. By potentially reaching more affluent customers with greater willingness to pay, online 
businesses can grow their margins . Online sourcing of supplies and equipme nt can help  businesses identify  new 
technology solutions  and lower cost  options . 
New jobs can be created through the emergence of a  rich eco -system of firms that facilitate online sales . Payment 
service providers enable sellers to process online transactio ns. Third party logistics (3PL) services facilitate delivery 
of purchases to the customer. Consultancies, IT companies and lawyers help sellers to navigate the process of 
developing an online business, from designing an online sales presence, to engineerin g back office processes and 
navigating the online regulatory environment. E -commerce platforms can offer standardized solutions to connect 
sellers and buyers online, starting with simple online matchmaking all the way to offering packaged payment, 
warehous ing and delivery services.  
Customers stand to gain through access to greater choice and conve nience . Customers  can make purchases at any 
time and from the comfort of their own home . At their fingertips , they have access to  a much  wider variety of product 
choices  than would be available at local stores  – selecting among both domestic and international online shops . 
Online product comparisons and product reviews can help customers make better  purchasing decisions. Websites 
can identify visitors and o ffer a more personalized shopping experience.  Greater competition through online shops 
can encourages low prices and customer service . 
Box: What is e -commerce ? 
 
Given the rapidly evolving  nature of the digital economy, the definition of what constitutes e-commerce can 
be elusive.  The conventional picture that may first come to mind for e -commerce is that of a business selling 
goods online through an e -commerce platform to a household (ie. Amazon). However, the definition of online 
trade can be drawn much more broadly. This box highlights a range of activities that could all also be considered 
as e-commerce.  Depending on how broad a definition of e -commerce is used, the term sometimes includes the 
following cases:  
• Online sellers may be an individual rather than a business (ie many ebay sales)  
• Online customers may be a business rather than an individual (ie amazon’s business platform)  
 
2 Data on e -commerce trends is available from statista.com. This i ncludes products or services ordered using the 
internet via any device, regardless of the method of payment or fulfillment; excludes travel and event tickets.   
15 
 • Online sellers may sell directly to customers, without intermediary e -commerce platform (ie apple.com)  
• Online transactions may  refer to the purchase of a service rather than a good (ie freelance online 
translat ion services )  
• Instead of a payment per transaction, e -businesses may generate revenue through subscriptions (ie the 
movie -streaming service provided by netflix), advertise ment (ie the search engine service provided by 
google) or other business models  
 
This diagnostic uses  a broad definition of e -commerce. Defining e -commerce as the sale of goods and services 
facilitated through the internet , the report encompasses  all of the above types of transactions. In general, more 
emphasis will be put on conventional e -commerce with a discrete transaction and a payment for a good or a 
service. However, a range of recommendations developed in this report will also a pply to other business models.  
  
 
During the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, e -commerce has also emerged as an important pillar in the fight against 
the virus. First, e -commerce reduces the risk of new infections by limiting the need for in -person transactions . 
Second, it preserves jobs despite social distancing requirements, allowing businesses to sell to their customers 
without meeting physically. Third, e -commerce increases the acceptance of prolonged physical distancing measures 
among the population. The co ntinued availability of online shopping and online services, including video chats, 
movie streaming, and online classes, likely made the Spring 2020 lockdown measures more bearable for  Albanians . 
 
NONETHELESS, THE GROWTH OF THE ONLINE ECONOMY ALSO COMES WI TH RISKS  
 
Nonetheless , the growth of e -commerce also comes with risks  for market participants . For established  brick -and-
mortar  businesses,  competition from e -commerce  can eat into market share s and profit margins . To the extent that 
local shops – often p illars of the community - are driven out of business, t he resulting economic disruption can cause  
considerable  anguish . At the same time, the difficulty of regulating online business es can increase the  risk that 
customers become the victim of fraud . To the extent that e -commerce giants come to dominate markets  and limit 
competition , customers  can be forced  into disadvantageous agreements – such as  signing up to  onerous terms of 
use.  
Digital markets create  new challenges for public re venue mobilization.  Online transactions obviate the need for a 
physical store front, potentially making it more difficult for governments  to enforce tax compliance.  Tax systems 
need to be upgraded to fully reflect the complexity of modern global online  businesses . Customs aut horities , 
established to focus on large  cross -border  container and truck shipments,  can struggle to  enforce taxes and duties 
in a world in which  small parcel s move across borders in large volumes . To ensure that growth of the digital economy 
does not also lead to growth of the grey economy  and tax avoidance , public revenue mobilization needs to  
modernize  and confront  the new challenges posed by  the rise of  e-commerce.  
The environmental footprint of e -commerce needs to be monitored . On the one hand, e -commerce eliminates the 
need for customers to drive to physical stores and purchase products.  More efficient inventory management and 
reduced need for showrooms can reduce the footprint of the retail sector.  Digitalization of products, such as the 
purchase of online books instead of hardcopies, can de -materialize industries. On the other hand, the growth of 
small parcel delivery – a natural by -product of e -commerce in goods – increases use of packaging. To the extent that  
16 
 e-commerce requires speedy deliverie s of small consignments  over large distances , it can lead to more extensive 
use of carbon -intensive air travel.  While e -commerce companies are continually innovating to reduce their packaging 
and logistics footprint , the net impact of the rise of the digit al economy on the environment needs to be closely 
monitored.   
 
TO LEVERAGE  E-COMMERCE,  ALBANIA CAN DRAW ON  INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE   
 
To leverage the opportunities from  the rise of  e-commerce, while managing risks, countries  and international 
institutions  around the world are developing  e-commerce action plans. In 2015, the European Commission  
unveiled its Single Digital Markets Strategy , setting out a roadmap for developing the  European Unions’  digital 
economy , including e -commerce.  In the political guidelines for the European Commission 2019 -2024, the digital 
economy  is one of the six key priorities that are singled out.   In the emerging market context, widely cited 
government strategies and act ion plans  include Egypt’s “ National E -Commerce Strategy ” (2016), the “Digital India”  
(2016) report and , Vietnam’s “E -Commerce Development Masterplan” (2016) . In 2016, UNCTAD la unched the 
“etrade for all ” initiative to help countries develop their e -commerce markets.  In 2019, the OECD launched its report 
“Unpacking e -commerce ”. 
The World Bank  Group  is moving forward on an  active and growing digital economy  development agenda , with 
significant work focused on e -commerce . A range of  global and regional reports have been published , assessing the 
opportunities, risks and reform needs linked to the rise of the digital economy . Seminal reports are the “Digital 
Divide nds”  World Development Report  (2016)  and the World Bank Report on Reaping Digital Dividends: Leveraging 
the Internet for Development in Europe and Central Asia  (2017). A series of  policy notes  on E-trade for Development  
(2019)  has develop ed a framework for e -commerce diagnostics . A cooperation with UNCTAD has assembled a 
dashboard of e -trade indicators  by country , published on the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) portal . In 
partnership with Google, the International Finance Corporation (IF C) released its e-Conomy Africa 2020 report . In 
the Europe 4.0  report  (2020) , the World Bank analyzes how Europe can navigate the latest digital economy 
developments.  Key regional and country diagnostics  recently completed by the World Bank,  assessing digital 
economy and e -commerce opportunities , include China  (2019) , Lao (2019) , Malaysia  (2018) , Philippines  (2020)  and 
South Asia  (2019) .  
 
E-COMMERCE CAN BE A PATHWAY TO  OVERCOMING KEY OBSTACLES TO TRADE  
 
For Albania, online markets can play a key role in overcoming traditional barriers to trade  and economic 
development . Online markets can help  (i) connect Albanians with markets, (ii) overcome information frictions  
between buyers and sellers  as well as (iii) tackle  limited access to finance . As such, th e digital economy has the 
potential to play a catalytic role in Albania’s  development.  
Many Albanian  customers  and sellers are poorly connected to markets – e-commerce  can help bridge physical 
distance . Reflecting its history of international isolation  and communism , close to 40 percent of Albania’s population  
still live in rural communities  away from  urban markets. As a small economy (population of 2.9 million) , Albanians  
are constrained by a limited domestic  national  market  – physical distance,  cumbersome border procedures , as well  
17 
 as other  trade barriers stand in the way of accessing  affluent markets  abroad  (EU population of 512.4 million) . In this 
context, e -commerce can  play an important role in connecting Albanians with markets. By  enabling customers  and 
sellers to trade remotely , online  shops can connect rural communities with urban markets , as well as Albania with 
the rest of the world . Many e -commerce platforms  now offer services that promise to take the hassle out of trading 
across border s, including by offering off-the-shelf  payment and logistics  solutions  for international trade , while 
providing support for completing administrative processes .   
Few Albanian firms have established strong  brands  and international client relationships  – online shopping  can 
help put Albanian companies on the map  and build trust with new buyers . Many Albanian companies  are small 
and struggling to gain the trust of consumers .3 Limited international brand recognition  and a lack of established  
relationships with buyers  abroad  is one of the reasons why only 16.4 percent of Albanian firms  have developed 
significant exporting activities  – behind  other Western Balkan peers, including  Bosnia and Herzegovina (36.4 percent) 
and Serbia (38.6  percent ).4 In this context, e -commerce can play a key role in bridging information frictions. Online 
search  and advertisement  can enable customers to find Albanian products.  A history of positive online reviews  by 
other customers may convince shoppers to purchase a product that they may not have  tried before. Listings through 
an established online marketplace platform  can further  establish trust . Buyers may be more comfortable sharing 
payment information with an established  platfor m, rather than directly with an unknown online seller. In case of 
disputes, buyers may take comfort that a trusted platform is involved in the transaction and can intermediate.  
Many Albanian businesses are small and face liquidity constrain ts – an online sales  channel  can enable 
entrepreneurs  to scale their business at  much  lower cost than would be possible using only conventional means . 
Building a conventional business requires significant investments in sales channels. Companies need to establish 
their o wn stores or convince other wholesale/retail outlets to carry their products.  Advertisement can be expensive . 
In a country like Albania, these costs can be prohibitive and deter entrepreneurship . Many businesses  are small – 
57.3 percent of Albanians report as self -employed, significantly above levels in  most  Western Balkan peers.  In part 
reflecting this, 21.2 percent of firms report that access to finance is a major constraint  for their business . 5 In this 
conte xt, e -commerce can enable business creation and expansion despite limited financing.  Many online businesses 
can be started from home.  Online marketing  offer s a low -cost way to gain the interest of customers.  Listing on online 
marketplaces abroad can be a simple  way of  testing demand for a product  in other countr ies – potentially 
establishing  the foundations for more comprehensive exporting relations  down the line , once a proof -of-concept 
has been established . 
Box: What is the evidence base on the impact of e-commerce on the economy?  
 
While rigorous evidence -based research on e -commerce is still limited, a body of literature is gradually 
emerging. Most research is centered on the US economy and finds sizeable consumer gains from e -commerce, 
including through access to a wider variety of  products. A range of papers also find benefits from greater 
competition, lowering prices and reallocating market share towards more productive firms. Key papers include:  
 
3 This issue is exacerbated by the lack of firms with internationally recognized quality certification. According to the 
2019 World Bank enterprise survey , only 13.2 percent of Albanian firms have an internationally recognized quality 
certification, as opposed to 34.5 percent of Serbian companies.

 • Brown and Golsbee (2002)  conclude that internet shopping reduced the price of life insurance by 8 -15 
percent on the US market  
• Freund and W einhold (2002)  and Freund and Weinhold (2004)  find that greater access to the internet 
increases international trade, including in services  
• Brynjolfsson et al (2003)  estimate significant consumer gains from access to a greater variety of products 
through e -commerce on the US market, exceeding by 7 to 10 times the benefit from lower prices through 
greater competition.  
• Goldmanis et al (2009)  document that the rise of e -commerce is accompanied by significant shifts in 
market structure in key US industries, with a shift of market share towards higher productivity fi rms. 
• Orlof (2011)  finds that the internet has reduced price dispersion in US airline tickets . 
• Lendle et al (2015)  compare the impact of geographic distance on conventional trade flows and trade 
facilitated through ebay. They find that the effect of distance to be on average 65% smaller on eBay , 
reflecting reduced information frictions .  
• Dolfen et al (2019)  estimate significant consumer gains from online shopping, with gains from access to 
a greater variety of products exceeding gains from greater convenience from avoiding travel  to a physical 
store . 
 
A particularly relevant case study for the emerging market context is recent evidence on the impact of e -
commerce in Chin ese rural communities . On the one hand, the rapid emergence of Chinese villages with 
significant e -commerce acti vity (the so -called Taobao villages) is often seen as success story for online trading, 
connecting rural communities with urban markets, see World Bank (2018) . On the other hand, Couture et al 
(2019)  use a randomized control led trial (RCT)  to study the impact of e -commerce facilitation meas ures - 
subsidized logistics and establishment of local e -commerce support service centers – on rural Chinese 
communities. The results of  the trial paint a more nuanced picture. The measures do not significantly increase 
the incomes of local businesses and workers. However, gains are achieved by lowering the cost of living for local 
consumers, in particular for younger, richer and more remote households. Local stores use access to e -commerce 
(or react to it) by expanding the variety of products they sell.  
 
Another relevant  body of  research body considers the role of digital platforms in growing the tourism sector.  
Hoonsawat (2015)  and Lopez -Cordova (2020)  estimate gravity models of trade in tourism services and find that 
fictions affecting bilateral tourism flows have been attenuated by the advent of digital tools . Zervas, Proserpio 
and Byers (2017)  find that market entry by Airbnb attenuates seasonal price fluctuations in the conventional hotel 
market. Baker and Twining -Ward (2018)  discuss the consequences of the rise of peer -to-peer accommodation 
services for the tourism industry. Salem and Twining -Ward (2018 ) discuss how user -generated online content 
creates new opportunities and challenges for the tourism sector.  
 
 
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DIAGNOSTIC  REPORT  
 
This World Bank diagnostic  provides a n assessment of Albania’s e -commerce sector  and identifies policy 
recommendations  to help Albania leverage the opportunities of online markets , while managing risks . This report 
reviews the state of Albania’s e -commerce sector, assessing key constraints faced by buyers, sellers and enabling 
service providers  – regarding both domestic a nd cross -border trade. The report then identifies policy 
recommendations.   
 
To reflect the complex multi -sectoral enabling environment required for e -commerce to thrive, this report reviews 
constraints and reform opportunities in a wide range of sectors . E-commerce can only thrive at the intersection of  
19 
 a complex multisectoral  enabling environment.  A strong foundational  infrastructure is needed, including reliable 
high -speed broadband internet access, strong payment systems and an efficient logistics backbo ne for trade in 
goods. A modern legal environment for e -commerce transaction includes a strong trust architecture detailing the 
rights and responsibilities of e -buyers, e -sellers and e -platforms (consumer protection, data and privacy, 
intermediary liabilit y and other), a transparent tax treatment as well as an effective market competition framework. 
Finally, an ecosystem of buyers, sellers and platforms needs to develop – requiring the gradual strengthening of e -
commerce skills, formalization of businesses and deepening of English language skills.

This report draws on a range of sources.  Existing e -commerce diagnostics from other countries, developed by 
national governments, the World Bank and other international institutions, are used as reference. Extensive use of 
data benchmarking, through existing databases as well as new data collection, allows for an as sessment of Albania’s 
e-commerce sector relative to Western Balkan peers (WB -6: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, 
North Macedonia, Serbia), other regional peers (Croatia, Greece, Turkey) and aspirational peers (Austria, Germany, 
Italy, U S). This has been supplemented with face -to-face interviews with Albanian government officials and e -
commerce businesses, as well as an online survey of Albanian consumers on their online purchasing experiences.  
This diagnostic has several  objectives.  In the first instance, this report strengthens the evidence base for reform of 
Albania’s e -commerce enabling environment.  As such, it can represent a blueprint that Albania can use as basis for 
the development of its own e -commerce action plan.  In the second i nstance,  this report aims to sensitize the  E-commerce

change in the way markets  work . In the third instance, by making the case for  reform, this diagnostic aims to 
motivate change on the ground  and contribute to the creation of  stronger enabling environment – allowing Albania 
to better take advantage of the opportunities that come with the rise of e -commerce, while managing its risks.

3. THE  STATE OF  ALBANIA’S E -COMMERCE SECTO R  
22 
 This chapter  provides an overview of  the current state of  Albania’s e-commerce sector , setting the stage for this 
diagnostic . To better understand the perceptions of Albanian customers  and businesses  vis-à-vis e -commerce,  the 
chapter summar izes findings from an online survey of Albanian online shoppers  as well as a series of qualitative 
interviews with e -commerce companies , conducted by the World Bank as part of this diagnostic . This sets the stage 
for subsequent in-depth  sector -by-sector  analysis  of this diagnostic . 
 
ALBANIA’S ONLINE  CONSUMERS  
 
The penetration of e -commerce among Albanian customers significantly lags behind regional peers. According to 
the 2017 Global Findex Survey, which reflects the latest globally comparable database, less than 7 percent of the 
Albanians report having used the  internet to buy something online over the past year.6 This is the lowest rate among 
the WB -6. It is also far behind other peer countries in the region with very similar income levels, such as Moldova. 
Estimated e-commerce user numbers from  statista.com p aint a somewhat less drastic picture – but continue to 
highlight Albania’s potential for further growth of its e -commerce sector.  
Few Albanians make purchases online…  … though exact numbers differ according to source  
and period of measurement

Both  (i) limited existing penetration of e -commerce and (ii) fast growth rates point to the significant potential of 
online markets in Albania and in the broader Western Balkans region.  Statista.com estimates e -commerce revenue 
growth to range between 19 and 49 percent among the benchmark countries used for this diagnostic. For Albania, 
the growth forecast stands at 34 percent for 2020 (as of November 2 020).

(ICT) usage in Households and by Individuals  2018 -19, online purchases were conducted by 10.1 percent of the

A Fall 2020  online survey o n how consumers  use e-commerce  in the Western Balkans, conducted as part of this 
diagnostic, offers  a useful window into the current state of play . Since the main dissemination channels were the 
World Bank Group regional social media accounts, the survey respondents inherentl y tend to represent a particular 
segment of the population – our typical participant is female  (74 percent of Albanian respondents) , from a capital 
city (69 percent)  and has already shopped online  (79 percent) . Nonetheless, the survey offers a useful windo w into 
the perceptions of what can reasonably be approximated as the marginal e -commerce consumer in the region.7 
The survey  highlights that the  COVID -19 pandemic  has further accelerated the use of online shopping . 54 percent 
of Albanian survey respondent s indicate that they have increased their use of online shopping during the crisis (WB -
6 average: 62 percent ). Out of these, 74 percent believe that they will continue to shop online more frequently once 
the pandemic is overcome (WB -6 average: 8 5 percent). Out of those Albanian survey participants  that have not yet 
used e -commerce, 69.3 percent indicate that they  expect to try it in the near future (WB -6 average: 68 percent).  
Online markets in Albania  are characterized by  (i) domestic sales through social media  and local webshops  settled 
through cash on delivery as well as (ii) e -shopping on international e-commer ce platforms settled through card 
transactions . Out of Albanian survey respondents that already use e -commerce, 67 percent highlight that they use 
social media to buy from domestic sellers, while 61 percent declare buying from international marketplaces. T he 
predominant means of payment for domestic transactions is cash on delivery (84 percent declare that cash on 
delivery is one of their primary payment methods for e -commerce transactions), while international transactions 
are largely settled through card payments (77 percent). While these are trends that are seen across the Western 
 
7 The online survey was open from 28 October to 22 November 2020, collecting  a total of 1533 respon ses. The data 
presented here includes 748 respondents from Albania, 122 respondents from Bosnia and Herzegovina, 258 
respondents from Kosovo, 129 respondents from Montenegro, 128 respondents from North Macedonia and 148

 Balkans, results are more pronounced in Albania. Relative to the rest of the Western Balkans, sales from the seller’s 
own website are relatively less common – likely reflecting a less developed e -commerce sector in Albania.

A key constraint for growth of online markets is a lack of trust in webshops, particularly when it comes to domestic 
sellers. 83 percent of Albanian survey respondents highlight that the risk of ordering a product that does not meet 
expectatio ns is a key constraint for online purchases from domestic sellers (WB -6 average: 83 percent). 30 percent 
see as main concern the risk of identify and payment theft. When it comes to cross -border transactions, these trust 
concerns remain a major factor. How ever, in addition, survey respondents highlight high delivery costs and the cost 
of customs duties.  
For the general population, access to accepted payment methods, lack of English language skills and lack of 
internet access remain other key challenges.  While our online social media survey can only reach a selected sample 
of the population, we try to counteract this by asking respondents for their perceptions as to key e -commerce 
constraints for the general population in their country.

Consumers view time saving and greater product choice as key benefits of shopping online.  Looking the beyond 
the need for social distancing during the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, 80 percent of Albanian respondents highlight 
time saving as key benefit of e -commerce (WB -6 average: 80 percent). 57 percent view greater product choice 
(beyond what is available in local stores) as core value proposition (WB -6 average: 67 percent).  
For around half of Albanian survey participants,  for the moment,  e-commerce is a complement to purchases from 
brick -and-mortar shop s, rather than a substitute.   34 percent of Albanian respondents indicate that their online 
shopping has displaced some purchases they would have otherwise made from local shops. 50 percent indicate that 
they mostly use e -commerce to purchase goods that ar e not available on the local markets. 15 percent report mainly 
using online shopping to buy from local stores. This suggests that, at its current stage of development, e -commerce 
still largely complements analogue markets in Albania – rather than replacing  them.

 enterprises have e -commerce sales.8 The vast majority of Albanian firms selling their own physical products online , 
which were  identified in the course of this diagnostic , were small  scale  businesses , selling niche artisanal products 
through  domestic and international marketplaces .9  
Compared to regional leaders, the scope for Albanian 
firms to grow e -commerce is large…  …the penetration of online marketplaces in Albania 
remains comparatively low…

However, a n Albanian entrepreneurship  ecosystem is gradually emerging that  re-sells imported goods  online  on 
the domestic market . Different setups  exist, in which the e -commerce company either acts as  pure market maker 
or is itself the re -seller of the product.  Relative to  the established international e -commerce websites, these Albanian 
e-commerce players  have generally developed tailored business models for the Albanian market . Because goods 
have already been imported in bulk , they can be delivered to the final customer more quickly  and at lower cost  (and 
the final customer is fully shielded from customs procedures ). Because Albanian firms cooperate with local logistic s 
compani es which accept cash -on-delivery (COD),  Albanians can order online without access to electronic payment 
systems. Websites are generally fully accessible in Albanian, meaning that no language barriers need to be overcome.  
Despite these advantages , these Albanian online re -sellers  are still in the process of establishing their credibility  and 
gaining customers . Their product offering is still limited  and further growth is needed to better exploit the economies 
 
8 While the Balkan Business Barometer of the Regional Cooperation Council uses an alternative survey to find a 
higher number, it also concludes that Alba nian firms trail Serbia and North Macedonia in the use of online sales 
channels.  
9 In part, this is likely to reflect an underlying shallow Albanian production base. Given a small domestic economy, 
still recovering from half a century of international isol ation and repression under a brutal communist regime, 
there are simply still few domestic companies ready to produce the type of product that can compete on 
international online markets.  0 10 20 30 40AlbaniaGreeceItalyTurkeyMontenegroGermanyAustriaBosnia and HerzegovinaCroatiaSerbiaEnterprises selling online (% of firms with

A thriving Albanian industry is developing around the sale and delivery of online services  abroad , particularly in 
business process outsourcing (BPO) . On one hand of the spectrum, Risi Albania estimates  that Albania’s BPO 
companies  employ be tween 25,000 to 32,000 professionals . These firms are  gradually evolving beyond basic call 
center s towards providing financial, HR and IT services.  They range from homegrown companies  to international 
players establishing Albanian subsidiaries.  On the other h and of the spectrum, many Albanian  self-employed  have 
been quick in adopting online freelance websites such as upwork.com  to offer on -demand online services , including  
website design, financial planning and translation services . On a per -capita basis, the penetration of Albanians on 
these freelance websites often exceeds that of many advanced economies. Given a  skilled  multilingual  workforce , 
limited local wages as well as the still significant barriers to emigration , Albania is ideally placed to provide on line 
services  at-distance  to the European and American market.  
Albania’s growing tourism sector is adopt ing online sales channels. Albania’s  tourism potential has long been 
under -explored.  With an extensive Mediterranean coastline , a plentiful endowment of forests, mountains and rivers 
as well as a rich cultural and historical heritage, Albania has plenty to offer for leisure and adventure travelers.  Yet, 
besides country branding, key bottlenecks include limited tourism infrastructure, such as h igh-end tourism resorts 
with close airport access, as well as few standing arrangements with international package tourism companies.  To 
overcome these  obstacles , local Albanian service providers  have been quick to adopt online platforms to directly 
reach out to new domestic and international customers  that are willing to take the initiative and make their own 
independent travel arrangements  to explore Albania . The growing use of online platforms such as booking.com  has 
played a key role in the expansion of  Albania’s tourism market . Between 2014 and 201 9, annual arrivals of foreign 
citizens into Albania grew by 74 percent, reaching 6.4 million arrivals in 201 9.

Around the e -commerce companies themselves, a growing eco -system of Albanian firms is emerging that provide s 
support services.   A range of Albanian and international courier services provide 3PL services for domestic and 
international delivery of goods , complementing the offering of the Albanian Post . A range of consultancies , law firms  
and IT companies  offer specialized packages to support e -commerce companies set up their business , helping 
entrepreneurs to navigate the often complex legal, techni cal and strategic decisions needed to build an online sales 
channel . Albanian electronic payment providers are emerging, including easypay, which  offer new payment options 
for Albanian e -customers and e -sellers.   
In interviews with Albanian e -commerce comp anies , conducted as part of the  preparation for this diagnostic , 
Albania’s large informal economy st ood out as important  constraint for the development of Albania’s formal 
digital economy . In general , the development of Albania’s formal economy is held bac k by unfair  competition from 
its still significant  informal economy , since the latter  does not face the costs that come with  tax and regulatory 
compliance . However, i n the context  of emerg ing online markets , pressures from the informal economy are 
heightened.  Digital markets make it easier for  informal businesses to reach more customers  – accentuating  
competitive pressure s. As many customers make  form their first impressions of  online markets, a negative 
experience with an informal company offering inferior services can undermine consumer confidence in  the e-
commerce sector in general . 
Albania n firms need to gain the  trust  of customers  – online platforms are often playing  a key intermediating role 
in this process.  In general, Albanian firms  suffer fr om the many negative stereotypes  that are unfortunately still  
associated with  the Albania n country brand . In the context of e -commerce, these concerns can be heightened. 
Customers are purchasing goods online sight unseen. When making electronic payments, they are sharing personal 
information with the vendor.  They need to trust in the vendor’s assurance that returned products will be refunded, 
if they do not meet expectations.  In this context , trusted international online market platforms can play  a key 
intermediating role and bridge trust gaps . By handling payment processing  and explicitly or implicitly providing 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200TurkeyGermanyItalyAustriaGreeceUSACroatiaMontenegroBiHAlbaniaNorth MacedoniaSerbiaFreelancers and agencies on upworks.com

 assurances on product quality  and return services , the platforms can facilitate transactions between sellers and 
customers that do not  have existing  trusted relationships.  
Interviews with Albanian e -commerce companies  highlighted a range of constraints specific to the digital 
economy . These includ e (i) limited adoption of electronic payments, (ii)  limited logistics and difficult border 
procedures, (iii)  a tax system that does not fit e -commerce and (iv) a lack of digital skills among  customers and among  
workers . The prevalence cash and the limited use of electronic payments significantly  comp licates the business 
model of e -commerce companie s. Expensive and slow logistics, including customs border procedures , limit the 
ability of businesses to reach their customers.  An u nclear and disadvantageous tax treatment  hold e -commerce 
companies back.  Many Albanian customers are still not comfortable participating in the digital economy. The pool 
of IT and e -commerce specialists  that can help bring businesses online remains limited.  The subsequent chapters of 
this report will review these challenges, as well as possi ble policy actions to address them, in greater detail.  
 
MAPPING THE STATE OF ALBANIA’S E-COMMERCE ECOSYSTEM  
 
Overall , Albania’s main current  e-commerce activity is focused on (i) the import of foreign goods  into Albania and 
(ii) the export  of Albanian serv ices to the advanced economies  – these fundamental patterns reflect the existing 
underlying structural realities of the Albanian economy and will be slow to change . The pattern of online trade in 
goods is to a large extent driven by Albania’s still  limited  base of  internationally competitive  domestic  goods 
producers . On the one hand,  this limits  the online sale of “made in Albania”  goods to niche products . On the other 
hand,  this leads Albanians to purchase more foreign -produced goods  online, as Albanian incomes  and demand for 
advanced products grow  - an ecosystem of Albanian firms  is emerging t hat play an  intermediat ing role  in this process  
(e-commerce platforms,  but also  logistics companies, electronic payment providers , consultancie s etc ), creating new 
jobs for Albania ns. The pattern for online trade in services reflects the  availability of a relatively skilled and low -cost 
Albanian labor force. The digital service industry  allows Albanians  to enjoy (digital) access to labor markets that offer 
better pay, while avoid ing outright emigration – which requires often painful  uprooting from  their local communities 
and (as-of-yet) navigating complicated emigration processes  to advanced economic zones like the EU .  
Yet, our scan of the Albani an e -commerce landscape also reveals a range of specific measures Albania can take in 
the short and medium -run to make fuller  use of its existing  digital markets opportunit y – these actions are the 
subject of the subsequent sections of this report.  While economic fundamentals will continue to shape the major 
pattern of Albanian e -commerce trade flows for the years to come, individual Albanian e -customers and e -producers 
are also constrained by a myriad of smaller and yet sizeable constraints  that pre vent Albania from making better use 
of its existing digital markets opportunity.  Many of these constraints can be alleviated  in the short and medium term  
through concerted government and private sector actions  – and in turn , by creating new  economic  opport unities for 
Albanian businesses , workers  and consumers,  they can lay the foundations for more fundamental structural progress 
of Albania’s economy.  These  policy actions  are the focus of this report.  The subsequent sections of this report will 
in turn revie w recommended  policy actions in the domain of  (i) logistics and customs, (ii) payment services, (iii) 
digital connectivity, (iv) private sector e -commerce capabilities and skills and (v) the regulatory and tax environment.

4. STRENGT HENING  LOGISTICS AND CUSTOMS   
33 
 Reliable, fast and low -cost logistics  services are foundational enablers  for the growth  of e-commerce in goods.  E-
commerce companies that sell goods online need to either develop in -house logistics capabilities or, more likely, 
establish partnerships with 3rd party logistics (3PL). International and domestic bulk shipment is needed to move 
goods to local warehouses and delivery centers. International and domestic postal and courier services are needed 
for final last -mile delivery of parcels to customers.  
Efficient clearance at the border is crucial for cross -border e -commerce. Both bulk shipments and small 
consignment parcels need to be able to cross borders without facing undue tariffs/fees, complicated administrative 
procedures or time delays. This require s customs procedures that have adapted to a world in which a large volume 
of small e -commerce parcels are delivered across borders. Customs formalities need to be predictable and follow 
the rule of law.  
Given (i) a large body of existing work on challenges  for international bulk shipment in Albania and (ii) the 
particular challenges facing trade in small consignments, t his section of this e -commerce diagnostic focuses on  
actions needed to facilitate  small parcel  delivery . Relative to bulk container shipments, many of the challenges 
faced in small parcel logistics are heightened. Administrative steps that may appear small for a container can become 
significant if they are applied separately for each package in a large courie r shipment. At the same time, challenges 
for trade in bulk shipment in Albania are already amply analyzed in other technical assistance reports, including this 
UNECE (2015)  report. This section of the diagnostic therefore focuses on logistics and customs challenges for small 
consignments.  
 
POSTAL AND COURIER LOGISTICS  
 
Albania has 15 registered postal  and courier  operators , with the dominant player being the Albania Post .10 The 
Albanian Agency for Electronic and Postal Communications (AKEP) regulates the sector and maintains a register of 
official operators. According to its 2018 annual report, the Albanian Post – a strategic state -owned enterprise (SOE) 
of the Government of Albania - generates 66 percent of market revenues, followed by DHL and Ulysses/Fedex. 
Besides the official postal operators, market participants report a large number of informal businesses that offer 
letter and pa rcel delivery services, creating significant competition for formal operators.  
While Albania Post offers a low -cost postal service across Albania,  prices are still elevated relative to local incomes 
– key drivers of operational costs include (i) the limite d scope for economies of scale  in a small national market 
and (ii) an imbalance between inbound and outbound international parcel shipments.  While basic parcel delivery 
prices are low in absolute terms compared to peers, affordability relative to local inc omes remains elevated.  Several 
structural factors drive up the operational costs of postal delivery. First, national postal operators have limited scope 
for developing economies of scale in a national market of 2.9 million inhabitants. This is particularly  acute given the 
need to service Albania’s many rural communities, where low volumes limit revenue margins. Second, the cost of 
international postal service is driven up by a significant imbalance between inbound and outbound parcel deliveries. 
According t o the Universal Postal Union (UPU), more than three times as many parcels enter Albania as are sent

 abroad (a pattern also mirrored in Albania’s overall trade balance) – meaning that planes and trucks on outbound 
trips are often not loaded to capacity, dri ving up the unit cost of delivery.

compared to peers…  … costs  remain elevated compared  to local incomes

Alania’s unreliable  address system  is a structural obstacle to cost -effective and timely postal delivery. Given rapid 
urbanization and the frequent change of street names, the Albanian address system remains unreliable. Many 
Albanians are uncertain about their own address. While postal operators have learned to cope - employing local 
staff with knowledge of the local community, encouraging senders to add description of local lan dmarks to address 
labels, calling recipients to locate them – this is still driving up day -to-day operational costs of delivery and causes 
delays.  A key action to bring down the cost of domestic parcel delivery is therefore:  
• Modernization of the Albanian address system: a renewed effort is needed to establish a transparent address 
system for Albania, requiring a concerted and coordinated efforts by Albania’s local governments. A strong 
outreach effort is needed to ensure that local communities acc ept the resulting address system and start to use 
it in their daily life. The World Bank book Street Addressing and the Management of Cit ies (2005)  offer a useful 
collection of international experiences with such reform efforts . 
The c overage of Albania Post is comparable to  international  peers  – but there is scope to strengthen reliability.  
The Albania Post continues to offer a strong netwo rk of local offices, connecting Albanians with each other and with 
the rest of the world. According to UPU statistics, 96 percent of the population receive their mail delivered at home. 
Rural areas are serviced on average three times a week. Nonetheless, t he reliability of the service can be further 
improved. According to the UPU’s reliability score, based on the average and variability of delivery times, Albania 
ranks low compared to regional and aspirational peers. In its 2019 overall postal development r anking, combining 
scoring on reliability, reach, relevance and resilience, the UPU ranks Albania 83rd out of 172 countries.  0 2 4 6 8 10MoldovaMontenegroTurkeyNorth MacedoniaAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaKosovoGreeceSerbiaCroatiaAustriaGermanyItalyRetail cost of sending a domestic parcel

Recognizing the growth potential of e -commerce, Albania Post is gradually rolling out value -added services to 
better support the digital economy – but scope for further strengthening its product offerings is large . Given the 
worldwide trend in e -commerce and recognizing the resu lting revenue opportunity, the Albania Post has taken a 
range of measures to better serve the growth of digital markets. Notably, in 2018, the Albania Post introduced pre -
payment of border tax and customs duties for international parcels arriving in Albani a on behalf of recipients, making 
online shopping from foreign websites significantly more convenient for Albanians.11 In 2019, the Albania Post 
introduced at -home parcel delivery in urban areas (rural customers still have to collect their parcel at the closest 
post office). In 2020, the Albanian Post is rolling out a first series of automatic 24 -hour parcel lockers, enab ling 
Albanians to collect parcels outside of business hours and with minimal wait. Nonetheless, scope to introduce further 
services for e -commerce customers remains vast, including:  
• Simplified returns procedures : Currently, product returns require the customer to start new paperwork and 
pay for a new parcel shipment at the Post Office. Instead, agreements with major e -commerce companies could 
make returns more convenient. A bar code system could be set up that would identify the product return when 
brou ght to the Post Office and automatically generate labeling for the return box. E -commerce companies would 
have the option to offer customers a service under which the company pays for the return shipment.  The 
Albanian Post is already building these capabil ities. But they n ow need to be marketed  and offered as part of a 
standard package service for e -commerce business accounts.  Such services are routinely offered by postal 
operators in other countries such as UPS. 
 
11 Pre-2018, Albanian recipients of in ternational parcels subject to VAT and/or customs duties generally had to pay 
the border customs office, before parcels could be released for delivery. Under the new pre -payment arrangement, 
the Albania Post pre -pays VAT and customs to ensure the release o f the parcel at customs. The recipient then 
compensates the Albania Post when collecting the parcel. This saves the parcel recipient the administrative burden 
of separate transactions with the customs office and the Albania Post.  05000100001500020000250003000035000International parcel traffic

• International c ollect -on-delivery  (COD)  payment solution:  one reason  Albanian e -sellers currently do not reach 
many Western Balkan online shoppers is the relatively low penetration of electronic paym ents in the region. 
Within Albania, the Post therefore already offers a COD product – with the Post collecting payment for the 
product, on behalf of the seller, on delivery of the product to the customer. Extending such an offering to 
international deliver y, particularly in the Western Balkans, could significantly strengthen the reach of Albanian 
e-sellers in the region. The Postpak scheme  between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia is an 
interesting existing example for this type of initiative.   
 
• Online label printing  service and adoption of internationally harmonized parcel label : adoption of latest 
harmonized labeling standards (such as the standard introduced by IPC Interconnect ) will allow international 
parcel shipments to benefit from faster handling abroad. By o ffering the option of online label printing before 
bringing the package to the Post office, administrative costs for both e -sellers and the Albanian Post can be 
reduced.

 The formal private courier market focuses  on offering premium express service s – measures to strengthen 
competition can potentially further improve services available to e -commerce companies . Two key constraints 
prevent the courier market from working more efficiently. First, the growth of regist ered formal courier services is 
held back by unfair competition from a large number of informal operators, which often provide inferior service, but 
– without tax and regulatory burden – can offer better prices. Second, competition among formal courier com panies 
is limited by the nature of the market. While there are few legal restrictions12 to new market entry, effective barriers 
particularly for international parcel delivery are high: courier services need to become registered customs agents to 
go through  customs on behalf of their customers, establish strong relationships with the customs office, build 
partnerships with courier offices in destination countries, build significant operational knowhow to execute 
international shipments and achieve the volume s necessary to break even. Price transparency is limited, given e -
commerce companies generally negotiate bilateral volume -based tariffs at substantial discount relative to headline 
prices offered to retail customers. In this environment, the following meas ures can strengthen the courier market:  
• Rigorously enforce f ormalization of the  private  courier market:  by rigorously enforcing that all operators 
comply with regulations and taxes, a more level playing field can be established, allowing the most competiti ve 
couriers to grow. As sub -standard informal courier services are forced to exit the market, e -customers are more 
likely to benefit from quality logistics services and have a positive e -commerce user experience.  
 
• Regular compilation and publication of dom estic and international tariff comparison tables among courier 
services:  To strengthen competition among the existing registered courier services, the AKUM could consider 
mandating regular publication of a postal and courier service tariff comparison tabl e – as recently introduced 
by the EU through its cross -border parcel directive . 
 
 
CUSTOMS PROCEDURES FOR SMALL CONSIGNMENTS  
 
The quality of trade and customs procedures is key to fully exploiting the benefits of cross -border e -commerce . 
Besides the direct cost of paying taxes and duties at customs, the burden of administrative procedures impacts on 
the cost, speed and convenience of cross -border trade. In the c ase of cross -border e -commerce and the delivery of 
small parcels, these concerns are heighte ned – with the cost of administrative procedure often large relative to the 
value of the shipment itself.  
While tariffs are generally low, burdensome non -tariff mea sures  and border clearance procedures  are still  
significant barriers for international trade.  Albania’s imports tariffs are relatively low and transparent, relative to 
other countries in the region. Through its Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)  with the EU and as a 
member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), Albania also faces no or low tariffs when exporting 
to key trading partners. However, while Albania imposes limited non -tariff measures (such as health and product 
standards , technical and labelling requirements, etc.) on imports, non -tariff measures in key trading partners create 
significant barriers for potential Albanian exporters. The existing production of Albanian firms often does not meet 
the onerous standards required  by advanced market. When the standards are met, firms often need to go through

 costly and complicated procedures to receive the certifications validating that the standards are met. Equally, the 
border clearance procedures of Albania and other Western Bal kan countries continue to rank low.

In line with international best practice, Albania has a simplified  regime for cross -border  trade in  small 
consignments.  A “de minimis” value of 22 euros has been set, below which imports are exempt from import VAT 
and customs duties, saving on administrati ve costs. Authorized traders that are processing a large number of cross -
border parcels (such as logistics companies handling a large number of parcels on behalf of cross -border e -sellers) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6CroatiaItalyGreeceGermanyAustriaUnited StatesAlbaniaMontenegroMoldovaNorth MacedoniaBosnia and HerzegovinaSerbiaTurkey

 can file simplified declarations for each item, to be followed thro ugh filling of a supplementary summary declaration 
within 24 hours. Schemes for “Local Clearance” and “Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)” status have been 
legalized and have the potential to further reduce the administrative costs of frequent traders – though they are not 
widely used in Albania yet.    
Nonetheless, p ostal and courier operators report high administrative costs in clearing small consignments at 
Albanian customs – (i) driving up the fees that operators charge for handling customs and (ii) con tributing to 
delivery delays . Operators report the need for frequent and drawn -out negotiations with customs officials, who are 
sometimes unfamiliar with the procedures for export/import of small consignment parcels (particularly at land 
borders) and who r equest submission of additional documents that are not technically required under the customs 
code.13 Operators face significant administrative costs in handling VAT and customs payments on imports, either (i) 
because they process the payment on behalf of the sender/recipient or (ii) because they need to wait until the 
customer has paid taxes/duties and t he customs office releases the parcel for circulation. To reduce administrative 
burden at customs and to speed up procedures, the following actions can be considered:  
• Ensure transparent and predictable application of customs procedures, by creating a simp le online manual 
for small consignment customs procedures and strengthening training of customs officials. To clarify customs 
procedures, the customs office could maintain a transparent website explaining in non -technical language 
document requirements for  import and export. All front -line customs officials should be trained in the particular 
procedures necessary for processing small parcel consignments, ensuring consistent and predictable 
implementation of the customs procedures.  
 
• Simplify payment of tax a nd customs duties for imports, by (i) i ntroduc ing an Albanian online VAT one -stop -
shop (OOS)  to replace import Vat for registered traders  and (ii) raising the “de minimis”  value  for import 
duties to the EU level  of 150 euros : by allowing selected importers  to charge VAT to end -customers online and 
to pay on the OSS, products of such importers could be exempt from VAT on importation at the customs office. 
This measure is planned to be adopted in the EU by 2021 under its VAT e -commerce package . By combining this 
measure with an increase of the “de minimis” for customs duties from currently 22 euros to 150 euros, hence 
aligning the customs code with the EU, significantly more small consignments could be exempt from VAT/duties 
on entering Albania – lowering administrative costs and time delays at the border.  
Box: Decline in Albanian parcel imports after reduction  in VAT and duties  de minimis  in 2016 to 22 euros  
 
Many countries set a “de minimis” value below which small consignment parcels are exempt from  import VAT 
and duties at customs. However, the appropriate level of the “de minimis” is subject to considerable debate. On 
the one hand, a “de minimis” allows customs officials to avoid costly administrative procedures on small parcels 
that will yield few revenues. E -commerce companies and e -customers also gain, because they do not have to pay 
at customs (both a direct financial saving and an adm inistrative time saving). On the other hand, the “de minimis” 
leads to a loss in direct revenue collection of the State on small consignment imports. This is exacerbated in 
countries with poor internal tax compliance, where border customs is often the most  effective point in the value 
chain to enforce revenue collection. Furthermore, the “de minimis” means that foreign e -commerce companies 
selling at -distance can offer their products without attaching the cost of VAT and customs duties, distorting 
competiti on vis -à-vis local firms that are subject to VAT (and that do pay customs duties when importing larger 
shipments in bulk for domestic re -sale).  
 
13 A key issue of contention reported by courier services is the need for certification of origin for exports.   
40 
  
In 2016, Albania lowered its high “de minimis” from 160 euros to 22 euros – both for VAT and for customs 
duties . This measure aligned the VAT “de minimis” with the EU level. However, it also means that the Albanian 
“de minimis” for customs duties is now significantly lower than the EU level (150 euros).    
 
Albania’s international parcel receipts declined following  drop in de minimis  
 
Source: Universal Postal Union (UPU) statistics; averages are formed for each country based on years for 
which data is reported in a given year interval  
 
As a result of this measure, purchases by Albanian residents from foreign e -commerce websites became 
significantly more costly and cumbersome after 2016. After years in which Albanians had become used to 
purchasing from abroad without facing VAT and import duties on most products, the change in policy let to a 
sharp increase in cos ts. Albania’s VAT standard rate is 20 percent and other duties average 2.4 percent. The 
change in policy also made foreign purchases more cumbersome, since (in the absence of arrangements for the 
e-seller to cover customs duties) the Albanian e -customer ha d to pay customs duties to the Albanian customs 
office before the parcel could be released.14    
 
A sharp drop in international parcel receipts by Albanians mirrors this policy change. While other Western 
Balkan peers saw continued growth of small parcel consignment arrivals, Albania saw a close to 25 percent decline 
in inbound parcels in 2016 -18. Refl ecting continued discontent about the change in “de minimis”, the Albanian e -
customers in the e -commerce survey conducted for this diagnostic continue to highlight high VAT and import 
duties as their most pressing concern when buying online.  
 
 
Charging pr actices by customs officials discourage trade, particularly for small consignments . First, a scanning fee 
is due on consignments entering or leaving Albania (equivalent to 22 euros if the value of the consignment is over 
1,000 euros or 5 euros if the value  is below the said threshold). This constitutes an unusual and implicit tax on both 
exports and imports, which is particularly onerous for small parcels – for which the scanning fee can be a significant 
fraction of the underlying value of the good. Second,  importers report that customs officials routinely correct 
declared import valuations upwards – driving up the effective import VAT and customs duties charged. The WTO 
 
14 Since 2018, Albania Post has i ntroduced an arrangement under which the Post will pre -pay customs duties. This 
allows customers to pay for customs duties at the Post Office when collecting their parcel, instead of making a 
separate transaction at the customs office.  -30-20-100102030

 Valuation Agreement (which is transposed in Albanian legislation) requires customs offic ials to follow a sequence of 
valuation methods15 until the value of a good can be established. However, officials routinely ignore the primary 
valuation method that should be used – the transaction value method – because they do not trust the commercial 
invoices submitted by the importer, particularly if goods are sold at discount. Instead, officials revert to use of a 
valuation database with reference prices – which often leads to a significantly higher valuation than what has been 
declared by the importer . 
• Eliminate the scanner fees for low-value  consignments: the Government could abolish the scanning fee, which 
is a drag on Albania’s e -commerce performance. In the absence of this, the Government could consider waving 
the scanning fee for low -value consign ments (a natural threshold could be 150 euros, which is the EU “de 
minimis” for customs duties).16 
 
• Strengthen valuation methods used at customs: train customs officers (i) to use the commercial invoice 
provided as primary valuation method, (ii) to use the  reference pricing database as a tool to identify problematic 
invoices, rather than a source of “correct” valuations, and (iii) to rely more frequently on post -clearance control 
functions to identify fraud cases. Customs should publish clear guidelines for  its officials to follow when dealing 
with cases in which the prices of the same good may vary considerably, or cases in which the declared price is 
well below the market level.

Box: Managing the impact of international e -commerce on domestic brick -and-mortar r etailers  
 
This chapter recommends a range of measures t hat will  make it  more affordable and convenient for Albanians 
to purchase goods from international webshops . Introducing an online VAT one -stop shop, raising the de minimis 
for import duties, eliminating scanning fees for low -value consignments – all these measures will make it more 
affordable and convenient for Albanians to purchase goods from international webs hops. Clear winners from 
these measures will be the Albanian consumer, but also international e -commerce websites.  
 
While Albanian customers will gain, these  measures may hurt  existing  Albanian  brick -and-mortar shops if 
customers use international online shopping to replace domestic offline purchases . In the facebook survey 
prepared for this e -commerce diagnostic, 65 percent of Albanians responded that the products they buy online 
are not available in local shops. This suggests that, a t the current stage of development of Albania’s e -commerce 
industry, cannibalization of offline sales through online shopping is limited. However, as ample anecdotal 
evidence from advanced economies has demonstrated, as e -commerce becomes more pervasive, i t can become 
competition for traditional retailers.  
 
To respond to greater competition through international e -commerce,  Albanian brick -and-mortar shops  will 
need to adapt their business models . On the one hand, many Albanian businesses will need to develo p their own 
online sales channels to compete with international webshops - turning their physical (and cultural/language) 
proximity to local customers into a key competitive advantage in local online markets. For instance, domestic 
shipments can be done mo re quickly and cheaply than shipments from abroad. Albanian brick -and-mortar shops 
can offer their Albanian online customers the option to return products at physical store locations – which can be 
more appealing to customers than to negotiate returns by p hone/email and then to send the product back as 
international parcel shipment. On the other hand, Albanian businesses need to focus on the value -added services 
that only brick -and-mortar shops can provide. This can mean an even greater emphasis on in -store  personalized 
customer advice by sales representatives and more attention on making shopping “an experience”. To the extent 
that Albanian brick -and-mortar shops respond to international e -commerce competition by strengthening their 
own business models, ope ning up can play an important role in helping Albania move towards a more productive 
economy.  
 
To contain  disruption of domestic businesses through increased competition from international e -commerce, 
the transition towards a more open economy needs to be managed carefully . It is likely that some local  
43 
 businesses will become unviable in the face of more intense competition from international e -commerce. In those 
cases, government needs to play a key role in buffering the shock for the affected firms and wor kers, redistributing 
the gains from greater international trade more evenly across Albanian society. This means strengthening the 
social safety net, providing training opportunities for workers to re -tool, offering job matching services to help 
workers fin d new employment opportunities and strengthening the business environment to enable the creation 
of new jobs.  
 
 
Going beyond these measures, a large reduction in the cost of international trade  will require eliminating customs 
procedures by joining into a  customs union  with key trading partners . Negotiating customs will always generate 
administrative burden and create time delays – for parcel services, these issues will always be particularly acute. To 
significantly bring down the cost and time of border c learance procedures, it is necessary to eliminate customs 
procedures by joining a customs union. The EU offers a useful example on the potential for cross -border e -commerce 
once border customs procedures are dropped. EU e -commerce platforms can offer signi ficantly more attractive 
delivery prices and times within the EU than outside - among other reasons because intra -EU trade does not require 
dealing with customs. Partly as a result, cross -border e -commerce within the EU is significantly more developed than  
with the rest of the region  (differences  in the level of development of the local logistics sector are also likely 
important explanatory factors ). A key policy measure, which could – among many other consequences – also catalyze 
Albania’s e -commerce marke t is therefore:  
• Eventually, i ntegrate  into regional economy  by joining a  customs union , such as EU, CEFTA or at the WB -6 
level.  
A customs union can play a key role in bringing 
down the cost and time delays for cross -border e -
commerce … … which can help inte rnational e -trade gain traction

The private sector can bring down the costs of logistics by developing warehousing  and delivery center  capabilities  
in the country of their customer . Ordering goods online to be shipped as a cross -border parcel is costly and leads to 
long delivery times. If customs procedures are involved, the customer often needs to make a second payment to 
customs for import VAT and custo ms duties before the parcel is released at the border and can be delivered. As 
such, Albanian e -customers stands to gain from the expansion of Albanian domestic warehousing and delivery center 
infrastructure. Under this business model, e -commerce companies  ship products in bulk to Albanian warehouses. 
When an e -customer orders the good, she then only pays for the additional parcel delivery within Albania – and 
receives the good within the usually significantly shorter domestic delivery delays. While Albania n warehousing and 
online platforms are already emerging, the sector remains nascent. None of the leading international e -commerce 
platforms have established an Albanian warehousing hub so far. Equally, few Albanian e -sellers have established a 
strong enoug h EU and US business to warrant building stocks in local warehouses in those countries. Yet, as e -
commerce grows, the case for such arrangements will become stronger – bringing down the per -unit cost of cross -
border logistics. The private sector needs to p roactively seek opportunities for the establishment of local 
warehousing and delivery services.  
• Developing warehousing and delivery center capabilities in the country of the customer: Albanian e -sellers 
need to stock inventory at warehousing/delivery cente rs in the country of their customer. Equally, Albanian and 
international e -sellers need to either develop their own Albanian delivery centers or stock inventory at delivery 
centers operated by other companies in Albania.

5. LEVERAGING ELECTRONIC PAYMENT S  
48 
 Electronic payment  instruments play a central role in facilitating e -commerce. Online payments allow remote 
processing of transactions, without seller and buyer (or an intermediary) physically meeting. For consumers, easy -
to-use online payments can play a key contributing r ole in ensuring a seamless and convenient online shopping 
experience. By avoiding cash, merchants can save on the administrative costs of handling coins and bills, while 
reducing the scope for employee fraud and facilitating book -keeping. The main electron ic payment instruments used 
for e -commerce include debit cards, credit cards, credit transfer, direct debit and e -money.  
This chapter reviews key constraints to the adoption  and use  of electronic payments  in e-commerce, both f rom 
the perspective of Albani an customers and online shops . The aim is to benchmark adoption of electronic payments, 
review key constraints and then to highlight recommendations to address market obstacles. This work builds on 
extensive existing analytical work on payment service diag nostics, including the 2018 -23 National Payments Strategy  
of Albania (prepared by the Bank of Albania with World Bank Technical Assistance) and the World Bank (2016) global 
report on electronic payme nts adoption by small retailers . 
Box: Introduction  to Albania’s  existing landscape for payment services  
 
The Bank of Albania  (BoA)  plays various critical roles in the Albanian national payments system.  It acts as 
operator of payment systems, overseer of the national payments system, and catalyst of change.  BoA is legally 
empowered as the regulator and overseer of the Albanian nationa l payments system. These powers explicitly 
cover payment and securities settlement systems, as well as payment instruments.  
The National Payment Systems Committee of Albania (NPSC) is another relevant consultative body , chaired by 
the BoA and consisting o f various public and private sector stakeholders (e.g. government agencies, banks, non -
bank payment service providers, among other) . The purpose of the NPSC is to support and contribute to increasing 
the security, stability and efficiency of the national p ayment system in Albania. The NPSC does not have juristic 
personality, and its decisions are not binding for participating members  but rather have a consultative role . 
Participants in the committee are banks, non -banks financial institutions which are inst itutions licensed and 
supervised by BoA and government agencies.   
The main providers of payment instruments, services and infrastructure in Albania are commercial banks , 
although there are also some non -bank providers such as e -money issuers, money transfer operators, and the 
Albania Post.  
 
Government payments are to a large extent  already  digitized in Albania  (on both, the collection and 
disbursement side).  However, ce rtain use cases still rely on cash:  pensions and social assistance programs, which 
are primarily channeled through the Albania Post; payments for certain government obligations, mainly enabled 
through paper -based credit transfers.  
 
A legal framework that promotes innovation and competition in the payments marketplace is developing in 
Albania.  Laws and BoA regulations have been amended to accommodate new technologies and business models. 
For example, the new Law on Payment System s provides the possibility f or non-banks  to compete in the payments 
market. Further, the legal foundations for the provision of digital financial services ha ve been established , 
including for electronic payments, electronic signatures, electronic communications and electronic identif ication 
of customers. Nevertheless, more remains to be done in order to keep up with the fast -evolving technologies and 
business models in the electronic payments industry.  
 
ACCESS AND USAGE OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AMONG ALBANIAN CUSTOMERS   
49 
  
Many Albanians  still lack access to transaction accounts - a prerequisite for most electronic payment instruments . 
According to the 2017 World Bank Findex survey, only 40 percent of Albanian adults have access to a transaction 
account with a financial institution – less than in any other country of the Western Balkans and significantly behind 
equivalent rates in the EU. Mirroring low account penetration, the usage of electronic payments instruments by 
Albanians severely lags behind peers.  
The penetration of accounts lags  behind regional 
peers…  … household surveys suggest that key drivers are a lack 
of funds and the cost of accounts

 A range of structural factors hold back the penetration of basic payment services among Albanians – these will 
take time to tackle . First, for many Albanians, low incomes and savings mean that an account (or electronic payment 
services) offers limited direct benefits. 77 percent of Albanian Findex survey respondents indicated a lack of funds 
as main reason for lack of access to an acc ount. Second, a key contributing factor is likely the prevalence of the  grey 
economy.  According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), 31.9 percent of non -agricultural employment in 
Albania is informal (2016 data). The IMF estimates a VAT complianc e gap of 30 percent of revenues (2016). Given 
the scale of undeclared economic activity, many Albanian workers and firms are likely reluctant to use financial 
services, which would leave a formal record that could be used to deduce their economic activity.  Third,  without 
more use -cases in their daily lives, many consumers and businesses have little to gain from acquiring electronic 
payment capabilities.  A 2018  World Bank and Bank of Albania  report on  “The Retail Payment Costs and Savings in 
Albania ” concludes that Albanian consumers make and receive day -to-pay payments overwhelmingly in cash (96 
percent of payments initiated as compar ed to 90 percent of payments received).17 Equally, businesses accepting 
electronic payments are limited to 15 percent of the business sample. Without more businesses and government 
offices accepting electronic payments, customers have limited incentive to gain access to these services. In turn, 
without more customers requesting electronic payments, firms have limited incentive to invest in the necessary 
infrastructure. This further entrenches the habit of customers and businesses to settle transactions in c ash.  
In the short term, some immediate steps can be taken to broaden access to affordable electronic payment services 
which can be used for online shopping. 47 percent of Albanian Findex survey respondents without account indicate 
that the cost of financi al services is a deterrent. In part, this likely reflects that many Albanians – having never had 
an account – are likely to over -estimate the effective costs of an account (which are often complex and difficult to 
understand) and undervalue its benefits. H owever, in part, this likely also reflects that traditional banks have limited 
interest in offering no -frills basic accounts to attract low -income depositors – since these depositors are often seen 
as unlikely to become significant profit generators for th e bank going forward. Given the significant social benefits 
of allowing more Albanians to become users of financial services, including (but not limited to) access to e -
commerce, this creates a rationale for Government and central bank intervention to broa den access to basic 
accounts and electronic payment services.  
• Legislate  a “basic payments account” , ensuring access to a transparent and low -cost starter bank account and 
debit card for those that have never held an account before and are part of vulnerable groups (e.g. low 
income, rural residents, pensioners, out of labor force) : roll-out of “basic payments account” framework, 
requiring banks to offer  broad right of access for all Albanian residents to a basic low -cost bank account with  
transparen t statement of fees  and debit card  service. This is already among the high priorities of the Bank of 
Albania under the technical assistance of the World Bank and was also decided on during the IV National 
Payments System Council meeting. To strengthen comp etitive pressure to bring down fees, the Bank of Albania 
has already established a fee comparison website to compare the costs of different account offerings. To further 
leverage competition, the legislative provision should also include a  simple protocol that allows account holders 
to move from one institution to another.  This would follow the principles laid out in the 2014  EU directive  on 
the comparability  of fees related  to payment  accounts,  payment  account  switching  and access  to payment  
accounts  with  basic  features . In the process, BoA has to monitor closely the due diligence process that is being 
followed for onboarding customers. The fact that Albania was included in the grey list of the Financial Action 
Task Force ( FATF ) for Money Laundering in 2020 means tha t financial institutions might impose more stringent 
 
17 The report was part of a broader ongoing technical assistance (Remittances and Payments Program) that the 
World Bank is providing to Bank of Albania on various aspects of retail payments and remittances market (e.g. 
infrastructure, int eroperability, legal/regulatory, financial education).   
51 
 due diligence and know -your -customer (KYC) procedures (that go beyond the requirements set by BoA) in order 
to comply with recommendations. However, it is imperative that this is not done disproportionat ely at the 
expense of the more vulnerable communities that are the most in need of transaction accounts and electronic 
payme nt services.  
 
• Ensure that Albanians are informed about how to activate their debit cards for online purchases: as a safety 
measure i n order to reduce potential card fraud, banks in Albania require their debit card holders to “activate” 
their debits cards before they make the first online transaction. However, many customers are not aware of this 
procedure and they wrongly assume that d ebit cards cannot be used for e -commerce transactions. As such, it 
is imperative for banks to inform their customers consistently of this requirement and of the option to use debit 
cards for e -commerce purchases.   
 
• Roll out  a basic payment s card  through t he Albania Post, including for online shopping : leveraging its license 
as a non -bank financial institution and benefitting from the new Payment Services Law which allows for card 
issuance, the Albania Post could offer a prepaid card through its large exist ing network of postal branches which 
could be used for online purchases. This would also require agreements with commercial banks and potentially 
the international card networks. A blueprint for this could be PostePay Card  offering of the Italian Post, which 
enables online payments on all Visa -affiliated webshops.  
Albanians need to become more confident in using online payment options . In the survey of Albanian e -commerce 
users developed for this diagnostic, close to 35 percent of respondents highlighted the risk of identity or payment 
fraud as a key concern when shopping online. While  confidence in online payment is likely to develop over time, as 
more customers gain experience in online shopping or more trusted Albanian e -commerce websites emerge, key 
measures can be taken now to encourage Albanians to make full use of online payments for e -commerce 
transactions.  
• Implement a financial education campaign specifically on the use of electronic payments for online shopping: 
use communications to businesses and potential customers, educating them on (i) the benefits of using 
electronic means of payments online (including convenience, greater security etc .), (ii) the rights of consume rs 
and businesses during online transactions as well as (iii)  precautions that consumers and businesses can take 
to avoid becoming a victim of online fraud . One of the aims of such a financial education campaign needs to be 
to alleviate  fear of dealing wi th unresponsive, complicated systems prone to operational error  and the  perce ived 
loss of privacy.  The World Bank has already provided assistance to Bank of Albania and others in the design of 
financial education programs  pertaining to electronic payments. Some of those principles and design 
methods/tools (e.g. surveys, focus groups, awareness campaigns) could also be applied in the  context of 
electronic payment usage for e -commerce. In the process, the OECD Policy Handbook on the design of National 
Financial Education Strategies could also be utilized.18 
 
• Rigorous ly follow -up on cases of online payment fraud and identity theft: the incidence and types of online 
payment fraud should be monitored  by the relevant service providers  and regularly reviewed by Bank of Albania 
(in their supervisory and oversight role). A working group of the National Payment Systems Committee of 
Albania (NPS C) could also focus on this topic by  sharing with the  relevant agencies and the private sector 
international experience and best practices on how to better protect against online fraud going forward. The

52 
 Albanian Consumer Protection Agency needs to be rein forced to ensure that online fraud cases are rigorously 
followed up on.19 In addition, international examples such as the Observatory for the Security of Payment Means 
(OSPM) in France could also be followed.20 The OSPM is a body whose purpose is to facilitate the exchange of 
information and the consultation among all relevant parties (consumers, businesses, banks and PSPs, public 
authorities) pertaining to the fight against fraud.  
 
ACCESS AND USAGE OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AMONG ALBANIAN WEBSHOPS  
 
Prominent Albanian e -commerce websites largely rely on cash -on-deliver y (COD)  to settle transactions – adapting 
their business model to the demands of many Albanian customers.  The many Albanians without access to 
electronic payment instruments want to be able to participate in e -commerce while paying with cash. As Albanian 
online market places are gradually establishing their credibility, customers prefer to avoid sharing payment 
information online and contain the risk of online data theft. By paying cash on delivery, customers can avoid making 
an online payment for a product that might n ot arrive or that may not meet expectations.

Nonetheless, without offering electronic payment options, Albanian webshops  limit their reach, both on the 
domestic and international markets. Customers need to physically meet the parcel delivery service in order to settle 
the transaction, which can be inconvenient and time -consuming. International customers may be reluctant to 
transact on websites that do not offer the electronic payment options that they are used to. Most Albanian e -
commerce companies can only offer cash -on-delivery on the domestic market, where they have established 
partnerships with local logistics companies or where they can deliver using in -house logistics capabilities – making 
their webshop (in absence of electronic payment options) effectively inaccessible for foreign customers.  
Schematic of card payment transaction costs 
 
 
 
Two Albanian banks offer vir tual points -of-service (POS) for cards (VISA, Mastercard etc) that can be integrated 
into webshops – but merchants face complex and expensive setup procedures as well as high transaction costs . 
The traditional approach for a webshop to have electronic paym ent capabilities is to open a merchant account with 
a bank and to set up a payment gateway (which could be offered by the bank itself or by a third party provider that 
collaborates with the bank or provides the service distinctly) to enable online payment acceptance. This requires 
significant upfront investments and technical expertise – investments which only become profitable if enough 
customers then use the service. In addition, high fees for processing debit/credit card payments in the Albanian 
market c an deter e -commerce companies from making the necessary investments to accept card payments.  
One factor driving up costs is that Albanian card transactions are processed through international card payment 
networks.  The overall variable (transaction) cost to the merchant for every card payment accepted is called the 
Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), or Merchant Service Charge (MCS), and is paid to the acquiring bank (that represents 
the merchant). MDR consists of three main components: the interchange fees (set  by the international card 
networks such as Visa and MasterCard) and is passed from the acquiring bank to the issuing bank (that represents 
the payer); dues and assessment fees which go to the card networks; acquirer fee, which covers the cost of the 
acqui rer to provide the service as well as profit. It is worth highlighting that the largest component of the MDR is the 
 
54 
 interchange fee and thus, changes in interchange fees can drastically impact MDR (assuming no changes in the other 
components). The intercha nge fees for online card payments could go up to 2.5 percent in Albania.21 
• Upgrade the  domestic payment processing infrastructure:  if Albania had a modern processing infrastructure 
that would process electronic payments within the country across different use cases and channels (including 
fast payments capability), some of the transactions currently processed through the internationa l card payment 
schemes could migrate to the domestic infrastructure, and this could lower the cost of electronic transactions 
within Albania. Other benefits would include the instant access to funds for the payees. As such, the Bank of 
Albania and the priv ate market are encouraged to explore the possibility of establishing a domestic payment 
processing infrastructure  (either upgrading one of the existing payment systems or implementing a new system) 
in order to reduce reliance on the international card net works for card transactions taking place in Albania.22 
This is also among the high priorities of the central bank which has started working on a feasibility study in this 
respect.  
 
• Expand use of  credit  transfers:  If the buyer and seller have access to ban k accounts, e -commerce payments can 
also be facilitated through direct account -to-account credit transfers. If interbank, the payments are processed 
through Albania’s existing domestic payments infrastructure, namely the Albanian Electronic Clearing House 
(AECH) operated by the Bank of Albania – such transactions are associated with low processing costs. However, 
for interbank credit transfers, the e -seller might still need to have an integrated payment gateway, which could 
be costly to incorporate. In the absence of it, the e -seller would need to share bank account information with 
the buyer. Furthermore, the buyer would have to initiate the transfer via their internet banking options. Those 
steps add to complexity and also make e -sellers hesitant to share bank account information. The bottlenecks 
could be avoided by third party providers that can facilitate account -to-account e -commerce payments via APIs. 
However, such models are still not seen in the Albanian market. The new payment services law, which pav es 
the way to open banking and APIs, is likely to make it easier for third party service providers offering such APIs 
to come into the market.  
Box: Regulating card interchange fees  
 
The level of card interchange fee s depends on a range of  cost factors.  In general, fees will reflect compensation 
for the issuing financial institution to cover card issuance, handling of fraud and bad debt costs and other risks 
involved in approving transactions. Inherently, to the extent that costs and risks per merchant are  likely to be 
higher in less mature markets, this reflects also in differences in interchange fees across countries.  
 
Beyond cost factors, however, the level of interchange fees may also reflect the market power of international 
card networks  over busines ses and consumers - some countries have therefore regulated  ceilings on 
interchange fees.  For instance, the EU interchange regulation  caps interchange fees at 0 .2% and 0.3% respectively 
for consumer debit and credit cards. The US also caps interchange fees. In 2018, Serbia  introduced interchange 
fee caps (same levels as the EU) in the Western Balkans region.

payment processing infrastructure  deployed in the Western Balkans region:

55 
  
The effectiveness of regulating interchange fees needs to be closely reviewed on a country -by-country basis.  
Just as with any price regu lation, interference in markets needs to be well -justified. A too low interchange fee can 
blunt the incentive for financial institutions to issue cards to their customers, delaying the adoption of electronic 
payments. However, if the market power of card s ystems drives interchange fees too high, then high card 
transaction fees can deter businesses from accepting card payments – leading to continued reliance on cash. The 
recent cap imposed in Serbia will offer an interesting test case for the impact of regul ating interchange fees in the 
Western Balkans region.  
 
 
Credit card fees for Albanian sellers are significant, also 
compar ed with the EU … .. but, despite this, Albania has seen growth in 
virtual POS for online card payments

Nonetheless, the Bank of Albania has recorded a gradual pickup in virtual POS issued, suggesting that Albanian 
webshops are gradually adopting electronic payments . There are only two banks that acquire e -merchants in 
Albania. Nevertheless, in 2019, approximately 3 million debit/credit card purchases took place online in Albania (with 
cards issued by Albanian banks). This represents about 38 percent of all card purchases  in the country for the same 
year.23  
One -stop -shop payment service providers, like Paypal , 2checkout or Stripe, have significant potential as enablers 
of electronic payments, (i) making it easier for e -commerce companies to integrate electronic payments i nto their 
webshops and (ii) alleviating customer concerns about fraud. Relative to traditional online card payment solutions 
requiring opening a merchant account with a bank and integrating a customized payment gateway into the webshop, 
these wholistic pay ment service providers offer simple and transparent plug -in solutions and application 
programming interfaces (APIs) that e -commerce companies can build into their websites without incurring large

 upfront costs. Financial data, such as card or bank account details, is shared with the payment service provider, who 
then credits the web -shop once the payment has occurred – alleviating customer concerns that their financial data 
will be compromised during the transaction. As such, these integrated service provid ers have significant potential as 
entry -level electronic payment options to help emerging Albanian webshops grow.  
However , existing international integrated  payment service providers  so far  offer only limited or no functionality 
on the Albanian market.  Their services need to be integrated within the local financial eco -system, including by 
building relationships with local financial institutions so that payments can be transferred quickly and at low cost to 
and from the financial accounts of the users. On the other hand, the upsides for entering a small market like Albania 
can appear limited for large international companies. Given a small Albanian producer base and a shallow e -
commerce industry, there are relatively few natural sellers that could use the p ayment service. Moreover, with the 
low penetration of bank accounts and payment cards among Albanian households, in an already small country, there 
are few natural buyers. As a result of high entry costs and limited perceived business opportunity, internat ional 
payment service providers have been relatively slow to expand their services to the Albanian market.  
Other innovative e -commerce payment models, such as Amazon PayCode, offer hybrid solutions for markets with 
low penetration of electronic payment ser vices – but these are also generally not available in Albania yet. Under 
the Amazon Paycode model, a customer can shop products from Amazon and select the PayCode payment option 
during check -out. For this option, the customer does not need to have a paymen t card, or any other electronic 
instrument, registered with Amazon. They receive a transaction code and then make the payment using cash at a 
participating local Western Union agent. Western Union handles the currency exchange aspects, settlement and 
money  movement.   
 
Box: Pay Pal Case Study  
 
The payment service Pay Pal for instance, though known for its broad  international reach , offers – so far – 
limited functionality in  Albania. PayPal is not registered with the Bank of Albania  to operate and provide their 
services in Albani a. Businesses registered in Albania can make and receive payments through PayPal, but they 
face elevated transaction fees and they need to cash -out either through a US -registered bank account or by paying 
a fee to withdraw through a domestic VISA card at the end of each month. This means that withdrawals are 
cumbersome and time intensive. Since Paypal cannot process payments in Albanian lek, Albanian customers 
paying through Paypal online need to pay in foreig n currency (usually euro or USD) and Albanian businesses face 
additional foreign exchange fees to convert proceeds back into Albanian lek.

The need for new business models in Albania’s electronic payments landscape is creating an opportunity for 
growth of local companies that can facilitate e -commerce transactions. EasyPay for example, an Albanian electronic 
money institution that offers e -money payment services through mobile phone or desktop, has been adopted as a 
payment option by several Albanian webshops. Like the service provided by international integrated payment 
service providers, e -money providers allow webshops to accept electronic payments (i) without incurring the high 
upfront costs needed for integrating a traditional virtual POS into the website and (ii) using the e -money provider as 
intermediary in handling the sensitive financial data of buyers. However, for the moment, local e -money providers 
offer only a partial alternative to traditional electronic payment methods such as cards. Albanian e -money providers 
accept payments only in Albanian lek and both the merchant and the payer need to have an account with a particular 
provide r for the online transaction to take place. E -money accounts are currently not interoperable with bank 
accounts, meaning that funds cannot be directly transferred from one to the other, although this is expected to 
change with the current revisions of the regulatory framework by BoA whereas e -money institutions and payment 
institutions can be direct participants to the ACH.  
Albania needs to establish a comprehensive regulatory environment that allows its electronic payment ecosystem 
to keep up with the newe st developments . Key measures include:  
• Implement bylaws for the newly approved Law on payment services, aligning Albania’s regulatory framework 
with the  EU Pay ment Systems Directive (PSD -2): full implementation of the regulatory framework will 
eliminate regulatory uncertainty, clarifying rights and responsibilities of payment service providers - thereby 
encouraging domestic and international payment service prov iders to expand their services in Albania. Through 
alignment with the EU framework, international companies – who are generally already compliant with EU  
58 
 regulation – will be able to expand their services to Albania at limited additional cost, while Albani an companies 
will set up their service in a way that will make it simple to expand to other countries in the region that follow 
the EU framework. The PSD2 transposition would enable and provide more clarity pertaining to a variety of 
issues  that are also relevant for e -commerce:  open banking; APIs; tokenization and aliases ; interoperability; 
among other. Open APIs can be particularly helpful in the context of e -commerce, given that they can facilitate 
cost-efficient and seamless integration of payment platforms into webshops.    
 
• Foster innovation by exploring the establishment of a regulatory sandbox in the context of FinTech, spanning 
e-commerce: a regulatory sandbox refers to a mechanism for businesses to conduct tests of new products, 
services, delivery channels, or business models in a live environment , with regulatory oversight and subject to 
certain conditions and safeguards . The critical feature that distinguishes a regulatory sandbox from other tools 
used to facilitate innovation is t esting in a live environment —that is, real transactions with real customers or 
counterparties. Sandboxes are often implemented as part of broader initiatives to facilitate innovation or 
promote competition. The most common of these other tools, often refer red to as an “innovation hub,”  or 
innovation lab,  is a dedicated office or point of contact within a regulatory agency that facilitates engagement 
with companies seeking guidance about new products or services. These tools facilitate engagement between 
regulators and innovative financial services firms to address areas of regulatory uncertainty. In that sense, a 
sandbox may be thought of as one part of a process —by which businesses and regulators work together to 
understand and address the regulatory risks of innovative products or services with the objective of facilitating 
their safe intro duction to the marketplace. In the case of Albania, establishing a regulatory sandbox in order to 
accommodate and explore  new business models  in the area of FinTech, inc luding for  e-commerce , could be 
attractive for new players.24 
 
• Create a conducive market environment to encourage international payment service providers to expand 
their services in Albania. : Bank of Albania and government agencies could work towa rd attracting international 
service providers, including by (i) clarifying the regulatory requirements t hat the service providers need to 
comply with when operating in Albania via informational sessions and digital events, (ii) ensuring short times 
for applic ation reviews and license granting.     
 
Box: International experience on direct incentives to encourage customers and businesses to use electronic 
payments  
 
A recent World Bank (2020) report on “ Electronic payments acceptance incentives ” offers a summary of 
international experience on deploying more direct incentives to encourage use of elec tronic payments. Given the 
significant positive externalities from developing an electronic payments ecosystem – including (going beyond e -
commerce) as steppingstone for households and businesses to access more advanced financial services, as means 
of redu cing informality and as means of avoiding the extensive transaction costs of a cash -based economy – a 
range of instrument have been deployed, including:  
 
 
24 The UK is one of the first jurisdictions to implement regulatory sandboxes and their experience offers valuable 
lessons.  
https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory -sandbox   
59 
 • Tax incentives for electronic transactions, such as VAT refunds or income tax deductions (ie  Argentina, 
Colombia, Japan, South Korea)  
• Lottery schemes on electronic transactions (ie India, Mexico, South Korea)  
• Subsidy and/or tax incentive for merchant POS installation (ie Argentina, Japan, Mexico)  
• Limits on cash transactions and/or mandated acce ptance of electronic means of payments by merchants 
(ie France, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Denmark, South 
Korea )  
  
The report highlights some evidence that these more direct interventions have, in some cases, supported the 
adoption of electronic payments. However, international experience also highlights drawbacks. Some countries 
have eventually withdrawn these direct incentives, given concerns that they disproportionately benefit the better 
off (who are more likely to already use electronic payments). Tax and lottery schemes can be difficult to 
implement and administratively burdensome. Fiscal measures can be costly - regular cost -benefit analysis is 
needed to ensure that these instruments achieve value -for-money.  
 
 
LEVERAGING  INTERNATIONAL E -COMMERCE PLATFORMS  
 
Instead of selling through an Albanian webshop, Albanian e -sellers can sell through an international e -comm erce 
platform and benefit from the mature  integrated payment solution s these platforms offer . In this case, 
transactions generally take place in the currency of the country in which the platform is native – meaning that 
Albanian e -sellers face currency con version fees (i.e. Amazon.com transactions take place in USD, though 
aliexpress.com allows buyers to purchase in Albanian lek). Equally, the website is generally only available in the 
language of the country in which the platform is native (this is the cas e for amazon.com, though aliexpress.com is 
also available in Albanian auto translation). Finally, Albanian e -sellers may be required to register her/his business 
and open a bank account in the country in which the platform is native (this is the case for a liexpress.com, but not 
for Albanian e -sellers on amazon.com).  
• Reach out to major international e -commerce platforms to encourage them to facilitate sign -up of Albaniane -
sellers: key measures the platforms can take are (i) enable Albanian e -sellers to sign up with their Albanian 
business registration, (ii) enable Albanian e -sellers to be paid in Albanian lek on their Albanian bank account (or 
there should be an integration with an international payment service such as payoneer.com that facilitates 
payment to  a lek -denominated bank account), (iii) provide Albanian language support on the website 
(potentially through auto translation), both to help Albanian sellers navigate the website and to allow Albanian 
buyers to use the platform.25

commerce market and started offering innovative payments products in the context of e -commerce.

 CHAPTER SUMMARY  
 
Albani a’s nascent domestic e -commerce sector largely settles transactions through cash -on-delivery – this holds 
back further growth of the sector. While COD reflects current market conditions in Albania (including customer 
demands to pay in cash), in the medium term this can become a key bottleneck to further growth. Electronic 
payments can make e -commerce more convenient for domestic customers. The capability of webshops to accept 
online payments is also often a sine -qua-non to attract orders from abroad. Equall y, Albanians need to adopt online 
payments to be able to order from most international e -commerce websites.  
Growth of online payment s requires a concerted effort to equip both Albanian customers and webshops with 
electronic  payment capabilities.  As outline d in this chapter, the foundations for this are a stronger legal enabling 
environment for payment services as well as a comprehensive and interoperable payment system infrastructure. 
This needs to be complemented with a change of Albania’s payments culture , reflected in upgraded payment 
capabilities of both customers and webshops.

6. UPGRADING  PRIVATE SECTOR CAPABILITIES 
64 
 Strong private sector e -commerce capabilities, skills and knowhow are a crucial ingredient for developing 
Albania’s online markets. First  and foremost , e-commerce is driven by individual e -entrepreneurs that seize the 
opportunity presented by online market s, either by adding an online sales channel to their existing brick -and-mortar 
business or by starting a new online venture. Second, to enable such e -entrepreneurship, a capable e -commerce 
supporting ecosystem is needed. Businesses need access to a pool of  skilled employees, including e -commerce 
specialists, online advertising, web -design, programming and others. An ecosystem of enabling businesses (online 
marketplaces, e -commerce business advisory, integrated software solutions for payments/logistics/accou nting etc) 
facilitates entry into e -commerce. Third, at a basic level, the development of online markets requires a broad base 
of domestic customers that are digitally literate and that are comfortable with online shopping. This chapter reviews 
key measure s to address the existing constraints at each of these three layers of the e -commerce capabilities 
pyramid in Albania.

SUPPORTING E -ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
 
Many Albanian brick -and-mortar businesses have not yet  invested in developing an  online sales channel.  Only 5 
percent of Albanian businesses reported online sales in 2018, significantly lagging behind regional peers. Though a  
2020 Enterprise Survey  update reveals that almost 20 percent of surveyed Albanian firms have either started or 
increased online business activity during the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic – suggesti ng a big forward jump in 
digitalization to cope with the crisis – this response lags other countries in which the survey was performed. In part, 
this reflects the fundamentals of the Albanian economy. For certain business activities prominent in Albania (f or 
instance agriculture), developing online sales channels is inherently more difficult. A limited domestic base of online 
shoppers makes investing in an online shop less attractive. However, these structural factors are likely exacerbated 
by more immediat e constraints faced by Albanian firms. For instance, given insufficient knowledge about e -
commerce, businesses may underestimate its advantages and overestimate the cost of going online. In some Supporting e -

 instances, financing constraints are likely to preclude the n ecessary investments. General status -quo bias may also 
prevent some firms from making changes to their business model and upgrading to e -commerce.  
 
Compared to regional leaders, the scope for Albanian 
firms to grow e -commerce is large…  … though the 2020 C OVID -19 pandemic gave online 
business activity a major push

A range of measures can support  Albanian businesses to go online, overcoming information frictions, financial 
frictions and status -quo bias:  
• Establish information websites (and seminars) with how -to guides on moving businesses online and 
increasing awareness about Albanian e -commerce success stories:  a low -cost starting point for intervention 
would be the establishment of an information website that explains what companies need to take into account 
when going online, including links to app licable legislation, a step -by-step guide on decisions the business will 
need to make to go online and case studies of domestic businesses that have successfully built their online 
presence. Good examples for such websites can be found in the UK, US and also in the Western Balkans region 
(i.e. Croatia ). The we bpage could be hosted in the website of MFE or AIDA.  
 
• Create  financing  and training  programs to support businesses in opening online sales channels:  while 
financing (usually in the form of a matching grant scheme to finance consulting/training/website development/ 
market research) and/or the free provision of training services is a key component of these programs, it also 
serves as an anchor to prompt businesses to take action and commit to  e -commerce development. Business 
advisory expertise helps bridge information frictions. Programs therefore can, and should be, designed to 
overcome a range of barriers: financing, information asymmetry, and status quo bias. In the Albanian context, 
such financing and training programs coul d either be established as new structures (potentially with the support 0 10 20 30 40AlbaniaGreeceItalyTurkeyMontenegroGermanyAustriaBosnia and HerzegovinaCroatiaSerbiaEnterprises selling online (% of firms with

 of international development partners) or within existing government structures (such as within the existing 
grant program portfolio financed by the Albanian Investment Development Age ncy - AIDA). Programs should 
integrate strong monitoring and evaluation components. Rigorous impact evaluations should regularly review 
whether programs achieve value -for-money.   
Whenever possible, government should explore designing programs in close part nership with the private sector - 
for instance,  in collaboration with  e-commerce  platforms . E-commerce  platforms  have an incentive to attract more 
online sellers  to their website . The  platforms  also bring to the table deep sector expertise. As example of such 
private -sector -led initiatives, see  Jumia (equivalent of Amazon in Africa and MENA)  which  has created Jumia 
University to train vendors , including through the  creat ion of guidelines to help  vendors make  professional packages 
that are compliant with Jumia’ s standards of quality. ShopGo in Jordan is another example, which  provides several 
tutorials imported from San Francisco to help vendors improve their experience selling goods online. Anoth er 
example is the Veezeta platform, an online medical care scheduling service and search platform, which has made 
software and hardware investments to foster supply -side take -up.  
Box: Financing and training p rograms to encourage businesses to establish on line sales channels  
 
The World Bank has partnered with  a range of  countries to establish financing and training programs that 
support businesses to develop online sales . These programs offer useful example schemes that can be deployed 
in Albania:   
 
1/ Programs that support micro, small and medium -sized enterprises (MSMEs)  to develop their own web -
shops: For instance, the Moldova Export Competitiveness Project  provides matching grants (matching up to 50 
percent of the firm’s own funding contribution) for selected business development services (BDS) and equipment 
to strengthen export capabilities. In practice, a significant fraction of grants supports the development of online 
sales channels, including website design and marketing. The average project costs US$19,800 (of which $10,000 
is provided by the project beneficiary).  
 
2/ Programs that support SMEs to sell through online marketplace intermediaries: For instance, the World Bank 
is currently runnin g an e-Commerce and Women -Led SMEs in MENA  project that trains e -commerce advisors, 
who will in turn train women -led SMEs to se ll through online marketplaces, including abroad. Similarly, a pilot 
project in Egypt is training micro enterprises to use facebook for product advertising and provides financing 
support to cover initial advertising costs. A pilot program in Georgia is pro viding training to SMEs to establish sales 
channels through online marketplaces and provides a subsidy (in the form of an initial online order) to program 
participants that successfully establish such a channel.   
 
But governments and other development part ners have also rolled out their own programs.  For instance, the 
UK e -exporting program  provides support to companies who are new to e -commerce or look to expand into new 
markets . The International Trade Center ( a joint agency of UN and WTO) has launched the ecomConnect  initiative, 
running projects in a range of countries.

E-entrepreneurs need to be supported by a business environment that has adapted to the digital economy – 
currently, the unclear tax treatment of online businesses stands out as a particularly prominent bottleneck.   
67 
 Albanian tax laws are generally – despite some references to services supplied elect ronicall y (e-services)  - silent 
about e -commerce. In a way, this suits some online traders that aim to avoid taxation and stay informal. However, 
this also acts as powerful disincentive for honest businesses that are considering an online sales channel. Wi thout 
legal certainty, unclear interpretation of tax provisions for online sales exposes businesses to the risk of potential 
penalties and fines. Firms are vulnerable to how individual tax administration officials interpret how Albania’s tax 
law applies to  their specific online business. This make long -term business planning challenging.  
• Broaden acceptance of digital invoices for tax purposes:   a key cost for online businesses is digital advertising, 
including through international digital platforms (googl e, facebook, etc). These providers use digital invoicing to 
certify payments, which are generally not available in Albanian language or in accordance with the Albanian 
invoicing format. As a result, Albanian e -entrepreneurs report that the Albanian tax aut horities generally do not 
accept these digital invoices as proof of business expense for tax purposes. Adjustment of Albanian tax 
legislation and tax administration operational guidelines to respond to the peculiarities of digital businesses can 
play a key  role in creating a more conducive business environment for e -entrepreneurship. A 2019 legal 
amendment already allows for the use of electronic invoicing for VAT purposes, as long as the authenticity of 
the content, the integrity of the content and the rea dability are guaranteed. However, according to the income 
taxation law, for expenses to be deductible, an original invoice is needed. To simplify digital invoicing, all laws 
should be aligned to clarify that electronic invoices are acceptable, that the tax  authority will accept invoices in 
any language (though it  may request document translation to be provided by the business) and that all invoice 
formats will be acceptable, as long as minimum information requirements are met. The acceptability of “invoice s 
issued by the buyer” with regards to digital invoices (including foreign) needs to be clarified and the tax 
administration needs to renew efforts to ensure that all businesses are aware about how to use this invoicing 
procedure.  
 
• Clarify deductible expenses for income tax purposes:  in Albania, a ll necessary and reasonable expenses 
incurred for a business  activity  and that are properly documented are deductible,  with some exclusions.  Yet e -
entrepreneurs report that advertisement and trainin gs are key expenses that are often contested by the tax 
authority. As in other countries, the legal framework could strengthen the position of companies by highlighting 
explicitly that these specific expenditure categories are eligible for income tax deduc tion.  
 
• Review the tax legal framework to clarify the treatment of online marketplaces  (intermediat ors  between 
buyers and sellers ): Online marketplaces operating in Albania need to have clarity on when they are (or not) 
legally liable (i) to ensure that buyers and sellers that use their marketplace comply with the taxation framework 
and (ii) under what circumstances the marketplace its elf is considered to be a seller for tax purposes. The EU 
VAT e -commerce package  offers a useful international example in this regard.  
 
• Ensure that  businesses are aware of CIT withholding tax provisions when foreign businesses sell to Albanian 
businesses: Non-resident juridical persons (ie foreign registered companies) are subject to withholding tax of 
15% (a substitute of corporate profit tax) for i ncome sourced in Albania (ie income earned from services offered 
to Albanian companies).26 The withholding tax is deducted by the Albanian company (receiving the services) 
 
26 In case there is a Tax Treaty in force between Albania and the country where the foreign supplier of services is a 
resident, the provisions of such a treaty prevail over the Albanian legislation; Some of the Tax Treaties Albania is part 
of, provide for a reduced withholding tax (5 -15%) when certain criteria are met.  
  
68 
 from the gross value of the foreign supplier's invoice and declared and paid to the tax office by the Albanian 
company. In case the Albanian company does not withhold and pay the tax, then the 15% withholding tax, along 
with fines and penalties are charged to the Albanian company, and/or the cost of service is not accepted as 
deductible e xpenses for CIT purposes . It is crucial that Albanian e -commerce businesses – which often purchase 
advertising, hosting and other services from international e -commerce platforms – are fully aware about these 
tax obligations.  
 
• Train tax administration staf f to deal  efficiently and consistently  with the peculiarities of the taxation issues 
faced by e-businesses: tax administration staff need to be trained to deal with the peculiarities of the digital 
economy. For instance, Albanian firms reported during prep aration for this study that the tax administration in 
multiple cases refused to accept expenses for the purchase of software downloaded from abroad, since the firm 
could not produce customs declaration documents. Small Albanian exporters reported lack of c larity on how to 
deal with returned goods from foreign customers, which they ended up treating as new imported goods on 
which customs duties and taxes were due. Tax administration staff need to develop simple and transparent 
protocols to deal with these sp ecial cases, providing e -entrepreneurs with clarity on how different types of 
expenses will be treated for tax purposes (including documentation requirements).  
A more conducive business environment can help more e -entrepreneurs to formalize, reducing disto rtions from 
Albania’s informal digital economy , creating a more level playing field for Albania’s formal e -commerce sector and 
encouraging fair market competition . Faced with unclear and burdensome regulations, some businesses react by 
staying informal or not complying with certain elements of the regulatory/tax regime. So -called “social commerce” 
on platforms such as facebook and Instagram, often largely executed by informal freelancers and companies, is 
thriving in Albania  and often informal . Informality in turn holds these e -entrepreneurs back – they cannot access 
bank loans and they need to stay small to stay undetected. In some cases, informal online businesses – unburdened 
by regulation and taxation – create unfair competition for formal e -commerce com panies, cannibalizing market 
share. A poor online shopping experience when buying from an unregulated informal shop can hurt the reputation 
of the entire Albanian e -commerce industry – also punishing formal businesses. In the worst case, a faulty product 
bought from an unregulated firm can create a health and safety risk for the customer. A stronger business 
environment – combined with continued anti -informality enforcement campaigns – can therefore play a key role in 
encouraging formalization of the e -comm erce industry and upgrading of online business capabilities.   
Albania’s  digital startup eco -system remains nascent. Albania has a young, multilingual and ICT -literate population . 
Thus  many of the fundamen tal factors for the development of a dynamic startu p ecosystem  for online businesses  
are present. Yet,  the digital startup scene remains nascent. Universities and development partners implement a 
range of initiatives to encourage entrepreneurship, but many of these initiatives remain disjointed. Grant prog rams 
for young businesses exist, but they are often too small to make a difference. A 2019 report on the entrepreneurial 
ecosystem in Albania  indicates that both government and donor programs to support entrepreneurship are 
perceived as not sufficient to address the existing business needs. Private sector early -stage financing is largely non -
existent. For example, Albania is the only country in  the Western Balkans without its own angel investor network – 
partly also because investors report that there are not yet many attractive investment prospects in Albania.  
• Strengthen access to early -stage financing options for digital startups: given limite d current private sector 
financing, this will in the first place require strengthening existing government (for example AIDA) and 
international donor grant programs for startups. In particular, a shift is needed towards (i) larger more 
meaningful grants pe r company, (ii) less cumbersome and digitalized application procedures, accompanied by 
inclusive communication campaigns to encourage take -up, (iii) closer accompaniment of those startups that are 
accepted into the grant programs to establish accountabilit y for results and support entrepreneurs with  
69 
 mentorship and (iv) more systematic impact evaluations to identify grant program features that work and those 
that do not – ensuring that these support programs gradually achieve better value -for-money.  
 
• Strengt hen incubator and accelerator programs:  the 2019 report on the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Albania  
in particular identifies the need for the establishment of a stronger incubator and accelerator ecosystem. 
Incubator programs are needed that (i) accept applications throughout the year, (ii) offer close linkages with 
local universities and their entrepreneurship ideation programs and (iii) offer close linkages  with international 
e-commerce industry insiders that can act as mentors. Partnerships with Silicon Valley (such as the partnership 
of Serbia’s Startit accelerator with google ) offer potential paths to reinvigorating Albania’s startup scene.

One sector in which Albanian e -entrepreneurship has already de monstrated clear potential is the sale and delivery 
of online services abroad, particularly in business process outsourcing (BPO). Risi Albania estimates  that Albania’s 
BPO companies employ between 25,000 to 32,000 professionals. These firms are gradually evolving beyond basic 
call centers towards providing financial, HR and IT services. They range from homegrown companies to international 
players establishing Albanian subsidiaries. In addition, many Albanian self -employed have been successful in building 
a presence on international online freelance websites such as upwork.com to offer globally on -demand online 
services, inc luding website design, financial planning and translation services. On a per -capita basis, the penetration 
 
70 
 of Albanians on these freelance websites exceeds that of many advanced economies. Given a skilled multilingual 
workforce, competitive local wages as well as the still significant barriers to emigration, Albania has great potential 
to build on current progress and to create even more jobs providing online services at -distance to the European and 
American markets.  
Albania’s growing tourism sector has als o rapidly  adopt ed online sales channels. Albania’s tourism potential has 
long been under -explored. With an extensive Mediterranean coastline, a plentiful endowment of forests, mountains 
and rivers as well as a rich cultural and historical heritage, Albania  has plenty to offer for leisure and adventure 
travelers. Yet, besides country branding, key bottlenecks include limited tourism infrastructure, such as high -end 
tourism resorts with close airport access, as well as few standing arrangements with internati onal package tourism 
companies. To overcome these obstacles, local Albanian service providers were able to adopt online platforms to 
directly reach out to new domestic and international customers that are willing to take the initiative and make their 
own i ndependent travel arrangements to explore Albania. The growing use of online platforms such as booking.com 
has played a key role in the expansion of Albania’s tourism market. Between 2014 and 2019, annual arrivals of 
foreign citizens into Albania grew by 74.4 percent, reaching 6.4 million arrivals in 201 9. In 2020, the ongoing COVID -
19 crisis is a severe setback for Albania’s tourism industry – but the fundamental long -term trend of tourism as an 
Albanian growth industry is expected to re -emerge once the pa ndemic is overcome.  
 
Albania has successfully built an industry selling 
online services (mostly to businesses) abroad…  … while Albania’s tourism sector has been quick to 
adopt digital markets to reach new customers

A strategy to support e -entrepreneurship in Albania could be to dedicate resources to support  these two  Albanian 
sectors that have already demonstrated high potential for using online sales chan nels:  
• Pilot training programs to help Albanians access online global freelancer  opportunities  including in the BPO 
sector : an interesting pilot that Albania could replicate would be the Kosovo Women in Online Work (WoW)  0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200TurkeyGermanyItalyAustriaGreeceUSACroatiaMontenegroBiHAlbaniaNorth MacedoniaSerbiaFreelancers and agencies on upworks.com

 program, which trained women in f ront -end web development , coding, graphic design and digital marketing. 
The program then helped the program partic ipants to advertise their services on online freelancer websites 
(such as upworks.com) and win international contracts. The Pilot has proved the concept and was joined by 
number of other donors (such as USAid, Swiss). It is now scaled up nationally to incl ude the youth of both 
genders.27 
 
• Pilot training program to help Albanian businesses in the hospitality sector better advertise and sell their 
services online: governments, international organizations, hospitality schools, universities and private training  
companies offer numerous courses on digitalization of tourism including digital transformation and innovation. 
A good example is the Tourism Online Academy launched by the IE University and the United Nations World 
Tourism Organization  (UNWTO). This online platform allows participants  to take courses to  acquire managerial 
skills in digital marketing, finance, strategy, operations, i nnovation and digital transformation. The academy 
offers free and paid training modules.  For an example of a government -driven training program, see the 
trainings offered for the hospitality sector in  Malta  for instance.  
Albania’s e -commerce sector needs to organize and defend its interests, advocating for a stronger enabling 
environment for online businesses. Currently, among the WB -6, only Serbia  and North Macedonia  have dedicated 
e-commerce business associations. Yet, such associations play an important role in self -regulating the industry, 
creating networkin g opportunities (see the annual North Macedonia e-commerce conference ) and representing the 
interests of national e -commerce businesses vis -à-vis policy makers and in international settings. Currently,  The 
Albanian Chamber of Commerce is  playing an important role in representing the business sector, including when it 
comes to digital economy issues.  The Albanian Business Services Association ( ABSA ) represents t he BPO sector and 
is also contributing to the debate on the needs of Albania’s e -commerce sector more broadly.  Furthermore, t he 
Albanian ICT Association (AITA ) was established in 2007 as an initiative of Albanian enterpr ises working to address 
the needs of the IT sector . 
• Albania’s e -commerce sector needs to organize and defend its interests, advocating for a stronger 
enabling environment for online businesses : Serbia  and North Macedonia  have dedicated e -commerce 
business associations  that could offer useful blueprints.  
 
NURTURING THE E -COMMERCE ENABLING ECOSYSTEM  
 
The penetration of online intermediary marketplaces remains low.  Selling through an established online 
marketplace intermediary (such as amazon, Alibaba or more specialized marketplaces such as etsy) offers an 
attractive entry point into the digital economy. Avoiding the significant setup costs of a stand -alone webshop , selling 
through an established marketplace can be significantly cheaper. Since marketplaces offer a pre -packaged and 
(often) user -friendly service product (combining basic features such as product placement with more advanced 
features such as payment pro cessing and logistics handling), they are also often a convenient solution for e -
entrepreneurs.28 Given significant existing traffic on online marketplaces, reaching customers can be easier. By 
 
27 The scale up was implemented through the World Bank financed Kosovo Digital Economy (KODE) Project . 
28 International pre -packaged webshop s olutions are available in Albania (though sometimes with restricted 
functionality).   
72 
 acting as intermediary, marketplace brands can establish a basic level of trust between customers and new e -
entrepreneurs. As such, online marketplaces can pla y the role of critical infrastructure enabling the growth of e -
commerce. Yet, in Albania, both local and international marketplaces – while existent – have low market 
penetration, limiting their usefulness. International marketplaces generally offer only l imited functionality for 
businesses based in Albania or businesses that aim to sell in Albania. Few international marketplaces offer Albanian 
language functionality.  
The penetration of online marketplaces in Albania remains comparatively low

Pre-packaged webshop solutions offer an alternative low -cost entry point to e -entrepreneurship , but functionality 
in Albania remains limited . International platforms such as shopify, bigcommerce and  volusion offer pre -packaged 
webshop solutions. These are generally also available to Albanian companies, though sometimes with restricted 
functionality. They generally do not offer Albanian language functionality.  
A range of boutique Albanian e -commerce b usiness advisory and support agencies are emerging to support e -
entr epreneurs.  Albanian companies such as Evolve Studio Albania  and DM Consulting  are gradually gaining 
experience accompanying and supporting e -entrepreneurs in their journey to wards  establish ing an online sales 
channel. Given e -commerce experience remains scarce in Albania, these companies can potentially play a pivotal 
role in helping spread information about how to  connect to online markets amongst Albania’s business community. 
Relative to international companies, they can tailor their advice to their Albanian clients and help them navigate 
domestic and international markets. Webshops can be designed catering to the  needs of an Albanian customer base.  
While Albania’s ICT sector is growing rapidly, skilled employees needed by e -commerce companies remain difficult 
to find. Albania has a relatively young population. According to the EF English proficiency index, Albania  ranks 50th 
out of 100 countries. More than 20 percent of students graduate from STEM universities ( UIS, 2018). These are good 
foundations for developing a strong ICT sector. Yet, according to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness 
Indicators (2019), Albania ranks 81st in terms of digital skills among the active population and 102nd in terms of ease 
of finding skilled employees (out of 141 countries). Confirming these statistics, Albanian e -entrepreneurs 
interviewed for this diagnost ic report that the domestic talent pool they can draw on is shallow. A range of measures

 • Strengthen the ICT curriculum in the formal education system : Serbia incorporates tech education into the 
curriculum from primary school onwards. Since 201 7, coding classes are compulsory for all students from age 
11. This emphasis on ICT in education is often credited as one reason for Serbia’s vibrant ICT industry .  
 
• Expand on initiatives to motivate (i)  youth to pursue a career in the digital economy and (ii) life -long learning 
to gain ICT skills: Initiatives such as the Albania ICT Academy  offer ICT courses for children of all ag es as well as 
adults. The Kosovo Women in Online Work (WoW)  program, discussed in the previous section of this chapter, 
offers another useful regional example of a successful prog ram aimed at teaching marketable ICT skills. Further 
such  private sector and public sector initiatives should be encouraged to make ICT accessible, motivate 
Albanians to consider this career choice and broaden ICT skills in the general population.  
 
• Reinfo rce on -the-job training incentives for employers: The 2018 Albania STEP survey  conducted by the World 
Bank  found  that “on average, less than 15 percent of firms provide internal or on -the-job training to their 
workforce; and less than 5 percent provide external training.” Yet, such trainings are crucial to nurture a skilled 
workforce . A key deterrent for such traini ngs is often that employers fear that they will bear the cost of trainings 
and investing in their employees – only to then see the employee leave for another job. The firm then faces all 
costs of the training, but the firm does not receive any of the benef its. To align incentives, Albania can clarify 
the conditions under which firms can use training payback clauses (requiring the employee to take charge of 
training costs if he/she leaves the firm within a certain period after receiving the training).29 Tax incentives or 
subsidies for training costs can also be considered, if subject to regular impact evaluations to ensure value -for-
money. An expanded discussion on challenges with training workers can be found in the World Bank report 
(2012) “The Rights Skills for the Right Job?” . 
 
• Attract foreign  direct  investment in the ICT sector , including by proactively reaching out to Albania’s diaspora 
to encourage them to establish business at home : proactively seek to  attract  international technology 
companies to set up hubs in Albania. Such FDI would contribute to (i) creation of a pool of skilled engineers that 
coul d stimulate the local tech industry and (ii) inspiring the youth to choose a tech career path. Regional 
examples for this development path exist. For instance, the establishment of the Microsoft Development Center 
is widely credited as an important element  in the success story of Serbia’s vibrant ICT ecosystem. Serbians 
working for Microsoft abroad played a key role in establishin g Microsoft’s office in Serbia.   
 
• Join forces with other Western Balkans countries to leverage on FDIs and integrate into global value chain s. 
Albania and the other Western Balkans countries have joined affert in the Multi -Annual Action Plan for a 
regional  economic area ( MAP REA ) and have identified not only digital integration, but also investments as key 
focus areas. An upcoming World Bank analysis  highlights at lea st three main ways in which FDI can  in particular  
help the Western Balkans integrate into Global Value Chains (GVCs) and boost growth, jobs, technology 
transfers: attracting FDI into manufacturing sectors such as automotive  and machinery (see  Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia); focusing on specific industry segments that are relatively labor -
intensive;  leveraging on  FDIs in tourism services to create  jobs and improve travel infrastructure.  
 
 
29 It is important that such payback clauses balance employee and employer rights. While employers need 
assurances that they will recoup employee training costs, employees n eed to preserve the right to change jobs. 
Payback clauses should not be abused by employers to chain workers to their current job. Dynamic reallocation of 
workers to those companies that are most promising and that offer the best employment conditions is a n important 
feature of many successful economies – it is important that payback clauses do not unduly restrict such reallocations.

Box: The interrelation between e -commerce, the ICT skills gap and emigration  
 
Stemming  the steady tide of emigration  is a key challenge to deepening Albania’s pool of skilled 
workers . Besides being a beneficiary of resolving this challenge, Albania’s e -commerce sector can 
also be a key part of the solution.  As highlighted in the  2020 Western Balkans Labor Market Trends  
report of the World Bank and the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies  (wiiw) , the I CT 
sector is among the industries most affected by talent emigration  across the Western Balkans. A 
cooperation between LinkedIn and the World Bank  identifies the key skills of Linkedin members that 
leave Albania in  the period 2017 -19. All top 5 skills being lost are linked to ICT. This points to a key 
challenge. It is not sufficient to increase the ICT proficiency of Albanians. For Albania to reap full the 
reward of training its workers, sufficient attractive domest ic job opportunities need to be available to 
persuade the highly skilled to stay in the country. Workers skills and job opportunities need to be 
developed jointly. As such, Albania’s e -commerce sector can play a key role in tackling the skills 
migration ch allenge. By creating attractive ICT jobs in Albania, e -entrepreneurs can persuade more 
Albanians to stay close to their families and help build Albanian businesses at home, thereby stemming 
the steady drip of skills leaving the country and instead deepenin g the domestic talent pool.

BROADENING THE BASE OF DIGITALLY SAVVY ONLINE CUSTOMERS  
 
While most Albanians are regular internet users, for some, distrust of online transactions remains a key constraint 
to full participation in the digital economy.  In our survey of Albanian online shoppers prepared for this e -commerce 
diagnostic, close to 83 percent of respondents view as key conc ern the risk that a product purchased online does 
not meet expectations and is then difficult to return. Close to 3 0 percent are concerned about identity or payment 
fraud.  
• Establish an e -commerce trustmark for Albania n webshops : establish (i) a code of conduct for Albanian e -
commerce businesses to abide to, (ii) branding that allows membe rs of the trust mark to identify themselves to 
consumers, (iii) a verification mechanism that regularly checks that members of the trustmark abide to the code 
of conduct and (iv) an effective dispute resolution mechanism (DRM) in case consumers have compla ints about 
a webshop that carries the trustmark. A natural starting point and template for designing such a trustmark could 
be the Ecommerce Europe Trustmark  or the global Safe.Shop Trustmark . To increase recognition of the 
trustmark abroad, partnerships with established international trustmarks could be explored. One option would 
be the introduction of a CEFTA -wide or W estern Balkans ecommerce trustmark.  
 
• Implement a  consumer protection awareness  campaign : the campaign should highlight the rights of online 
shoppers as well as options for seeking redress when those rights are not respected (including prominent 
advertising  of the consumer complaints hotline and website).  The campaign(s) could be organized by the 
Consumer Protection Commission  (KMK) , jointly with local government authorities  and other stakeholders, as  
76 
 consumers’ uni ons. Other collaborations may include private sector partners. In 2020, in Italy, a joint campaign  
has been  organized by  eBay and National Consumers’ Union  (UNC – Unione Nazionale Consumatori) to raise 
awareness  on consumers’ rights when buying online.  The campaign includes not only a brief guidance, but also  
videos and other social media content . The use of social media to  reach consumers is crucial. The KMK  could 
revitalize its social media channels, incl. Facebook and YouTube , and leverage the tools embedded in the portals 
to boost the  awareness campaigns.  
 
• Rigorously follow up on reported cases of misconduct among Albanian e -commerce businesses : ultimately,  
rigorous enforcement by Albania’s consumer protection agency and other government entities is needed to 
remove bad actors from Albania’s e -commerce ecosystem, giving Albanian customers the confidence needed 
to pa rticipate in the digital economy and ensuring that Albanian businesses actively aim to meet regulations and 
avoid penalties.   
 
While companies build their reputation, they can offer additional services to make consumers feel more secure  
and persuade them to try e -commerce . Offering a c ash-on-delivery payment option, which is already widespread in 
Albania, allows customers to physically receive the product before making the payment. Setting up escrow accounts, 
which release payment only a fter satisfactory receipt of the product, also help protect customers against scams. The 
use of online consumer reviews helps companies to demonstrate a track record of reliable service.   
 
CHAPTER SUMMARY  
 
Putting in place the legal and physical infrast ructure for e -commerce is  necessary, but  not enough. Ultimately, e -
commerce is driven by people.  Entrepreneurs need to take initiative and leverage the opportunities of the digital 
economy. A skilled workforce needs to build high -quality online shops, offe ring a smooth purchasing experience and 
reliable delivery. Customers need to be digitally -savvy and comfortable with buying online. This chapter highlights a 
range of policy recommendations that Albania can implement to more directly support this dynamic p rocess and 
foster growth of the e -commerce capabilities ecosystem.  Building private sector capabilities is a complex task, but 
significant international experience - including the case studies highlighted in this chapter – offers a useful starting 
point f or Albania. In many areas, Albania can build on existing initiatives already in place in the country. Rigorous 
impact evaluations, identifying what interventions work and which ones do not work in the Albanian context, are 
crucial to help learn from experi ence and further improve the support package over time.

7. PROMOTING  DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY 
81 
 Widely available and affordable high -speed internet access is a natural prerequisite for e -commerce.  Such 
interconnection between buyers and sellers typically goes beyond mere access of a customer to web shop. In more 
sophisticated settings, it oftentimes includes interconnection between payment systems of different merchant 
banks, interconnection betwee n the web shop and its suppliers and logistic/distribution partners, interconnection 
within the logistics network and its interconnection with the customer.  
This chapter reviews the state of digital connectivity in Albania - in terms of coverage, quality and affordability - 
and identifies key reform needs. In many Albanian cities, broad -based and relatively affordable access to basic 
internet services is already available. However, four key digital connectivity challenges now face Albania. First, fixed 
broadband coverage remains an issue for many rural communities. A mixture of private sector and public sector 
solutions is needed to bridge these connectivity gaps. Second, even in urban areas, the market for top -of-the-line 
high -speed fixed broadband remains  under -developed. This translates into high effective costs for those companies 
that do need such fast connections, such as the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. In the EU, regular 
households subscribe to at least 30 Mbps connection. In Albania, s uch high -speed subscriptions are rare for firms 
and almost not used by households. The market for high -speed broadband needs to be developed more actively and 
market participants need to take a more forward -looking perspective, following global connectivit y consumption 
trends. Third, while basic mobile internet already has significant coverage across the country, it is crucial to transition 
television broadcasting to digital technology, thereby freeing lower bands on the radio spectrum for mobile 
telephony and further improving mobile connection coverage, particularly in rural areas. Fourth, Albania needs to 
put in place now the basis for adoption of mobile network 5G technology, which is set to shape the next generation 
of digital entrepreneurship opportuni ties.

The chapter builds on many other existing reports on digital connectivity challenges facing Albania. Notably, it 
builds on Albania’s 2020 -2025 broadband  strategy , released by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy in July 
2020. It also synthesizes work ongoing under the existing  World Bank Digital Highways project . 
The chapter reviews both fixed and mobile networks in Albania – both matter for e -commerce. It is important to 
note that both types of networks are essential for digitalization of the economy and development of both shoul d 
thus be promoted. While more Albanians have access to mobile internet than to fixed broadband and while 
individuals increasingly use their mobile phones to purchase online directly, it is the fixed network that interconnects Expanding coverage of

Box: Sector stakeholders  
The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) is responsible for policy in the Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) Sector, including Broadband. The Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (AKEP) is the 
sector regulator for electronic communications, in cluding broadband, in Albania. MIE and AKEP execute the Law 
on Electronic Communications which is a primary Law of the sector. AKEP has power to adopt regulations that 
implement the Law. Major stakeholders and their respective roles are listed in the Table  1 below.

telecommunications regulator for Albania. It administers the Law on 
Electronic Communications.  AKEP is an independent authority, 
appointed by the Parliament, with well -defined regulatory objectives 
and competencies.  
National Agency for Information 
Society (AKSHI)  The National Agency for Information Society (AKSHI) is an institution of 
the Albanian Government supervised by the Prime Minister's Office. 
AKSHI’s mission is to coordinate the development and administration 
of state information systems and to promote the development of the 
information society in Albania.  
Audiovisual Media Authority (AMA)  AMA is a re gulatory authority in the field of audio and/or visual 
broadcasting programs and related services.  
Local Government Units (LGU)  As per Law no. 115/2014, dated 31.07.2014 “ On the administrative -
territorial division of local government units in the Republic  of Albania ” 
Albania is divided into 61 municipalities. The Municipalities are further 
subdivided into local administrative units, which ensure that 
municipalities services are also carried out in distant areas, incl. 
issuance of the construction permits e ssential for the broadband 
network construction.  
ALBtelecom  ALBtelecom is Albania’s incumbent operator, and the largest fixed line 
telephone company in the country. On October 1, 2007, the CETEL 
Company, member of ÇALIK Holding, in consortium with Turk Te lekom, 
became the owners of ALBtelecom, presently with 80.27% of the 
shares. The remaining shares -19.73% - are owned by the Albanian 
government and other shareholders majority of whom are employees 
of Albtelecom.

 Mobile operators  There are three mobile operators in Albania: Vodafone, Telekom 
Albania (previously known as Albanian Mobile Communications/AMC) 
and Eagle Mobile (owned by ALBtelecom). The largest is Vodafone 
which concentrates its operations in mobile telephony.  
Other Te lecom Operators  ABCom (Albanian Broadband Company), Tring, Abissnet, and Digicom 
are among the biggest alternative operators owning about 43% of the 
number of subscribers of fixed broadband, after the incumbent 
ALBtelecom (31.2%) and smaller alternative op erators (25.3%). 
ALBCom continues to be the biggest fixed alternative operator with 
close to 75,000 retail subscribers. Until recently ABCom and Tring 
(formerly known as Albanian Satellite Communications/ASC) were the 
two biggest alternative operators pres ent in the market with “triple 
play” offers, i.e. providing broadband internet, telephony and TV. Since 
February 2020 ABCom became part of Vodafone Albania.  
The Electricity Transmission System 
Operator  The Transmission System Operator (OST) is a state -own ed, legally 
unbundled company, which operates the electricity transmission 
system of  Albania and performs central dispatching of the electricity 
loads, and also is a Market Operator. OST possesses a substantial 
fiber -optic network (2,002 km31) that is soon to be commercialized.

FIXED BROADBAND  
At the end of December 2019, fixed broadband penetration stood at 58 percent of Albanian households – driven 
by low coverage rates in rural areas.  Penetration of fixed broadband access is highly uneven and is ranging from 
81.5 percent of households in Tirana to the lowest of 27.8 percent in the county of Kukes. Overall, fixed broadband 
penetration stands at 86.5 percent  of households in urban areas, whereas only 20.4 percent of rural households 
have access. At the village level, out of a total of 2995 villages, 2862 are not connected.

With urban areas mostly connected, fixed broadband penetration growth will be determined by the growth of 
newly connected rural households, businesses, and institutions . Currently, low consumer density and high 
deployment costs (70 percent of Albania’s terrain is mountainous) limit the business case for expansion of private 
sector broadband connectiv ity into rural areas. Where rural connections have been provided, over three quarters 
(79.5 percent) are run by small local internet service providers (ISPs), with market share of below 2 percent, many 
of whom rely on their own built networks at the local level (and not on the incumbent’s network).  
Albania has adopted a new national broadband strategy in June 2020 – this offers a roadmap towards tackling the 
rural connectivity challenge.35 The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) is now working to o perationalize a 
dedicated government program/project to address the poor broadband coverage in rural areas, where it is not 
possible for operators to extend networks due to lack of a commercial business case. In these cases, public support 
is needed in ord er to broaden access to the internet.  
• Implement the recently adopted national broadband strategy: adoption of this strategy has been an important 
milestone towards a coordinated approach to tackling broadband connectivity gaps in Albania. It is now urgent 
to proceed with implementation.  
 
• Finalize design and implement a program/project to mobilize public financing for broadband expansion into 
rural areas:  a feasibility study was recently concluded with the European Investment Bank (EIB), a financing

 partner of the future program/project, and the final workshop was conducted in July 2020.36 Appropriate 
investment models need to now be selected and implemented.   
In addition, a range of measures need to be taken to make it more attractive for private internet service providers 
to expand their network coverage on a commercial basis. Key measures could include:  
• Create a more detailed mapping of broadband infrastructu re (within national GIS -enabled broadband atlas):  
this will allow new network deployments to be better planned and coordinated.  
 
• Ease the fixed broadband network expansion construction process through lighter and faster administrative 
procedures: as has re cently been recommended by the World Bank in the context of the draft 5G strategy, the 
Government could scan existing administrative procedures to identify measures that can ease bureaucracy with 
regards to new network construction.  
 
• Exploit the potential  for infrastructure sharing, whenever possible, to support broadband expansion:  for 
instance, the scope for aerial deployments using existing electricity distribution poles should be fully exploited. 
Albania’s electricity transmission company (OST) changed  its statute at the end of 2019 to enable it to lease its 
infrastructure to be used by ISPs. It is now crucial to finalize agreements on the terms of use and for OST to start 
actual partnerships with ISPs. The  World Bank Digital Highways project  provides extensive analysis on the 
potential and the benefits of infrastructure sharing for digital connectivity in the Western Balkans.  
Besid es coverage, a key issue is the quality of the connection – Albania lags behind in terms of registered average 
download and upload speeds. According to the M -Lab web tool during a specific period of measurements37, the 
average download and upload speeds in Albania were 7.7 Mbps and 3.1 Mbps, respectively. Highest download 
speeds were recorded in Serbia (20.3 Mbps), Montenegro (16.9 Mbps) and Kosovo (8.9 Mbps) respectively.

Within Albania, the highest speeds have been historically recorded in the city of Tirana . During the same 
measurement period, the average download speed there was 9.7 Mbps and the upload speed was 3.3 Mbps. Over 
three quarters of all connections in the city (76.7 percent) were in the range of up to 12Mbps, with the majority 
(over a thir d) up to 4Mbps. Less than 10 percent of all connections in the capital could be considered high -speed, 
i.e. at least 30Mbps38. Yet competitive pressures have been growing in recent years, prompting infrastructure 
improvements bound to facilitate provision of faster speeds at lower prices39. 
Box: Top -of-the line download and upload speeds matter for e -commerce  
The quality of the internet service plays a critical role in e -commerce shopper’s experience and impacts the 
success of the e -commerce business. 47 percent of shoppers expect the website to load in mere 2 seconds. 41 
percent of visitors abandon a website t hat takes more than 3 seconds to load. It is estimated that if an e -
commerce site is making USD 100,000 per day, a 1 second delay in page loading could potentially cost USD 2.5 
million in lost sales every year.40 New trends in e -commerce are putting even g reater pressure on internet service 
quality requirements. For instance, visual commerce41 premised on the use of virtual and augmented reality 
(VR/AR) is poised to affect the future of digital commerce in the next 5 to 10 years.42 Strategic development of an 
enabling environment for such investments in new technologies43 is therefore of utmost importance for e -
commerce development in any country, with Albania being no exception.

 While basic fixed broadband connections are affordable, the cost of top -of-the-line high -speed internet is much 
higher (compared to incomes) in Albania than in regi onal peers. Albania’s 2020 -2025 broadband strategy  highlights 
a range of statistics suggesting that baseline fixed broadband is generally affordable for  Albanians. However, 
According to the Ministry of Finance and Economy of Albania, broadband costs for an unlimited 10 Mbps Cable/ADSL 
line is one of the most expensive, when compared with the competing business process outsourcing (BPO) 
destinations in the  region.44 The affordability of fixed broadband trails most mature BPO locations45 and regional 
peers46. World Bank analysis confir ms that 30 Mbps (high -speed) fixed broadband packages cannot be considered 
affordable for the general population – affordability lags regional peers and significantly exceeds the commonly used 
2 percent monthly disposable income affordability threshold.47 
The market for top -of-the-line high -speed broadband remains niche – explaining low quality of effective internet 
connections and low affordability for high -speed connections. Albania’s 2020 -2025 broadband strategy  highlights: 
“In relation to fixed broadband by downlo ad speed, in 2018 a majority of 62% of subscribers was on 4 -10Mbps, 24% 
on 10 -30 Mbps (54,000 in 2017 and 89,000 in 2018), and 12% of subscribers were still below 4Mbps. As regards fast 
and ultra -fast BB above 30 Mbps, while subscriptions delivered more th an doubled in 2017, the total proportion is 
still low at 2%.” Given limited demand for top -of-the-line high speed internet, private sector investments in advanced 
technologies such as fiber (FTTx) is limited. The service is marketed to a limited audience o f early adopters and 
specialized ITC companies at premium price – a nice product. For comparison, in the EU, subscription of at least 30 
Mbps currently accounts for 63 percent of all broadband subscriptions, while in 16 Member States, its market share 
is greater than 75 percent.48 
As Albania’s digital economy matures, demand and supply for high -speed fixed broadband is expected to grow – 
moving such services into the mainstream and increasing competitive pressures among ISPs. By growing Albania’s 
e-business  ecosystem and adopting latest technologies, more businesses will demand top -of-the-line internet 
speeds. Households will also demand higher speeds, as they adopt more demanding online services (video 
streaming, cloud services, online gaming). As a result,  ISPs will have greater incentive to upgrade their fixed 
broadband infrastructure. Greater competition and business volume will make it attractive for ISPs to market high -
speed broadband connections for mainstream customers, making the service more afforda ble. To accelerate this 
process, Albania needs to ensure open and fair competition between ISPs, both in terms of prices and on speeds. To 
help companies upgrade their infrastructure, easing construction permits and opening the way for greater 
infrastructu re sharing (as recommended above) play a key role. In addition, uncompetitive practices must be 
stopped:  
• Formalize all ISPs : some local ISPs are reported to operate without official license in the grey economy. This 
gives them an advantage compared to law -abiding ISPs and prevents fair competition. Enforcement action is 
needed to ensure that all ISPs compete on an equal footing, abiding by the tax and regulatory regime.  
  
• Ensure equal access to buildings for all ISPs:  according to the law, buildings should enable all ISPs to offer their 
services to occupants. In practice, Albania’s 2020 -2025 broadband strategy  highli ghts that some buildings make 
exclusivity agreements with one ISP. This distorts competition and contradicts existing law. The law needs to be 
enforced, ensuring fair competition between ISPs.

 Albania’s mobile market is home to an estimated 2.6 million subscribers at the end -2019, representing a per -
capita penetration rate for mobile subscriptions of 90.2 percent .49 Comparing to other countries in the region, 
Albania has the lowest mobile subscription penetration, with the highest b eing Serbia and Montenegro respectively.  
All three mobile network operators (MNOs) are running 3G and 4G mobile networks, with the latter technology 
being available mostly in the urban areas and along major transport corridors.  3G signal covers 97 percent of the 
population50. In terms of 4G coverage, only Vodafone covers over 95 percent of the populated territory. Telekom 
Albania’s coverage is up to 85 percent and ALBtelecom covers 75 percent51. Overall, 90 percent of the population 
lives in settlements wit h 4G signal52.  
Effective coverage of mobile network is high, though lags the rest of the region. The share of connections using 
the faster 4G technology is higher than in most regional peers. Around three quarters of all mobile connections are 
provided ov er 4G technology. In this regards Albania along with North Macedonia are relatively advanced when 
compared to other countries in the region. Advancement on this front is important, as upcoming 5G networks will 
be deployed using existing 4G infrastructure. In this regard countries with higher 4G coverage may be considered 
more 5G -ready. Out of the benchmark countries for this e -commerce diagnostic, Italy, Austria, Germany and USA 
have already launched commercial 5G deployments.

AKEP recording over 700,000 net disconnections during this time period. The extreme level of decline is attributed to the 
removal of inactive subscribers from the user -base by the remaining operator s and stronger -than -usual seasonal volatility.

In absence of fixed networks, internet access in rural Albania occurs mainly through mobile and this will likely be 
the way in which many citizens will access e -commerce in the near future. Enabling better qualit y for such access 
will require freeing radio spectrum allocations in lower bands (700 MHz band) for mobile communications. Lower 
bands transmit signals that can travel further – allowing to ensure mobile coverage with less investment in base 
stations in ru ral areas in which there are fewer structures. The  700 MHz frequency band is also necessary for future 
5G networks’ development53. Yet, these bands have historically been used for analog television broadcasting in 
Abania and were not released just yet.  
Currently, Albania is in the process of implementing a nationwide analogue -to-digital switchover (DSO) for 
television broadcasting, which will allow re -assigning radio spectrum from television to mobile communications.54 
Five counties55 have transitioned t o digital broadcasting and more than 80 percent of the population having access 
to digital audio -visual transmissions. Some of the upper segment frequencies (Digital Dividend 1 (DD1) 700 -800 MHz 
band) have thus been released already. However, digital broad casters still occupy the frequency, preventing mobile 
network operators from launching commercial 800 MHz LTE. Also, the remaining frequencies (Digital Dividend 2 
(DD2) 700 MHz band) were re -assigned to broadcasting companies via 15 year licenses.  
 
53 Spectrum requirements for 5G networks are considerably higher than for 4G networks

 • Update the DSO strategy and finalize reallocation of radio frequencies for mobile communications : Albania 
will need to go through the refarming  process to recover and reallocate the radio frequencies that are feed by 
the DSO and make them available for mobile communications. The deadline for freeing up those frequencies is 
June 30th, 2022.  
Albania is preparing the grounds for 5G technology deploy ment through development of the national 5G 
strategy.56 5G infrastructure is expected to provide new service capabilities and will become the central 
infrastructure and enabler for large parts of the national digital economy. Migration to 5G will require m ajor 
densification in the radio access network57 and therefore significant investments for deployment works. The draft 
5G strategy identifies a number of bottlenecks in mobile infrastructure deployment process.  
• Complete preparation and adoption of 5G strat egy: include time bound coverage and quality objectives aligned 
with strategic directions of the EU.  
 
• Simplify the permit granting process for micro sites:  Deployment procedures should be aligned with the “light -
touch” approach used for Wi -Fi deployment.  
• Abandon the bundling practice for permit issuance for cell -sites: currently, construction permits for cell -sites 
are not issued on a first -come -first-served basis. Instead, the responsible authority accumulates a number of 
projects, then reviews and deals w ith the request as a bundle. If there is a delay with one of the projects, the 
entire bundle will be delayed. Such practice constrains the ability of operators to invest on the timely manner.  
• Promulgation of guidelines on the leasing of street furniture (s uch as street lights, traffic lights, various 
cabinets) for the deployment of mobile networks.  
 
CHAPTER SUMMARY  
 
Widely available and affordable high -speed internet access is a natural prerequisite for e -commerce.  Much has 
already been achieved in Albania,  but a range of key challenges still need to be overcome. First, fixed broadband 
coverage needs to be brought to more rural communities. Second, a broader market for top -of-the-line broadband 
is needed to allow Albania to compete at the frontier of digital  technology. Third, in terms of mobile connectivity, 
finalizing the digital switchover for television broadcasting holds the promise of further improving mobile 
communications availability in Albania. Fourth, to prepare Albania for the next generation of e -innovations, the 
seeds need to be sown now to reap the rewards of the coming 5G technology. If these challenges can be overcome, 
they can play a key role in bringing equitable access to digital services, including e -commerce, to all Albanian citizens 
– including those less privileged and with limited access to conventional services and product markets. This chapter 
synthesizes a range of policy recommendations that can help Albania achieve this policy objective.

8. BOLSTERING  THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
94 
 Regulation plays a central role in building the foundations of digital markets.   An enabling regulatory framework 
supports e -commerce and digital trade through two main channels: First, i t provide s essential tools for remote 
transactions, such as electronic documents and signatures . Second, it fosters consumers’ trust in digital mark ets by 
ensuring data protection and privacy and protecting consumers’ rights , hence increasing reliance and bringing new 
actors to digital transactions . Yet, regulations can also introduce restrictions that hamper the conditions for digital 
markets : by res tricting the types of goods and services that can be bought online; by limiting or increasing costs for 
the transfer of data —which is necessary for the transactions —or creating burdensome conditions for online 
marketplaces, platforms, and services provider s, which ultimately limits the offer of goods and services in digital 
markets.

 This diagnostic concludes that Albania has put in place many of the building bl ocks for a modern and 
comprehensive regulatory framework on digital trade  – though several areas for further progress remain .  
Following the mandate to gradually harmonize  its regulatory framework with  the EU acquis, Albania has adopted a 
strong framework  that includes  the main regulatory pillars of digital trade, while maintaining an open and non -
discriminatory regime for foreign digital services. Albania’s regulations on data governance, online consumer 
protection, electronic signature, and intermediary l iability, in general , are in line with the most advanced regulations , 
protecting individuals and consumers, while limiting the costs and restrictions faced by digital businesses . In other 
areas, such as cybersecurity, regulation is still evolving, with a g eneral framework being complemented by sector -
specific regulation . Smaller regulatory gaps need to be addressed, such as  on e-documentation.  Importantly , Albania 
does not maintain other typically restrictive regulations found in other jurisdictions, such as burdensome licensing 
requirements for e -commerce platforms, limitations on the type of goods that can be sold online (other than for 
generally accepted public policy considerations), and restrictions on cross -border data flows.  
 
95 
 This is reflected in Albania’s strong performance in the World Bank’s Digital Trade Regulatory Readiness Index . 
The Digital Trade Regulatory Readiness Index reviews and scores a key set of regulations for digital trade for a total 
47 countries around the world,  including Albania and its Western Balkan neighbors.58  Out of a total of 20 points for 
six categories of regulation, Albania scores a total of 16.5 points.  All Western Balkan countries in fact perform well 
in the regulatory index, scoring between 15.5 and 18.5, reflecting the regulatory efforts done in the context of their 
association agreements to the EU .

in all 37 re gulatory variables deemed valuable to digital trade.  
 
With the regulatory framework largely in place, adequate implementation remains a challenge due to institutional 
capacity constraints and limited private sector awareness . Albania has also advanced in  building the institutions to 
oversee this regulatory framework, but progress has been partial. Areas like e -signatures and data privacy, where 
capable regulatory bodies are in place, could benefit from some improvement in practices and innovations. Other 
areas, like consumer protection and cybersecurity, instead, still require substantial efforts to build modern and 
effective regulatory bodies. Albanian businesses stress that regulations are irregularly or only partially implemented, 
and often their conten t is interpreted differently by different government agencies. For instance, the consumer 
protection regime currently lacks an effective supervisory authority to oversee compliance, create awareness of  
consumers’ rights and solve e -commerce disputes . Equal ly, key r egulations  remain largely unknown to the private 
sector  - on data protection and cybersecurity , for example. Few businesses make use of electronic signatures, even 
though the legal framework is in place. Lack of awareness about regulations limit s their effectiveness and, worse, 
foste rs uncertainty  about the applicable rules.  
In what follows, this study reviews the main policy areas that constitute  the regulatory framework for Albania’s 
digital market.  The study considers a set of regulatory areas of central importance to digital markets and assesses

 the domestic regulatory frameworks in light of recent international trends and regulatory models.  In particular, the 
study addresses electronic documentati on and signature; online consumer protection; data and privacy protection; 
cybersecurity; and intellectual property regulations. These different regulatory areas have in common that, taken 
together, they offer a set of basic rules that create tools for rem ote transactions (e -document and e -signature) or 
clarify conditions of digital transaction that enhance consumers’ and businesses’ trust (such as online consumer 
protection, data governance and cybersecurity).59  
 
REGULATIONS ON ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS  
 
The legal recognition of electronic documents and electronic signatures as adequate tools for remote businesses 
is a crucial step in building a thriving digital market.   As communication technologies connect people and businesses 
around the w orld with increasing ease and convenience, businesses engaged in digital trade also expand their 
network of clients and suppliers across borders .  A conducive regulatory framework for digital trade should hence 
guarantee that contracts concluded remotely t hrough electronic channels are valid and legally enforceable , just as 
those concluded in person .  
Box: The development of Albania’s legal framework for electronic transactions and the e -Albania initiative  
 
A key driver for the development of Albania’s le gal framework for electronic transactions has been the 
Government’s E-Albania  initiative . The E -Albania portal seeks to offer citizens an electronic channel to fulfill a 
wide range of official procedures, such as regis tering a business, obtaining a birth certificate, or paying taxes. To 
implement this initiative, a key foundational block was putting in place key regulations and institutional 
arrangements to recognize electronic documents and signatures.  
 
Challenges dur ing the implementation of the E -Albania initiative highlight the difficulty of implementing an 
electronic transactions framework.  The rolling out of the E -Albania portal casts lights on legal, regulatory and 
institutional channels that need to be addresse d to ensure an adequate framework for electronic transactions, 
such as the interaction of digital regulation with fiscal legislation or other statutes , such as the regulation on 
notarized documents.  
 
Given a focus on building an electronic transactions fr amework suitable for transactions  with the Government, 
spillovers to e -commerce and digital businesses have been slow to materialize . While the regulatory solutions 
 
59 There are a number of additional policies of relevant to digital trade that are not covered in this chapter: regulations rela ted 
to competition policy, taxation, intellectual property, as well as the conditions for business licenses can also make or brea k a 
conducive framework for digital businesses. In assessing these regulatory fields, the analysis focuses on selected regulatory  
options within each of these fields, so as to assess the regulations in the country in a comprehensive manner.  For example, when 
assessing the regulation of electronic signature, the study discusses the scope of the signature and legal validity given to the 
electronic signature. While an in -depth assessment of the regulation of electronic signature in a specific country would req uire 
discussing several other aspects that are referenced only in passing in this analysis (e.g. the nature of the signature certi fying 
authority), the assessment of these key regulatory options provides a picture of the level of sophistication of the regu lation and 
its timeliness in keeping with the policy challenges introduced by digital transactions.   
  
97 
 for e -documents and e -signatures  developed by Albania  are sound and conform to international guidelines , they 
provide for strict procedures that are suitable for governmental procedures such as fiscal declarations , but lack 
the flexibility that is valued in private transactions. The regulation on electronic signature, for instance, could be 
improved by allow ing parties to a remote (private) contract to choose the type of digital signature that be st suits 
their needs , rather than using the stringent electronic signature solution currently used by the Governmen t. 
 
Electronic documentation  
A strong and reliable framework for e -documents is particularly important for digital firms focused on business -
to-business (B2B ), such as the business processing outsourcing (BPO) sector .  Transactions by final consumers, suc h 
as those on e -commerce platforms like Aliexpress or Gjeveve  and app -based services like Airbnb, do not typically 
entail major documentation exchanges and can be concluded even without a specific regulatory framework for 
electronic transactions.  However,  for business relations that require a degree of customization of the products and 
services and that are provided over time, such as those that allow suppliers to connect to global value chains and/or 
services that require peripatetic delivery over extende d contract periods, the ability to conclude a contract or amend 
its terms remotely in a secure and reliable manner is a key step towards engaging in business -to-business  digital 
trade.  
UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (MLEC) of 1996 is the intern ational standard on regulation of 
electronic documents.  The main objective of the MLEC is to facilitate remote transactions by establishing rules to 
allow the electronic equivalent of paper -based documents to be legally recogni zed, thereby removing obstac les 
encountered in the use of electronic means.   The MLEC promotes the principles of non -discrimination, technological 
neutrality , and functional equivalence in the treatment of electronic documentation .  The principle of non -
discrimination is the cornerst one of the regulation, as it ensures that a document would not be denied legal effect, 
validity , or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form.

 Albania’s regime on electronic documentation broadly follow s international guidelines. Albania’s Law on 
Electronic Documents60 in 2010 provides solutions in line with UNCITRAL MLEC recommendations. In line with all 
other Western Balkan and ECA countries reviewed, the Law recognizes electronic documents as legally equivalent 
to paper -based documents .  Equally, the Law includes details on the admissibility of e -documents as evidence. 
However, Albania’s  regulation remains unclear about the recognition of technological neutrality. The Law includes  a 
provision requiring the “inviolability of the electronic document” during  storage of the electronic document61.  While 
this condition appears to promote cybersecurity measures, it can also be understood as requiring specific 
cybersecurity requirements for storage of electronic documents, which would unnecessarily limit the type  of 
electronic documents. Under a strict reading, this would suggest that documents such as email or non -encrypted 
documents may not be fully recognized as electronic documents equivalent to paper documents.  This requirement 
can be unduly restrictive as p arties to a contract should be free to decide what is most appropriate based on their 
circumstances.   
• Clarify the regulatory framework  on electronic documents to reinforce the principle of technology neutrality : 
The government could consider issuing a gui dance indicating what type of measures would be sufficient to 
comply with the requirements for the storage of e -documents or, if needed, amending the Law on Electronic 
Documents to ensure its technological neutrality.  
 
Electronic signature  
Digital activity  involves engaging in remote —often international —contracts on a routine basis , and the legal 
recognition of electronic signatures is key for digital trade. At a minimum, a regulatory framework should recognize 
that electronic signatures are a legally valid  form of accepting an obligation or terms of a document.  Further, the 
framework should also ensure that, when an electronic signature meets certain requirements, it has full recognition 
of validity and enforceability, just like a handwritten signature.62   
Box: International standards for electronic signatures  
 
UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (MLES) of 2001 provides the standards required for an e -signature 
to be considered legally equivalent to a hand -written signature.  It also lays out basi c rules of conduct regarding 
the responsibilities and liabilities of the parties, including the signatory, the certification service provider (CSP) 
and the relying party.  If deemed sufficiently reliable, foreign certificates and electronic signatures are recognized 
regardless of the place of issuance of the certificate, creation or use of the signature, or place of business of the 
issuer or signatory.  
 
 
60 Law No. 10273 of 2010 on Electronic Document s. 
61 Articles 6.C, 18.  
62 Handwritten signatures, in addition to being legally valid, are also enforceable a s they create the presumption 
that they were indeed inserted by the designated person (a rebuttable  presumption, that allows the interested 
person to show proof, for instance, that the signature had been forged). E lectronic signature s can be recognized as 
legally valid but may or may not be given full enforceability depending on the technology and procedures in use. 
Typically, only “digital signatures” that use some type of encryption technology are given full enforceability. An 
electronic signature that is  not fully enforceable would require that the person claiming its validity also provide 
evidence that such electronic signature was indeed inserted by the designated person.   
99 
 With the growth of e -commerce around the world, governments have enacted legal instruments to give 
recogn ition and legal validity to electronic and digital signatures . While the objective of all these regulations is to 
recognize some kind of electronic representation as a legally valid signature, t hree different regulatory models 
are currently in place  ( (Frederick Fischer, 2001) ; (Blythe, 2011) ): 
 
• On one end of the spectrum, the prescriptive approach  only recognizes one type of e -signature as legally 
valid  – typically, secure digital signatures that have adopted specific encryption mechanism and have 
been issued following prescribed procedures. (  (Blythe, 2011) ; (Adobe, 2019) ) 
•  A “minimalist ” or “permissive” approach , on the contrary, allows parties to choose the technology they 
prefer , giving any selected technology equal legal validity. The United States, Canada, Australia, and New 
Zealand have adopted this approached (Assu reSign, 2019) .  
• A hybrid or “two -tiered”  approach  is a mix between these two, recognizing all technologies as legally 
valid while giving certain presumptions only to secure digital signatures . Like the prescriptive approach, 
it describes the requireme nts of a secure digital signature, and include s rules of conduct regarding the 
rights and responsibilities of the parties, including the signatory, the certification service provider (CSP), 
and the relying party .  The EU has further elaborated the two -tiered model to offer greater liberty to 
private parties in adopting secure digital signatures through technologies of their own preference –a 
“two -tiered +”  category. With a view to increasing security while reducing costs of adoption, the EU 
Electronic Identification and Authentication Services Regulation (eIDAS) of 2016 allows the part ies to 
adopt a digital signature that meets all the security requirements  of the secure  digital signature (called 
“qualified Electronic Signature”) but enjoys greater freedom on the selection of the certification 
authorities.  A similar intermediate step was already present in Singapore’s ETA regulation, which 
allowed private p arties to adopt other commercially available technology or procedures for a secure 
digital signature to the extent that it can provide equivalent security as the prescribed mechanism.   
 
 
Albania has adopted a strong regulatory framework for electronic si gnatures . Albania’s e -signature regulation is 
modeled after the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (MLES) of 2001.  According to Albania’s Law on 
Electronic Signature, e -signatures are recognized and admissible as evidence, granting legal recognit ion to electronic 
transactions. The regulation adopts a two -tiered approach (Table 2).  Qualified digital signatures must be certified 
by a designated certification authority and verifiable by a public key encryption key.  If they meet these 
requirements, they are deemed equivalent to hand -written signatures and they enjoy a rebuttable presumption in 
court. Importantly, the Albanian legislation allows for commercial firms to provide legally recognized certifications, 
reducing the costs of adoption.   
In the context of E -Albania, Albania  is implementing a nation -wide digital identification that includes a digital 
signature .  AKCESK leads the digital signatures, electronic identification and trusted services initiatives in Albania. 
Among AKCESK core functions are registering and accrediting Trusted Service Providers (i.e. CSP) and oversee ing 
their activity . Two agencies are recognized by AKCESK to issue digital signatures: the National Agency for Information 
Society (NAIS)  issues certification for official sign ature by government officials, and a public company (ALEAT) 
administers digital signatures for the rest of the citizenship  on behalf of Ministry of Interior . These digital signatures 
are based on public key infrastructure (PKI)  -- a common, and sound, tec hnical solution to ensure the  
100 
 trustworthiness of the signature —and requires two in -person visits (one for application, one for picking up the ID) 
at one of 100+ ALEAT offices spread throughout Albania.63  
But use of digital signatures for commercial matter s remains low.  Stakeholders point that the current procedures 
for obtaining a qualified digital signature are too onerous for a widespread adoption of in private commercial 
contracts. Furthermore, despite the Law’s framework for “advanced digital signature s” that offer greater flexibility, 
Albania’s small domestic market does not appear as a priority for the establishment of firms offering trust services 
on a commercial basis. As a result, while Albania has adopted a conducive regulation for electronic sign atures, their 
use in private businesses remains limited. Awareness campaigns can ensure that both the public and private sectors 
are able to take advantage of the benefits provided by the law.  
AKCESK has recently engaged in several initiatives to facilita te the use of digital signatures. The electronic signature 
law was amended to recognize digital signatures certified by trust services providers in EU Member States. This is a 
positive development for Albania businesses, especially as the EU market is the main destination for Albania’s 
services exports. Now, they can rely on “advanced digital signatures” with certificates issued by companies based in 
the EU, with the confidence that they will be recognized in Albania. Additionally, a trust services agreemen t was 
reached with other Western Balkans countries, which should also increase facilitate remote contracts, particularly 
for B2B transactions.  
• Harmonize regulation on electronic signature, including registration of CSPs, to support integration of digital 
markets in the Western Balkans. In the CEFTA context, Albania and its CEFTA partners could advance to a 
harmonized framework for digital signatures that would not only facilitate remote contracts in the region by 
ensuring mutual recognition, but would also  expand incentives for trust services providers to establish in the 
region.

Importantly, electronic documents and signatures must be recognized also by the courts.   Beyond convenience 
and cost savings, an essential factor for stakeholders to rely on digital signatures and documents is the certain ty that 
the documents will be recognized by the courts should a dispute arise.  The Law on Electronic Documents (Article 
12) expressly mandates as much.  Yet stakeholders in Albania point to court procedures, in particular the 
requirement to notarize the documents being brought to the court, as an obstacle to the recognition of digitally 
signed documents in the country. A spec ific review of conditions of use and recognition of electronic documents and 
signatures by Albanian courts would help shed light on this matters. Simple and clear procedures for incorporating 
electronic document and signatures in court proceedings should b e considered a priority in the regulation of digital 
transactions in the country, especially as the growth of e -signature under the e -Albania initiative is likely to  
• Assess the conditions of use and recognition  of electronic signatures in court proceeding s: The GOA should 
coordinate with the judiciary branch and with the notary association to review and assess the procedures 
involving the presentation of electronic documents and signatures in court proceedings, in order to ensure that 
digital documents can  be admitted in court on equal terms as hand -signed contracts, in compliance with the 
principles set out in the Law on Electronic Documents.  
TRUST -BUILDING REGULATIONS  
 
Regulation plays an essential role in bolstering digital markets by promoting trust.  As digital markets are still in 
their infancy, t he top reason for not engaging in online purchases , at least in developed markets, remains the lack 
of trust in remote electronic transactions (Figure 3).  Consumers typically have no face -to-face contact with  vendors, 
which leads to few “visual cues”, such as location, facilities, and personalized interaction, which helps consumers 
gauge the retailer’s or supplier’s professionalism.  In this environment, consumers are asked to disclose sensitive 
information an d personal data either to a retailer, online intermediary, or digital platform.  As a result, one important 
limiting factor in both developed and developing economies is the perception that cross ‑border online transactions 
and delivery are less secure, and  remedies do not exist for when something goes wrong  (World Economic Forum, 
2019) .  A recent WB study in Albania confirms that lack of trust is one of the main barriers to the expansion of e -
commerce services in the country. 64

Online consumer protection  
Online consumer protection is crucial to enhance consumer trust in e -commerce.   Distance shopping presents 
challenges, such as the inability to assess products in person before confirming a transaction.  Online consumer 
protection laws aim to ensure “a level of protection not less than that afforded in o ffline commerce”  (UNCTAD, 2017)  
(Bartley Johns, Hoppe, Molinuevo, Nghardsaysone, & Daza Jaller, 2017) .   To that end, online  consumer protection 
builds on the principles and mechanisms of traditional consumer protection regimes, extending and adapting those 
protections to digital markets, in order to reduce some of the challenges of buying and selling online, such as the 
rights  and obligations involving an electronic transaction , or the way to rescind it if necessary  (OECD, 2000) . 
A detailed framework for online consumer protection should include digital -specific protections at all stages of 
the tra nsaction.  Consumer concerns include whether the information they enter online is safe  and the terms of the 
transaction (pre -purchase) , whether the goods purchased online will meet their expectations when they arrive  
(purchase) , and whether they are entitl ed to any remedies if any problems arise during or after the transaction  (post -
purchase) .  These can be addressed through regulations addressing information disclosure requirements, the right 
to withdraw from a transaction, dispute resolution, and redress (Figure 4) . 
 
Figure:  Stages of consumer protection regulations  
 
 
The key principles for online consumer protection are recognized in two main international soft -law instruments.   
In 2016 the OECD revised its Recommendation on Consumer Protection for E -commerc e of 1998 , moderni zing its 
approach to fair business practices, information disclosures, payment protections, unsafe products, dispute 
resolution, enforcement and education  (Box 1) .  Similarly, the UNCTAD Guidelines on Consumer Prot ection of 1985 
(revised 1999) were updated in 2015 to include recommendations directed to protecting online consumers and 
improving transparency in online transactions.  The Guidelines also recommend cooperation among countries, 
including in terms of infor mation exchange and enforcement activities.  
Box: General Principles for E-commerce Consumer Protection - OECD Recommendation s 
Pre - Purchase  
1. Transparent and effective protection: consumers who participate in e -commerce should be afforded 
transparent and effective consumer protection that is not less than the level of protection afforded in other 
forms of commerce  
2. Fair business, advertising and marketing practices: businesses engaged in e -commerce should pay due 
regard to the interests of c onsumers and act in accordance with fair business, advertising and marketing 
practices as well as the general principle of good faith   
103 
  
Albania features a comprehensive regulatory framework for consumer protection in digital transactions.  In line 
with international good practices, Albania’s Law on Consumer Protection of 2008 explicitly recognizes online 
transactions in a chapter dedicated to distance contracts. Specific disciplines on online consumer protection offer 
the opportunity to fin e tune the regulation to online transactions, and hence provide for more comprehensive and 
tailored solutions that are often absent from general consumer protection laws.  Albania is amongst the top 
performers in the regional comparative analysis. This ref lects that most countries in the Western Balkans have, like 
Albania, advanced in adopting consumer protection principles pioneered by the EU and its Members States –who 
generally feature some of the strongest consumer protection systems in the world.   3. Online disclosures: online disclosures should be clear, accurate, easily accessible and conspicuous so that 
consumers have  sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding a transaction. Online 
disclosures comprise the following areas of recommendations:  
a. Information about the business: businesses engaged in e -commerce with consumers should 
make readily available  information about themselves that is sufficient to allow, at a minimum: 
i) identification of the business; ii) prompt, easy and effective consumer communication with 
the business; iii) appropriate and effective resolution of any disputes that may arise; i v) service 
of legal process in domestic and cross -border disputes; and v) location of the business  
b. Information about the goods and services: businesses engaged in e -commerce with consumers 
should provide information describing the goods or services offered  that is sufficient to enable 
consumers to make informed decisions regarding a transaction  
c. Information about transaction: businesses engaged in e -commerce should provide information 
about the terms, conditions and costs associated with a transaction that i s sufficient to enable 
consumers to make an informed decision regarding a transaction.  Consumers should be able 
to easily access this information at any stage of the transaction  
Purchase  
4. Confirmation process: businesses should ensure that the point at whi ch consumers are asked to confirm a 
transaction, after which time payment is due or they are otherwise contractually bound, is clear and 
unambiguous, as well as the steps needed to complete the transaction, especially for new payment 
mechanism s 
Post - Purc hase  
5. Dispute resolution and redress: consumers should be provided with meaningful access to fair, easy -to-use, 
transparent and effective mechanisms to resolve domestic and cross -border e -commerce disputes in a 
timely manner and obtain redress, as appropria te, without incurring unnecessary cost s or burden.  These 
should include out of court mechanisms, such as internal complaints handling and alternative dispute 
resolution.  Subject to applicable law, the use of such out -of-court mechanisms should not preven t 
consumers from pursuing other forms of dispute resolution and redress ( see below sub -section on online 
dispute resolution and redress)  
6. Privacy and security: businesses should protect consumer privacy by ensuring that their practices relating to 
the colle ction and use of consumer data are lawful, transparent and fair, enable consumer participation and 
choice, and provide reasonable security safeguards (see section on data privacy)  
Other  
7. Education, awareness and digital competence: governments and stakehold ers should work together to 
educate consumers, government officials and businesses about e -commerce to foster informed decision 
making.  They should work towards increasing business and consumer awareness of the consumer 
protection framework that applies t o their online activities, including their respective rights and obligations, 
at domestic and cross -border levels   
104 
 Albania’s regulatory framework currently 
adopts most main features relevant to online 
consumer protection. Informed decision 
making relies on knowledge about the 
merchant, about the product or services, and 
about the parties’ rights after purchase.  
Albania’s Law ad dresses this, requiring the 
disclosure of essential information on product 
specifics and transaction conditions. Since 
online customers are unable to inspect a 
product before purchasing it, the right of 
withdrawal from the transaction is particularly 
impor tant, allowing customers to return the 
product within a certain period of time, 
escaping the contractual obligation with no 
repercussions.  The Law includes the right of 
withdrawal with a cooling -off period of 
fourteen days.  Customers are not required to 
provide a reason for returning the product, 
which is essential for the right of withdrawal to be effective. Merchants must provide redress for harm suffered as 
a consequence of a product that is defective, damaged, or does not meet the advertised quality c riteria.  In the case 
of defective or inadequate products, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, replacement, or price reduction 
under the Law.   
There is currently no legally mandated online dispute resolution mechanism. Traditional judicial mechani sms are 
poorly suited to e -commerce disputes, particularly when they involve cross -border transactions. Modern regulations 
increasingly call for e -commerce firms to feature an online dispute resolution (ODR) mechanism that leverages 
technology and automate d procedures to resolve small claims, allowing for a quicker and less expensive alternative 
to traditional disputes. In Europe, currently only France, Croatia and Montenegro (these two latter having passed a 
new law on the matter in 2015 and 2014, respecti vely) provide this option to online consumers. The adoption of 
online dispute resolution can increase trust in online transactions and can be done in a cost -effective manner by 
subscribing to existing international mechanisms rather than building one speci fic for the country.  Econsumer.gov, 
for instance, is a partnership of thirty -six consumer protection agencies worldwide that provides, among other 
services, an international platform to address cases of cross -border claims. It is one of the first examples  of an 
international ODR platform, meant to help consumers and agencies to combat international scams.  It allows 
consumers to make cross -border fraud complaints in several languages and across many industries. This solution, 
together with a consumer prote ction regulation that expands consumer rights by providing an online dispute 
resolution mechanism, would create a stronger framework for online consumer protections in Albania.

Albania’s main shortcoming on consumer protection is the lack of an effective dedicated institution to support 
the regime.  Despite Albania having adopted a strong and modern regulation on consumer protection, the lack of 
an institutional framework to supp ort the regulation severely limits the effectiveness of the system. To date, the 
consumer protection regime lacks a high -level, independent or semi -independent agency similar to those backing 
other aspects of digital regulations, such as digital signature (with the support of AKCESK, and NAIS) or data privacy 
(overseen by the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDP C)). Rather, the role currently rests on the 
Consumer Protection Commission, headed by five Commissioners and with the support of one expert. The 
Commission has a broad mandate in terms of consumer protection, but lacks the structure and resources of other 
similar bodies. For dispute resolution, the Commission’s Technical Secretariat (a directorate of the Ministry of 
Finance) receive s consumer complaints submitted through the Ministry of Finance website, but the process remains 
a traditional one.  Given the weak institutional setting, it may not come as a surprise that stakeholders in the 
ecommerce sector do not seem aware of the cons umer protection framework in Albania. Beyond the government, 
the Albanian Consumer Association  (ACA) focuses on the protection of consumers and provides for an active 
traditional dispute resolution mechanism.  However, the efforts of the ACA have so far no t extended into the 
ecommerce sector.  
• Strengthen the institutional capacity of the Consumer Protection Commission or other relevant body to 
implement and monitor a comprehensive  e-commerce consumer protection framework . The Government 
should coordinate wit h the relevant agencies to streamline procedures under one dedicated institution. The 
establishment of a strong consumer protection agency, including with disciplines on online transaction and 
online dispute resolution should be considered a priority in th e development of an e -commerce strategy.

 Data privacy  
Consumers are increasingly aware of the value of their personal data .  Lack of trust on the way personal data is 
managed leads consumers away from electronic transactions, limiting the growth of digita l markets .  Certainty about 
online data use and handling increases trust in digital trade.  At the same time, burdensome regulations on the use 
and transfer of individual data can create  substantial costs for businesses, especially small and medium enterpr ises.  
The goal is hence to allow data transfers in a manner that supports the expansion of digital markets, while increasing 
consumer trust that their private information remains secure and under their control.   
 
Data privacy legal frameworks consist of e ntitling rights for all or certain types of individuals (also called data 
subjects) regarding the collection, usage, storage, and disposal of their personal data.  They also create obligations 
for controllers and processors while enacting derogations in cer tain circumstances (state security, public safety, etc.). 
Security processes for data controllers (either public or private) ensure the appropriate processing of personal data.  
 
 
Box: Key principles of data privacy regulation  
Several international instruments have been focused on setting out the key principles of data privacy 
regulation.  The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework of 2015 promotes a flexible 
approach to privacy protection, with a focus on avoiding th e creation of unnecessary barriers to information 
flows.  The Convention “108+ ” by the Council of Europe is an international human rights treaty focused on data 
protection , setting out principles that are compatible with the requirements of the European reg ulation .  In 2013, 
OECD members updated their Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy adopted in 1980 to account for the new 
reality of digital data flows. The OECD Guidelines declare digital risk an economic risk and they aim to protect 
privacy and indivi dual liberties with respect to personal data processes in the public or private sector. They include 
eight basic principles for data protection:  
 
• Collection limitation principle : limits the collection of personal data and suggests lawful and fair means 
for collection, as well as consent of the data subject where appropriate  
• Data quality principle : calls for relevance of the personal data to the purposes for which they are to be 
used. Additionally, it calls for data accuracy, completion, and mainten ance  
• Purpose specification principle : data controllers should specify the purpose for which the data are 
collected no later than at the time of data collection. Subsequent use of the data should be limited to 
those purposes and the data subject should be n otified of any change of purpose  
• Use limitation principle : limits the use of the data for purposes other than those specified, with the 
consent of the data subject or by the authority of law  
• Security safeguards principle : calls for reasonable protection of  the data from risks such as loss or 
unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of the data  
• Openness principle : suggests a general policy of openness regarding developments, practices, and 
policies with respect to personal data  
• Individual participation principle : the data subject should have the right to request data from a data 
controller or a confirmation of whether the data controller has personal data relating to the individual. 
If the data controller has such data, it should be  provided to the data subject within a reasonable time, 
in a reasonable manner and in a form that is readily intelligible to the data subject  
•  Accountability principle : the data controller should be held accountable for abiding with principles of 
the Guide lines   
107 
  
Albania has implemented a n advanced and 
comprehensive regulatory and institutional 
framework for data privacy.  In close 
cooperation with the EU, Albania adopted a 
new Law on Protection of Personal Data in 
2008, which mandated the establishment of 
the Information and Data Protection 
Commissioner (IDP C) as the main authority 
charged with policy making and regulating  
personal data in Albania.  The Law  on 
Protection of Personal Data incorporates the 
main principles and provisions of the EU Data 
Protection Directive  of 1995 . The promotion of 
data privacy principles is an area of substantial 
interest for the EU Commissio n and several EU 
Member States, and a priority area for technical assistance, especially for other European countries that have a 
strong digital trade link with EU Members States. As a result, the high performance of Albania in this field is not 
unique.  I n fact, all Western Balkans countries and Moldova score top marks in terms of their regulation for data 
privacy, in line with EU Member States France and Croatia.  Other countries in the sample also feature 
comprehensive regulations for data privacy, but m iss some important features.  
Albania’s  Law on Personal Data Protection covers all main regulatory areas of digital privacy . First, specific rules 
govern sensitive personal data, such as political views, sexual orientation, medical history, religion, or eth nical origin 
- thereby safeguarding deeply personal values and preventing discrimination or other forms of misuse. Second, the 
law specifies that legitimate reason  is needed  for collecting and processing personal data. The central requirement 
is obtain ing the consent of the data subject . In addition to consent, some additional basis for the collection and 
processing of data is possible under the law.  Allowing for data to be transferred and processed on the basis of 
contractual obligations allows businesses  to outsource some of their data management needs, such as HR, payroll, 
or consumer analytics. A strong public purpose can override the need to seek consent.65 Third, the law enshrines the 
ability to retrieve one’s personal information, request its amendme nt or demand its deletion as an essential right of 
data subjects. Fourth,  the law includes guidance on the conditions for data to be transferred to other jurisdictions. 
In this context, Albania follows the EU model of allowing transfers of personal data to  jurisdictions that offer an 
“adequate level of protection”. T ransfer of personal data to third countries that do not hav e an  adequate level of 
protection may be done upon authori zation of the IDP .

Digital trade with the EU could be facilitated by recognition of Albania’s privacy regime as “adequate” privacy 
protection. This decision from the European Commission would remove obstacles to transfers  of personal data to 
and from Albania, reducing costs for Albania’s digital businesses. Since Albania’s regime is based on the European 
Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC , which sets the basis for the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  of 
2018,  and Albania is a potential EU enlargement country, Albania is in a good position to seek a decision on 
“adequacy” that could make Albania part of the GDPR -compliant countries.   
• Advance data protection framework in order to seek EU recognition of Albania’ s privacy regime as 
“adequate” , facilitating digital trade: To that end, Albania may need to advance first in updating its privacy 
framework to incorporate new GDPR rules, including aspects related to definition of personal data, consent and 
opt-in require ment for data processing, “right to be forgotten”, and data breach rules.  
The regulation on data privacy is supported by a capable data protection authority.  The Information and Data 
Protection Commissioner (IDPC) is Albania’s main data protection authori ty. IDPC is an independent institution , with 
a Commissioner elected by Albania’s Assembly.   The agency currently counts with 37 employees focused on 
overseeing the implementation of the l egislation on the right to information and personal data protection  by public 
agencies as well as business. IPDC also has an active collaboration framework with international partners, in 
particular the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) .  Reflecting its strong international cooperation, Albania 
hosted a successful 41st edition of the high -level I nternational Conference of Data Protection  and Privacy 
Commissioners in October 2019, hosting over 700 delegates at the Palace of Congress premises  in Tirana.   
109 
 While the Government is making progress implementing data protection, awareness about this effort is limited 
among ordinary Albanians and small businesses .  Concerns about how personal data is being used and protected 
have hindered the wide adoption of e -government services in Albania.66  Most of IDPC’s focus is geared towar d 
promoting implementation of data protection rules by government and private entities. To that end, it monitors the 
adoption of “transparency programmes” on the use of personal data by public authorities and oversees compliance 
by individual firms either by investigating complaints received from individuals or by conducting their own ex officio 
investigations. IDPC’s outreach to civil society supports these goals. Yet consultations with stakeholders and experts 
suggests that the level of awareness of Alban ia’s data protection regimes by individuals and small businesses 
(including those in the IT sector) remains low, curtailing individuals’ trust in Albania’s e -commerce and other digital 
firms.   
• Strengthen data protection  awareness -raising campaigns targeti ng ordinary Albanians and small businesses : 
IPDC may considering strengthening its awareness -raising campaigns as a tool to both incentivize 
implementation by firms and to promote trust in Albania’s emerging e -commerce sector. Public and private 
sector sta keholders could collaborate periodically to share information on privacy and cybersecurity risks and 
best practices.  
 
Cybersecurity  
While less visible to the individual consumers, cybersecurity regulation is an essential component for promoting 
trust in digital markets .  Major data breaches, like that which Yahoo witnessed in 2013 —affecting 3 billion user 
accounts — not only compromise people’s privacy , but can  also have a chilling effect for digital markets , as 
consumers realize how vulnerable  their infor mation is .  In 2015, the OECD declared digital risk an economic risk 
(OECD, Recommendation of the Council on Digital Security Risk Management for Economic and Social Prosperity 
2015). Personal data must be stored and processed securely in order to minimize  the risk of data breaches.  
Security requirements consist of organizational and technical measures as well human resources. These may 
include mandatory encryption of personal data, implementation of rigorous internal policies, and the appointment 
of a dat a manager. Assessment of the risk to a data subject’s privacy helps determine the adequate safeguards that 
need to be implemented (OECD, Privacy Guidelines 2013). Countries without adequate data protection regulations 
risk being avoided by companies due to  the lack of certainty about compliance and data handling (Trade 2015). The 
EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018, introduces updated provisions to 
protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens, including cyb ersecurity requirements.  
 
Table: EU GDPR cybersecurity requirements  
Security of processing  Controllers and processors must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk 
through measures such as data pseudonymization and encryption  
Breach notification  In case of a personal data breach, controllers must notify the supervisory authority 
within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.  In cases where the breach is likely to 
result in a high risk to the individual rights, the controller must n otify the data subject 
of the breach without undue delay

 Impact assessment  Where data processing is likely to result in  a high risk to individual rights, the controller 
must conduct an impact assessment prior to processing, including the foreseen 
measures to address the risks  
Designation of data 
protection officer  Controllers and processors must designate a data protection officer under certain 
circumstances, including if the bulk of the processing activities require regular and 
systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if it consists of processing of 
sensitive data on a large scale  
 
Cybersecurity rules appear as the most 
underdeveloped segment of digital regulations 
in Albania.  This limited progress on 
cybersecurity is not unique to Albania. The 
comparative a nalysis highlights that, unlike most 
other digital regulations assessed in this review, 
cybersecurity rules have seen irregular adoption 
in the Western Balkans region as well as in 
Europe and Central Asia altogether (Figure 8).67  
The twelve countries that  have been reviewed 
appear rather evenly distributed in three groups: 
those with top marks, including France, Croatia, 
Kosovo, and Serbia, feature an advanced and  
comprehensive framework; Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Moldova feature 
instead only  basic, general rules.  Albania is in a 
middle group, together with North Macedonia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, that have adopted a framework for 
cybersecurity, with some requirements to protect the user’s data, but leaving out substantial provisions  designed  to 
strengthen data security.

regulatory requirements in general cybersecurity laws and regulations as well as laws on data protection in the 
context of data privacy.  The analysis does not address cybersecurity requirements that may be set out in sectoral 
laws, including those related to critical infrastructure or other sector -specific regulations.  Figure : Regulation on cybersecurity in ECA countries

Despite limited progress, cybersecurity regulations and policy appear relatively advanced compared to other 
aspects of Albania’s cybersecurity environment. In 2018 -2019 the World Bank in collaboration with the Global 
Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC) of the University of Oxford  and AKCESK  assessed the state of maturity of 
 
112 
 Albania’s cybersecurity  framework .68 It relie d on the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) 
methodology, developed by GCSCC  in collaboration with global experts . The assessment was released by AKCESK 
(CMM Report) and found that, while some efforts have been put into providing for functional and defined  regulatory 
and policy framework for cybersecurity, areas like cybersecurity standards, education and training, and cu lture and 
societal conditions for cybersecurity were only at a very nascent level of maturity and should be tackled in parallel 
with policy and regulations.  
Albania does not have an all -encompassing regulation that deals explicitly with cybersecurity . Ther e is no 
obligation to implement national (or sector -specific) ICT security standards. Albania, through AKCESK, has adopted 
official guidelines that refer to cybersecurity issues.   Further, some cybersecurity elements are set out in the Law on 
Personal Data  Protection and the Law on Cybersecurity. In particular, the Law on Data Protection requires that data 
controllers adopt and publish an internal policy for the protection of the personal data that comes under their 
control.  The law mandates the IDPC with the oversight of this cybersecurity requirement.  However, the broader 
policy and regulatory mandate for cybersecurity lies with AKCESK , who incorporated the role of the National Agency 
for Cyber Security (ALCIRT)  and is in charge of participating in prepa ring the national cybersecurity strategy, drafting 
relevant legislation, and cooperating with all relevant institutions  on the matter. Albania’s Law on Cybersecurity of 
2017 provides a general framework that requires further elaboration; however it does in clude the requirements to 
appoint a data manager responsible for data security and a mandate for data controllers to notify users when there 
have been security breaches that may have exposed personal data.

 Further progress on the development of the cybersecurity legal framework and implementation of policies would 
improve Albania’s performance in the area of cybersecurity . Albania should  expand regulations for cybersecurity, 
including adding requirements such as  mandating the encryption  of personal data and the adoption of risks 
assessments on cybersecurity practices.  Additionally, aligning the legislative fra mework with provisions of the EU 
Directive on security of network and information systems and data protection framework would strengthen the 
system. The report by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  with the World Bank (2019) further suggests that 
the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy and the allocation of a dedicated budget to ensure the 
implementation of a national cybersecurity program  would help achieve greater cybersecurity capacity .  
Increased visibility and greater awareness abou t the cybersecurity legal framework in place could help strengthen 
users ’ trust in Albania’s digital sector  – an important enabler for e -commerce nationally and internationally.  The 
GOA could consider creating an online portal available to all with informa tion on cybersecurity risks and threats.  A 
general observation from conducting CMM Report is that the interviewed participants pointed to a lack of 
cybersecurity awareness skills across all levels of the population and a need to address this from the top down. 
Although the private sector is starting to consider cybersecurity awareness, this is still a nascent process. Even among 
the most prominent corporations in Albania, there is a growing knowledge about cybersecurity issues but not about 
how these issue s may affect them.  
• Update and expand regulatory framework for cybersecurity in line with EU framework : including 
requirements for data encryption  and risk assessment.  
• Adopt National Cybersecurity Strategy and allocate budget to ensure the implementation o f cybersecurity 
strategic plans . Strategic plans might consider the implementation of the Directive on security of network and 
information systems  (the NIS Directive)  and GDPR Directives. Strengthen domestic capacity in cybersecurity by 
implementing a program for cybersecurity researchers . 
• Consider creating a national single online portal linking to appropriate cybersecurity information and 
disseminate the cybersecurity awareness program . 
 
PLATFORM REGULATION  
 
The internet’s unparalleled ability to connect billions of individuals worldwide has boosted platform -based 
business models in which an  intermedi ary stands  between vendors and consumers.   E-commerce platforms like 
Alibaba, E -bay, and Mercado Libre are base d on offering consumers products from thousands of different providers 
rather than their own stock.  “Gig economy” apps offer services such as rides, lodging, or delivery of food or groceries 
from firms and individuals.  Other services rely on content such  as video (YouTube, Vimeo), opinions and reviews of 
products or services (Yelp, Google), or information (blogs) developed by thousands of users, most of whom remain 
relatively unknown to the final consumer.  The relationship between the intermediary (websi tes and apps) and the 
firms or individuals offering their own products or services is hence essential to the functioning of those digital 
transactions.  
Intermediary liability rules are the set of provisions that distribute the liability between intermediar ies (website 
and apps) and actual vendors or content developers when things go wrong.   In other words , intermediary liability 
is the responsibility that falls upon online intermediaries, such as search engines, application platforms, social 
networks, and b roadband companies, for third -party content featured in, or products and services offered through,  
114 
 their website or apps . Just like intermediation is not a novel business model, intermediary liability rules are not new 
a legal concept – most such rules can  be traced back to Roman law.  Intermediary liability rules can in fact be broader 
rules that apply  not only  to online intermediaries  (Gasser & Schulz, 2015) .  However, specific rules of digital 
intermediaries are more likely to  reflect the particular conditions of digital markets.  
Intermediary liability  
Rules on intermediary liability need to strike a balance between protecting consumer rights and supporting the 
expansion of digital markets, including through intermediary platfo rms.   On the one hand, w hile the good s, 
service s, or content may be offered or developed by third parties, intermediary platforms benefit from them  by 
building their businesses around it.  Digital intermediaries manage the relationship with the costumer, a nd they are 
often the largest, mo st sophisticated actor involved in the transaction.  As such, regulations can impose on 
intermediaries (jointly with the third party) liability for fake or faulty products or services, or for offensive or illegal 
content, t ransacted through or featured in their services.  On the other hand, intermediaries often do  not have full 
knowledge of everything that is being offered by producers and content developers  on the platform. Excessive 
liability can therefore deter the development of platform -based services.  
For digital intermediaries, responsibility may arise mainly from two types of conducts: the offering for sale of 
counterfeited products, or the publicatio n of unlawful content, such as images or text, by their users.  The offering 
of fake products would normally entail a violation of intellectual property rules (typically trademark protection). 
Unlawful content can instead run against intellectual property r ules when the content is unduly featuring other 
people’s work (a violation of copyright protection) by, for instance, reproducing music or video without the authors’ 
permission, or it may violate criminal law provisions such as rules against libel, hate sp eech, or child pornography, 
the protection of individual privacy or classified information, or amount to l èse-majesté  or other speech crimes.  
Typically, rules on online intermediary liability have two components: one attributing responsibility to the 
inter mediary and another reducing its liability by removing the violation (“safe harbor”).  For example, the 
intermediary would be held liable if it had knowledge that the product being offered was fake but could be 
exonerated from responsibility if it took step s to remove the product from its listings upon obtaining knowledge of 
the violation.  Rules on responsibility pivot between no responsibility, actual knowledge of the infringement (the 
platform knew the content was unlawful), duty of knowledge (the platfor ms should have known that the content 
was unlawful), or absolute responsibility (the platform is responsible under all conditions). Safe harbor provisions 
typically involve notice and stay -down procedures, which require that upon receipt of a notice regard ing infringing 
content, the intermediary search and remove all copies of the infringing content and ensure it is not uploaded again.  
 
Box: Manila Principles for the treatment of Intermediary Liability  
 
The Manila Principles for Intermediary Liability wer e developed to protect online freedom of expression and to 
provide governments with standards for censorship and takedown laws that respect the users’ rights.  The effort 
involved civil society groups from around the world, led by the Electronic Frontier F oundation (EFF, USA), the 
Centre for Internet and Society (CIS, India), Article 19 (UK), KICTANET (Kenya), Derechos Digitales (Chile), 
Asociación por los Derechos Civiles (ADC, Argentina) and Open Net (South Korea).  
The proposed principles are:  
1. Intermediaries should not be liable for third party content: intermediaries should be exempt from liability for 
third party content where they did not modify the content; they must not be required to routinely monitor 
content on their network or platform;   
115 
 2. An order by a judicial authority must be required for content restriction: an order from an independent and 
impartial judicial authority must be required for content restriction;  
3. Requests for restrictions of content must be clear, be unambiguous, and follo w due process: where an 
intermediary receives a restriction request before a court order is issued, they need not evaluate the legality 
of the content; the request must include its legal basis; sanctions should be imposed for bad faith restriction 
requests ; 
4. Laws and content restrictions orders and practices must comply with necessity and proportionality tests: 
restrictions should be specific to the content at issue, if applicable, limited in geographical scope; and not 
extend beyond its duration;  
5. Laws and c ontent restriction policies and practices must respect due process: parties must be provided the 
right to be heard and to appeal against restriction orders;  
6. Transparency and accountability must be built into laws and content restriction policies and practi ces: 
applicable rules and transparency reports must be published online in a timely manner.

Albania has introduced a solid framework on 
intermediary liability. Albania’s 2009 Law on 
Electronic Commerce  includes a chapter on the 
conditions for liability of different types of digital 
services providers. The law builds on the EU E -
Commerce Directive of 2000, and provides a 
framework for the conditions of liability for (i)  
telecom infrastructure operators w ho only 
transmit data through their networks (“mere 
conduit”) or store data temporarily for the 
effectiveness of the transmission (“caching”) 
and (ii) “hosting” service providers that store 
information provided by third parties. The latter 
includes interme diaries like ecommerce or 
digital content platforms.  This framework in 
itself is a key step towards  increasing 
transparency about the rules on intermediary liability .  
In line with international best practice, Albania’s legal  framework provides a “safe ha rbor” for platform services 
such as digital platforms . The regulation provides a channel for digital platforms to be exempt of liability for unlawful 
material uploaded by third parties.  “Hosting” providers are exempt from wrongdoing if they l ack knowledge  of 
infringing content  or they r emov e it upon acquiring knowledge of such content. This conditional exclusion of liability 
is in line with modern international practices, as it seeks to strike a balance between the liberty of the intermediary 
to allow thir d parties to exchange information and views, and the responsibility to avoid unlawful content. Under 
this framework, for example, a news video -sharing platform like YouTube or Vimeo would not be immediately 
responsible for a video featuring, say, hate spee ch, if it took action to remove it once they were informed of its 
existence. Similarly, an e -commerce platform like Gjirafa.com or Gjeveve  would only be liable for the sale of illegal 
drugs by a vendor if it failed to block it once it came to their knowled ge. This is also the approach adopted by the EU 
regulations and the EU Members States.  Figure : Regulation on cybersecurity in ECA countries

However, the legal framework can be further strengthened . Firstly,  despite early attempts to adopt secondary 
regulation setting out the conditions of operation of the safe harbor provision of the E -Commerce Law, no such 
guidance has been adopted to date. The adoption of such rules would help strengthening the system, as well as to 
clarify the safe harbor and notice -and-takedown procedures for digital platforms, especially SMEs and start -ups that 
do not have advanced internal policies yet. Secondly   Article 2 of the E -Commerce Law explicitly excludes matters 
relating to i ntellectual property from its coverage.  The Law seems to aim to address situations involving criminal or 
civil sanctions, such as content that violates individual privacy, public morals, or national security.  As a result, digital 
intermediaries are (part ially) sheltered from criminal conduct for unlawful content (e.g. hate speech, child 
pornography, etc) uploaded by third parties, but they can be found fully liable (jointly with the third party) for 
content that infringes intellectual property rights, suc h as copyright for video or text, or trademarks for counterfeit 
protects. This is a key issue  for content platforms (YouTube) or social media (Facebook) or smaller local social 
platforms, who depend on content uploaded by third parties and may find themsel ves liable for violations incurred 
by their users.  The IP Law of 2016 ( Law No. 35/2016 of March 31, 2016, on Copyright and Related Rights ) was 
updated to reflect obligations under the Copyright Directive of 2001, including the rights of copyright holders a nd 
remedies available for the violation of those rights.  While the Law does address the matter of liability of digital 
intermediaries in its article 163:1,, the provision is not directed to developing a safe harbor regime, but only to 
extending the right of copyright holders to seek compensation in court from online intermediaries in case of a 
violation. As such, the provision fails to reduce liability of intermediaries for third party content, and also fails to 
create a simplified mechanism that allows IP  rightsholders to seek the prompt removal of copyrighted content from 
the internet. Finally, Albania’s existing legal framework  includes a provision requiring intermediaries to restrict the  
117 
 content upon notice by the court or competent authorities.  Making  this requirement strictly dependent on an order 
from a judicial authority would prevent arbitrary orders and overreach from the government.  
• Amend E -Commerce law to expand scope of intermediary liability rules to intellectual property rights , and 
regulate the conditions for safe -harbor and notice -and-takedown procedures : Such a broader scope of the e -
commerce law has also been applied in other European countries, including Croatia, Montenegro, North 
Macedonia and France.  
 
CHAPTER SUMMARY  
 
A conducive regulatory framework is necessary for vibrant digital markets.   Regulation can provide the legal tools 
necessary for remote contracts, clarify the rights and obligations of the multiple actors involved in digital 
transactions, and establish a fra mework that promotes consumer trust in digital markets, even when the consumer 
does not know the merchant or when the merchant is in a different country.  
Albania has made valuable progress in providing a conducive and comprehensive legal and regulatory fr amework 
for digital trade.   Albania’s regulatory framework for digital trade has benefitted substantially from the Association 
Agreement with the EU and the resulting partnerships with EU institutions and Member States, so that laws and 
regulations have dr awn on EU lessons and guidance. These efforts are particularly valuable given the nascent nature 
of the digital sector in the country, particularly those related to e -commerce, which suggest a vision to leverage 
digital technologies and digital businesses as a pillar of economic growth.  These regulatory advances, however, 
should be completed with adequate resources and technical capacity in the government bodies to ensure their 
effectiveness.  Further, a comprehensive awareness campaign to disseminate thes e efforts in the digital trade sector 
would be a cost-effective initiative to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, as well as to foster synergies 
between the private sector and policymaker s. 
A number of regulatory and institutional initiatives woul d further help fostering digital trade and e -commerce by 
increasing trust in digital transactions.   Some specific recommendations resulting from the analysis include:

9. CONCLUSION  
  
120 
 This report reviews Albania’s e -commerce enabling environment and identifies recommendations to help Albania 
better leverage the opportunities associated with digital trade. E-commerce thrives at the intersection of a complex 
multisectoral enabling environ ment . Constraints on  all dimensions need to be tackled to support Albania’s e -
commerce ecosystem:  
• Logistics and customs:   postal services and other logistics companies need to develop tailored solutions to 
support e -commerce companies . The c ustom s administ ration  need s to adapt and  strengthen  processes to 
effectively handle  the low -value high -volume  consignments typically associated with e -commerce . In turn, 
e-commerce companies  need to invest in their warehousing strategies, storing inventory close to the 
eventual customers – enabling fast, reliable and affordable last mile delivery  when an online purchase is 
made . 
 
• Digital connectivity : public and private sector solutions are needed to expand access to high -speed 
broadband connectivity , which requires mobilizing financing for infrastructure investments as well as 
streamlin ing the processing of  permits . Beyond this, investment in mobile technologies - including roll -out 
of 5G – is crucial for preparing Albania for the next generation of online b usiness opportunities.  
 
• Online payments : On the one hand, broadening access to electronic means of payments among customers 
is key. On the other hand, businesses  need  to invest in developing their capabilit ies to accept online 
payments. Growth of either si de of the market can accelerate development of the other, setting in motion 
positive feedback loops.   
 
• Private sector capabilities and skills : online markets need a well -developed  e-commerce  private sector  
capabilities pyramid. Albanian e -entrepreneurs need to be supported , both through financing and training 
solutions, but also by developing an overall supportive business environment  - for instance, creating a 
transparent and business -friendly tax  and customs  framework for e -commerce . E-commerce enabling 
businesses, such as consultancies, IT companies and logistics players, are important strategic assets that 
can help local businesses to make the jump and develop online sales c hannels. Finally, Albanian  customers 
need to be educated – making them confident online shoppers that know their rights and responsibilities , 
while avoiding scams . Developing gradual familiarity with online shopping - learning by doing – will be key.  
 
• E-commerce regulatory framework : online transactions need to be underpinned by a strong regulatory 
framework. The law needs to provide protection for all parties involved,  building trust in the digital 
economy. The emergence of online platforms calls for the n eed to develop a  dedicated legal infrastructure 
clarifying the rights and responsibilities  faced by these new types of businesses . 
As Albania’s e -commerce ecosystem  develops, it will be crucial to also manage risks associated with the growth 
of online mark ets. Given Albania’s nascent e -commerce ecosystem, this report has prioritized strengthening the 
enabling environment for digital trade. However, as  the market grows, key risks associated with online markets will 
also need to be managed. To the extent that  e-commerce displaces some of the  established local brick -and-mortar 
businesses, local communities need to be supported to adapt to these changes. Government agencies, such as the 
tax administration and customs, will have to upgrade their procedures to man age e -businesses efficiently, fighting 
informality in online markets as well as ensuring that international e -commerce players pay their fair share of taxes 
in Albania. Albania’s competition framework will need to find practical solutions  to protect custom ers from e -
commerce giants that can dominate online markets and limit competition. While e -commerce companies are  
121 
 continually innovating to reduce their packaging and logistics footprint, the net impact of the rise of the digital 
economy on the environment  needs to be closely monitored.  
Albania needs to establish institutions that can ensure that the momentum on e -commerce reform is maintained 
and that reform announcements also translate into reform outcomes. A key challenge for e -commerce reform is 
the requirement for concerted action across multiple government line ministries, closely coordinated with the 
private sector, international development partners as well as regional forums. Reform efforts are often t echnical 
and take time to bear fruit. In certain areas, international best practice still needs to fully mature and currently offers 
limited guidance. As important step in this process, Albania has already established an inter -ministerial e -commerce 
workin g group to regularly review progress with implementation of e -commerce reforms . This working group now 
needs to develop and adopt an e -commerce action plan, articulating actions, responsibilities and a reform timeline.   
The World Bank looks forward to cont inuing to support Albania in its effort to build a strong online economy that 
benefits all.  Concerted public and private sector action is needed to leverage Albania’s digital trade opportunity.  
Best practices that are gradually emerging in more mature e -commerce markets, including in its nearby partners in 
the European Union, offer a useful roadmap  for reform in Albania . This diagnostic report has aimed to highlight key 
policy actions  needed.
