In recent years, we have seen the enormous potential of digital technology to catalyze financial inclusion. By giving 
unbanked people access to financial services via mobile phones or the internet, technology is creating a brighter 
future for millions around the world. 
Digital financial services may also help break down one of the remaining impediments to full financial inclusion: 
the informal nature of many businesses worldwide. Although financial inclusion is particularly beneficial to 
entrepreneurs, the majority of micro- small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) do not participate in the formal 
financial system. Business-owners are often skeptical that the costs of formality, including paying taxes and abiding 
by regulations, are outweighed by the benefits.
The evidence shows, however, that formality can help firms enter new markets, join global value chains, reach 
foreign buyers, or access credit. For workers, being part of the formal economy offers legal protections and social 
benefits that are often otherwise lacking. In other words, formalization enables economic inclusion. And given that 
many MSMEs are owned by women, informality among small firms also represents a missed opportunity to close the 
gender gap in access to financial services. 
The conviction that digital financial services can accelerate the transition from informal to formal economic activity is 
shared by the World Bank Group and the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Advocate for Financial Inclusion, 
Her Majesty Queen Máxima. We have worked together to increase financial inclusion for more than a decade, 
advancing global goals such as Universal Financial Access 2020, working at the country-level on policy advice and 
collaborating on global advocacy with both Standard Setting Bodies and the G20’s Global Partnership for Financial 
Inclusion (GPFI). 
When the issue of informality and digital finance was raised as a focus for the GPFI during the Argentine Presidency 
we saw an opportunity to collaborate again, and this report is the result. It complements and extends the work of the 
GPFI in several key areas, notably providing the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of global informality. [And it 
shows, for example, that although East Africa still leads the world in mobile payments informal firms continue to rely 
upon informal channels for credit and savings, or lack access altogether.] 
There are encouraging signs that digital technologies are lowering the barriers for entry into the formal economy, 
but more work is needed. Governments can help through tax inducements, subsidies for point-of-sale facilities, and 
a range of digital infrastructure from connectivity to digital ID systems and regulation to protect consumers.
Financial technologies have a transformative role to play across the development agenda, and the findings of this 
report already inform country advisory work by both the World Bank and the UNSGSA. Going forward, we will continue 
to work together to expand research on this topic, identify country pilots where we can rapidly test approaches that 
have already proven successful and disseminate our findings.

• This paper explores economic informality and how it relates to digital financial inclusion. It focuses specifically 
on the potential role that digital financial services–including those accessed through mobile phones and the 
internet–can play in encouraging businesses to formalize their operations.
• Drawing on data from the World Bank Global Findex database and Gallup World Poll, the paper estimates the 
number of informal business owners around the world and reviews the way they make financial transactions. 
The data show wide variations in the extent of informality as well as the financial inclusion of informal business 
owners. 
• Existing research and our own calculations show that the size of the informal economy shrinks as countries 
become wealthier. Policies and institutions also have an impact: We find that informal economic activities tend 
to decrease as law and order improves, and that there are more formal firms registered in countries seen to have 
fair tax regimes.
• The paper finds that digital financial services can make it easier for informal firms to register and operate as a 
formal business, while also creating synergies between individual reform efforts. For example, companies 
that use a digital payroll system can easily make pension contributions when online platforms are available. 
Digital financial transactions also make it easier for governments to enforce laws and regulations, including tax 
collection. 
• Better access to formal financial services can also serve as an incentive for firms to formalize. Governments 
have used subsidies and other tax inducements to encourage both businesses and consumers to adopt digital 
financial services. One example is Uruguay, where the government has subsidized adoption of point-of-sale 
facilities for small businesses while reducing tax withholding requirements for firms and lowering value-added 
taxes for consumers. Another example is South Korea, which allows wage earners to claim tax deductions for 
purchases made using digital payments when they file their year-end income taxes. Early research suggests the 
reforms have helped increase the number of formal financial transactions. Informally operating firms might also 
be encouraged to register in order to receive these financial incentives and meet customer demands for electronic 
payment receipts.
• However, there are several important caveats. The relationship between digital financial inclusion and formalization 
is mostly anecdotal at this stage. Nor is it clear that formalizing small transactions is an effective way to increase tax 
collection. Uruguay's recent experience suggests that increasing use of digital payments by small retailers might not 
easily lead to higher tax revenues. If policymakers are looking for new sources of revenue, it might be more effective to 
focus on large firms and corporations, whose tax liabilities have generally fallen in recent decades. Much more research 
is needed on the topic.
• Curbing informality is not easy. Research shows that most approaches to boosting formalization—such as 
simplifying regulations, providing financial incentives, and increasing enforcement—have yielded modest 
impacts. Most informal firms remain relatively small and unproductive throughout their existence. Informal Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions9
firm owners generally believe that the costs of formalization (such as paying taxes) outweigh the benefits 
(such as gaining better access to financial services). Therefore, overly zealous enforcement might simply 
drive these firms out of business, leaving everyone worse off than before. 
• Using the financial system to compel formalization could have additional negative consequences. For example, 
if informal business owners think digitization will increase their tax burden, they might forgo the use of digital 
financial services, resulting in lower financial inclusion. Policymakers should see financial inclusion as a tool to 
facilitate development goals, not a bludgeon to force formalization.  
• As the digital economy grows and countries seek to curb informality, policymakers should tailor their programs 
to the needs and realities of different groups of enterprises. For example, the benefits of formalization might be 
most appealing to larger firms that aim to increase foreign sales, purchase property, or get access to formal loans. 
Recent research suggests that even when firms do register, they might need additional information and training 
about how to reap the benefits of formalization. 
• Formalization and digital financial inclusion depend on quality infrastructure. Moving away from cash to 
digital payments is only appealing if electronic transactions are cheap and widely available. Affordable digital 
connectivity is crucial for online and mobile transactions. Secure biometric identification can facilitate access to 
digital financial services. Vigorous and enforced consumer protections, interoperability, fair and proportional tax 
policy, and competition policy are key aspects of a vibrant digital financial infrastructure.
Mohamed © 2017 CGAP Photo ContestLeveraging Digital Financial Solutions10Companies operating within the formal economy benefit from access to markets, legal protection of their property, 
binding contracts, and investments. In return, they provide employment through formal contracts, contribute to 
employee benefits, and commit to paying taxes and observing public regulations. 
Alongside the formal economy, wealthy and poor countries alike have a parallel, informal economy in which many 
companies, entrepreneurs, and workers operate. Activities in the informal sector lack legal status, are not captured 
in official statistics, and fall outside the reach of public regulation. While this shadow economy can play an important 
role in providing jobs and filling demand for goods and services, it can also hamper the development of formal 
economic systems. Workers in the informal economy generally don't enjoy the same legal protections and social 
welfare benefits that formally employed workers do.  
This paper explores the role that financial services – and especially digital financial services accessed through cards, 
mobile phones and the internet – can play in encouraging informal enterprises to join the formal economy. As the use 
of digital financial services grows, tools such as digital payroll and payment systems can make it easier for informal 
firms to register and operate as a formal business. Formalization, in turn, can potentially open new opportunities for 
firms to access financial services, such as bank loans, as well as government subsidies and incentive programs.
Although digital financial services and tools have the potential to facilitate formal business registration, more 
research is needed to understand the relationship between 
digital financial inclusion and business formalization decisions. 
Numerous other factors contribute to the existence of informal 
economic activities, including cultural practices and attitudes; tax 
morale, or the intrinsic motivation of individuals and firms to pay 
their taxes; institutional strength and enforcement capabilities 
of governments; and country-specific structural barriers. While 
research suggests that administrative burdens such as complex 
tax payment procedures are key drivers of informal economic 
activity, simply streamlining such processes (with or without 
digital technology) isn't enough to produce substantial shifts 
from informal to formal economic activity. 1. Context: The global role of 
informality
As the use of digital financial services 
grows, tools such as digital payroll 
and payment systems can make it 
easier for informal firms to register 
and operate as a formal business. 
Formalization, in turn, can potentially 
open new opportunities for firms to 
access financial services, such as bank 
loans, as well as government subsidies 
and incentive programs.Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions11These findings suggest that small, informal firms might 
perceive that the benefits of operating in the formal economy–
ranging from access to formal credit markets and the ability 
to compete for government contracts, to the opportunity to 
engage in international trade–outweigh the significant costs 
of compliance, including paying taxes and registration fees 
and complying with pension and social security laws. It may 
not be cost effective for the government to try and formalize 
some segments of the informal economy, such as small family 
businesses that provide subsistence level income for few 
individuals, and it is not clear whether such efforts would 
aid or hurt development and growth. The multifaceted nature of the decision to formalize or remain informal 
may explain why shadow economic activity is higher in low income economies, and why stand-alone or narrow 
reforms typically fail to significantly affect rates of formalization. In poorer economies—where there are 
relatively few jobs available—people often set up their own business or make a living by doing day labor. Because 
informal employment tends to be low-paying, many people who work in the shadow economy could not afford to 
pay taxes or social security on what they earn. And they might not want to pay taxes if they perceive the government 
as untrustworthy or corrupt. Increasing use of digital finance and other such tools may help create synergies between 
individual reform efforts, while facilitating government enforcement of laws and regulations. For example, it may be 
easier for businesses that use digital payroll systems to pay pension contributions via online platforms.
The data analysis, literature overview, and country case studies in this report seek to illustrate the potential for 
financial services, and especially digital financial services, to aid governments in reducing informal economic activity. 
The report also provides a look into best practices and recent reforms in this sector among developing countries.  
1.1 Defining informality 
In the broadest sense, economic informality—sometimes known as the "shadow economy" or the "hidden economy"—
is defined by what it is not: 
• The informal economy refers to "all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in 
practice – not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements." i
• "Informal employment refers to jobs or activities in the production and sales of legal goods and services which are 
not regulated or protected by the state." ii
• "The shadow economy is defined as the ensemble of all market-based legal production activities that are 
deliberately concealed from public authorities" for one or more reasons.iii 
Formality has multiple dimensions and degrees, as defined by whether and how a business meets various legal 
obligations, as stipulated by public laws and regulations. The legal status of an enterprise begins but does not end 
with incorporation and registration. An enterprise must also obtain licenses or permits to operate, declare and 
pay taxes, compensate workers and pay taxes on labor, and comply with safety, health, environmental, and other 
regulations. Many registered firms exist in only partial compliance.iv  Small, informal firms might perceive 
that the benefits of operating in the 
formal economy–ranging from access 
to formal credit markets and the 
ability to compete for government 
contracts, to the opportunity to 
engage in international trade–outweigh 
the significant costs of compliance, 
including paying taxes and registration 
fees and complying with pension and 
social security laws. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions121.2 Scale of the informal economy
The informal sector represents a significant source of jobs, 
employing 1.8 billion people world-wide.v The shadow economy 
is largest in Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan 
Africa, and Europe and Central Asia, where informal activity 
makes up roughly 40 percent of gross domestic product. South 
Asia is close behind at about 35 percent, followed by East Asia and the Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa, 
each of which have informal sectors accounting for approximately 32 percent of GDP .vi In the average developing 
country, the informal sector accounts for about 70 percent of the labor force, and the informal economy is smallest 
in high-income OECD countries.vii
The IFC estimates that 74 percent of all micro, small, and medium sized enterprises globally are informal.viii 
"The degree of formality increases with firm size, suggesting that as firms grow, their demand for the services 
associated with formal institutions increases, as does the probability of detection by authorities." ix
1.2.1 Measuring the number of formal businesses
Another way to measure the extent of entrepreneurship is to 
look at data on formal firms. A rough estimate of formal business 
penetration is provided by World Bank Doing Business data on 
the number of new limited liability companies (LLCs) per 1,000 
adults. Figure 1 divides countries into five quintiles based on country-level GDP per capita. The first quintile represents 
the poorest 20 percent of countries worldwide, while the fifth quintile represents the richest 20 percent. The figure 
shows that the number of formal businesses rises with income. In the poorest fifth of countries, there is less than one 
new LLC per 1000 adults. That number is nearly five times as large in the richest two quintiles.x

all micro, small, and medium sized 
enterprises globally are informal.  
The number of formal businesses 
rises with income.Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions13A simple calculation based on Gallup World Poll and World Bank 
data suggests that in developing countries, income (as measured by 
country-level GDP per capita) explains about 40 percent of the cross-
country variation in informal business ownership. Yet income is not 
the only factor shaping informality. A country's overall institutional environment is also significant. The Gallup World 
Poll survey compiles an index on law and order. To make the index, surveyors ask respondents whether they have 
been victimized by burglary or assault in the past year; whether they feel safe; and if they have confidence in the local 
police forces. The data show that as law and order improves, the share of informal business owners in developing 
countries decreases (Figure 3). This effect is statistically significant after controlling for national income.Source: Gallup World Poll (2015-2017) and World Development Indicators (2017).Figure 2: Informality widespread in poorer countries
Adults who report being self-employed or report owning a business with two or fewer employees 
by income quintile as measured by country-level GDP per capita (% age 15+)1.2.2 Measuring the share of adults operating an informal business
Data on formal business ownership provides a helpful but incomplete 
gauge of entrepreneurship. Some people might not consider their 
economic activity as tantamount to owning a business. Another way 
to look at entrepreneurship is through self-employment data, which might capture people who engage in seasonal 
or occasional informal business practices, such as farmers who sell crops at a stand during a good harvest season. 
To offer a rough approximation of informal business ownership, we used Gallup World Poll survey data to 
construct a variable showing the share of adults who report being self-employed, or report owning a business 
with two or fewer employees. We assume such businesses include only the founder and a family member and are 
overwhelmingly informal. Our variable shows that informal business penetration is higher in poorer countries 
than richer countries. In the poorest 20 percent of countries globally, roughly 4 in 10 adults have an informal 
business, compared with only 1 in 10 adults in the richest 20 percent of countries. This suggests that informality 
shrinks as economic development increases. Informality shrinks as economic 
development increases.
As law and order improves, the 
share of informal business owners in 
developing countries decreases.    Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions14Another factor that influences business owners' decisions on 
whether to formalize their operations is taxation. The World Bank's 
Doing Business database measures the amount of taxes business 
owners have to pay. The database also looks at the overall ease of 
paying taxes – as determined by the number of tax payments per 
year, and the time it takes to prepare, file, and pay taxes. One might expect people to create more formal businesses 
in countries where the tax regime is seen as fair and convenient. Our calculations suggest that this is indeed the 
case. In developing countries, the number of new limited liability companies increases as the overall quality of the tax 
regime improves (Figure 4). The relationship is statistically significant after controlling for national income. Figure 3: Informality decreases as law and order rises

This report focuses on eight representative countries–Argentina, China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Pakistan, 
Tanzania and Zimbabwexi  – that vary by region, income level, size of informal economic activity, and adoption of 
digital financial services. Here, we see differences across rates of business ownership, self-employment and levels 
of financial inclusion. In Kenya and Tanzania, nearly half of adults have an informal business, as do roughly a third 
of adults in China and Colombia (Figure 5). The numbers are considerably lower in India and Pakistan, which have 
more economically inactive people and more subsistence farmers than China. Globally and in developing countries, 
roughly a quarter of adults have an informal business. 
In developing countries, 31 percent of men and 25 percent of women 
have an informal business. Gender differences vary among our 
representative countries. In China, roughly 1 in 3 adults run an 
informal business, with no differences between men and women 
(Figure 6). But in Pakistan, men are 10 times as likely as women to 
have an informal business.Figure 5: Informality varies in developing countries

In Argentina, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, poorer adults are nearly 10 
percentage points more likely than richer adults to have an informal 
business (Figure 7). The income disparity is even greater in China, 
reflecting a gap between urban and rural areas.Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions171.3 Why informality can be a problem 
Economic informality raises concerns across a spectrum of economic and social issues:
• Informal businesses generally have lower productivity than 
formal businesses, which can be a drag on firms and the 
economy. If informal firms in India were as productive as formal 
firms, output per worker would be five times greater, leading 
to higher income and lower poverty.xii (This is not to say that 
formalizing these firms would make them more productive. It is 
simply an illustration of the productivity gap between formal and informal firms.)
• Poorer and disadvantaged populations operate in the informal sector, which raises the question of economic 
inclusion. Informal firms are restricted from tapping into formal financing and markets. Workers in the informal 
sector generally lack social protections, such as insurance and pension benefits.
• Public revenues are reduced by hidden economic activity, resulting in diminished provision of public goods.
• Business conducted outside the regulated economy raises safety, health, and environmental risks for workers and 
communities.
• Owners of formal businesses, which generally pay taxes, may feel that informal businesses have an unfair 
competitive advantage because the latter don't pay taxes.
1.4  From a policy standpoint, is it advisable to force formalization? 
It's understandable that governments would seek to bring informal enterprises into the formal economy. Increasing 
the size of the formal economy could generate more tax revenues, strengthen protections for workers and the 
environment, and improve economic inclusion. For firms, a secure, formal legal status might improve competitiveness 
and profitability. Small and medium-sized manufacturers in Vietnam enjoyed higher profits, investments, and 
improved working conditions for workers after they formally registered their businesses.xiii  Another potential, but not 
automatic, benefit includes better access to financial services, such as loans, which can help firms to grow. However, 
researchers found businesses in Malawi that received assistance to register their operations only experienced 
improved access to financial services when the assistance was combined with bank information sessions. In those 
cases, firm sales rose by 20 percent and profits by 15 percent.xiv
1.4.1 Attempts at formalizing firms haven't been 
very successful
Researchers have done studies to see if addressing the perceived 
causes of informality leads to higher registration. The results 
are mixed, but generally show that informal firms are reluctant 
to formalize. Some interventions—such as incentive payments 
and tighter enforcement of laws—have had some success, while others—such as policy reforms and educational 
programs—have yielded more modest impacts. Informal businesses generally have 
lower productivity than formal 
businesses, which can be a drag on 
firms and the economy.

of doing so—but there was no impact on formalization. Registration only increased when the information was 
paired with incentive payments. Payments equivalent to between a half month and one month of profits increased 
registration by around 20 percent, while payments equal to two months of profit boosted formalization by about 
50 percent.xv  
• Researchers in Brazil offered firms information about formalizing and provided free accounting services for 
one year while subjecting them to government inspections. The study took place years after the government 
had simplified the process for registering, and reduced the cost of registering a business. Only the inspections 
increased registration rates (by 21 percentage points to 27 percentage points), suggesting that informal firms only 
formalize their operations when they are forced to do so.xvi  Another recent paper on Brazil argues that increasing 
enforcement reduces informality—but also weakens overall welfare in the economy.xvii  
• In Benin, statistically significant effects were reported for interventions focused on providing in-person 
informational visits and advisors to help with paperwork; offering business training and help opening a business 
bank account; and a complete package that included all these benefits plus tax mediation services. The complete 
package increased registration by 16.3 percentage points.xviii
   
• In Bangladesh, researchers provided informal small and medium enterprises with detailed, easy to understand 
information about how to register. The researchers also explained potential legal and economic benefits of 
formalizing, such as improved access to bank loans; stronger ownership rights and social status; and limited 
liabilities. The intervention coincided with regulatory reforms that dramatically reduced the time, complexity, 
and hidden costs of registering. But the intervention had no impact on formalization.xix
• Policy reforms such as reducing registration times, simplifying registration procedures, and lowering costs have 
generally had modest impacts, if any (see section 3 of this paper for detailed country examples.)xx 
Although informality can have negative economic consequences, these findings raise questions about whether 
governments should make business formalization an explicit policy goal. In the studies cited above, the registration 
of informal companies has generally had limited impact on the companies' growth and profitability. Formalization 
campaigns sometimes carry prohibitive costs for governments. In Benin, for example, formalization cost between 
US$1,200–$2,200 per firm, and registration had no significant impact on sales, profits, or credit access, or on the 
living standards of firm owners. Even if post-formalization tax compliance were 100 percent, the authors estimate 
that it would take a decade or more worth of tax revenues to recoup those costs. While bringing small enterprises 
into the tax net might appeal to policymakers, it is important to remember that taxing informal firms can also have 
adverse consequences. Recent research suggests that increased tax enforcement in Brazil leads to large productivity 
gains but hurts informal firms’ owners and workers.xxi Enforcement strategies targeted at large firms and wealthy 
individuals might produce higher returns given estimated evasion and avoidance rates,xxii while improving equity and 
with limited production distortions.xxiiiLeveraging Digital Financial Solutions191.4.2 Firms are reluctant to formalize because the costs might outweigh the benefits
One reason why efforts to persuade firms to formalize their operations 
haven't been very successful is that firm owners seem to think the costs of 
registering—including having to pay taxes—outweigh the benefits. Many 
firm owners also appear doubtful that formalization will address their 
problems, the most common of which, according to survey evidence, is lack 
of financing. Since informal firms tend to be less efficient and competitive, it 
is not clear that they could survive or thrive in the formal economy.
Most informal firms tend to stay informal throughout their existence, and 
rarely grow or improve over time. Pushing them to register might put excessive pressure on them and ultimately 
drive them out of business. And even though the underground economy can generate problems for governments, it 
isn't clear that curbing informal economic activity is important for macroeconomic progress. The informal economy 
tends to shrink slowly over time, suggesting that formalization might be something that happens in tandem with 
development, instead of serving as a precondition for development.xxiv
1.5  Digital financial services might enable formal business registration – but 
more research is needed
Widespread access to mobile phones and the internet is making the use of digital financial services more accessible 
than ever, even for small, informal businesses. The adoption of digital financial tools, in turn, can make it easier for 
such firms to register and operate in the formal economy. Digital sales are easier to track than cash sales. Digital 
payments make it easier for businesses to pay taxes. And electronic payroll technology can support formalization of 
labor arrangements between employers and employees. In the case of India, formalization efforts start with a firm 
establishing its digital identity with the government and simultaneously adopting digital payment tools to increase 
efficiency and transparency in both its public and private sector transactions. (See next section for more details.)
At the same time, the use of digital payment systems can help informal firms begin to establish a credit history, potentially 
opening the door to formal financing. Data generated from digital transactions and payments increasingly are being 
used to calculate credit scores, sometimes in combination with other sources of non-traditional data such as information 
gleaned from social media. Such data enable potential borrowers (whether individuals or firms) to begin to develop 
"reputation collateral," and even credit or risk scores, based on financial behaviors, such as timely payment of utility bills or 
consistent receipt of remittances or income, before they have received any loans from formal financial institutions. 
Digital forms of identification can also help people qualify for financial services. Customer due diligence and know your 
customer (KYC) regulations typically require banks to collect government documentation such as a birth certificate 
or other national identification documents. For very small transaction amounts, there can be tiered or proportionate 
KYC where no documentation is needed, to help facilitate access to finance for marginalized populations.
While digital tools might make it easier for informal firms to join the formal economy, firm owners are likely to consider 
other factors involved in formalization, including the need to pay taxes and follow laws and regulations. Further 
research is needed to better understand how financial inclusion, especially via digital finance, can contribute to or 
accelerate steps toward formalization in other areas beyond registration, including tax payments and compliance 
with labor, health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. More research is also needed on the impact that 
greater formalization of a country’s underground economy would have on economic growth, poverty reduction, and 
wellbeing, as well as the role and limitations of government policies in driving this trend. One reason why efforts to persuade 
firms to formalize their operations 
haven't been very successful is that 
firm owners seem to think the costs 
of registering—including having to 
pay taxes—outweigh the benefits. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions202. Can digital financial 
services encourage 
formalization?
This section reviews research on how formal financial products have helped firms expand their businesses. Drawing 
on Global Findex data, it measures the number of informal firm owners who make digital payments, use savings 
products, and borrow money. The section also measures informal firm owners' access to mobile phones and the 
internet – digital technologies that can facilitate both access to financial services and compliance with formal 
business requirements. It is our hope that policymakers can use this data to inform programs aimed at increasing 
formalization by leveraging digital financial services.
2.1  How informal firms use financial services and digital technology
Below, we present findings from several studies which highlight the ways formal financial services can benefit 
entrepreneurs. We do not suggest that formal business registration would automatically allow firms to get these 
benefits. Nor do we argue that formalization is a precondition for receiving these benefits, or that financial services 
always have positive results. Rather, we simply seek to demonstrate to policymakers that facilitating access to 
affordable, fair, and transparent financial services can be good for development – regardless of any connection to 
informality.
2.1.1 Digital payments
Financial services have several benefits for entrepreneurs whether 
they work in the formal or informal economy. Digital payments can 
raise profits by lowering the costs of transacting with customers, 
suppliers, and government officials. In Bangladesh, researchers 
studied the impact of digitizing wage payments at two garment 
factories in the capital Dhaka. They found that the factories cut wage-distribution costs in half by switching from cash 
to direct deposit. Electronic payments removed the need to bring in cash-filled trucks and eliminated the attendant 
costs of hiring guards and halting production in order to manually distribute wages to workers.xxv Similarly, a study in 
Afghanistan found that the use of digital payrolls resulted in cost savings by increasing the security of transactions.xxvi   
Researchers have also found that the digitized payroll system benefited workers. At the two Bangladesh factories, 
salaried workers were randomly assigned to receive their monthly wages electronically or to continue to receive them 
in cash. The workers were observed for two years. Workers who received payments directly into a bank account were 
significantly more likely to have non-zero account balances and to shift funds that were previously stored informally 
into accounts at formal financial institutions. Furthermore, workers who were provided with mobile money or bank 
accounts were less likely to have insufficient resources and were better able to respond to income shocks. Digital payments can raise profits 
by lowering the costs of transacting 
with customers, suppliers, and 
government officials. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions212.1.2 Mobile money
A recent study from Kenya argues that entrepreneurs benefit from 
mobile money's higher efficiency and security relative to cash. 
Noting that crime is a major problem for entrepreneurs in Kenya, the 
authors argue that mobile money significantly reduces theft. At the 
same time, mobile speeds up transactions between business owners 
and their suppliers. As a result, mobile money reduces output losses and increases creditworthiness, contributing to 
higher business growth and productivity. The authors estimate that mobile money can explain 10 percent of Kenya's 
per-capita income growth from 2007-2013, "thus pointing to quantitatively significant macroeconomic effects of 
mobile money technology through entrepreneurial finance." xxvii   
Other researchers studied mobile money's effects on poverty and gender in Kenya. The results suggest that the 
spread of mobile money helped spur business creation, with 185,000 women leaving agricultural employment for 
jobs in business or retail. The authors are unable to definitively explain the underlying impetus for the occupational 
change. But they speculate that it could have been a result of greater access to remittances, increased agency, or 
the alleviation of financial constraints due to increased use of mobile money. The authors contrast their findings 
with recent studies showing limited impacts of microcredit on women entrepreneurs. "For women, the route out of 
poverty might not be more capital, but rather financial inclusion at a more basic level, which enhances their ability 
to manage those financial resources that are already accessible," they write. The paper also found that mobile money 
helped reduce poverty while increasing consumption and savings.xxviii
2.1.3 Microcredit
Lack of financing is a well-known problem for small entrepreneurs 
– particularly in emerging countries. Recent studies suggest that 
microcredit can yield positive, if modest, business impacts. A review 
of seven randomized evaluations found that in five countries, credit 
access increased business activity, including business ownership, 
revenues, investments, and higher inventory and assets. However, 
profits increased significantly only in Morocco and India – and the gains mostly went to businesses that were already 
large and profitable.xxix  But microfinance studies have generally found weak impacts on welfare and gender outcomes.
2.1.4 Savings
Global Findex data suggests that adults are more likely to save 
than borrow for business – and some studies have suggested 
that small-scale entrepreneurs benefit from savings products. 
Researchers offered free savings accounts to self-employed 
people in rural Kenya. Women market vendors who signed up 
for the account increased their daily business investment by 60 
percent, equivalent to US$1.28 per day. They also increased their 
spending on personal goods and food.xxxEntrepreneurs benefit from mobile

percent.xxxi  A study in Ghana, Malawi, and Uganda found that village savings and loan associations helped member 
households open new businesses and keep short-term seasonal businesses open longer.xxxii  
2.1.5 Insurance
Insurance products can give entrepreneurs the confidence to 
increase investments in their business by reducing the risk of 
financial losses. Several recent papers have examined the impact 
of agricultural insurance on farmers' planting decisions. Farmers 
face constant business risks, including financial losses due to 
severe weather, crop failures, and fluctuations in market prices. These risks mean that farmers often choose to 
plant reliable but unprofitable crops. When farmers in Ghana received index insurance, they spent more money on 
fertilizer and labor, allowing them to cultivate more land.xxxiii  When Indian farmers received such insurance, they 
started planting riskier but more profitable crops.xxxiv In Kenya, households which adopted microinsurance were 
less likely to sell property or cut food consumption when faced with an economic emergency.xxxv  However, very 
few farmers buy index insurance without high subsidies, and the product has struggled to achieve commercial 
viability and widespread adoption.  
2.1.6 Digital financial services can help link firms with global value chains
Global value chains—production networks that span countries—
capture a major share of world trade but small firms in developing 
countries often struggle to link up with them. One reason is that 
small firms lack financing. Another hurdle is that the large firms 
which run supply chains increasingly want their suppliers to 
meet labor and environmental standards. These sustainability 
requirements can increase firm competitiveness and profitability 
but tend to impose costs on smaller suppliers.xxxvi Taking up digital 
financial services might help entrepreneurs land supplier contracts with large buyers, which increasingly see digital 
payroll as a corporate sustainability standard.
Sustainable global value chains also pose opportunities for would-be suppliers. The Better Than Cash Alliance 
recently surveyed dozens of major global retailers about how digitization figures into their supply chains. Their 
findings suggest that retailers see digital payments as key to increasing business efficiency and reducing costs. 
Given the benefits of digital payments for suppliers and their employees, retailers are pushing digitization as part of 
corporate social responsibility commitments. Small firms which adopt digital financial services might therefore be 
better positioned to become suppliers for these global firms.xxxvii
Suppliers in global value chains have benefited in other ways after adopting digital payment systems. As part of the 
Better Than Cash Alliance study, Gap Inc. said its supplier factories experienced a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction 
in employee attrition and turnover following adoption of digital payments, potentially due to increased employee 
satisfaction. In Kenya, Unilever suppliers used their digital transaction history to build creditworthiness and access 
working capital loans, helping them drive up sales by a fifth.When farmers in Ghana received 
index insurance, they spent more 
money on fertilizer and labor, 
allowing them to cultivate more 
land.

Financial education generally isn't effective when provided through 
classroom training on accounting concepts or numeracy. It can be 
more effective when linked to participants' real-world experiences. 
In the Dominican Republic, a microfinance institution taught 
clients practical tips for day to day business management, such as 
storing business and personal cash in different places. Participants 
who received the training were more likely to adopt the good business practices compared to a group which did not 
receive the training and another group which received old-fashioned financial education on accounting. Innovations 
for Poverty Action, a development research organization, is now testing a digital version of the same training. In 
Uganda, young people who received savings accounts in addition to financial education had higher business incomes 
years after the intervention.xxxviii 
    
2.2 Challenges to informal firm adoption of digital financial services and  
opportunities to encourage formalization
Policymakers are debating options for bringing informal firms into the formal financial system. These discussions 
might benefit from data on informal business owners' current access to financial services, digital technology, and 
identification. Such information can help policymakers understand the needs of informal business owners and 
identify potential ways to bring them into the formal system. For example, if informal business owners are found 
to have high access to mobile phones, then mobile-based solutions might be worth considering. This section brings 
together such data from the 2017 Gallup World Poll and Global Findex database. 
2.2.1 Gateways to formalization and financial inclusion: 
Access to digital technology and national identification
Financial services increasingly are delivered through digital technology—such as the internet and mobile phones—
particularly in emerging countries. Digital technology also has the potential to speed up the process of business 
registration (Box 1). Access to digital technology is therefore a component of financial inclusion and formalization of 
the informal economy. Financial education generally 
isn't effective when provided 
through classroom training on 
accounting concepts or numeracy. 
It can be more effective when 
linked to participants' real-world 
experiences. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions24Box 1: Online business registration in Argentina
Argentina is among the many countries globally seeking to speed up business 
registration by using digital technology. According to the World Bank's Doing 
Business database, Argentina ranks 157 out of 190 countries in terms of starting 
a business, a variable that gauges the procedures, time, and costs required to 
launch and formally operate a commercial enterprise. A new law aims to reduce 
the registration time to 24 hours using an online portal launched in September 
2017. Besides signing up with the national tax authority to pay federal and local 
taxes, business owners can use the portal to enroll in electronic invoices, get a tax 
ID, open bank accounts, and adopt an electronic wallet for tax payments. Other 
regulations have mandated acceptance of debit card payments and made electronic 
invoicing available for all taxpayers starting in April 2019. The reforms are part 
of a broader government push to boost entrepreneurship and expand small and 
medium enterprises’ access to low-cost credit. The regulation currently applies to 
Buenos Aires city, the capital's namesake province, and Cordoba province, though 
the government plans to expand it to other parts of the country.xxxix Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions25Globally, 42 percent of informal business owners have access to the internet – whether through a smartphone, 
internet café, personal computer, or some other device. In developing countries, that number is 35 percent. Among 
our representative countries, internet access among informal business owners ranges from 12 percent in India to 71 
percent in Argentina (Figure 8).   
Ownership of mobile phones tends to be more widespread than internet access. Globally, and in developing countries, 
nearly 80 percent of informal business owners have a mobile phone. Mobile phone ownership is practically universal 
for informal business owners in countries such as China and Kenya (Figure 9).

a prerequisite for accessing financial services or social benefits, 
participating in elections, and registering businesses or property. 
Reducing the number of people without ID can facilitate formalization 
and development more generally (see Box 2 below). New Global Findex 
data collected in collaboration with the World Bank's Identification 
for Development (ID4D) team is encouraging. It shows that globally 
and in developing countries, nearly 9 in 10 informal business owners 
have government-issued ID. The numbers are even higher in our 
sample of representative countries, including in Argentina, China, 
Colombia, and India (Figure 10).In many countries, having

in India
In 2014, India launched a policy to equip citizens with biometric identification 
numbers. Since then, roughly 1.2 billion people have received official ID.  The 
government reports that nearly 50 million micro-, small-, and medium- enterprises 
have registered online using a biometric ID number.xl This policy has helped increase 
financial inclusion. As of 2017, 80 percent of Indian adults have an account, up 
from 53 percent in 2014, according to the Global Findex. The policy has faced 
challenges due to privacy concerns and the potential for misuse of the identification 
data. Still, policy-makers looking to reduce the size of the informal economy might 
consider expanding access to digital identification and simplified online registration.   
2.2.2 Use of accounts, payments, savings, and credit among informal business owners
The most basic measure of financial inclusion is ownership of an 
account – whether a mobile money account, or an account at a 
bank or other formal financial institution. As of 2017, roughly half 
of informal business owners globally and in developing countries 
have an account (Figure 11). Among our representative countries, the 
share ranges from 37 percent in Pakistan to more than 80 percent 
each in India and Kenya.The most basic measure of

This variable also captures the receipt of digital wage payments, 
government social benefits, or payments for agricultural sales. In 
developing countries, roughly 1 in 3 informal business owners make 
or receive digital payments. The number is considerably higher in 
China, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, and especially Kenya, where about 84 percent of informal business owners make 
such payments (Figure 12).  Globally, about 4 in 10 informal 
business owners make or receive 
digital payments through a bank

African countries with strong mobile money penetration. In Kenya, for example, 78 percent of informal business 
owners make such payments, as do roughly half in Tanzania and Zimbabwe (Figure 13).
Card-based payments often predominate in countries where mobile money is uncommon or non-existent. In 
Argentina, 32 percent of informal business owners use a debit or credit card, while 21 percent do in China (Figure 14).

business owners report saving any money in the past year. Savings 
rates vary considerably among our representative countries (Figure 
15). In Kenya, about three-quarters of informal business owners save, 
compared to only one-third in Argentina. Most informal business 
owners save outside the formal financial system, using methods 
such as stuffing cash under a mattress or buying livestock. Two 
exceptions are China and India, where informal business owners are 
more inclined to use formal savings methods.      
The share of business owners who report borrowing money in the past year is roughly 50 percent globally and in 
developing countries. The number is much higher in Kenya, where it is 70 percent (Figure 16). Digital technology is 
changing the way business owners access financing. Mobile money-based credit products have emerged in some 
countries, with mixed results (Box 3). The internet has also opened the way to creative methods for raising funds 
(Box 4). But borrowing from sources other than a bank—including informal lenders and family and friends— still 
predominates among informal business owners who report borrowing. Argentina and Colombia are the only 
representative countries where most of these borrowers use formal credit sources.

digital credit for entrepreneurs
Mobile money has made it easier for entrepreneurs to access digital credit—
lending that involves limited inperson contact and leverages digital infrastructure.xli 
In Kenya and Tanzania—two  of the world's mobile money hubs—all it takes is a few 
text messages to access small, short-term loans. Recent research by CGAP suggests 
that these digital credit services pose threats as well as opportunities. In Kenya – 
home of the world's first digital credit service – roughly a quarter of adults have 
taken out a digital loan. Entrepreneurs are among the beneficiaries: 37 percent of 
digital credit users report borrowing for short-term business needs (working capital), 
making this one of the two most frequently-cited borrowing purposes. Yet there are 
signs that some digital credit users have been drawn into dangerous debt. Roughly 
half of borrowers have missed at least one loan payment, while at least 13 percent 
say they defaulted on a loan. Business underperformance and income losses are the 
two main reasons for late repayment.xlii To cover borrowing costs, half of borrowers 
report tapping into savings, a fifth report reducing food expenditures, and 1 in 6 Figure 16: Borrowing among informal business owners

percent of digital credit users are self-employed. Overall, roughly a third of borrowers 
(and less than 40 percent of self-employed borrowers) use their loans for business 
needs. More than half of all borrowers have missed a payment, while nearly 1 in 3 
have defaulted. A lack of transparency has created risks for borrowers. In Tanzania, 
CGAP reports, "Just over a quarter of digital borrowers report that they were 
charged fees they didn't expect, that they did not fully understand the costs associated 
with a loan, or that a lender unexpectedly withdrew money from their account."xliii 
These findings suggest that digital credit can pose risks to consumers – especially 
if there are no vigorous consumer protections. Steps are also needed to ensure that 
women have equal opportunities to benefit from financial innovations. In both Kenya 
and Tanzania, men make up the majority of digital credit users.
Box 4: China: Raising SME financing through internet-based 
crowdfunding
It is notoriously difficult for SMEs to get loans from traditional banks – but digital 
technology has given rise to new financing models. China's first internet equity-based 
crowdfunding website was launched in 2011. Within a few years, the number of 
platforms exceeded 300, raising a total of almost US $101.7 billion in 2015.xliv  Most 
of the funding has gone to risky, innovative technical projects which were searching for 
startup funding. At first, these platforms were predominantly used by small businesses 
to raise small investments from a wide body of investors that included the public. 
More recently, the government has enacted regulations that limit the total number 
of investors, exclude the public from participating, and establish high investment 
minimums. A World Bank Group study finds that internet crowdfunding has the 
potential to alleviate funding constraints faced by small businesses in China, though 
regulatory uncertainty persists.xlv  Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions332.2.3 Account ownership among informal business owners varies by gender and income

2.2.4 Use of digital payments by consumers
Digital retail payments are an important financial service for merchants. Naturally, a merchant's decision to adopt 
digital payments depends on the number of his or her customers using digital systems. Globally, the number of adults 
using digital payments varies. In high-income countries, 87 percent of adults on average have a debit or credit card, 
and 78 percent used a plastic card to make a payment in the past year. The share is lower in developing countries, 
where only 31 percent report having a card and only 16 percent made a payment with a card. The ownership of plastic 
cards ranges from a high of 60 percent in China and 52 percent in Argentina, to a low of 17 percent in Tanzania and 10 
percent in Pakistan. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions34Figure 18: The huge potential for mobile payments in developing countries

made a payment using their mobile, only 7 percent of adults in Pakistan did so. However, the data in Figure 18 shows 
that large shares of adults are in a position to adopt digital payments. In India, nearly 70 percent of adults have a 
mobile phone, while only about 5 percent use a mobile phone or the internet to make a payment. Yet it is important 
to remember that any expansion of digital merchant payments should be accompanied by adequate regulations and 
protections for consumers. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions353. Barriers to formality 
and country experiences 
addressing such barriers
This section documents some of the key barriers, especially taxation, that prevent companies from formally registering 
their business operations. It explores the ways that digital technologies, such as electronic business registration, and 
digital financial services, such as digital tax payment systems, can help nudge underground firms toward the formal 
economy.
3.1 Taxation is the biggest barrier to formal registration 
As section 2 of this paper notes, our analysis suggests that well-
developed taxation systems are associated with higher formal 
business registration rates. This finding is consistent with academic 
research. Schneider and Williams examined the main drivers of the 
informal economy across various regions and countries from 1989 to 
2012.xlvi Their analysis suggests that the main reason people stay in the informal economy is to avoid paying taxes 
and social security. Informality is also shaped by public trust in the taxation system, quality of institutions, and state 
regulations (Table 1). Over the period examined, some nations that embraced tax reforms and other initiatives that 
increased incentives for business owners to register their companies saw a significant decrease in informal economic 
activity. This, along with extensive academic literature and economic analysis in a range of country settings, suggests 
that reforms aimed at addressing the non-financial factors that discourage businesses from registering can have a 
considerable impact on decreasing informal economic activity.The main reason people stay in 
the informal economy is to avoid 
paying taxes and social security.

the use of such tools can help 
governments remedy institutional 
weaknesses, which contribute 
to informality in developing 
countries. 
After Guatemala introduced 
e-registration in 1999, business 
registration jumped by 40 
percent. Similar reforms in Jordan 
(1997) and Sri Lanka (2001) had 
modest positive impacts on new 
business registrations.3.2 Digital financial services and technology can facilitate formalization
Digital technology can make it easier for firms to comply with 
tax requirements and other regulations. At the same time, the 
use of such tools can help governments remedy institutional 
weaknesses, which contribute to informality in developing 
countries. As Loeprick describes, the use of mobile phone-based 
banking systems allows businesses to pay taxes and fees while 
substantially reducing the number of physical interactions with tax 
officials (occasions that create opportunities for demanding bribes 
or other forms of corruption) and ensuring better recordkeeping 
and proper tax collection.xlvii According to McKinsey, governments in emerging markets could save approximately US 
$110 billion annually by utilizing digital services for tax and government-to-person payments.xlviii The use of digital 
services in these cases could significantly reduce leakage in expenditure and tax collection due to corruption, and 
could potentially boost tax revenues by increasing the number of businesses joining the formal sector.xlix 
Middle and high-income countries have sought to use digital tools such as electronic business registration, tax 
payments, and tax invoicing to encourage formalization. Others have simply tried to change their tax laws. Below, 
we review some of these cases.
3.2.1 Electronic business registration 
Electronic business registration systems can improve a country's 
business environment and encourage businesses to register by 
reducing red tape and improving regulatory capabilities.l After 
Guatemala introduced e-registration in 1999, business registration 
jumped by 40 percent. Similar reforms in Jordan (1997) and Sri Lanka 
(2001) had modest positive impacts on new business registrations. 
World Bank Doing Business data demonstrate a modest positive 
relationship between the implementation of electronic registration systems and business incorporation (Figure 19). 
Still, developing countries are less likely than wealthier countries to have electronic registration systems. Klapper et 
al. (2013) found that nearly 90 percent of industrialized countries had e-registration services compared to a global 
rate of approximately 70 percent and a regional rate for Latin America and the Caribbean of about 54 percent.Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions37Reducing judicial involvement in registration decisions might help 
increase firm registration in places with weak public confidence in 
courts. Serbia introduced an electronic business registry in 2005 
as part of reforms that transferred responsibility for business 
registration from the judiciary to a new administrative agency. 
Previously, judges were responsible for approving registration 
applications. The process was discretionary and created 
opportunities for registration decisions to get stuck in various 
legal bottlenecks. After the reform, registration decisions were 
made by a new office called the Serbian Business Registers Agency. 
Minimum capital requirements for LLCs were lowered, and 
registration rules were made more flexible. In the years following the reform, the number of new businesses increased 
by up to 34 percent. In regions where distrust in courts was high, the increase was even greater. The researchers also 
found positive impacts on firm survival, but did not find evidence that the reform impacted the number of employees 
at new firms or employment growth rates.liFigure 19: New business incorporation and electronic business registration

When Costa Rica mandated large taxpayers to file and pay their taxes electronically in 2002–2003, the government 
introduced a digital tax management system that includes simplified tax return filing requirements and an electronic 
payment option for person-to-government obligations. Further advances, including the acceptance of digital 
signatures in 2006 and the launch of the National System of Electronic Payments (Sinpe) in 2013, reduced the amount 
of time it takes businesses to comply with tax regulations. In the decade after 2005, the total required time reported 
by businesses dropped by more than 62 percent to an average of 151 hours , while the number of tax payments they 
were required to make also decreased (Figure 20). lii

Implementing compulsory electronic tax invoicing (ETI) regimes 
can increase transparency and expand a country's tax base. But 
businesses may attempt to limit their paper trail or withdraw 
their formal registration if policy changes are ill received and 
enforcement mechanisms are weak, according to Lee.liii The 
Republic of Korea offers an example of how electronic tax 
invoicing systems can help to bolster tax collection. Since the 
late 1970s, the Republic of Korea has become increasingly reliant 
on its value-added tax (VAT) for revenues, which accounted for 
29 percent of tax revenue in 2013. In 1997, South Korean officials 
rolled out an optional ETI system, which became compulsory in 
2008. Officials in the finance ministry and tax agency coordinated 
enforcement efforts and used the electronic tax invoicing system to monitor compliance in real time. As a result of 
beefed up enforcement, the ETI adoption rate reached 99.8 percent in the first year that adoption was compulsory, 
compared to only 15 percent under the optional ETI regime. Uruguay has also introduced tax incentives and policies 
aimed at moving cash transactions into formal financial accounts, thereby contributing to the formalization of the 
economy (Box 5). In 1997, South Korean officials rolled 
out an optional Electronic Tax 
Invoicing system, which became 
compulsory in 2008.

Uruguayliv
Although the benefits of electronic payments are well-documented, several barriers 
can reduce use of electronic payment systems. These include economic factors, 
such as the cost of use and the value provided to merchants, the financial risks of 
adopting digital payment technology, and difficulty persuading customers, especially 
low-income adults and those excluded from the formal financial sector, to use the 
system.  Digitizing payments can address the institutional weaknesses that contribute 
to the existence of an informal economy, and can have a positive, if modest, impact in 
nudging firms toward formalizing their businesses.
Uruguay's 2014 financial inclusion law has made it mandatory to conduct a wide range 
of transactions through digital channels, including the payment of wages, salaries, and 
fees for professional services; pension payments; social welfare payments; and tax 
payments. At the same time, the government has taken steps to lower the costs for 
businesses adopting digital payment systems and to improve ease of use to encourage 
consumers to spend directly and digitally from their accounts. Measures include 
subsidizing the cost of adopting point-of-sale facilities for small businesses, slashing 
fees for digital payments, expanding interoperability among different brands, types, 
and networks of payments, lowering tax-withholding requirements for electronic 
sales made by small businesses, and reducing ATM fees. Consumers benefit from a 
VAT reduction for digital retail purchases as well as for utility bills that are paid 
digitally—a policy that can lead to more consumers to demand that merchants accept 
digital payments. 
Early results suggest that the number of formal financial transactions has increased, 
and that the country’s financial infrastructure has expanded. From 2014–2017, the 
volume of interbank transfers grew sevenfold and that of debit card transactions more 
than doubled; the number of point-of-sale (POS) terminals increased from 30,000 to 
more than 52,000; and the number of ATMs nearly doubled, to 2,200 (Figure 21). 
These reforms have only been in effect for a few years, and further research is needed 
to study if they will help increase formal business registration or employment. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions41Figure 21: Debit card transactions in Uruguay
Source: BCU, Retail Payment System. Informative Report 16, 2017.Although digital transactions have increased in Uruguay, ongoing research using 
firm-level tax data show that there has been a negligible increase in tax revenue. A 
comparison of retail and wholesale firms (using multiple methodologies) before and 
after the 2014 financial inclusion reform estimates a zero effect on VAT liabilities. 
Even among small firms, an effect is hard to detect. This may be because firms that 
have card machines process only about 30 percent of their sales through electronic 
payment methods, so that even a large increase in electronic sales does not create a 
binding constraint requiring firms to declare higher tax liabilities.lvLeveraging Digital Financial Solutions423.2.4 Electronic payroll technology
Electronic payroll technology can encourage formalization of business operations by creating digital records of 
employment relationships. In 2007, Peru rolled out an e-payroll system that requires firms with more than two 
employees to submit monthly reports to the tax authority on their workers, pensioners, and service providers. 
This has allowed e-payroll data to be cross-verified between labor regulators and tax authorities, which in turn has 
strengthened regulatory capacity and helped increase formal employment. The ILO estimates that after accounting 
for the role of growth in reducing informal economic activity, the government's e-payroll policy led to the registration 
of more than 275,000 new formal jobs.lvi Meanwhile, the overall number of registered workers increased to more 
than 2.7 million in 2011 from only 1 million at the turn of the century. Despite these encouraging metrics, progress 
among micro and small enterprises has been limited, and, as of 2011, the e-payroll system only covers 7 percent of 
small and medium enterprises in the country.
An analysis by Ernst & Young in 2017 found that the impact of electronic wage payment systems on reducing informal 
economic activity was highly country-specific and varied based on the share of cash and cashless transactions, 
tax regimes and overall size of the shadow economy.lvii Ultimately, regulations mandating the electronic payment 
of unemployment benefits were estimated to reduce the size of the passive shadow economy by 0.002-0.013 
percent of GDP , compared to more effective reforms, such as electronic payment of wages (0.02-0.28 percent), and 
POS terminal requirements, which are estimated to reduce informal economic activity by 0.26 percent of GDP in 
Bulgaria up to 1.14 percent in the Czech Republic (Figure 23). Furthermore, mandating thresholds for consumer cash 
payments and POS terminal requirements were found to significantly increase government revenue from both VAT 
and corporate income taxes. Figure 22: Peru: Registered employment, 1996-2011

Governments have tried reforming tax laws to reduce informal 
economic activity. Some of these efforts have involved the use of 
digital tools, while others have not. In Costa Rica, Brockmeyer 
and Hernandez show that a firm’s reported tax liability increases 
sharply in the month in which the firm uses a debit/credit card machine for the first time. In addition, an increase in 
the tax withholding rate (applied by card processing companies) show that withholding increases tax compliance, 
particularly among small firms. Perry et al. discuss the use of tax reforms in conjunction with modern audit systems 
and other electronic services to reduce informal economic activity in Spain and Chile.lviii  The report suggests that 
strengthened oversight and enforcement efforts are more effective than standalone reforms aimed at easing 
administrative costs. In Spain, measures aimed at preventing tax evasion included cross-referencing business 
registration data with other databases and criminalizing specific tax offenses; these initiatives were central to the 
near doubling of the country’s tax revenue to GDP ratio in the 1970s and 1980s. Similarly, in Chile, the use of digital 
auditing systems, together with consistent imposition of penalties for non-compliance, increased both oversight 
capabilities and tax collection and compliance rates.
Governments have had mixed success using only tax reforms to try and curb the shadow economy. The Brazilian 
government in 1996 adopted a streamlined tax regime for microenterprises with a maximum of five paid employees. 
The objective was to promote small, unskilled firms by facilitating formalization and fostering competitiveness. The 
program was known as Simples Nacional. As detailed in Elk and Kok,lix the SIMPLES program introduced a simplified 
tax system along with reduced tax rates and social contribution requirements and was accompanied by an extensive 
information campaign particularly targeted at urban populations. 
Previously, businesses would often be required to register with multiple agencies at different levels of government, a 
burdensome policy that inhibited economic formalization. The reforms allowed many small and micro businesses to 
pay a single monthly contribution based on a percentage of their revenue.  
Survey data from 1997 found that formalization rates among microenterprises established immediately following 
the implementation of SIMPLES were markedly higher than those founded immediately prior. This suggests that the 
program encouraged businesses to register with authorities at the time of founding. Critically, findings documented 
by Fajnzylber and Maloney, and Elk and Kok suggest that microenterprises that registered at the time of founding 
tended to maintain a fixed presence in an area, which in turn, can promote firm growth.lx  However, formal registration 
was not associated with a meaningful increase in the companies’ access to external capital.Governments have had mixed 
success using only tax reforms to 
try and curb the shadow economy. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions44Besides increasing licensing between 7 .1 percent and 11.6 percent, statistics suggest that the SIMPLES program also 
bolstered tax payments by 3–5 percent, with these and similar positive effects more significant for firms with paid 
employees. And formal firms were found to have revenues and profits that were 55–57 percent higher and 45–49 
percent higher, respectively, than firms operating in the informal sector. However, more recent analysis of the 
SIMPLES program by Piza, who sought to reconcile conflicting empirical studies, found little evidence that the 
program had a large impact on formalization rates.lxi  The inconclusive results of the program’s impact should cause 
policymakers to reconsider simplifying tax systems as a standalone reform. In Georgia, a simplified tax system aimed 
at microenterprises increased small-firm registration by 27 percent to 41 percent in the first year, but there was no 
increase in the following years. The researchers found evidence that the system was abused. Small taxpayers reduced 
their tax compliance for several years after the reform, and microenterprises did so during the reform's first year.lxii    Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions454. Policy considerations and 
conclusions 
Although most efforts to formalize firms have had modest 
impacts, reducing the size of the informal economy could prove 
beneficial on several levels. For firms, formalization could bring 
profitable new business relationships, including with supply chain 
leaders. Formalization might also help improve firm performance 
and access to financial services. Wider use of digital technology for 
formal financial transactions could provide governments access to new tax revenues. 
Strengthening formalization does not need to come at the expense of jobs. Some research suggests that cracking 
down on the informal economy does not increase unemployment  and might instead increase wages, output, and 
welfare by moving workers into better jobs in the formal sector.lxiii  More generally, promoting entrepreneurship can 
create new jobs, especially during economic downturns,lxiv  and have a positive impact on economic growth.lxv   
There are reasons to believe that digital financial services accessed through mobile phones and the internet could 
accelerate and lower the costs of formalization. Use of digital financial services for business transactions – including 
retail sales and wage payments – may also increase transparency and registration of economic activity. Digital 
technology can speed up the process of formalization by facilitating online registration. Online tax and fee payments 
have the potential to improve ease of compliance as well. Therefore, adoption of digital financial services is a step 
on the road to formality. Digital financial services offer firms and individuals access to economic opportunities, such 
as access to new markets and alternative data to gauge creditworthiness. But the benefits of formalization are not 
automatic. Researchers in Malawi found that business registration improved firm performance and access to bank 
accounts – but only when coupled with 20-hour information sessions explaining financial services and how they can 
be used for business purposes.lxvi  
However, pushing firms to formalize can have negative economic 
consequences. As was discussed in the research on Benin, 
the cost of enforcing compliance with tax policies and other 
business regulations far exceeded the immediate benefits for 
the government and presumably also for the microenterprises that were reluctant to formalize. Aggressively 
trying to reduce informality could put small, marginal firms out of business. In the absence of robust safety nets 
or opportunities for formal employment, people affected could end up worse off.  There are added downsides to 
using the financial system to compel formalization. If informal firms believe that using formal financial services will 
increase their tax burden, for example, they may opt out of the formal financial system, thereby reducing financial 
inclusion. It makes sense for policymakers to promote financial inclusion in order to facilitate development goals 
such as gender empowerment, food security, and ability to manage economic shocks. However, there is probably 
less benefit in explicitly pairing financial inclusion to formalization compliance in areas such as taxes, at least for low 
income individuals and microenterprises. There are reasons to believe that 
digital financial services accessed 
through mobile phones and the 
internet could accelerate and lower 
the costs of formalization. 
However, pushing firms to formalize 
can have negative economic 
consequences. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions46In light of the above, governments are exploring the possibility of harnessing digital financial inclusion as part of 
broader programs to reduce informality. This section outlines questions for policymakers to consider as they grapple 
with these issues. 
- Who may be excluded from the digital economy as formalization and digital financial inclusion 
efforts proceed?
Not everyone will benefit from government efforts to 
promote digital financial services and formalization. For 
example, some firms and individuals might not have access 
to the technology needed to access digital financial services. 
Some communities—such as immigrants—might lack the 
legal status or documentation to use accounts, savings, or 
digital payments. In many developing countries, most firms 
and business activities, including through self-employment, 
remain informal, and transactions are largely made in cash, 
even where formal financial options exist and mobile phones and other technology that could facilitate access 
to digital financial services are ubiquitous. As policymakers seek to promote financial inclusion and business 
formalization, they should ensure that disadvantaged populations are not excluded from the digital economy. 
Groups that merit special attention include women, rural populations, migrants, the least educated, the poor, 
and disabled people. 
A review of the literature and country experiences shows the importance of recognizing that different market 
segments, such as farmers, microenterprises, and SMEs, need different policy approaches. As discussed in the paper, it 
is important to tailor policy responses to the realities and needs of different population groups and different economic 
contexts. For instance, incentives to formalize and access digital financial services might be most attractive to firms 
that aspire to increase customers and foreign sales, hire more workers, purchase property, or access formal pensions 
or bank credit. Moreover, recent research in Malawi suggests that even firms that could benefit from formalization 
might need additional information and training about how to access the benefits of being formally registered.
- Is infrastructure available to maximize the benefits of digital financial services for businesses that 
join the formal economy?
Policymakers need to ensure that the needed infrastructure is present to make formalization and digital financial 
inclusion more appealing for firms than if they were to remain in the informal economy.  When individuals or firms 
perceive greater benefit from formalizing, such as gaining access to financial services, they are more likely to decide 
to emerge from the shadow economy. Likewise, shifting from cash to digital financial services is only attractive if 
options for making electronic transactions are widely available and cheaper than the alternatives. Governments 
can help by investing in systems that simplify business registration and fee payments; building financial systems 
infrastructure; and incentivizing investments by the private sector through subsidies or tax breaks. Fair competition 
policies, interoperability of payments systems, and consumer protections are also key components of a vibrant 
digital financial infrastructure. Other policies, such as the establishment of a national digital identification system, 
can help to reduce costs of moving to the formal economy for all stakeholders, including consumers, financial service 
providers, and governments. It might also be important to invest in programs to educate small business owners on 
how they can use financial services.As policymakers seek to promote 
financial inclusion and business 
formalization, they should ensure 
that disadvantaged populations 
are not excluded from the digital 
economy. Groups that merit special 
attention include women, rural 
populations, migrants, the least 
educated, the poor, and disabled 
people. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions47 
- Where is new research needed? 
Analysis on how digital financial services can impact formalization 
decisions has up to now largely been based on limited or anecdotal 
evidence, and much more data collection and research on the topic 
is needed. Using a proxy for informality based on self-employment 
or a firm size of no more than two employees, the analysis in this 
paper shows significant variation both in levels of informality and 
in use of digital finance across countries. Unfortunately, the data 
do not allow for direct analysis of how access to formal financial 
services, and especially digital financial services, impacts formalization. 
Further research is needed to understand links between digital financial services and aspects of business 
formalization. For example, tax morale—people's attitudes toward paying taxes—has been shown to significantly 
influence business owners' decision to remain in the informal economy. One contributing factor to poor tax morale 
is a lack of confidence in the tax system, which is related to a lack of transparency. Future research could explore 
whether digital financial services promote greater transparency and fairness in tax collection, and thereby help to 
boost tax morale. It would also be worth probing any relationships between digital financial inclusion and business 
registration and compliance with regulations on labor, health, safety, and environmental protection.  
- What are the most promising ways forward?
The paper briefly describes research on efforts to increase formalization through policies and programs that directly 
target informality, including through tax policy, enforcement and business registration. The evidence indicates that 
reducing informality through more narrowly defined approaches, such as streamlining business registration or 
simplifying the tax code, often results in only small changes. For larger firms which are far above the subsistence 
levels, a few factors have stood out in their considerations on whether to formalize operations: 
• Quality of enforcement/institutional strength: In several examples included in this paper, the quality of 
enforcement was critical in reducing informality. When South Korea introduced optional electronic tax invoicing, 
adoption and compliance was only 15 percent – but that number rose to 99.8 percent when the policy became 
compulsory.
• Creating incentives: In Uruguay, the 2014 financial inclusion law created tax incentives to encourage use of 
digital payments for both firms (lowered tax withholding) and consumers (VAT reduction). In the years since the 
law was enacted, formal transactions have increased 7-fold and digital payment infrastructure (ATMs, point-of-
sale terminals) has expanded to keep up with demand. 
Ultimately, the relationship between formalization of small firms and digital financial services remains unclear. 
But the analysis in this paper suggests that fair, efficient taxation systems, combined with widespread access to 
affordable and transparent financial services, can help countries nurture formal entrepreneurship. Further research is needed to 
understand links between digital 
financial services and aspects 
of business formalization. For 
example, tax morale—people's 
attitudes toward paying taxes—
has been shown to significantly 
influence business owners' decision 
to remain in the informal economy. Leveraging Digital Financial Solutions48i International Labour Conference, Recommendation 204, "Recommendation Concerning the
