Annex 1: Methodology and List of Interviewees 21CONTENTS1When Dickson Marira of Wonderkid Ltd. visited the 
home of a water utility customer in West Africa, he saw 
a pile of unpaid water bills held down by the corre-
sponding amount of cash. That family was willing and 
able to pay their bills, but they had no idea how or 
where to do so. It became immediately clear to Marira 
why the water utility was collecting only 6 percent of 
what it billed its customers every month: it was not 
communicating with its customers, and it was not offer -
ing them a convenient, secure channel to pay what 
they owed.
While this may be an extreme example, water and 
sanitation providers in emerging markets often strug-
gle to recoup their costs and become financially sus-
tainable. As a result, many low-income customers are 
at risk of losing access to safe water and sanitation 
at a time when countries worldwide have committed 
to universal access by 2030, under the Sustainable 
Development Goals. Costly inefficiencies in providers’ 
predominantly cash-based collection systems—of the 
kind witnessed by Marira—are a major contributor to 
their high operating costs. Cutting these costs is espe-
cially important because governments restrict utilities’ 
ability to increase prices to offset inefficiencies.
A growing number of water providers are experi-
menting with digital payments to reduce operational 
expenses and streamline service delivery. To better 
understand and document their experiences for other 
water providers in emerging markets who may be 
considering digital payments, CGAP and GSMA con-
ducted a literature review and interviewed 25 organi-
zations across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These 
organizations were a mix of urban utilities, small water 
enterprises, container toilet companies, and suppliers 
of hardware and software to the water and sanitation 
sector. Two-thirds were accepting digital payments or 
helping their clients to do so, motivated by four goals: 
cost savings, greater transparency, better security, and 
business model innovations.BENEFITS OF DIGITIZING PAYMENTS
• Digital payments reduce collection costs. Before 
digitization, the cost of cash collection ranged from 
3 to 20 percent of revenue collected. Digital pay-
ments reduced collection costs by 57–95 percent, 
with most of the savings stemming from reduced 
staff time and vendor commissions. In Haiti, eco-
logical sanitation provider SOIL decreased col-
lection costs from $1.10 to $0.05 by switching to 
mobile payments.
• Digital payments increase revenue and enable 
new business models. Revenues increased from 
15 to 37 percent for providers who reported data, 
driven by improved billing, increased efficiency, 
and a shift to prepaid models enabled by digital 
payments. Safe Water Network in Ghana went from 
a 30 percent net loss to 1 percent net surplus by 
introducing digital payments tied to prepaid ser -
vice.
• Digital payments also increase customer reach. 
Providers used cost savings and revenue growth to 
expand their businesses or lower the cost of their 
service. Container toilet company Loowatt did the 
latter in Madagascar, offering a 15 percent discount 
for customers that pay with mobile money.
Digitizing payments also have benefits beyond finan-
cial considerations: they create data trails that enable 
providers to offer a higher level of service and improve 
customers’ willingness to pay. They also facilitate the 
digitization of other business functions like billing, 
meter-reading, and customer service, all of which con-
tribute to greater efficiency.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYOBSTACLES TO DIGITIZING PAYMENTS
Respondents also reported the following obstacles to 
adopting digital payments: 
• Difficulty integrating mobile money provid-
ers. Some providers reported integrations taking 
months or even a year longer than expected. A 
growing number of mobile money operators are 
offering open APIs to streamline this process. 
• Too few mobile money users. Nascent digital 
payment ecosystems may lack the cash-in/cash-out 
(CICO) service points, robust use cases, and user-
friendly interfaces needed to attract sufficient num-
bers of digital payments users.
• Fees can deter customers. If regressively struc-
tured (e.g., flat fees on payments within a certain 
amount), mobile money transaction fees can make small-value payments prohibitively expensive com-
pared to cash, a deterrent to customers.
• Limited ability to analyze data. Providers often 
have difficulty obtaining accurate data on opera-
tions or revenue or may lack the analytical capacity 
to get the most out of the data. 
• Loss of jobs. Unfortunately, achieving cost savings 
in the water and sanitation sector often means elim-
inating staff positions. Reallocating staff to more 
efficient roles will make digitization more effective. 
Digitizing payments will not solve all the challenges 
facing water providers as they struggle to become 
sustainable. However, digitizing payments does 
deliver clear benefits when it is based on careful anal-
ysis and strategic decision making. Water providers in 
emerging markets should give serious consideration 
to going digital.2 • Testing the Waters3Despite a global commitment to achieving universal 
access to water and sanitation by 2030, we are on 
pace to fail (UN 2018). Today, 2.1 billion people do 
not have access to a safely managed source of drink-
ing water, and three out of every five people do not 
have access to safe sanitation facilities (WHO and 
UNICEF 2017). A key barrier to universal access is that 
water supply and sanitation (WSS) providers often 
lose money serving their current customers because 
tariffs are too low, nonrevenue water levels are high, 
and collection rates are poor. Before they can expand 
their services to poorer households, WSS providers 
need to adopt service models that allow them to cov-
er operational expenses while reaching low-income 
customers.
Digitizing payments in WSS can help to bring 
financial sustainability to these providers. It has 
the potential to reduce the cost of collections by 
eliminating cash handling, minimizing rent-seek-
ing, and reducing fraud, while also increasing rev-
enue through new, more efficient business models. 
CGAP and GSMA reached out to a subset of WSS 
providers to learn from their experiences in adopt-
ing digital payments. In this paper, we share practical 
experiences of adapting digital payments to WSS, 
highlight common challenges to digitization and 
successful approaches for overcoming them, and 
offer recommendations for WSS providers that want 
to digitize revenue collection.Our research found that digitizing payments in 
the water sector can have a positive impact on the 
financial sustainability of water service delivery mod-
els for low-income populations. Specifically, digital 
payments reduce operational expenses and enable 
more efficient service delivery. These general findings 
may come as little surprise to those familiar with the 
literature on digital finance.1 But WSS has unique char -
acteristics, including significant levels of nonpayment 
and serious impediments to raising prices, that make 
digital payments and digital payment-enabled innova-
tions such as pay-as-you-go (PAY-Go) water especially 
important to the sector.
Major barriers to integration and adoption have 
impeded large-scale implementation. Realizing the 
potential impact of digital payments and ensuing cus-
tomer data will require a greater emphasis on customer 
service and financial sustainability from WSS providers.
THE STATE OF GLOBAL ACCESS TO  
WATER AND SANITATION
Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 calls for univer -
sal access to safely managed water and sanitation by 
2030 (see Box 1). A baseline projection by the World 
Bank estimated that this would require an investment 
equivalent to 0.39 percent of global GDP—roughly INTRODUCTION
“Safely managed water” is water that comes from an improved source (e.g., piped water, standposts, 
borewells, protected dug wells, packaged, or delivered water), is available when needed, on premises, 
and is free of contamination (WHO and UNICEF 2017). 
An estimated 844 million people lack even a basic improved source of water that is within a 30-minute 
walk and free of contamination. 
More than 2 billion people use a drinking water source that has been faecally contaminated, and contam-
inated drinking water is estimated to cause half a million deaths every year (WHO 2018). 
“Safely managed sanitation” is an improved sanitation facility that is not shared and where excreta are 
disposed of on site or transported or treated off-site. Sixty-one percent of the world’s population lacks 
safely managed sanitation. (WHO and UNICEF 2017). BOX 1

three times the 0.12 percent that was spent annually 
from 2000 to 2015 (Hutton and Verghese 2016). 
These projections assume access will occur through a 
variety of channels, including those that are individu-
ally owned and managed. But a heavy burden will fall 
on service providers (particularly on the water side) 
who would need to shoulder a level of investment 
that is difficult to reconcile with their historically low 
efficiency. 
In part because water is both a human right and 
a commodity, providers are often prohibited from 
charging cost-reflective tariffs. Instead, they rely on 
public subsidies that are often insufficient. Danilenko 
et al. (2014) reported that the median utility in devel-
oping/emerging economies was barely covering its 
operating costs and had “no capacity to replace its 
assets once they wear out, let alone expand services 
to larger groups of consumers.” 
Suboptimal finances have led to suboptimal ser -
vice. The World Bank estimates that 16 billion cubic 
meters of water are lost to leaks every year, and 10 bil-
lion cubic meters are delivered to customers but never 
paid for, for a total economic loss of $5.8 billion. While 
eliminating this loss is not realistic, just halving it would 
free up enough water for 90 million people annually 
(Kingdom et al. 2006).
Rural and peri-urban providers are often worse off 
than urban providers because informal or communi-
ty-operated systems can be more expensive and/or 
less sustainable, particularly if public sector commit-
ments and revenue collection are insufficient to cover 
inevitable capital maintenance. As the water sector 
works to build a strategy that can lead to sustainable 
universal access, new tools such as digital payments 
can be deployed to lower costs and improve revenue 
collection. 
DEFINING DIGITAL FINANCE
Digital finance is a term that encompasses two con-
cepts: (i) financial services—payments, savings, credit, 
insurance—that are offered using digital channels and 
(ii) the digital technologies that deliver those financial 
services to the end user. In this framing, mobile tele-
phony is a digital channel, mobile money is a digital 
finance technology, and the payment, credit, and sav-
ings services accessed over mobile money are digital 
financial services. 
This classification is particularly relevant because 
most of the digital payments discussed in this paper are 
sent using “mobile money,” which is a technical term 
that describes the use of a mobile phone to access 
financial services. Mobile money transfers or payments 
are made using an electronic money account or wallet. 
In many cases involving rural or low-income customers, 
this requires users to deposit cash with an agent, who credits their mobile wallet. The agent can then initi-
ate a transfer to a person or organization. Sometimes 
this money stays in electronic circulation, and some-
times it is cashed out or transferred to a bank account. 
Mobile money operators (MMOs) are typically mobile 
network operators (MNOs), banks, or specialized third-
party firms. Their services are particularly important for 
people who do not have formal bank accounts, many 
of whom are low-income customers who struggle to 
access safe water and sanitation.2 
SURVEYING THE LITERATURE ON DIGITAL 
FINANCE FOR WATER AND SANITATION
In the early days of mobile money, advocates specu-
lated that digital finance could revolutionize the way 
people accessed not only payments, savings, and 
credit, but also material services such as energy and 
water (Ehrbeck 2014). The assumption was that a  
convenient, remote payment channel would remove 
the inconvenience of cash for customers in rural or 
informal areas, and that a secure channel for collecting 
revenue would make those customers less of an oper -
ational risk for providers. In many countries, the first 
organizations to accept digital bill payments were 
energy and water utilities, who were quick to see the 
potential cost savings.
In 2011, a group of Oxford researchers assessed 
the use of mobile payments for WSS in four East Afri-
can countries (Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania). 
They found that the benefits of digitizing payments 
were distributed between MNOs, utilities, and users, 
based largely on the size of transaction costs and who 
paid them (providers, customers, or both). In-depth 
research in Kiamumbi, Kenya, revealed that customers 
who were paying via mobile money were saving time, 
but that they might not be saving money (Hope et al. 
2011). User uptake of mobile payments was limited by 
“delayed reconciliation of billing systems, limited cus-
tomer awareness, lack of physical proof of payment, 
high transaction tariffs, and convenience of alternative 
pay points.”
The same researchers found that no large-scale util-
ities were collecting more than 10 percent of their reve-
nue over digital channels, but that if barriers to uptake 
were overcome, then digitizing payments could lead 
to “timelier bill payments, higher collection efficiencies 
and lower administrative costs” (Hope et al. 2011). 
Supporting this hypothesis, Ndaw (2015) described 
the implementation of an “E-Water” billing system by 
the National Water and Sewage Corporation (NWSC) 
of Uganda that allowed it to close its banking halls and 
outsource collections to mobile money and partner 
banks. This reduced NWSC’s collection costs by as 
much as 75 percent and increased revenue by 15 per -
cent. Similarly, in 2018 an analysis of container-based 
 2. This paper looks solely at the impact of digital payments in the WSS sector. For on the potential for digital credit and savings 
to expand WSS access, see Waldron and Shabbir (2017) and Nique and Opala (2014).Testing the Waters • 5
sanitation models3 showed that mobile payments 
could increase a provider’s gross margin by 26 percent-
age points (EY and WSUP 2018). And research by Kro-
likowski (2014) in Dar es Salaam showed that mobile 
water payments reduced the incidence of petty cor -
ruption and rent-seeking. Yet, overall, there have been 
few studies on the impact of digital payments on water 
and sanitation access compared to that of other sec-
tors such as energy or agriculture. 
DIGITAL PAYMENTS FOR WATER  
AND SANITATION IN 2018
Mobile money has existed since at least 2007, and  
several large-scale providers in East Africa—mobile 
money began in Kenya—have been accepting mobile 
bill payments since the beginning of the decade. Fig-
ure 1 shows the percentage of the population in each 
country that had made or received a payment using 
mobile money, debit/credit cards, internet, and digi-
tal finance applications. African countries show levels 
of digital payment adoption that are higher than 
countries with equal or greater incomes. Adults in 
Tanzania are twice as likely to have made/received a 
digital payment than those in Vietnam, despite the 
latter having a per capita gross national income twice that of the former. This is necessity-mandated innova-
tion: lower-density populations and shallower finan-
cial systems in Africa spurred experimentation with 
mobile money, which met a latent demand for remote 
transfers.
Following the literature review, researchers from 
CGAP and GSMA spoke with representatives of 25 
organizations with operations in 26 countries in Africa, 
Asia, and Latin America to learn more about the state 
of digital payments in the water sectors of emerging 
economies. The research was qualitative and relied 
heavily on in-depth conversations with leading WSS 
providers, hardware manufacturers, software compa-
nies, and donors, all working daily to improve access 
to WSS. (See the Appendix for more on methodology 
and a list of participants.)
Two thirds of the customer-facing providers (includ-
ing all the urban utilities) that we spoke to were accept-
ing digital payments. The breakdown was largely 
geographic: all the African providers accepted mobile 
money, even at relatively low levels. Only one of the 
Asian providers did so, with several respondents citing 
constraints such as prohibitive fees and extremely low 
penetration of payments platforms in rural areas. 
One provider in India ran a full promotional cam-
paign to encourage users to start paying with Bharat 
Interface for Money on their USSD phones.4,5 The cam-90

out by an operator, with full canisters transported to a nearby facility for safe treatment and disposal.

paign was ultimately unsuccessful and found that users 
had no money in their linked bank accounts and no 
desire to cash in for this specific purpose.
For the 10 WSS providers in our study who are  
accepting digital payments, revenue paid over those 
channels ranged from close to 0 percent to 95 per -
cent, with the latter representing a significant outlier 
of Clean Team, a container-based toilet business with 2,000 clients in Kumasi, Ghana. The next highest was 
Nairobi City Water and Sewage Company (NCWSC), 
which reported that 38 percent of its revenue was 
received over M-PESA. This had taken almost a decade 
to achieve, and significant growth happened only after 
real-time billing and integrated complaint solutions 
were introduced.
COST AND REVENUE BENEFITS FROM DIGITAL PAYMENTS
CASH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT COST 
FOR WSS PROVIDERS
This observation is perhaps obvious, but important: 
cash is expensive. It requires paid or commissioned 
staff to collect, trucks to transport, and bookkeepers 
to manually reconcile. 
• Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), the pro-
vider of all municipal water in Ghana, estimated 
that its total cash collection costs are 3.3 percent of 
revenue (including staff, transport, printers, and all 
other associated costs). 
• Small water enterprises such as Water4 are cur -
rently paying vendors commissions of 20 percent 
or more of revenue collected. Vendors are gen-
erally tasked with monitoring communal taps and 
collecting payments; their jobs are directly linked 
to the acceptance of physical cash.
• Container toilet provider Loowatt reports that 
collection costs make up 15 percent of its pricing 
model.
• Before closing most of its payment halls and shift-
ing to a digital billing/collection model, NCWSC 
incurred large cash management costs. Just post-
age for paper bills used to cost the utility approxi-
mately $600,000 annually. 
DIGITIZING PAYMENTS DECREASES  
OPERATIONAL COSTS
Every provider in the study that had digitized payments 
reported being motivated wholly or in part by saving 
on the cost of cash. Lori Gonnu, from 1,001 Fontaines, 
explained the dilemma that providers face, which 
makes cost-saving measures such as digitization so 
important: “Providers are not going to increase the 
prices, so the only way to be sustainable is to sell more 
or reduce costs.” Digital payments offer the opportu-
nity to do both, and savings are the immediate benefit.
On this front, as expected, 16 out of 24 respon-
dents (67 percent, excluding the one donor) reported 
that they spent less on collections when customers 
paid with mobile money instead of cash. Another 13 
percent reported that they were digitizing collections 
in the hope of reducing costs. 
• Ecological sanitation provider SOIL installs toilets 
in homes in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for a monthly fee. Door-to-door collections had a 35–40 percent suc-
cess rate and required valuable staff time. Shifting 
all collections to mobile money or in-office resulted 
in immediate savings: SOIL estimated that each 
cash payment collection costs $1.10 versus $0.05 
for each mobile payment. And on-time payment 
rates for mobile money payers are 12 percent 
higher than for cash payers.
• Drinkwell, which installs and manages water ATMs 
in India and Bangladesh reported the cost of col-
lections at 20 percent of revenue when collecting 
cash at the point of sale. When it switched to pre-
paid cards that users could top up at nearby shops 
(a semi-digital payment, discussed below), cost of 
collections dropped to 2 percent of revenue. 
• Clean Team, a container-based toilet enterprise 
in Ghana, estimates a shift from about 25 percent 
mobile payments to about 95 percent resulted in a 
2-percentage point increase in its gross margin.
• After the Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company 
worked with Wonderkid to introduce mobile ser -
vices for billing, collections, and customer care, it 
saw a 28 percent increase in revenue collected on 
an 8 percent increase in revenue billed. Mobile pay-
ment volumes increased by 71 percent.6 
• In a pilot of prepaid household meters linked to 
digital payments, Safe Water Network in Ghana 
saw a 37 percent increase in realized revenue (see 
Box 2 for more details).
With tight (or negative) profit margins in the WSS sec-
tor, collections expenses offer a rare opportunity to 
reduce costs while improving service, by making it 
more convenient for customers to pay. However, the 
largest driver of cost savings is usually reduced staff 
salaries or vendor costs. Achieving these cost savings 
may require reallocating staff or making difficult deci-
sions to reduce workforces.
7“ Providers are not going to increase the prices, so the only 
way to be sustainable is to sell more or reduce costs.”

8 • Testing the Waters
Safe Water Network is a nongovernment organization that 
establishes small water enterprises in peri-urban and rural 
areas throughout India and Ghana. In Ghana, its systems are 
built using donor/government funds, and they are operated 
by Safe Water. The organization’s financial goal is to cover all 
operating expenses and capital maintenance expenses and 
to eventually generate a small profit (of which a portion goes 
to the local community) through user tariffs. While custom-
ers are willing to pay for quality water, there is a strong 
incentive to keep water affordable, which motivates Safe 
Water to drive down costs. 
The following breaks down Safe Water Network’s unit 
economics for one cubic meter (m3) of water. Its tariff (and 
expected revenue) is $1.16 per m3. Beyond the fixed costs 
of Safe Water Network’s purification and distribution infra-
structure ($0.13/m3), its main costs are:
• Provision for under collection (nonrevenue water). 
Water that is pumped but not paid for, either due to leak-
ages or under-collection—$0.31/m3.
• Capital maintenance expenses. Depreciation on capital 
assets such as meters, standpipes, and purification tech-
nology—$0.24/m3 in the baseline.
• Variables costs related to station operation. Includes 
operator travel, stationary costs, and fees—$0.31/m3 in 
the baseline.BOX 2

are compensated at 20 percent of all revenue col-
lected—$0.12/m3. 
Combined with direct financial support to the station 
($0.31/m3), the baseline scenario has the station losing 
$0.26 for every m3 provided. 
Figure B2-1 shows how digital payments, together 
with prepaid service, change the financial viability of 
Safe Water’s service. Adding prepaid hardware and 
mobile systems increases its capital replacement costs 
by 10 cents, bringing the deficit to $0.36/m3. Prepaid 
systems also eliminate under-collection (a 31-cent sav-
ings) by requiring users to pay before they consume 
water, instead of chasing them for payment after. And 
automated systems that rely on digital payments cost far 
less per transaction than the 20 percent of revenue that 
vendors were receiving (net savings of 7 cents). Safe 
Water’s gross margin more than doubled, and it is now 
breaking even or generating a small net profit. 
Just by digitizing revenue, the net margin increases 
by $0.07 (16.5 percent)—important, but not transforma-
tive. Other savings on cash management are canceled 
out on transaction fees, which Safe Water Network pays 
on behalf of its customers. The combination of prepaid 
water and digital payments makes the operation finan-
cially viable. OTHER ADVANTAGES OF GOING DIGITAL
Digital payments deliver clear cost benefits, but there 
are other ways that digitizing transactions can improve 
the overall business model for WSS, making it more 
sustainable. Instant payments that leave permanent 
data trails allow providers to offer a higher level of 
service, which in turn can improve customers’ willing-
ness to pay.
AUTOMATIC PAYMENT RECONCILIATION 
When a cash payment is received by a provider, it can 
take days or weeks to be entered into its accounting 
system. A lot can happen in that time. According to 
Wonderkid, it is not uncommon for utility customers to 
pay a bill (in cash) in the morning, then be discon-
nected the same afternoon because of slow reconcili-
ation. Longer reconciliation cycles also mean that the 
business must wait before it can reinvest that revenue.
With digital payments, cycles are shorter. When 
customers with prepaid smart meters make a digital  
payment, a backend system updates their balance 
immediately to generate a token code. But to realize 
the full value of digital payments, more complex soft-
ware integration is needed with the payment proces-
sor (who must also invest in its backend processing), 
so that the WSS provider is notified about payment in 
real time, and the payment is credited to the proper 
user’s account in its billing system. Without this, man-
ual account reconciliation done at the end of the day 
can still lead to unintentional cut-offs. The GSMA 
Instant Payment Notification Hub, which helps address 
this challenge through a platform that eases integra-
tions, is covered later in this paper.
TRANSACTION RECORDS FROM DIGITAL 
PAYMENTS CREATE TRANSPARENCY
If cash changes hands and nobody records the trans-
action, does a business make money? Often, the 
answer is no. Digital payments create automatic, 
indelible records of a financial transaction, and those 
records create much-needed transparency. Several 
business-to-business (B2B) companies told us stories 
of providers uncovering significant levels of fraud, at 
all levels in the organization, during the process of dig-itization. One small water enterprise reported that its 
nonrevenue water had reached 22 percent, which it 
believed to be almost entirely nontechnical losses (i.e., 
under-billing or theft by vendors).7 Asking meter read-
ers and sanitation agents to handle large amounts of 
cash distracts from them from doing their core tasks 
and poses a significant security risk and an unneces-
sary temptation.
Transparency is important for both providers and 
customers. Water tariffs are established through long 
processes, then posted. When customers use public 
water or sanitation, they need to know that they are 
paying the posted price for that service. This benefit is 
best illustrated through its counter example: one East 
African utility showed us a group of privately operated 
kiosks, where operators were contracted to buy water 
from the utility and to sell it at a 40 percent mark-up. 
However, at the kiosks we visited, operators were sell-
ing water at a mark-up that was anywhere from 185 
percent to 700 percent, seeking payments that far 
exceeded what was specified in their contracts. The 
utility was in the process of moving to 100 percent 
digital payments and automated dispensing, which 
would cut out rent-seeking from vendors and give 
customers confidence that they are paying the estab-
lished price for water.
MODELS LIKE PAYGO REQUIRE  
DIGITAL PAYMENTS
PAYGo solutions link payment and usage seamlessly. In 
the water context, customers use their mobile phone 
to send a payment, which is tagged with their unique 
account number. This payment is recognized by the 
backend system which triggers an automatic signal to 
the water meter or sends an SMS code that users input 
via keypad, either of which unlocks water service for 
the purchased volume (or time). This can happen from 
anywhere at any time, and the marginal cost to the 
provider of collecting each payment is effectively zero 
(although providers may pay to license software). 
Just as digital payments can exist within post-
paid service frameworks, prepaid meters/kiosks can 
function with a network of cash-in points (see Box 
3 for more on the differences between prepaid and 
PAYGo). But several respondents (notably CityTaps, 
9 7. Nonrevenue water is water that is pumped but never paid for because of technical (leakage) or nontechnical (theft or non-
payment) issues.10 • Testing the Waters
SEEN, and Safe Water Network) believed that the 
two solutions (digital payments and prepaid meters/
kiosks) are more powerful if they are deployed 
together. Installing prepaid meters without digital 
collections requires establishing systems for receiv-
ing and managing cash (which may be some dis-
tance from a customer’s house and not available at all 
hours), as well as a system for vending credit tokens 
to top-up meters. Both are expensive to maintain 
because of commissions paid to middlemen. Simi-
larly, there are fewer benefits to digital payments if 
a staff member still must visit every customer every 
month to read their meter.
The landscape of PAYGo solutions for the water 
sector is both limited and expensive, and significant 
innovation will be needed to scale these products 
and services. The sector will need to work closely 
with digital payment systems to gain wider adop-
tion. Grégoire Landel, the CEO and co-founder of 
CityTaps, a smart meter company, was succinct when 
describing the linkage: “There is no [CityTaps] meter 
without mobile money.” 
BENEFITS OF DIGITIZING NON-PAYMENT 
FUNCTIONS 
WSS providers need lots of capital to expand access, 
even if they are not strictly for-profit entities, and so 
digitizing revenue collection is often their top priority. 
While this approach is understandable, several pro-
viders noted the importance of digitizing other pro-
cesses besides payments. PAYGo water is a good 
example of this: the entire payment/use experience 
happens seamlessly and digitally. But prepaid is by no 
means the only service model, and there are other 
processes that could benefit from digitization.
Meter-reading
Remotely monitoring postpaid consumption, through 
machine-to-machine communication or applications that allow a user to read their own meter on the utili-
ty’s behalf, makes the billing cycle more flexible and 
lowers the cost of meter-reading, which is often ham-
pered by low response rates. In Nairobi’s informal 
Kayole Soweto neighborhood, water connections 
were perceived as nonviable, partially because meter 
readers did not feel safe visiting households. A digi-
tal, self-reading mobile solution called Jisomee Mita 
eliminated the need for physical reading and made 
water connections possible (Ndaw and Mangi 2015).
Billing
GWCL emphasized the importance of digital billing for 
customers. Digital invoices allowed customers to see 
the volume they had consumed and the rate at which 
they were being charged. They could then make a pay-
ment on that bill and feel comfortable that they were 
paying the right amount. Or if the amount was wrong, 
they could act.
Customer feedback and inquiries
Dickson Marira of WonderKid tells a story about 
going into the homes of one utility’s customers. The 
utility was collecting only 6 percent of what it billed in 
a given month, and it was immediately apparent why. 
He met customers who had stacks of bills held down 
by stacks of cash. These customers were ready and 
eager to pay their water bills, but they did not know 
how or where to pay. 
While this obviously speaks to a broken collections 
system, it also indicates something else: a lack of com-
munication between customers and their providers. 
This is a frequent problem with utilities. When custom-
ers experience a breakdown, they do not think of call-
ing their service provider because that has always been 
an exercise in futility. In places such as Nairobi and 
Kisumu, WonderKid (with support from the World 
Bank) helped to solve this with MajiVoice—a digital 
platform for lodging complaints from different chan-
nels, including SMS, USSD, internet, and over the 
counter. Once utilities enable easy communication, 
they can address customer issues. Wonderkid sees a 
digital complaint channel as the crucial first step for its 
client utilities. A digital complaint channel has a posi-
tive impact on consumer confidence, which can trans-
late to uptake of revenue-generating or cost-saving 
digital services.With prepaid service, payment is received before a service or product is delivered. The terms pay-as-
you-go (PAYGo) and prepaid are often used interchangeably, but they are not technically the same. 
Customers who pay cash to a vendor to fill their bucket are prepaying for their water.
PAYGo in this paper refers to water or sanitation service that is automatically triggered or enabled by 
a digital payment. In other words, all PAYGo services are prepaid, but not all prepaid services are PAYGo.BOX 3

DIGITIZING INTERNAL TRANSACTIONS 
Digitization is a process that happens over time. 
Because setting up a user-facing system for digital pay-
ments is a long process, many manufacturers and ser -
vicers of communal water points have opted to take a 
quicker route. 
Instead of users sending a remote payment directly 
to the operator, they can use a water ATM, which often 
accepts payments from prepaid smart cards or tokens 
(see Figure 2). These prepaid instruments require users 
to top-up their account through an agent or vendor 
who loads credit using an application or point-of-sale 
device. When users tap their card against a reader 
in the water ATM, the reader pings the system (or a 
recent backup if it is offline), verifies that the requested 
amount will not exceed the user’s balance, and deb-
its that account. This requires less integration with the 
MNO and, therefore, is easier for most providers to 
implement. 
There are many upsides to using this system as oppos-  
ed to using cash:
• Users generally are able to access water 24 hours a 
day, if they hold a balance. 
• The system does not allow arrears to accumulate 
and does not require regular supervision from a 
water point operator (most providers we spoke with 
have contracts with local entrepreneurs to serve as 
token agents). 
• Cash risk, although not eliminated, is transferred 
from the organization to the token vendor. 
• The system provides transparency for both provider 
(revenue) and user (price), and it creates detailed 
records of individual consumption. 
The downside compared to a fully digitized system 
that allows users to load credit independently includes 
the following: 
• The vendor still receives some commission (10 
percent of revenue for Sarvajal) for performing top-
ups, so costs remain.
• Users can top-up their balances only when the 
vendor is available, which may decrease sales and 
inconvenience users if they need water at night. 
• There is an added expense of purchasing physical 
prepaid instruments, such as cards. 
All in all, cash plus card is a significant improvement on 
cash. It can exist in parallel with a fully digital top-up 
option, and it serves as a useful bridge to fully digital 
collections, particularly in places where users are unac-
customed to initiating payments.DATA FROM DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS 
Surprisingly, no providers reported using data from 
customer payments to influence business decisions or 
allocate resources, although many were planning to do 
so. Hardware and software providers also say that their 
clients are not using data to the fullest extent possible. 
In some cases, systems were incompatible in their data 
structures, but this could be fixed in future iterations. In 
other cases, software and hardware providers sought 
to protect their data, which they considered to be valu-
able, thus limiting the scope of analysis for their part-
ners and customers. 
To increase the value clients receive from their hard-
ware or software, B2B firms like Wonderkid or CityTaps 
create monthly data analytics reports on the service for 
their clients. This supports decision-making and helps 
to build WSS providers’ analytical capacity. More B2B 
providers can offer this service or enable their custom-
ers to analyze their own data. And as a lack of analytical 
capacity is also a key barrier to digitization, investing in 
analysts and analytical tools should be an essential part 
of any provider’s digital payment strategy.FIGURE 2: A Woman using a water ATM in rural Gambia (Courtesy of

12 • Testing the Waters
Grundfos (a Danish water pump manufacturer) and its partners World Vision (an international charity), 
mobile operator Safaricom, and local communities have installed 32 self-service water kiosks for homes 
and businesses in Kenya that lack water infrastructure. The kiosks (called LifeLink) are automated water 
distribution points that are integrated with a mobile money payment facility (through Safaricom in Kenya) 
and real-time GSM monitoring of water dispensed and payments made. 
The GSMA Mobile for Development Utilities team contracted researchers  to conduct individual and 
group interviews at 10 of these sites in Kenya to understand the level of mobile money awareness and 
use of PAYGo water payments among users of the water ATMs. The research included questions around 
frequency, mode (cash/mobile money), payment 
experience, and limitations of using mobile money. 
In six out of seven Grundfos locations sur -
veyed, mobile money was the only mode of pay-
ment for water. Even in Kenya, where M-PESA 
is omnipresent and 73 percent of adults have a 
mobile money account, WSS providers are driving 
increased use. Thirty-five percent of interviewed 
customers made their first mobile bill payment at 
LifeLink ATMs; users who had previously used only 
mobile money for remittances or airtime top-ups 
are now paying for other services, such as school 
fees, on their phones. Much of this was driven by 
value: Lifelink water is cleaner and cheaper than 
water sold by private sellers, and customers are 
now tracking and optimizing their water spend in 
ways they could not before digitization.BOX 4

KIOSKS IN KENYA
FIGURE B4-1: A Grundfos Lifelink kiosk in rural

For users to adopt a digital payment solution, certain 
basic elements must be in place. WSS providers can 
take the following steps to build the foundation for a 
digital payment solution. These recommendations are 
based on experiences with mobile money, but they are 
broadly applicable to other digital payment platforms:
• Understand the costs of cash collections and how 
they impact the unit economics for WSS. With-
out this basic knowledge, it is not possible to 
determine if there is a business case for digitizing  
payments. 
• Conduct research within a service area to deter -
mine which, if any, payment operators have an 
established cash-in/cash-out (CICO) infrastructure. 
These CICO points (usually mobile money agents) 
are essential—without them, users who currently 
make most transactions in cash will be unable to 
load electronic money to their wallets. 
• Meet with customers to understand what payment 
technologies they are familiar with, what their per -
sonal experiences have been, the potential costs 
and benefits for them of switching to digital pay-
ments, and any requirements they would have 
around a new payment/service model.
• Negotiate commercial agreement(s) with the pay -
ment systems operator(s). This is discussed in 
detail in the next section. 
• Receive a dedicated paybill account to which users 
can direct mobile payments.
• If necessary (e.g., if providing PAYGo services or 
collecting a high volume of daily/weekly payments), 
integrate the WSS billing system into the payments 
platform so that the billing system receives instant 
notification of payments and automatically credits 
user accounts.
• Develop tailored marketing and training materi-
als that help users to understand the benefits of 
mobile payments and empower them to initiate 
transactions.
• Implement, experiment, and iterate.INTEGRATION CHALLENGES WITH MMOS 
In the past decade, MMOs have become the providers 
and gatekeepers of complex payment platforms that 
go beyond traditional banks. Although users benefit 
from this, figuring out the right business model for 
mobile money has been a process of experimentation. 
There is consensus that, in the long run, open and 
accessible platforms are more effective at generating 
value and therefore use. Operators such as MTN and 
Safaricom have taken the step of publishing their 
application program interfaces (APIs) and creating a 
virtual sandbox for application testing, allowing devel-
opers to integrate with and innovate around the 
M-PESA platform. 
However, most other MMOs have yet to take this 
step, which means that integration with a mobile 
money service or an aggregator is done on a case-by-
case basis and is constrained by human and technical 
resources. In a few cases, mobile money integration 
was handled quickly, but several WSS providers told 
stories of waiting months or even years to integrate 
with MMOs. Manobi, for example, spent more than 
one year integrating with an operator in Benin. 
NEGOTIATING COMMERCIAL  
AGREEMENTS WITH MMOS 
Municipal utilities that serve tens or hundreds of thou-
sands of customers bring clear value to MMOs 
through the sheer volume of their annual cash flows. 
This allows them to enter negotiations from a position 
of relative strength. But smaller and/or rural WSS pro-
viders may need to convince MMOs of their value, 
particularly if they are seeking more complex, sys-
tems-level integration. 
13“ Some of the challenges in implementing digital payments is 
the integration and local nuances with each local payment 
provider. Each country has a bit of their own standards and 
APIs. For a company that works in multiple countries like 
Susteq, it’s a barrier.” — MARTEN SUSEBEEK, SUSTEQ
FIGURE B4-1: A Grundfos Lifelink kiosk in rural  
Kenya (Courtesy of Grundfos)14 • Testing the Waters
In theory, WSS providers are ideal partners for 
MMOs. There is no commodity more essential than 
water and, if mobile money is connected to its daily 
procurement, that can be a powerful and sticky intro-
duction to mobile bill payments. But smaller-scale 
providers still need to offer realistic and defensible 
projections of the number of customers and volume of 
transactions that they will reach, and they must meet 
those targets. Providers in more rural areas can also 
emphasize that they will bring more active mobile 
money users to the platform. For example, SOIL 
reports that 60 percent of its customers are new to 
mobile money, and 19 percent of them had opened an 
account but never made a transaction before paying 
for SOIL (see Box 4 for similar findings in Kenya). Rural 
providers also help agents to balance liquidity by pro-
viding a cash-in use case.8  
Karim and Komu (2017) highlight six important con-
siderations for commercial partnerships between utility 
providers and MMOs:
• Both parties protect customers’ privacy by keeping 
customer data secure.9 
• Resolution procedures are applied to resolve issues 
between customers and either provider or between 
the providers themselves.
• The size of transaction charges and who pays them 
are established: Are they paid by the customer, or 
the service provider, or shared by both?
• Minimum amount and frequency of settlement is 
established, as well as the party that initiates settle-
ments, or if they will be conducted automatically.
• Service-level agreements clearly define each party’s 
roles and responsibilities (e.g., the MMO commits 
to sharing its API and providing timely notification 
of system changes).
• Tax obligations of both parties are noted.
INSTANT PAYMENT NOTIFICATION  
AND APIS
Real-time, automated data sharing is essential for 
PAYGo models. Service providers’ systems need to be 
alerted immediately when a customer has 
made a mobile payment so that the service 
provider is able to reconcile the payments 
(matching the payment to a unique ID num-
ber) and unlock the PAYGo meter for the 
corresponding volume or time (either 
directly or by sending the user a code to input). Automated, rapid service delivery is the implicit 
bargain that PAYGo providers make when they ask 
their customers to prepay: you get what you pay for, on 
time, and in full. 
This functionality requires integrating the sys-
tems of a WSS provider and an MMO. In the past, 
systems-level integrations were done one on one or 
through a payments aggregator who was integrated 
with several MMOs. GSMA’s Instant Payment Notifica-
tion (IPN) Hub aims to simplify this process by using a 
single platform.10 The IPN Hub enables service provid-
ers to receive real-time notification from several MMOs 
that are connected to the platform. GSMA is scaling up 
this service across Africa and is working with its mobile 
operator members to connect them to providers in the 
WSS and energy sectors.
More complicated service offerings like automatic 
debit payments from a mobile wallet require more 
sophisticated APIs. These may not be publicly avail-
able and can vary significantly from operator to opera-
tor. CGAP and GSMA have been working with mobile 
operators for years to help them make their APIs 
accessible and harmonized, which will reduce com-
plexity and enable innovation. 
The IPN Hub and open, harmonized APIs can help 
companies to quickly integrate with mobile payment 
platforms and develop more specialized tools that 
improve the user’s experience. 
THE COST OF TRANSACTIONS
Asking users to switch from cash to a new payment 
modality becomes even more difficult if they must pay 
to make a transaction. Yet that is the situation that 
many service providers are forced into. Respondents 
reported that mobile money fees for WSS payments 
varied, in both size and structure. The latter is particu-
larly problematic: block fee structures can disincentiv-
ize micropayments because they can add 5 percent or 
more to payments under $1. This effectively eliminates 
the core value proposition of digital payments from the 
customer’s perspective and should be a major concern 
for any operator looking to digitize collections. 
Different MMOs offer different pricing options—
these disparities are a major issue to resolve when 
“ The payment for water is very low, a micro-payment  
even, and the transaction fee makes it prohibitive.”

negotiating a commercial agreement. In some cases, 
WSS providers can pay a bulk fee to the MMO and 
price it into their tariff (assuming it is less than what 
they were paying for collections). In other cases, pro-
viders pass the cost directly to the consumer. And 
some MMOs allow the fee to be split between pro-
vider and consumer. In any case, WSS providers need 
to evaluate what the fee structure will mean to the 
average customer and make sure that customers see 
value in the long run. If providers can demonstrate 
increased registrations and use, they may be able to 
build a case for concessionary rate structures, which 
will, in turn, accelerate adoption. 
Sanitation providers have been passing savings 
from digitization on to their customers to encourage 
adoption. In Madagascar, Loowatt has made sanita-
tion cheaper by offering a 15 percent discount for 
customers who pay using mobile money. SOIL in Haiti 
and Clean Team in Ghana have rolled out similar ini-
tiatives, offering 8 percent and 12 percent discounts, 
respectively. 
ECOSYSTEMS FOR DIGITAL PAYMENTS
Payment platforms are multisided: to function opti-
mally they require many different types of users on 
both sides. Without customers who are willing to pay 
for goods digitally, why should merchants bother 
accepting digital payments? And without a wide vari-
ety of added-value use cases, why should customers 
bother to adopt the technology in the first place? 
In many markets, users of mobile money simply do 
not have enough places to use it. Loowatt customers 
in Madagascar can use mobile money to pay their 
electric bill or cable TV subscription, but few of those 
customers have electricity, let alone TVs. In the future, 
other companies that accept digital payments stand to 
gain from Loowatt’s work with its client base. MMOs 
are already benefitting from the volume that water/
sanitation providers drive onto their platforms. But for 
WSS providers who need to educate their clients on 
how to make a digital payment, much work remains.
THE DISTRIBUTION ECOSYSTEM 
In the future, poor rural water customers may keep a 
balance on their digital wallet, stop carrying cash, and 
make everyday purchases with mobile phones or con-
tactless cards. But that scenario is still some ways away. 
For now, it is safe to assume that most digital payments 
will require physical money to be converted to elec-
tronic money (and vice versa, for individuals receiving 
payments). To do that, customers need CICO points, 
which are usually mobile money agents.Agents are the backbone of any mobile money 
deployment. Their proximity and reliability are crucial 
factors in digitizing payments. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 
cities and towns typically have no shortage of agents, 
but smaller villages may have only few agents, or none 
at all. In addition, agents in rural areas often face diffi-
culties in balancing their cash and electronic liquidity. 
WSS providers, particularly those that serve rural 
segments, can bring substantial value to MMOs. Rural 
agents are traditionally used as cash-out points for 
villagers who receive domestic or international remit-
tances. But small water enterprises or sanitation pro-
viders can offer a use case for cashing-in or leaving 
money in the wallet. MMOs that are eager for more 
use cases may be willing to help WSS providers by 
establishing agents in key locations and incentivizing 
those agents to drive mobile bill payments. Alterna-
tively, WSS providers may decide to register their 
own staff or vendors as mobile money agents. Early 
evidence shows that this approach can ease payment 
restrictions for service providers while opening up new 
markets for MMOs (Winiecki and Pillai 2018), but this 
would require a separate business analysis and agree-
ment with an MMO. 
In non-African contexts, the rapid proliferation of 
digital payment options makes this an interesting time 
to pursue integration. Different WSS providers reported 
both a lack of or too many digital payment options. In 
Bangladesh, Drinkwell had to choose between Bkash, 
Rocket, and traditional bank agents, with penetration 
and cost being its main considerations.
FIGURE 3: A flyer promoting mobile payment  
for water in Ghana (Courtesty of Safe Water Network)
16In Ghana, 85 percent of Safe Water Network’s customers had mobile money, but only 10 percent had 
ever initiated a payment of any kind. When customers tried to use mobile money, they faced a range 
of complications:
• Menu was in an unfamiliar language.
• Too many steps and numbers.
• USSD session timed out if they took too long.
• Lack of clarity around payment receipt.
• Lag between payment and receipt of a prepaid token.
Safe Water Network collaborated with the country’s leading MMO (MTN Ghana) to conduct work-
shops for its customers on how to make mobile payments. In the months immediately following the 
workshop, it saw a 20-percentage point jump in the share of revenue coming through mobile channels 
(Waldron 2018).BOX 5 
EXPERIENCE OF SAFE WATER NETWORK WITH INTRODUCING  
MOBILE PAYMENTSDIGITAL ILLITERACY MEETS BAD  
CUSTOMER INTERFACE
Digital payment systems run the gamut from mobile 
money to credit cards to messenger applications. 
Some of these offer intuitive, user-friendly experiences. 
However, many mobile money services—particularly in 
Africa where smartphone penetration continues to 
lag—still run on Unstructured Supplementary Service 
Data (USSD) protocol. USSD is essentially a language 
comprised of numbers, dashes, and asterisks that is 
used to communicate between mobile phones and 
the MNO’s computers (see Figure 3). 
That such a rudimentary system can and is used 
to channel billions of dollars across countries and 
continents is nothing short of amazing. But that the 
system is not particularly user friendly is an unfortu-
nate reality. Also, USSD protocol is vulnerable to out-
side interference, which makes vigilant monitoring 
and user authentication through PINs crucial for bill 
payees.11 In most cases, making a mobile payment requires 
a user to read several menus; enter in a paybill num-
ber, account number, and PIN code; and complete the 
entire process within the allotted time for a USSD ses-
sion (otherwise, they will be forced to start over). For 
literate, numerate customers, this can be a challenge. 
For illiterate, innumerate customers, it is basically 
impossible without some level of one-on-one instruc-
tion. And like it or not, it is often innovative service 
providers that find themselves taking on the burden of 
that training (see Box 5). 
INCREASED MOBILE MONEY TAXATION 
Politicians in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have 
recently levied or increased excise duties and taxes 
on withdrawals from mobile wallets. This has led 
many users to shy away from mobile money, whether 
or not the tax affects bill payments, with PAYGo solar 
providers in Uganda reporting a 10–15 percent 
reduction in mobile money transactions per customer 
(Ferracuti 2018).16 • Testing the Waters

vulnerabilities-in/.INTERNAL BARRIERS
THE NEED FOR ACCURATE DATA ON  
BUSINESS OPERATIONS
The decision to adopt digital payments should be 
based on a careful analysis of the various costs and 
benefits to all parties: the MNO, the customer, and 
especially the water provider. However, we found 
that many business managers at utilities and small 
water enterprises do not know the baseline measure-
ments of their business (cost of cash collections, non-
revenue water, etc.), making it impossible for them to 
quantify the return or impact of investing in digital 
technology. Digital billing has helped NCWSC reach 
an 85 percent collection rate, but it has no historical 
data to use as a benchmark. One B2B company 
described a utility client who had no clear view of its 
overall monthly revenue. 
To some degree, this reflects the analog state of 
WSS providers—digitizing billing and collections 
should shine light on the financial situation. But pro-
viders need accurate data on the cost of these oper -
ations to accurately measure the impact of digitizing 
them. Collecting and analyzing operational data are 
fundamental steps, and providers need to take these 
on before they begin digitizing payments. 
RE-ALLOCATING OR REDUCING STAFF MAY 
BE NECESSARY TO SAVE COSTS
A prominent obstacle to digitizing payments is its 
impact on staff of water providers. Eliminating meter 
reading and payment halls saves providers money and can lead to better service to more people. 
Although the aggregate impact of digitizing pay-
ments is both positive and significant, that impact is 
diffused over time and across thousands or millions of 
customers. For staff whose jobs are eliminated as 
result of this shift, its effect can be negative and 
immediate. 
Providers reported that the effect on staff is a seri-
ous downside when considering whether to digitize 
payments. Managers of small water enterprises talked 
about having to lay off vendors who had become like 
family. The story is even more complex for managers 
of larger utilities who have unionized workforces. In 
their case, workers whose tasks have been digitized 
must be given more productive work, and full cost 
savings from digitization may not be realized for sev-
eral years. 
However, there are ways to reduce the impact on 
staff. Growing organizations are usually able to reallo-
cate staff and boost their efficiency. And as previous 
examples have illustrated, there is an abundant need 
for better customer service that could be fulfilled by 
former collections staff. 
Nevertheless, providers will need to make hard 
decisions. They must focus on the business case when 
they compare the benefits to their customers against 
the disruption to their workforce. Decisions to reduce 
staff need to be communicated and managed as com-
passionately and carefully as possible. Policy makers 
looking to eliminate cash—although they are wise to 
do so overall—must ensure that policies are in place to 
compensate and re-train workers whose jobs are lost 
in the transition.
17“ The organizations that run small decentralized water treat-
ment and distribution systems, especially in rural areas and 
remote locations in Africa, are part of the local communities. 
These small water entrepreneurs don’t have the financial 
means or organizational structure to evaluate, operate, or 
control a new digital system.” — RUI BRAS GOMES, CUBO“ If we could move all payments to digital, we 
would be happy. Staff could work on other tasks, 
it would reduce transport and security costs, and 
customers would have added convenience”—

COMPANYCONCLUSION
WSS providers need to increase revenue to achieve 
universal access, but they are often unwilling or unable 
to increase tariffs. A focus on reducing costs and 
increasing efficiency will help providers achieve sus-
tainability. Digitizing payments can lead to operational 
savings, and adopting other digital technologies 
(e-billing, meter reading, customer relationship man-
agement tools etc.) can magnify these savings. There is 
reason for optimism in the WSS sector, but the social, 
institutional, and technological barriers highlighted in 
this paper must be overcome, or they will limit the 
potential scale of digital payments and other solutions. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Providers need to be clear about why they want to 
shift to digital and what results they expect to have. 
Explicitly defining their desired outcomes of digitiza-
tion (cost savings, consumer data, business transpar -
ency, etc.) and quantifying them wherever possible will 
help providers to make informed decisions on when 
and how to invest in digitizing payments.
In many areas that want to expand access to WSS, 
mobile money is the only digital payment system 
available, and its reach may be limited to nonrural 
areas. An enabling mobile ecosystem is needed for 
digital payments to work in the WSS sector. MNOs, 
regulators, and others need to work together to 
deliver network coverage to the last-mile, build a 
robust mobile money infrastructure with several 
use cases for low-income populations, and reduce or eliminate fees for small, routine transactions. In 
the short term, WSS providers need to be creative 
in establishing CICO points and integrating their 
systems with payment platforms. At the same time, 
payment providers need to actively collaborate with 
stakeholders in the WSS sector. 
Providers need to prioritize overcoming internal 
barriers to digitization—for example, lack of proper 
financial data or a poor customer service culture. 
They need to build a sound financial model that facil-
itates strategic decision making. The business model 
should reflect a customer-centric approach; WSS 
providers need to understand why their consumers 
choose to pay through other channels and how they 
should go about addressing customers’ desires, con-
cerns, or pain points. 
A NOTE OF CAUTION AND OPTIMISM
Digital payments are not a panacea. But with careful 
analysis and a considered strategy, digitizing payments 
can help WSS providers lower costs, improve service, 
and unlock new business models. To reap these bene-
fits, providers must pursue long-term financial sustain-
ability. This means embracing data, analytics, and 
customer service; eliminating waste and fraud; and 
creating an organization that is well-governed and 
financially sustainable. Digital payments are just a tech-
nology. They are not a substitute for proper gover -
nance and institutional controls.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
GSMA and CGAP partnered to investigate the state of 
digital payments in the water sectors of emerging 
economies. The research was qualitative, relying heav-
ily on in-depth conversations with leading WSS provid-
ers, hardware manufacturers, software companies, and 
donors, all working daily to improve access to WSS. 
We spoke with 25 organizations with operations 
in 26 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Of 
our sample, 14 firms were directly providing customers 
with water or sanitation through a variety of business 
models, including water and sanitation utilities, small water enterprises, container sanitation firms, and oth-
ers (customer-facing firms). 12 firms were supplying 
WSS providers with hardware, software, and/or data 
analytics (business-facing firms). Two firms straddled 
the divide, operating as customer service providers in 
some markets and as hardware/software/consultancy 
providers in others. And one organization was a foun-
dation that had rich expertise in the WSS sector. Our 
sample is not exhaustive, and it skews toward markets 
with established mobile money deployments.
Those conversations with industry leaders form the 
backbone of this paper, which is both a stock-taking 
and an introduction to the topic.
