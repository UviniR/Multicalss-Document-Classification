Abstract
A new form of secured lending utlitizing \digital collateral" has recently emerged,
most prominently in low and middle income countries. Digital collateral relies on
\lockout" technology, which allows the lender to temporarily disable the ow value
of the collateral to the borrower without physically repossessing it. We explore this
new form of credit both in a model and in a eld experiment using school-fee loans
digitally secured with a solar home system. We nd that securing a loan with digital
collateral drastically reduces default rates (by 19 pp) and increases the lender's rate
of return (by 38 pp). Employing a variant of the Karlan and Zinman (2009) method-
ology, we decompose the total eect and nd that roughly one-third is attributable
to (ex-ante) adverse selection and two-thirds is attributable to (interim or ex-post)
moral hazard. Access to a school-fee loan signicantly increases school enrollment
and school-related expenditures without detrimental eects to households' balance
sheet.

There is a general consensus that households in low and middle income countries (LMICs)
have insucient access to credit. While 20 years ago economists were optimistic that
micronance would ll this void, most of the evidence suggests that micronance loans do
not have transformative eects on the average borrower (Banerjee et al., 2015; Meager,
2019).
Traditional micronance loans are typically unsecured and characterized by high in-
terest rates, large transaction costs, and low uptake. In contrast, more than 80% of total
household debt in the US is secured by a physical asset.1Using collateral to secure debt
helps overcome economic frictions, thereby expanding the supply of credit and reducing
the cost of credit provision. Yet, secured debt is much less prevalent in very poor coun-
tries. Why? First, property rights are dicult to establish and enforce in economies with
weak legal institutions, which translates to a high cost of repossessing collateral for cred-
itors. This is especially true for households in remote areas, where the costs associated
with locating collateral, physically repossessing it, and subsequently redeploying it are
prohibitive. Second, the primary source of income for many households in LMICs is self-
employment, which is subject to more frequent shocks than households whose primary
source of income is from formal sector wages. As such, they are more likely to default for
nonstrategic reasons and may choose to avoid the risk of having assets repossessed.
In this paper, we argue that collateral need not be physically repossessed in order to
serve a useful role in access to credit. Recent technological innovations have facilitated the
use of digital collateral without the need for costly and inecient physical repossession.
An emerging example is pay-as-you-go nancing (PAYGO). The typical PAYGO contract
requires a nominal down payment to take possession of an asset, followed by frequent,
small payments made via a mobile payment system. PAYGO nancing crucially relies
on an embedded \lockout technology" that allows the lender to remotely, cheaply, and
temporarily disable the ow of services from the asset. In other words, the lender can
digitally repossess the asset without the need to repossess it physically. Digital collateral

1has several technological advantages: disabling the ow of services is cheap and easily
reversible. Borrowers unable to make a payment do not lose the asset, rather they are
simply unable to consume the ow of services from the asset until they start paying
again. These advantages allow for a richer space of nancial contracts involving exible
repayment schedules (e.g., pay per usage) and temporary (digital) repossession for non-
payment.2
We explore this new form of nancial contracting within a stylized model and a eld ex-
periment. In the model, rms can produce a good at a constant marginal cost. Households
have a private value for consuming the good that is realized after they take possession
of it. Due to their limited wealth and nancial constraints, households cannot aord to
purchase the good outright. In order to recoup their costs, rms must oer nancing to
households. But households cannot credibly commit to repay out of future income. Thus,
rms oer a contract that is collateralized by the good: if the household does not repay
the loan then the rm repossesses the good.
In the model, repossessing collateral plays two roles: (i) the lender recovers something
of value, thereby insuring them against default, and (ii) the household loses something of
value, thereby providing them incentive to repay or decline the loan oer. In most models
of collateralized lending, these two implications are inherently bundled. They need not
be. In both our model and experimental setting, repossessing digital collateral imposes a
cost on households who fail to repay but does not necessarily involve recovery value for
the lender.This decoupling is especially valuable when the lender's faces a high cost of
repossession rendering the recovery role of little (net) value.
Much like traditional collateral, securing loans with digital collateral reduces the rms'
cost of providing nancing via two channels relative to unsecured credit. First, it provides
households with an incentive to repay the loan when they can aord to do so, thereby the
moral hazard problem of strategic default. Second, when combined with a downpayment,
digital collateral serves as a screening mechanism to overcome adverse selection. That
is, a borrower that knows she is more likely to face a negative income shock will have
2These features are in contrast to the typical secured loan that involves a xed repayment schedule
and permanent (physical) repossession in default.
2less incentive to accept a digitally secured loan. By reducing moral hazard and adverse
selection, lenders can oer more nancing to credit-worthy borrowers at terms they nd
acceptable.
In spite of the two aforementioned attributes, a stronger (or more eective) lockout
technology|which enables collateral to be digitized|does not necessarily increase wel-
fare. Stronger lockout destroys more surplus (i.e., household utility) when it is employed,
which can oset the welfare gains of the credit expansion. As a result, an intermediate de-
gree of lockout can be welfare maximizing. This nding is consistent with the temporary
and relatively lenient nature in which the lockout technology is employed in the typical
PAYGO contract compared to traditional secured lending.
We conduct a eld experiment to identify the impact of digital collateral on market
frictions and economic outcomes. To conduct the experiment, we partnered with Fenix
International, the largest solar-home system (SHS) provider in Uganda. The SHS provides
a household with access to a modest amount of electricity without being connected to the
grid. Fenix oers PAYGO nancing for their SHS. They also oer follow-up loans for
good payers, where the SHS is re-used as digital collateral to secure the loan. Our study
examines the eects of digital collateral with Fenix's most popular follow-up product, a
cash loan that is oered to customers near the beginning of each school term when school
fees are due.
Our experimental design randomizes the sample into three treatment groups and a
control group. In the rst treatment, the customer is oered a loan secured with digital
collateral. In the second treatment, the customer is oered an unsecured loan. In the
third treatment, a customer is oered a secured loan, but if the customer accepts the
loan, he or she is (positively) \surprised" and receives an unsecured loan. The \surprise"
group is used to disentangle adverse selection from moral hazard a la Karlan and Zinman
(2009).
Our experiment yields ve main results. First, customer interest and take-up rates
are high. More than 12% of the over 27,000 customers who received an SMS about the
loan indicated they were interested. Of the 2,200 customers who were oered a loan
after expressing interest, 47% took up the oer and received a loan. These high take-up
3rates suggest the loan terms were attractive to customers and help to alleviate credit
constraints. Second, consistent with our hypothesis that digital collateral reduces adverse
selection, the take-up rate was about 6 percentage points (pp) lower for customers oered
a (digitally) secured loan than those oered an unsecured loan (45% vs 51%).
Third, digital collateral signicantly increases loan repayment. Average repayment
increased by 11 pp when the loan was secured with digital collateral compared to an
unsecured loan. Furthermore, the fraction of households that fully repaid the secured loan
was 19 pp higher than the unsecured loans. About one-third of the total eect can be
attributed to adverse selection while two-thirds is driven by moral hazard. The reduction
in moral hazard was concentrated among higher risk borrowers (based on repayment
of previous loans), whereas the reduction in adverse selection was concentrated among
lower risk borrowers. From a protability standpoint, digital collateral increased the
(annualized) internal rate of return on the loans by 38 pp.
Our nding that moral hazard rather than adverse selection drives the majority of
the repayment increase is important because it suggests that credit provision is both
sustainable and acceptable to a large fraction of households, provided they are given the
right incentives. Therefore, the potential for digital collateral to expand access to credit
is signicant. By contrast, if we had found that most of the increase in repayment was
due to adverse selection, then digital collateral serves primarily as a screening device and
only a select subset of households are both willing and protable lending opportunities.
Our fourth nding is that the school-fee loan had a positive impact on both enrollment
and school expenditures. Children in households that were oered a school-fee loan were
signicantly more likely to be enrolled at school compared to children in the control
group. Accounting for loan take-up, the loans reduced the share of children who were
not enrolled by half (from 12% to 6%). In addition, households with loans increased
schooling related-expenditures by 44%. Increases in enrollment were concentrated among
males, but increases in expenditures were observed for both males and females.
Fifth, the loans did not have signicant eects on household balance sheets. Asset
purchases (sales) increased (decreased) moderately, but not signicantly, and household
borrowing was largely unchanged. Our estimates are precise enough to rule out large
4negative impacts on household balance sheet.
Altogether, our results suggest that digital collateral increases the share of customers to
whom a company can protably oer loans. Moreover, these loans signicantly increased
school enrollment and expenditures, suggesting that the customers did not have access to
other sources of nancing to pay for school fees. While our ndings are mostly positive,
securing loans with digital collateral is not without cost. First, there are costs to integrate
and install the lockout technology into a SHS. Second, there is an (ex-post) ineciency
associated with locking devices. In our sample, the SHS was locked for 50 of the rst 200
days from loan origination for the median household (Table 3). On one hand, this could
be viewed as a feature of the PAYGO contract; customers need not make payments on
days in which they do not require or have a low value for electricity, whereas borrowers
face permanent repossession if they fail to repay a traditional secured loan. On the other
hand, it suggests that there is potential room for improvement in the contract design.
Our study helps to explain why digital collateral is being employed in a range of
emerging applications. For example, PayJoy, a FinTech rm based in San Francisco,
developed a lockout technology for smart phones and has been oering digitally secured
credit for the purchase of smart phones since 2016. Similar to Fenix's school-fee loan
product, they recently started to oer secured cash loans to customers who have completed
the payments on the initial loan by recollateralizing the smart phone. Payjoy has large
scale operations in Mexico, and a small but growing customer base in South Africa, India,
Indonesia, and Zambia. With the proliferation of smart devices, secured lending via digital
collateral could easily be extended to a wide range of devices such as laptops, refrigerators,
and televisions. Importantly, the capacity to reuse collateral for future loans (as it has
been by Fenix and PayJoy) expands the potential impact of the innovation as a vehicle
for aordable access to credit.
A similar technology has been deployed in the United States for subprime auto loans.
Several rms have developed starter interrupt devices, which allow the lender to remotely
disable the ability to start the car if the borrower is not in good standing on the loan.
These devices have been installed in more than two million vehicles.3

5Finally, electric, telecommunication, and water companies have been using similar
contracts to nance last mile connection costs (Devoto et al., 2012; van den Berg and
Danilenko, 2014; Coville et al., 2021). In addition some utilities use their ow of services as
digital collateral to provide nancing for other asset purchases. For example, TELMEX,
a Mexican telecom provides secured loans to customers for the purchase of computer
equipment using the customers' access to internet service as digital collateral.4We believe
there is signicant potential for utilities to further scale the use of digital collateral in
providing aordable access to credit in LMICs.
2 Related Literature
Our paper relates to several dierent literatures including corporate and household -
nance, micronance, and education in development economics.
2.1 Collateral in Credit Markets
There is a large theoretical literature explaining the use of collateral in credit markets.
Our contribution to this literature is to explicitly model the repossession technology and
to understand how its properties impact equilibrium outcomes. Most relevant to our work
are the numerous papers that have illustrated how collateral can be useful to mitigate
ineciencies associated with moral hazard, adverse selection, and limited enforcement. In
a model with adverse selection, Bester (1985) shows that the credit rationing in Stiglitz
and Weiss (1981) can be (partially) overcome through the use of collateral as a screening
device: better credit risks post more collateral and receive a lower interest rate, thereby
eliminating the need for rationing.5Securing debt with collateral does not come without
cost: by assumption, posting collateral is more costly for riskier borrowers leading to
a single-crossing property that facilitates screening. Another explanation for the use of
collateral is to alleviate moral hazard problems: posting collateral makes it more costly
for a borrower to risk shift, shirk, or strategically default (Bester, 1987; Chan and Thakor,
4See https://telmex.com/web/hogar/credito-telmex.
5Similar ndings obtain in Chan and Kanatas (1985); Bester (1987); Besanko and Thakor (1987a,b).
61987; Tirole, 2006).6
There is also an extensive empirical literature on the role of collateral in credit markets.
Consistent with our experimental ndings, a number of papers have found observational
evidence consistent with moral hazard (Berger and Udell, 1990, 1995; Jimenez et al.,
2006).
There is also evidence that a more ecient repossession technology leads to credit
expansion. One source of ineciency are liquidation costs after repossession. (Assun c~ ao
et al., 2013) shows that loan spreads dropped and credit expanded, but default rates
increased after a Brazilian reform that simplied the sale of repossessed cars. Benmelech
and Bergman (2009) nds that debts secured by more redeployable collateral exhibit lower
credit spreads, higher credit ratings, and higher loan-to-value ratios. Another source of
ineciency are the costs associated with repossessing collateral after default due to weak
creditor rights. In countries with stronger creditor rights protection (and thus lower costs
of repossession), the credit markets are more developed, which may contribute to economic
growth (e.g., La Porta et al., 1998; Qian and Strahan, 2007; Djankov et al., 2007). The
potential economic benets of collateral are therefore more signicant in less developed
countries and countries with weaker creditor rights protection (Liberti and Mian, 2010;
Benmelech et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, borrowing secured is not without cost. Exhausting pledgeable assets may
mean losing nancial exibility and giving up protable future investment opportunities
(see, e.g., Acharya et al., 2007; Rampini and Viswanathan, 2010, 2013; Li et al., 2016;
Donaldson et al., 2019). By pledging collateral, a rm also limits its exibility to sell
or redeploy assets to craft a better business operation. Indeed, Benmelech et al. (2020)
document a signicant decline in secured debt (as a fraction of total debt) among US
rms over the twentieth century attributed in part to these reasons.
6The theoretical literature also illustrates other roles for the use of collateral (or control rights) in-
cluding incomplete contracts ((Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Hart and Moore, 1994)), monitoring incen-
tives (Rajan and Winton, 1995), priority (Ayotte and Bolton, 2011), limited enforcement (Rampini and
Viswanathan, 2013), exclusivity (Donaldson et al., 2019), and as a commitment device (DeMarzo, 2019).
72.2 Micronance
The eectiveness of microcredit as a tool to combat poverty appears to be more modest
than advocated by its early proponents and unlikely to be a major pathway out of poverty
for much of the population (Banerjee et al., 1994; Meager, 2019). Moreover, micronance
institutions (MFIs) are struggling as the costs of making small loans to poor clients are
high due to mediocre repayment (Cull et al., 2018). We demonstrate that securing loans
with digital collateral can signicantly reduce lending costs and remain both attractive
and seemingly benecial to households.
MFIs turned to joint liability lending as a means to address repayment issues. Under
joint liability small groups of borrowers are responsible for the repayment of each other's
loans. All group members are treated as being in default when at least one of them does
not repay and all members are denied subsequent loans. Because co-borrowers act as
guarantors they screen and monitor each other and in so doing reduce agency problems
between the MFI and its borrowers (Ghatak and Guinnane, 1999). Theory suggests that
joint liability may reduce adverse selection (Ghatak, 1999, 2000; Gangopadhyay et al.,
2005), ex-ante moral hazard by preventing excessively risky projects, shirking (Stiglitz,
1990; Banerjee et al., 1994; Laont and Rey, 2003), and ex-post moral hazard by pre-
venting nonrepayment in case of successful projects (Besley and Coate, 1995; Bhole and
Ogden, 2010).
However, the empirical evidence on the eectiveness of joint liability is mixed. At-
tanasio et al. (2015) nd no dierences in repayment rates between joint and individual
liability from a eld experiment in rural Mongolia. Gine and Karlan (2014) examine
the impact of joint liability on repayment through two experiments in the Philippines.
They nd that group liability did not aect repayment rates over the ensuing three years.
Carpena et al. (2012) exploit a natural experiment in which an Indian MFI switched from
individual to joint liability and nd that joint liability signicantly improved repayment
rates.
The downsides to joint-liability lending are that it often involves frequent and time-
consuming repayment meetings, making it potentially onerous for borrowers. In addition,
8it exerts strong social pressure and can suppress ecient risk taking (Gin e et al., 2010).
For these reasons, many MFIs (such as ASA, Grameen Bank II, and BancoSol) have
started to move from joint liability to individual lending (Cull et al., 2009).
Finally, while collateralized lending is not common in micronance, Jack et al. (2019)
use a eld experiment to study the potential for asset collateralization to expand access
to credit in rural Kenya. They nd that a reduction in the down payment on a water tank
from 25% to 4% led to a signicantly increase in take-up with only a modest increase in
default rates, which they attribute almost entirely to selection rather than moral hazard.
This is in contrast with our ndings that secured lending leads to a drastic increase in
repayment primarily driven by a reduction in moral hazard. These dierences are likely
attributable to dierences in study design and the contrast between traditional and digital
collateral. In Jack et al. (2019), all loans were secured by collateral|borrowers in default
faced physical repossession regardless of the treatment group. Whereas, in our study,
borrowers faced digital repossession when they were delinquent and not just in default,
but only if they were assigned to the secured treatment group.
2.3 Education in Developing Countries
Out-of-pocket costs are an important constraint to education in most African countries,
as families are asked to pay for things like school fees, books and supplies, lunch, uniforms
and transport (Williams et al., 2015). A number of recent observational studies nd that
reducing or eliminating those costs improve enrollment and educational attainment in
African countries ( _I scan et al., 2015; Moussa and Omoeva, 2020; Ajayi and Ross, 2020;
Adu Boahen and Yamauchi, 2017; Masuda and Yamauchi, 2018; Chicoine, 2019, 2020;
Delesalle, 2019; Valente, 2019; Moshoeshoe et al., 2019). Finally, a randomized controlled
trial of scholarships for students in Ghana, who had already passed the entrance exam
but lacked nancing, increased secondary and tertiary attainment (Duo et al., 2019).
To our knowledge, our study is the rst to demonstrate that loans are an eective
mechanism for increasing K-12 enrollment and school-related expenditures in LMICs.
However, for tertiary education, loans are common and have been studied in some middle
income countries such as Chile, South Africa and China (Solis, 2017; Gurgand et al.,
92011). While loans have been eective in improving college enrollment, several studies
have found evidence of adverse eects on students graduating with debt (Cai et al., 2019;
Dearden, 2019). In contrast, our study does not suggest K-12 loans add undue burden to
households' balance sheets.
3 Model
In this section, we propose a stylized model of collateralized lending. Our primary con-
tribution is to decompose the repossession technology into two independent parameters
(\lockout" and \recovery") in order to isolate and understand the role of each.
Our main ndings are as follows. First, using the lockout technology to secure a
loan increases borrower's repayment incentives thereby reducing the moral hazard prob-
lem. Second, lockout leads to positive selection : borrowers with suciently high (ex-ante)
income risk will be unwilling to accept a loan secured with digital collateral. In combina-
tion, these ndings imply that the lockout technology makes it easier for rms to recover
production costs and increases the supply of credit. With a monopolist rm, stronger
lockout technology leads to less strategic default and repossession in equilibrium, which is
in contrast to the eect of a higher recovery value. Despite the aforementioned attributes,
a stronger lockout technology does not necessarily increase welfare.
The model has two dates (0 and 1) and two types of agents (households and rms).
Households would like to purchase a durable good produced by rms, but have limited
wealth. Firms produce the good and can also provide nancing for it. However, due
to incomplete markets (e.g., moral hazard, adverse selection), rms require collateral in
order to underwrite household debt.
Households. There is a unit mass of households, indexed by i2[0;1]. Household i
derives utility from consuming the production good at date 1, denoted by ~ vi, which is
distributed according to Fon support [v ;v]2R. Household iprivately observes ~ viat the
beginning of date 1.7
7A higher realization of ~ vican be interpreted either as deriving from a shock leading to a particularly
high value for consuming the good or from a positive income shock and thus a lower marginal utility
10Each household has date-1 income denoted by ~ yi. Households are heterogeneous with
respect to income risk. With probability qi, household iexperiences an income shock
and ~yi= 0. With the complimentary probability, household ihas sucient income,
~yi=y >v, but may still choose to strategically default. Thus, higher qicorrespond to
riskier households. Without loss of generality, assume that qiis increasing in i. Households
know their risk type. Let Gandgdenote the distribution and density of risk types in the
population, which has support [0; 1]. For simplicity, we assume that all households have
the same wealth wi=wfor alliand that households are risk-neutral utility maximizers
with a discount factor normalized to 1.8
Firms. There areN1 identical rms. Each rm has the technology to produce a good
that generates value for households at date 1. Each rm has a marginal production cost
c. Firms also have the ability to provide nancing to their customers. At the beginning
of date 0, rms rst decide whether to enter (pay cto produce the good). Conditional on
entry, rms design a contract, which is a pair (d;p), where dis the downpayment required
at date 0 to take possession of the good and pis the price of consuming the good at date
1. If a household takes possession at date 0, but does not make the payment at date 1,
then the rm \repossesses" the good.9
Repossession. Should the borrower fail to repay, repossession has two implications.
First, the lender recovers something of value. Second, the household loses something of
value, which provides an incentive to repay the loan conditional on accepting it and an
incentive for riskier borrowers to decline the loan oer.
In most models of collateralized lending, these two roles, recovery and incentives, are
inseparable and characterized by a single parameter (e.g., Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997).
The lockout technology facilitates a decoupling of the two roles by providing incentives
from consumption of other goods.
8Risk-neutrality simplies the space of relevant contracts since there is no demand for intra- nor
inter-temporal consumption smoothing.
9We take the form of contract as given because it is representative of what is used in practice by
PAYGO providers and in our experiment. If households are identical (e.g., qi=qfor alli) or risk
is observable, then, under the Myerson's (1981) regularity condition, this contract is optimal within a
more general class of mechanisms in which the date-1 transfer and repossession are contingent on the
household's reported value.
11without the cost and benets associated with physical repossession. To separate the two
roles, we parameterize rms' repossession technology by the pair (;), where denotes
the eectiveness of recovery|it is the fraction of the production cost that the rm recovers
from repossession, and denotes the eectiveness on incentives|the borrower enjoys only
the fraction 1 times her value of the good in repossession.10
As discussed earlier, physical repossession is costly in economies with weak creditor
rights and limited enforcement. Therefore, a (traditional) collateralized loan, where the
asset is physically repossessed in default, is characterized by relatively low . A loan
collateralized with lockout involves no physical repossession in default (i.e., = 0), but
also little to no value for customers who default (i.e., close to 1). Our primary interest
will be to explore how an improvement in the lockout technology (i.e., increasing ) aects
household incentives and the equilibrium outcome.
We make the following parametric assumptions.
Assumption 1 (Trade is ecient ex-ante) .E[~vi]>c.
Assumption 2 (Repossession is inecient ex-post). v>c for allv2[v;v].
Given these assumptions, the rst-best outcome is for all households to purchase the
good and for rms to never repossess the good. This outcome can be sustained as an
equilibrium even without lockout if households have sucient wealth. Assumption 3 rules
out this possibility.
Assumption 3 (Households are nancially constrained). w<c v, but households that
do not experience a shock have sucient wealth and income to aord the good: w+y>c .
Finally, we impose the Myerson (1981) regularity assumption on the distribution of
household values, which is commonly used in auction theory and mechanism design.
Assumption 4 (Monotone virtual surplus). v 1 F(v)
f(v)is monotonically increasing in v.
10One can interpret as the probability with which the good is successfully repossessed from the
borrower and (1 )= as the rate of depreciation or the cost of repossession the good (as a fraction of
c).
123.1 Household Behavior
We begin by considering the behavior of households taking the contract ( d;p) as given.
Suppose that household ipurchases the good at date 0. The household will repay at date
1 provided that (i) it does not experience an income shock, and ( ii) that it's utility for
consuming the good is suciently high:
~vip
: (1)
The right hand side is decreasing in , meaning that a more eective lockout technology
leads to a higher probability of repayment.
Proposition 1 (Lockout Reduces Moral Hazard) .Fixing a contract, a more eective
lockout technology (i.e., higher ) decreases the probability that household istrategically
defaults.

S1(p)< dw < S 0(p). Then, there exists q2(0;1)such that only households with
income risk qiqchoose to purchase. Moreover, qis decreasing in .
This results shows that in combination with a downpayment, lockout leads to positive
13selection. Households with more credit risk prefer not to make a downpayment for the
good because they anticipate a higher chance of being locked out.

3.3 Equilibrium
The equilibrium will naturally depend both on the degree of competition among rms as
well as whether rms can observe households' risk type. In this section, we consider both
the monopolistic and competitive equilibrium with observable household risk.

14We decompose the problem into two steps. First, maximize prot conditional on selling
to household i. Then decide whether to sell to household i. Clearly, the rm's prot is
increasing in d. So it will be optimal to set di= minfw;Si(p)g. Thus, the rm's problem
can be written as
max
p(minfw;S i(p)g+Ri(p) c)
Consider the problem of maximizing date-1 revenue with respect to the lowest type
that strategically defaults, v=p=. The marginal revenue to the rm of increasing vis

which has a unique solution by Assumption 4. Notice that vis independent of qi, and
increases with , but decreases with . Higheror higherboth correspond to a \better"
repossession technology, but they have dierent eects on the marginal household type
who strategically defaults; higher gives the rm more incentive to repossess which
always increases v, whereas higher decreasesv. Equation (5) is intimately linked to
the monopoly price. In particular, when households' nancial constraints are severe, the
monopoly price is pv.

monopolist problem involves di=wand

i(w)otherwise
When household wealth is small, the monopolist prioritizes date-1 revenue by charging
pi=p. Whenw > Si(p), the rm charges less than pat date 1 in order to extract a
larger downpayment. Focusing on the rst case, we have the following contrast between
the two roles of repossession.
15Proposition 3 (Recovery vs Incentives). When the rm is a monopolist and household
wealth is suciently small, i.e., w<Si(p):
More ecient recovery (higher ) leads to more strategic default and repossession.
More eective lockout (higher ) leads to less strategic default and less repossession.
Highergives the rm more incentive to repossess the good and makes strategic
default less of a concern. So the rm sets a higher price and households default more
frequently. Stronger lockout has the opposite eect. It makes strategic default more
costly to the rm since it increases the wedge between the rm's payo conditional on
repayment and the payo conditional on default.
If the implied prot from the contract in Lemma 1 is positive, then it is optimal for
the rm to sell to household i. Otherwise, the household will reject any oers that the
rm is willing to make.
Proposition 4 (Monopoly Quantities) .The monopolist will sell to household iif and
only if either
(i)w+Ri(p)cwhenSi(p)w, or
(ii)w+Ri(S 1
i(w))cotherwise.
Noting that both RiandSiare decreasing in qi, we can conclude that positive selection
also emerges as an equilibrium outcome.
Corollary 1. For any >0, there exists qsuch that only households with qi< qwill
purchase the good.
Since the downpayment is simply a transfer, we can ignore it when computing total
suplus. The total surplus in the economy is given by
TS=Zq
0(Ri(pi) +Si(pi) c)dG(qi):
Total rm prot and consumer surplus are given by  =Rq
0i(di;pi)dG(qi) andCS=
Rq
0Ui(di;pi)dG(qi).
163.3.2 Competitive Firms
When rms compete for households, they oer the contract that maximizes each house-
hold's welfare subject to breaking even. That is, the contract oered to household isolves
(di;pi)2arg max
d;pUi(d;p)
s:t: i(d;p)0(6)
Household expected utility is decreasing in both dandp. However, the deposit is purely a
transfer while a higher pdestroys more surplus. Therefore, to maximize household utility,
rms minimize pisubject to breaking even.
Proposition 5 (Competitive Equilibrium) .In a competitive equilibrium:
1. The household purchases the good if and only if condition (i) or (ii) from Proposi-
tion 4 is satised. Otherwise, there does not exist a contract such that both the rm
breaks even and the household is willing to purchase.
2. If the household purchases the good then dc
i=wandpc
iis the lowest price such that
Ri(pc
i) =c w.
Notice that the household purchases under the exact same conditions as when the rm
is a monopolist. Thus, Corollary 1 also holds with competitive rms and any implications
for total surplus apply to both settings. Of course, the price oered by competitive rms
is lower for all but the marginal household.

Quantity and prot is increasing in as illustrated in the top panels of Figure 1.
Household welfare increases with on the extensive margin (q i=q) as more households
get served. However, households that were already purchasing the good (q i< q) face
higher date-1 prices. As a result, aggregate household welfare can decrease with . This
possibility is clearly illustrated in Figure 1(b), where both household and total surplus
decreases for large enough. Intuitively, a stronger lockout technology increases the
incentive to repay, but also destroys more value when the household defaults. This eect
is most pronounced on households with higher income risk as they are more likely to
default for non-strategic reasons.
Perhaps surprisingly, the decrease in household welfare and total surplus can also
obtain when rms are perfectly competitive as illustrated in Figure 2(b). These ndings
suggest that a more lenient repossession policy may be preferable. For example, the rm
could reposess the good only after a certain number of missed payments or only with
some probability less than one. Indeed, a key innovation of the PAYGO model is that the
punishment for missing a payment is not too severe. Failure to make a payment results
18in a punishment that is proportional to the ow value of consuming the good rather than
the stock value (i.e., physical repossession).

3.4 Reusing digital collateral
The households in our experiment have already purchased the good and completed pay-
ments on the loan. The product that they are oered is a follow-up loan for school fees in
which some fraction of the households are required to (re)-pledge the SHS as collateral in
order to be eligible for the loan. It is straightforward to extend most of the results above
to this setting. Increasing reduces both moral hazard and adverse selection. Yet, higher
destroys more surplus after negative income shocks and therefore may reduce overall
welfare.
Unlike the model above, a downpayment on a follow-up loan is not necessary to get
positive selection|the act re-pledging collateral serves the role of the downpayment.
Nevertheless, a feature of the loan product oered in our experiment is that it requires
households to make a cash deposit (several days in advance) when the loan funds are
disbursed, which can serve as an additional screening device.11
11To illustrate this claim, consider a three-date model, in which the household receives some income at
194 Experimental Setting
We test the eect of digital collateral on a school-fee loan product oered by Fenix Inter-
national, a solar home system technology company operating in Africa. As of mid-2019,
Fenix had more than half a million solar home system (SHS) customers across 6 countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa.12They are the largest SHS provider in Uganda.13Fenix's most
popular system is 10 Watts and is able to power LED lamps and a radio, and charge cell
phones.14Fenix's solar home systems dier in several ways from the solar panels on homes
in the US and Western Europe. First, they are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller
than the typical solar panel installation on a US or Western European home. Second,
they are standalone systems, meaning they are not connected to a grid.
Like most SHS providers, Fenix sells most of its units through a PAYGO model.15
Customers make a small down payment, less than $10, to take possession of the SHS.
Customers make small (usually daily or weekly) payments using mobile money until they
have paid o the loan. If a customer does not make a payment on time, the SHS will lock
(i.e., the battery will not discharge electricity) until the next payment is made.
Fenix also uses the remote payment and locking technology to oer products upgrades
and additional loans. Their most popular follow-up product is a school-fee loan. These
are cash loans oered to the better-paying customers three times a year at the beginning
of school terms. As with the original SHS loan, customers make a small down payment
and then Fenix transfers money to the customer's mobile money account. The deposit
date 0, has an investment opportunity at date 1, and receives additional income at date 2. The household
owns a good that delivers value ~ vat date 2 and can be pledged as collateral for a loan at date 1. The rm
oers a contact (d;L;p ), wheredis the downpayment at date 0, Lis the amount of the loan at date 1,
andpis the price the household must pay at date 2 in order to avoid repossession. If income is persistent
then being able to make the downpayment at date 0 is a positive signal about the household's ability
to repay the loan at date 2 and serves as an additional screening device above and beyond household's
willingness to pledge their collateral at date 1.

20covers administrative fees and gives the customer a seven day grace period before the
device is subject to being locked. After the grace period, if the customer does not make a
daily payment, the system will lock and the customer will not be able to use it until they
make their next payment.
Our study focused on a 300,000 Ugandan Shilling (UGX) loan ($81).16Obtaining the
loan requires customers make a deposit of 20% (60,000 UGX, or $16).17Several days after
making the deposit, the funds are disbursed to the customer via mobile money. Customers
receive seven free days of light after which they are responsible for making daily payments
of 3,000 UGX (less than $1) for 100 days. Most customers choose to pay for several days or
a week of light at a time rather than make daily payments. Fenix considers the loan to be
paid o as long as the customer makes nominal payments totaling $81 (not including the
deposit) within 145 days of the loan issue date. This arrangement implies that customers
who take longer to repay face a lower eective interest rate. For instance, a customer who
makes a payment every day pays an annual percentage rate (APR) of 168%, whereas a
customer who makes a payment only two out of every three days pays an APR of only
112%. Of course, the latter APR does not reect the cost of losing access to the SHS on
locked days.
Customers who do not pay o the loan within 45 days of the target repayment date
face interest charges of 2% per month on any remaining principal. In addition, failure
to repay the loan in a timely manner renders customers ineligible for futures loan oers.
After 180 days of no payments, the loan is considered to be in default and Fenix reserves
the right to repossess the SHS system. In practice, only a very small fraction of defaults
(less than 5%) result in physical repossession, which is consistent with our hypothesis that
the traditional repossession technology is expensive and ineective in this setting.

17While down payments on collateralized loans are standard, a deposit in advance of a cash loan is an
uncommon practice. We explore the eects of this feature and potential mechanisms in Gertler et al.
(2021).
214.1 Background: Education and School Fees in Uganda
Formal schooling in Uganda starts at age 5. Primary school extends for seven years,
through age 12. Secondary school is for children aged 13-20. Primary and secondary-aged
children in Uganda have access to both government and privately run schools. In 2016,
the most recent year for which data are available, 80% of primary-aged students attended
government-run schools and 20% attended privately run schools. At the secondary level,
over 50% of children attend private schools.18The government has oered a universal
primary education program since 1997, although in practice not all students have access
to subsidized primary education, and even those that do incur expenses for uniforms,
books, school lunches and other supplies.
School fees and school related expenditures constitute a non-trivial portion of house-
hold expenses in Uganda. Conditional on enrollment, the median household spends 14%
of income on primary education and 21% of income on secondary education based on data
from the 2019 nationally representative Living Standards Measurement Survey. School
fees for both government and public schools are typically due three times per year. Two
of the three due dates are not proximate to harvest season, and hence are periods of low
income across rural Uganda. In one study, 53% of families reported having their children
sent home because they were unable to pay school fees (Intermedia, 2016).
5 Experimental Design
Figure 3 illustrates our experimental design. Our universe of eligible loan recipients
consisted of Fenix customers that repaid the initial loan on their solar home system and
did not have an outstanding school-fee loan. In May 2019 we sent an SMS message to the
27,081 eligible customers inviting them to reply if they were interested in a school-fee loan
and 3,300 customers (12%) responded. Table A.1, columns (1) and (2) uses administrative
data to compare our sample of Fenix customers to population-wide statistics from rural
Uganda based on the 2019 World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS).
18Statistics from the Uganda Ministry of Education and Sports at http://www.education.go.ug/wp-
content/uploads/2019/07/FACT-SHEET-2016.pdf
22Fenix customers are more likely to be male and married and have more children than
the typical rural Ugandan head of household. They also are more likely to be employed
outside the agricultural sector and more likely to come from the (relatively more wealthy)
central region.
We randomly allocated the interested customers into four groups - a control group, a
treatment group that was required to post their SHS as (digital) collateral to get the loan
(\Secured"), a treatment group that did not have to post collateral (\Unsecured"), and
a treatment group that were oered a secured loan but were later informed they would
not have to post collateral (\Surprise Unsecured").19The Surprise Unsecured group was
treated the same as the Secured group until after they had accepted the loan, at which
point these households were informed that they would in fact not have to post collateral
to get the loan.
Following Karlan and Zinman (2009), this surprise allows us to separately identify
moral hazard and adverse selection. More specically, we identify the pure moral hazard
eect by comparing repayment of the Secured group to the Surprise Unsecured group|
both received and accepted the secured loan oer. We identify the pure adverse selection
eect by comparing the Unsecured group to the Surprise Unsecured loans|neither group
was ultimately required to post collateral, but the latter group accepted the loan expecting
that they would have to post collateral.
Our call center attempted to reach the households in each treatment group using the
phone number to which we had sent the SMS messages. In the treatment groups, the
call center reached over 80% of households. The call center explained that the customers
were eligible for a loan and asked if they were interested in proceeding. The Secured and
Surprise Unsecured treatment groups were informed they would have to post their SHS
as (digital) collateral to obtain the loan, whereas the Unsecured treatment group was
informed they would not have to post collateral.
Field teams administered a baseline survey to the set of customers that were oered
a loan and the control group. In some cases, the eld team reached households in the
19The experiment also included a small group of customers that were given the choice between a secured
and unsecured loan, which we do not discuss in this paper.
23Surprise Unsecured treatment group and revealed the surprise before the household had
made the deposit to nalize the loan. Thus, we observed a multi-stage decision process,
in which households rst verbally accepted the loan terms, but then only about half of
those customers made the deposit. Given that some of the households in the surprise
group knew they would not have to post collateral before they made the second decision
(to pay the deposit), we separately considered only households that paid the deposit prior
to interaction with the eld team as a robustness check.
All households who received a loan were sent regular SMS payment reminders: on the
payment due date, if they were two days late, and again if they were one week late in
making a payment. This is standard practice for Fenix and is useful to rule out alternative
hypothesis as we will discuss in more detail below. We also conducted an endline survey
six months after the loans had been disbursed.
6 Experimental Results
We delineate our experimental results into three categories: (i) take-up rates, (ii) repay-
ment and protability, and (iii) educational and balance sheet outcomes.
6.1 Take-up Rates
Take-up rates were high across all treatment groups. The bottom row of Figure 3 indicates
the share of households in each group that took the loan as a share of households that
the call center was able to reach. Consistent with our model, we see a clear indication
that requiring households to post digital collateral serves as a screening device: 45% of
households take the secured loan compared to 51% who take the unsecured loan.
Table A.2 in the Appendix explores whether there are signicant dierences in the
baseline characteristics of the households that took up the loan across treatment groups.
Most baseline characteristics are statistically indistinguishable across the two groups,
suggesting that digital collateral is screening on characteristics that are not captured by
variables in administrative or survey data.
246.2 Repayment and Protability
Repayment We measure repayment as the household's cumulative payments towards
the principal divided by the total loan principal (i.e., the fraction of principal repaid).20
Figure 4(a) plots the fraction of principal repaid over time for customers in the three
treatment groups. Figure 4(b) plots the dierences between the three groups.
Consistent with our model's predictions, repayment in the Secured group is consis-
tently higher than repayment in either Unsecured group. Overall, digital collateral in-
creased repayment by 13 pp at both 100 days (from 46% to 59%) and 150 days (57%
to 70%). As discussed above, the moral hazard eect is derived by comparing repay-
ment in the Secured group to repayment in the Surprise Unsecured group; the selection
mechanisms were the same in these two groups as they both were told they would be
required to post digital collateral. This accounts for the bulk of the overall eect: 9 pp at
both 100 and 150 days. The adverse selection eect is derived by comparing repayment
in the Surprise group to the Unsecured group; both groups faced the same incentive to
repay conditional on taking-up the loan since neither was required to post collateral. This
accounts for 4-5 pp of the overall eect.
Table 1, Panel A presents results from regression specications of the following form:
rit=t+tTreatment group i+it; (7)
whereritis the repayment rate for household iaftertdays from loan origination. The
treatment eect is t,tis a constant, and itis an error term. The results in Table 1 reect
Local Average Treatment Eects (LATE) estimates, accounting for imperfect compliance
(i.e., the fact that some customers who were supposed to be locked were unlocked for
some days and vice versa).21The column labeled \Secured" captures the total eect of
20Fenix credits commissions to customers who refer other customers to Fenix, and we include payments
from these commissions, although they account for less than 0.05% of total payments towards principal.
21Altogether, fewer than 10% of the loan days were not in compliance. There were two general types
of imperfect compliance: (1) administrative errors at the beginning of the experiment, and (2) customers
who had additional transactions with Fenix over the study period, for example to upgrade their solar
home system, and were sometimes switched to the wrong locking arrangement. See Appendix A Tables
A.5 and A.6 for more details and for the Intent to Treat (ITT) estimates of the specications reported
in Table 1, respectively.
25securing loans with digital collateral. Specications in this column include households in
the Secured and Unsecured groups, where Treatmentgroup iis equal to one for households
in the Secured group. Specications in the column labeled \Adverse Selection" include
households in the Surprise and Unsecured groups, where Treatment group iis equal to
one for households in the Surprise group. Specications in the columns labeled \Moral
Hazard" include households in the Secured and Surprise groups, where Treatmentgroup i
is equal to one for households in the Secured group. The rows report the results at
t= 100, 150 and 200 from origination. The last column provides the p-values for the
hypothesis test that the moral hazard eect is equal to the adverse selection eect. The
standard errors indicate that the overall lockout eect is signicant at the 1% level, the
moral hazard eect signicant at the 5% level while the adverse selection eect is not
statistically signicant.
As an alternative measure of repayment, we consider the fraction of loans that have
completed payments in Table 1, Panel B. A loan is recorded as completed when the repay-
ment rate equals one. Our results convey a similar message under this alternative measure.
Lockout leads to a 19 pp increase in the completion rate after 200 days, with moral hazard
accounting for slightly more than two thirds of the eect and adverse selection accounting
for slightly less than one third of the total eect.
Protability To understand how customer repayment translates to rm protability,
we calculate the monthly internal rate of return (IRR) on loan portfolios.22Table 2
summarizes the results, and shows that using digital collateral increased protability by
3.2 pp (38 pp annualized). When we restrict attention to loans with perfect compliance
(see Table A.8), the increase in protability is even larger 4.5 pp (54 pp annualized).
We sorted households into terciles based on their repayment history prior to taking the
school-fee loan (i.e., account percent locked).23Loans in each tercile are formed into a
portfolio. The rst tercile corresponds to households with the highest repayment rates
22The internal rate of return is the discount rate such that the net present value of cash ows on the
portfolio is equal to zero.
23Account percent locked is the percentage of days in which the household's SHS was locked due to
non-repayment of loans prior to taking the school-fee loan. While all had completed payments on the
original SHS loan, some took longer to do so and thereby were locked a higher percentage of days.
26prior to taking the school-fee loan. Table 2 illustrates that digital collateral increased
protability by more for the rst two terciles (3.9 pp and 3.8 pp respectively) than it did
for the third tercile (1.8 pp).
It is noteworthy that all of the unsecured loan terciles have a negative IRR and only
the rst tercile of secured loans has a positive IRR. There are several takeaways from this
nding. First, the unsecured lending contract is not protable even among households
who have previously been good repayers. Second, securing a loan with digital collateral
does not ensure protability. Screening remains a necessary component of a sustainable
lending business. For the purposes of this study, we expanded Fenix's eligibility criterion
and increased the loan size. Under Fenix's usual business practices, (i) all school-fee
loans are secured, (ii) only households with above median repayment history (among our
sample of loans) would be eligible for a school-fee loan, and (iii) as rst-time borrowers,
they would only be eligible for a loan one-third of the size.24Thus, our ndings are
consistent with Fenix's usual business practices being value maximizing.
For more perspective on protability, we calculated IRRs for school-fee loans that
Fenix had oered in prior school terms (in 2018) under their usual business practices,
again broken into terciles based on repayment history. As illustrated by the bottom row
of Table 2), the prior school-fee loans have signicantly better repayment history and are
considerably more protable. The monthly IRR is 6.6%, 6.0%, and 3.2% across the three
terciles with an average monthly IRR of 5.1%.
Heterogeneity across households Table 4 analyzes the treatment impact on repay-
ment rates and loan completion for households that were above and below median number
of days locked on the original SHS loan. This allows us to assess the extent to which
households with higher a priori risk levels had lower repayment and loan completion rates
because of selection or moral hazard. The coecients on the interaction term in Table
4 suggest that digital collateral increased repayments and completion slightly more for
riskier households (with above median number of days locked on their original solar home
24Our study oered 300,000 UGX ($81) loans to customers who had never had a school-fee loan, while
the prior school-fee loans were smaller (100,000 UGX, $27) for rst-time borrowers. Fenix oers larger
loan sizes to customers after they have successfully paid o their rst school-fee loan.
27system loan). Interestingly, virtually all of the increase in repayment for higher risk house-
holds is due to moral hazard and not selection, whereas the opposite is true for lower risk
households.
Second, we analyze heterogeneity in willingness to pay (WTP) for the electricity pro-
vided by the SHS. If we incorporated this heterogeneity into our model, it would predict
that households with a higher WTP would be less willing to accept a locked loan com-
pared to lower WTP households. Figure 5 analyzes loan take-up by respondent's stated
WTP for a extra day of access to their SHS.25We group the responses into three cate-
gories and see that indeed households with the highest WTP are signicantly less likely
to accept a secured loan compared to an unsecured loan, while households in the lower
two groups are equally likely to accept them. Also consistent with our model, we found
the eect on repayment is larger for households with above median WTP for solar (see
Table A.21). For instance, the eect of requiring digital collateral is 10 pp higher at 150
days for households with above (vs below) median willingness to pay.
We also test robustness of our main estimates by exploring heterogeneity with respect
to how quickly households accepted the loan. In particular, some of the households in the
Surprise Unsecured group were notied by our eld sta that they would not be required
to post collateral before completing the paperwork and making the deposit. It is possible
that the households who made the deposit after they were notied were dierent than the
households who accepted a secured loan.26To understand by how much this potential
selection is driving our decomposition results, we re-estimated versions of the specications
in Table 1 using only those households that completed the deposit before they were visited
by our eld sta. These results are reported in Table A.7 in the Appendix. Interestingly,
the overall eect of digital collateral on repayment is almost two times as large among this
set of people, pointing to considerable heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the overall conclusion
that moral hazard explains the bulk of the eect remains.
25Until recently, Fenix's systems did not record the number of hours of use by households, so we could
not use that as a revealed preference measure of value, although even average hours of usage would be
an imperfect measure.
26Note that this potential selection does not impact the estimate of the overall eect.
286.3 Schooling and Household Balance Sheet Outcomes
While the results presented thus far clearly suggest that securing loans with digital col-
lateral increases repayment and rm prots, we are also interested in the impacts of the
loans on household-level outcomes. At a high level, access to credit may facilitate welfare-
enhancing investments for households (e.g., schooling). On the other hand, loans with
high interest rates, especially if they are misunderstood by customers, may have detri-
mental eects on households' balance sheet. We rst examine schooling outcomes and
then present results on households' balance sheet.
Schooling outcomes As discussed in Section 4, the loans we study were oered in
May 2019, just before school fees were due for Term 2. The product was marketed as a
school-fee loan, though Fenix oered them to all eligible customers, regardless of whether
they had school-aged children. Yet, almost 90% of our sample households had school-aged
children and 92% who accepted a school-fee loan reported using it for education-related
expenditures.
To understand whether the loans had an impact on schooling outcomes, we estimate
the following equations:
yi=+Loan Oeri+i (8)
yi=+[Loani+i; (9)
whereyiis an outcome variable for household i. Equation (8) yields the intent to treat
(ITT) estimates, where Loan Oeriis an indicator for a household that was oered a
loan through one of the three (locked, surprise unlocked, unlocked) groups. Equation (9),
estimated by instrumenting for Loaniwith Loan Oeri, yields the local average treat-
ment eect (LATE) for households that accepted loans.27In what follows, we focus on
discussing the LATE estimates, and the ITT estimates are reported in the Appendix.
Table 5 reports results from estimates of (9) for several schooling-related outcomes.
27We also estimated specications that allowed the loan impacts to vary by treatment group but saw
no signicant dierences in the eect size across the treatment groups.
29The rst two columns report impacts on the share of 5 to 20-year-old children within a
household who are enrolled in school. The sample is restricted to households that had at
least one child in that age range at the endline survey. The results indicate that the loan
increased the fraction of households who enrolled all of their school-aged children by 6
pp. Given that 88 percent of children in the control group are enrolled, access to the loan
reduced the share of children who are not enrolled by just over half.28
The third column on Table 5 analyzes the impact on monthly absences from school
for households that had at least one child enrolled. The coecients are precisely esti-
mated and suggest no meaningful impact on days absent. The fourth column shows that
expenditures for school-related items (including school fees, uniforms, supplies, transport
and meals) increased by 34.6% for households who received a loan.29The increase in
school-related expenditures corresponds to roughly 44% of the loan amount (net of the
deposit) or $29.7.
Table 6 presents the LATE results on enrollment and expenditures by child, separating
outcomes for males and females. The unit of observation is now the child and not the
household. We therefore cluster standard errors at the household level for statistical
inference. This table indicates that the increased enrollment was concentrated among
male children, who have a lower base rate (control mean) of enrollment, possibly because
they were more likely to be working. The loan then may have not only been used to cover
school costs but also used to oset lost income from reduced child labor supply. The loan
was associated with a signicant increase in school expenditures for both males (29 pp)
and females (46 pp) by a similar magnitude to the household-level results.
In summary, Fenix's loans had an economically meaningful and statistically signicant
impact on educational outcomes. These ndings suggest that households did not have
another source of liquidity to use for schooling-related expenditures. The Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS) reinforces this interpretation: only 3% of households in the
LSMS had a loan with a commercial bank, only 6% had other formal loans, and only 1%
28Enrollment rates among households in our sample appear roughly comparable to enrollment rates
for the population. According to the Living Standards Measurement Survey, nationwide 91% of primary
school-aged children and 68% of secondary school-aged children are enrolled at school.
29The estimated coecient of the loan on log expenditures is 0.297. So, the percentage increase in
expenditures for households who received a loan is e0:297 1 = 34:6%.
30had a loan with a micronance institution.
Household balance sheet Table 7 reports results on household asset purchases, sales,
and borrowing in the six months prior to endline survey. The eect of the loan on
households balance sheet is not statistically signicant eect in any category. Moreover,
based on the standard errors, we can rule out large negative impacts on households that
took loans, such as a signicant increase in asset sales or reduction in purchases. We
repeated the analysis using endline asset, loans and balance sheet level variables in Table
8. The estimated eect of the loan on household net balance is small and is not statistically
dierent from zero. For additional perspectives on households' nancial position, we
asked a series of questions about shocks households had experienced, including nancial
shocks, and their ability to weather those shocks. The results are summarized in Table
A.11. Again, we see no systematic or signicant dierences between households that were
oered loans and the control group.
7 Discussion
We have interpreted digital collateral as providing a repayment incentive for households
that reduces both moral hazard and adverse selection. An alternative interpretation is
that getting locked simply serves as a reminder or a nudge to repay. Indeed, there is
evidence that payment reminders increase on-time repayment (Cadena and Schoar, 2011;
Medina, 2020). In our setting, this explanation is less plausible because all of the borrowers
(secured or unsecured) received frequent payment reminders. Fenix sent reminders to all
customers three days and one day before payment was due, on the day the payment was
due, when the customer was two days late, and when the customer was one week late.
The estimated eect of digital collateral on reducing moral hazard is large and signif-
icant. Yet, it is possible that our estimate is biased downward for the following reason.
Fenix oers school-fee loans three times per year. In order to be eligible, the customer
must have completed payments on their prior school-fee loan (i.e., completed the loan
within 120 days). Thus, households with a high continuation value for a loan in the
31next term have a strong incentive to complete payments in a timely manner regardless of
whether digital collateral is applied.30If the set of households with a high continuation
value overlaps with the set of households that responds to the incentives from lockout,
then our estimate is biased downward.
To get a sense for the magnitude of the bias, suppose a fraction qof such households
have a high continuation value and complete payments within 120 days regardless of
whether or not lockout is applied. Absent this high continuation value, the true eect of
lockout on increasing loan completion is m.31If continuation value and willingness to pay
are independently distributed, then we would estimate the (moral hazard) eect on loan
completion to be (1  q)m. Under the assumption of independence, we can provide an
upper bound on musing the observation that 40% of households in the surprise unlocked
treatment complete the loan within 120 days. Thus, qis at most 0.4 and mis at most
two thirds larger than the eect size that we estimate.
Our nding that adverse selection accounts for a smaller portion of the increase in
repayment than does moral hazard can partially be attributed to the fact that our sample
has already been screened via other measures. First, in order to be eligible for the school-
fee loan, customers must have already successfully completed payments on the initial SHS
loan. The adverse selection eect is likely to be larger on the initial loan. Second, eligible
school-fee loan customers are required to put down a 20% deposit before getting the school-
fee loan. In an experiment on a dierent sample of Fenix customers, we investigated the
role of the deposit and found evidence consistent with it serving as a screening device
(Gertler et al., 2021).
In addition to reducing moral hazard and adverse selection, there are other potential
benets of loans secured with digital collateral. First, the digitally collaterized contract
eectively functions as a commitment-savings device. Much like a typical fully amortiz-
ing mortgage contract, each payment that a customer makes covers both interest and
principal. The principal payment is akin to savings. This savings vehicle can be partic-
30Consistent with this view, notice that Figure 4(c) exhibits a moderate increase in the rate of loan
completion right near the 120 day for all treatment groups.
31Within the context of the model from Section 3, if we consider a locked loan to have = 1 and an
unlocked loan to have = 0, thenm= 1 F(p) is simply the fraction of households with vigreater than
the price.
32ularly valuable to households who lack self control because there is an added incentive
to save (Laibson, 1994)|failure to do so means facing temporary repossession, and the
savings are illiquid and cannot be easily or immediately accessed (Laibson, 1997). Sec-
ond, if lenders lack commitment power to physically repossess collateral, they may face a
hold-up problem (Hart and Moore, 1998) from strategic borrowers who know they will be
tempted to renegotiate rather then incur repossession costs. By eectively lowering the
lender's repossession cost, the lockout technology provides a credible method to avoid the
hold-up problem.
Finally, because repossessing digital collateral imposes a cost on borrowers without
any reciprocal benet to lenders, it may raise ethical questions especially if the primary
reason for nonpayment is due to income shocks rather than strategic default. Are there
nancial contracts that are too punitive for borrowers? Should governments regulate
certain contracts on ethical grounds?32These are important questions, and our study aims
to provide evidence useful to inform answers. However, for the particular product in our
experiment, we do not believe they should be of much concern. First, as discussed earlier,
digital repossession in our setting is temporary and reversible, so it can be signicantly
less punitive than physical repossession, a practice that is widely accepted. Second, the
magnitude of the cost imposed on households by digital repossession of their SHS is small
compared to those that are usually restricted on moral grounds (e.g., imprisonment or
bondage). Finally, the households in our study are familiar with the contractual terms
and appear to make informed decisions: households with a higher willingness to pay for
the service ow from the SHS were signicantly less likely to take-up secured loans.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we explore a novel form of nancial contracting that uses lockout technol-
ogy to create digital collateral, which does not require physical repossession. Rather, the
lender temporarily disables the ow value of the collateral to the borrower when the bor-
32An economic reason to regulate certain types of nancial contracts is if the punishments impose
externalities on third-parties (Bond and Newman, 2009).
33rower misses a payment. We show that digitally collateralized loans exhibit signicantly
higher repayment and are therefore substantially more protable to the lender. About
one-third of the increase in repayment can be attributed to screening and about two-
thirds to reducing moral hazard. Access to these loans had positive eects on educational
outcomes and did not have negative eects on households' balance sheet.
Our nding that moral hazard drives the majority of the repayment increase implies
that credit provision is both sustainable and acceptable to a large fraction of households,
provided they are given the right incentives. Therefore, the potential for digital collateral
to expand access to credit is signicant. By contrast, if we had found that adverse
selection drove most of the increase in repayment, then digital collateral serves primarily
as a screening device and only a select subset of households provide protable lending
opportunities.
Our eld experiment also demonstrates the potential for private institutions to oer
digitally collateralized loans to pay for schooling, resulting in increased enrollment and
expenditures without placing a long-term nancial burden on the family. This result is
important as schooling-related costs are large relative to income and must be paid in
periods of low income for many households, especially those working in agriculture and
other informal jobs.
There are numerous other potential applications in which digital collateral could be uti-
lized to provide cheaper access to credit, which appear especially promising in economies
with an underdeveloped banking and nancial system. With the proliferation of smart
devices, secured lending via digital collateral could easily be extended to a wide range
of devices such as smartphones,laptops, refrigerators, automobiles, and televisions. Im-
portantly, the capacity to reuse collateral for future loans (as it has been by Fenix and
PayJoy) expands the potential impact of the innovation as a vehicle for aordable ac-
cess to credit. Many utility companies (e.g., electric, telecommunication, and water) are
able to remotely disable service and thus natural candidates for oering credit secured
by access to the ow of services they provide. We believe there is signicant potential
for utilities to further scale the use of digital collateral in providing aordable access to
credit in LMICs.

Note: Standard errors in parentheses. Loan repayment is measured by the cumulative proportion of
the loan principal repaid (Panel A). Loan completion describes whether the loan principal has been
repaid (Panel B). The above results display the Local Average Treatment Eect (LATE), which measures
the average treatment eect on loan repayment (completion) for compliers, using the share of days in
compliance as the endogenous variable (see the Appendix for Intent to Treat (ITT) results). The analysis
is run on samples at either the 100th, 110th, 150th, or 200th day from origination. \Lockout" captures
the dierence in the repayment (completion) rate between the Unsecured and Secured samples, \Adverse
Selection" captures the dierence in the repayment (completion) rate between the Unsecured and Surprise
Unsecured samples, and \Moral Hazard" captures the dierence in the repayment (completion) rate

Note: Loans in each treatment group are sorted by proportion of days locked at SMS and divided into
equal-sized terciles. Loans in each tercile are formed into a portfolio. The internal rate of return (IRR) is
the discount rate that makes the net present value of cash ows on the portfolio equal to zero. The IRRs
of portfolios formed using all loans in each treatment group are also reported. The range of the fraction
of days locked is reported in square brackets.

results display the Local Average Treatment Eect (LATE), which measures the average treatment eect
on either loan repayment or loan completion for compliers, using the share of days in compliance as the
endogenous variable. The analysis is run on the sample at the 150th day (for loan repayment) or 200th day
(for loan completion) from origination. Under \Lockout" where the subsample is those who were assigned
Secured or Unsecured, \Treatment" captures the treatment eect of Secured. Under \Adverse Selection"

Note: In this analysis, we exclude customers with imperfect compliance (i.e., customers who were sup-
posed to be locked were unlocked for some days and vice versa). Loans in each treatment group are
sorted by proportion of days locked at SMS and divided into equal-sized terciles. Loans in each tercile
are formed into a portfolio. The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net
present value of cash ows on the portfolio equal to zero. The IRRs of portfolios formed using all loans
in each treatment group are also reported. The range of the fraction of days locked is reported in square
brackets.

Note: This gure covers the sample of 950 individuals, of which 344 are treated with Secured loans and
606 are treated with Unsecured loans. Individuals treated with Surprise Unsecured loans are excluded
from this gure. Individuals with willingness to pay to unlock next day being 0 or 1,000 UGX are
in the rst group, being 2,000 or 3,000 UGX in the second group, and being 4,000 or 5,000 in the
third group. The average loan take-up by willingness to pay is plotted and 95% condence intervals
are along with the bars. Note that 1 USD was equal to approximately 3,704 UGX in 2019 (Source:

71B Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1. Householdistrategically defaults with probability (1  qi)F(p=), where F() is
a cdf and therefore increasing in its argument. Fixing p, asincreases the argument, p=, decreases and
therefore so too does (1  qi)F(p=).
Proof of Proposition 2. By hypothesis, S1(p) = (1 )E(~vi)< S 0(p) =Rv
vmaxfv p;(1 )vgdF(v).
Hence, there must exist vsuch that the household does not strategically default (i.e.,  v > p=) and
thereforeSi(p) is strictly decreasing in qi. Further, observe that Si(p) is continuous in qi. By the
intermediate value theorem, there must exist a qj2(0;1) such that Sj(q) =dw. From (2), all isuch
thatqiqjwill purchase and all isuch thatqi>qjwill not. Hence, qj=q. To see that qis decreasing
in, dierentiate both sides of Sj(p) =dwith respect to to get that
0 =dSj(p)

Proof of Lemma 1. We will rst show that di=wis optimal. First, clearly di<minfw;Si(pi)gis subop-
timal since the monopolist can simply increase diand earn more prot. Therefore, di= minfw;Si(pi)g.
Next suppose that the monopolist sells to household ianddi< w, which therefore implies di=Si(pi)
and therefore pisolves arg max Si(pi) +Ri(pi) c. Since repossession is inecient (Assumption 2), total
surplus is maximized by setting v(p) =vorpi=v, but thendi+Ri(pi)<w+Ri(v)w+v<c(by
Assumption 3). Thus, the monopolist would prefer not to sell to household i, a contradiction. Hence,
di=w.
Proof of Proposition 3. As shown in Lemma 1, when wSi(p) then the monopoly price is p=v.
Conditional on purchasing the good, the probability that household istrategically defaults is therefore
(1 qi)F(v). Thus, to prove the result, it suces to show that vis increasing in and decreasing in .
The left-hand side of (5) is independent of the two parameters and increasing in v(by Assumption 4).
The right-hand side of (5) is increasing in and decreasing in . Thus, the point at which the left and
right-hand side intersect (i.e., v) must increase with and decrease with .
Proof of Proposition 4. This result follows from computing when monopoly prots are positive given the
optimal prices in Lemma 1. For (i), when w <Si(p), the rm's total prot from selling to household i
under the optimal contract is w+Ri(p) c. Similarly, for (ii), when w >Si(p), the rms total prot
from selling to household iisw+Ri(S 1
i(w)) c.
Proof of Proposition 5. It is straightforward to argue that the constraint in (6) binds with equality. If
not, then the rm could lower dand increase Ui. We can therefore rewrite the program (6) as
(di;pi)2arg max
d;pUi(d;p) +i(d;p)
s:t: i(d;p) = 0(10)
Sinceddoes not enter the objective of (10) and total surplus is decreasing in p, the solution to the above
involves the smallest psuch that the rm makes zero prot (and then setting dc
i=w), which is precisely
as stated in (ii). Statement (i) then follows from computing when the rm prots are non-negative given
the prices in (ii).
