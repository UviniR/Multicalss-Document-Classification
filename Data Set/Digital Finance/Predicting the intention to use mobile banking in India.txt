 Predicting the Intention to Use Mobile Banking in I ndia 
 
Introduction 
Information and communication technologies, such as  the Internet and wireless 
technologies, have revolutionised the world. Specif ically, the mobile sector in both 
developed and developing countries is growing enorm ously. According to a report by 
the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI, 20 16), there are 936 million wireless 
subscribers in India. Moreover, the number of mobil e Internet users in India is expected 
to grow to more than 300 million by the end of 2017  (KPMG, Google, 2016). 
 
To meet customers’ expectations, banks now offer a wide range of services delivered 
through mobile technologies. Mobile banking, which was introduced in India in the late 
1990s and early 2000s, is defined as “a channel whe reby the customer interacts with a 
bank via a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or  personal digital assistant” (Barnes 
& Corbitt, 2003). It has considerable potential in developing countries, where customers 
primarily connect to the Internet through mobile ph ones. The major advantage of 
mobile banking is that financial transactions can b e conducted anytime and anywhere 
(Kleijnen et al., 2004; Herzberg, 2003; Rivari, 200 6; Laukkanen, 2007). Customers can 
check account balances, transfer funds between acco unts, and make electronic bill 
payments without traveling to a traditional bank. M obile banking thus reduces the 
physical distance between the bank and the customer , helping customers achieve 
financial inclusion. 
 
There are 18.7 bank branches per 100,000 adults in urban areas of India, whereas this 
proportion is only 7.8 in semiKurban and rural area s. The number of ATMs in India is 
just 205,151, which indicates that mobile banking i n India has great potential to deliver 
banking services to an untapped market (RBI, 2016).  In rural India, only 5% of the adult 
population has access to a commercial bank branch a nd only 40% have bank accounts 
(India Brand Equity Foundation, 2016). Furthermore,  Internet penetration is much less 
in rural areas in India compared with mobile penetr ation. It may thus be easier to offer 
banking services through mobile phones in rural are as, where bank branches are scarce, 
than through any other delivery channel.

 Despite the advantages of mobile banking, few custo mers actually use these services in 
India ((Poddar et al., 2016). The surge in the use of mobile wallets from nonKbank 
companies, such as Paytm, also poses competition to  banks. According to a survey 
conducted by Poddar et al. (2016), 21% out of the 3 2% of customers using online 
banking use a mobile wallet from a nonKbank instead  of mobile banking from their own 
banks. India is presently in a demonetisation wave,  with the government of India and 
the Reserve Bank of India (the banking regulatory a uthority) encouraging more and 
more cashless transactions. Cultural settings and e conomic factors also play a major role 
in the adoption of mobile banking (Koksal, 2016; Ba ptista & Oliveira, 2015; Bankole et 
al., 2011; Ainin et al., 2007; Amin et al, 2006). H ence, the findings of prior studies 
conducted in different parts of the world can be us ed as a guide, but they cannot solely 
explain the current banking climate in India. Indee d, limited research studies have 
examined the adoption of mobile banking in India (D asgupta et al., 2011; Ketkar et al., 
2012; Kumar et al., 2017), which indicates a need f or further research to understand the 
motivators and inhibitors of mobile banking adoptio n in the country. To bridge the gap 
between the high penetration of mobile wallets and the low adoption of mobile banking, 
we must develop a model that measures the factors l eading to the acceptance of mobile 
banking. The literature points out that the same mo dels or theories, if tested in different 
economic, political and cultural settings, give dif ferent results (Baptista & Oliveira, 
2015; Mortimer et al., 2015). Past empirical studie s of mobile banking have adapted 
different theories to study adoption intentions and  have showed diverse results, which 
makes it difficult for bankers and researchers to i dentify the key drivers and inhibitors 
of mobile banking adoption. Prior studies have iden tified that the success of new 
technologyKenabled delivery channels, such as mobil e banking, solely depends upon the 
acceptance of customers ( Hanafizadeh  et al., 2014; Tan & Lau, 2016; Chaouali et al., 
2017). Hence, it is important to study and understa nd customers’ adoption of mobile 
banking to enhance its diffusion.  
 
Literature Review 
Mobile banking is considered the most valueKadding and important mobile commerce 
application available (Baptista & Oliveira, 2015; M alaquias & Hwang, 2016; Chaouali 
et al., 2017). Laukkanen and Kiviniemi (2010) defin ed mobile banking as “an 
interaction in which a customer is connected to a b ank via a mobile device such as a cell 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 phone, smartphone, or personal digital assistant.” Mobile banking services allow 
customers to check account balances, transfer funds  between accounts, and make 
electronic bill payments. They thus have vast marke t potential because of their alwaysK
on functionality and the option for customers to ba nk virtually any time and anywhere. 
 
Acceptance Models used in Mobile Banking Adoption 
Technology adoption is one major areas of focus for  information systems (IS) 
researchers. A variety of theoretical perspectives have been developed to study mobile 
banking adoption: innovation diffusion theory (IDT)  (Rogers, 1995), the technology 
acceptance model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) and its extens ions, unified theory of acceptance 
and use of technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al., 20 03), and UTAUT2 (Venkatesh et 
al., 2012). These theoretical models are derived fr om social psychology theories, such 
as the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and the theory of 
planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). 
 
TRA specifies that human behaviour is preceded by i ntentions, which are formed based 
on the individual’s attitude towards behaviour and on perceived subjective norms. TPB 
(Ajzen, 1991) is derived from TRA, supplementing th e theory with an additional 
construct called perceived behavioural control, whi ch describes the resources and 
opportunities required to form behaviour. 
 
IDT (Rogers, 1995) is used to study the characteris tics of innovation. The core idea of 
innovation diffusion is the process through which a n innovation is communicated by 
certain channels over time among the members of a s ocial system. The TAM (Davis, 
1989) describes a consumer’s willingness to use tec hnology and is derived from TRA 
(Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). The TAM is tailorKmade fo r the IS context; it is an intentionK
based model, relying on behavioural intention to pr edict usage, that was designed to 
predict information technology acceptance and usage  in an organisation. The TAM 
comprises five constructs, namely perceived usefuln ess, perceived ease of use, attitude, 
intention to use, and actual use. 
 
Venkatesh et al. (2003) integrated elements from ei ght prominent IS models to develop 
UTAUT. These eight models are TRA (Fishbein & Ajzen , 1975), TPB (Ajzen, 1991), 
the TAM (Davis, 1989), decomposed TPB (DTPB) (Taylo r & Todd, 1995), the model

 of PC utilisation (MPCU) (Thompson et al., 1991), t he motivational model (Davis et al., 
1992), IDT (Rogers, 1995), and social cognitive the ory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986). The 
four core constructs determining intention and usag e are performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating cond itions. The four moderators used in 
this model are age, experience, gender, and volunta riness of use. Venkatesh et al. (2012) 
modified the UTAUT model by adding three constructs , namely hedonic motivation, 
price value, and habit, dropping the moderator of v oluntariness to better suit a consumer 
context (UTAUT2). 
 
Many studies have been conducted in both developed and developing countries to 
understand the adoption of mobile banking. These ar e summarised in the Appendix 1. 
Most of these studies implemented wellKknown adopti on models, such as the TAM 
(Luarn & Lin, 2005; Lee et al., 2007; Norzaidi et a l., 2011; Jeong & Yoon, 2013; 
Mortimer et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2017), TPB/DTP B (Beiginia et al., 2011; 
Aboelmaged & Gebba, 2013), UTAUT/UTAUT2 (Luo et al. , 2010; Bankole et al., 
2011; Yu, 2012; Baptista & Oliveira, 2015; Alalwan et al., 2017), and IDT (Khraim et 
al., 2011; Lin, 2011). A small number used other th eories, such as the meansKend 
approach (Laukkanen, 2007), the Bass diffusion mode l (Suoranta & Mattila, 2004), and 
TTF (Zhou et al., 2011; Afshan & Sharif, 2016) to i dentify the core determinants of 
mobile banking adoption. The extensive review of th e literature revealed diverse 
antecedents to the adoption of mobile banking (Luar n & Lin, 2005; Crabbe et al, 2009; 
Yu, 2012; Aboelmaged & Gebba, 2013). Studies were c arried out in both developing 
and developed countries; however, a limited number have been conducted in India, 
specifically in metropolitan cities (Goyal et al., 2012; Rejikumar & Ravindran; 2012; 
Singh & Srivastava, 2014). These findings are thus insufficient to provide meaningful 
insights into predicting which factors influence cu stomers’ use of mobile banking in 
India. 
 
Theoretical Model and Hypotheses 
The proposed research model is developed based on e xisting theories, such as the TAM 
(Davis, 1989) and its extensions, SCT (Bandura, 198 6), and UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 
2003). To these the study added constructs, such as  trust, security, and perceived 
financial cost, which are considered to influence m obile banking acceptance (Luarn & 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 Lin, 2005; Lee et al., 2007; Zhou, 2011; Yu, 2012; Hanafizadeh et al., 2014; Afshan & 
Sharif, 2016). The bank customer has many alternati ve digital channels to use than 
mobile banking where these six constructs play an i mportant role. The study proposes 
that if the mobile banking is easy to use, customer s have the selfKconfidence to use, if 
their significant others recommend using, and it is  secure, trustworthy channel, and 
cheaper than other digital channels, more customers  will be willing to use mobile 
banking. These factors were integrated into a conce ptual model that has more 
explanatory power, since these factors are not pres ent in any one single model (Figure 
1), which led to the proposed hypotheses for the st udy. 
 
Perceived Ease of Use 
Perceived ease of use is defined by Davis (1989) as  “the degree to which a person 
believes that using a particular system would be fr ee of effort”. It is the extent to which 
a customer believes that a system is easy to learn or use. This construct is similar to the 
complexity construct used in IDT (Rogers, 1995). Mo bile banking technology should be 
simple and easy for the customer to understand in o rder to enhance acceptance 
(Chitungo & Munongo, 2013; Mortimer et al., 2015; K oksal, 2016). In mobile banking, 
many factors can increase complexity, such as navig ation problems, a small screen size, 
and transaction issues. If the mobile banking servi ce is easy to learn and use, it 
positively influences the customer’s use. Hence, th e following hypothesis is proposed: 
 
H1: Perceived ease of use has a positive effect on behavioural intentions to use mobile 
banking. 
 
Social Influence 
TRA and its extensions ( Fishbein  & Ajzen, 1975) specify that human behaviour is 
preceded by intentions, which are formed based on a n individual’s attitude towards the 
behaviour and perceived subjective norms. Venkatesh  et al. (2003) represented 
subjective norms as social influence, which is deri ved from theories such as TRA, TPB, 
DTPB, TAM2, CKTAMKTPB, MPCU, and image in IDT. Soci al influence refers to an 
individual’s perception of other people’s opinions if he or she should perform a 
particular behaviour. Prior studies of mobile banki ng adoption have shown a 
relationship between social influence and intention  to use mobile banking (Laukkanen 
et al., 2007; Amin et al., 2008; Riquelme & Rios, 2 010; Puschel et al., 2010; Sripalawat 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 et al., 2011; Dasgupta et al., 2011; Tan & Lau, 201 6). This study investigates whether 
social influence has any effect on customers’ decis ion to use mobile banking, proposing 
the following hypothesis: 
 
H2: Social influence has a positive effect on behav ioural intentions to use mobile 
banking. 
 
Computer Self-Efficacy 
The origin of selfKefficacy is SCT (Bandura, 1986).  SelfKefficacy expectation is the 
“conviction that one can successfully execute the b ehaviour required to produce the 
outcomes” (Bandura, 1977). Further, “expectations o f selfKefficacy determine whether 
coping behaviour will be initiated, how much effort  will be expended, and how long it 
will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aver sive experiences” (Bandura, 1977). 
SelfKefficacy belief is extended in IS research; he re, it is termed computer selfKefficacy, 
which is defined as one’s perception of his or her ability to use a computer (Compeau & 
Higgins, 1995). In the context of mobile banking, i f the customer believes that he or she 
has the required knowledge, skill, or ability to op erate mobile banking, there is a higher 
chance of attempting to use the service. Through th is hypothesis, the study investigates 
whether a customer has the selfKconfidence to use m obile banking. Past studies have 
shown empirical evidence of a causal link between p erceived ease of use and selfK
efficacy (Luarn & Lin, 2005; Wang et al., 2006; Sri palawat et al., 2011; Jeong & Yoon, 
2013). The following hypotheses are thus proposed: 
 
H3: Computer selfKefficacy has a positive effect on  behavioural intentions to use mobile 
banking. 
H3a: Computer selfKefficacy has a positive effect o n the perceived ease of use of mobile 
banking. 
 
Perceived Financial Cost 
The cost incurred in conducting mobile banking coul d slow its adoption. In the mobile 
banking context, cost has been found to be a major barrier to adoption (Yu, 2012; 
Hanafizadeh et al., 2014; Alalwan et al., 2017). Th e cost incurred includes the initial 
purchase price, equipment cost, subscription charge s, and transaction cost. Perceived 
financial cost is the extent to which a person beli eves that using mobile banking would 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 be costlier than other options (Luarn & Lin, 2005).  Hence, the following hypothesis is 
proposed: 
 
H4: Perceived financial cost has a significant effe ct on behavioural intentions to use 
mobile banking. 
 
Security 
Security is a serious concern when conducting finan cial transactions through electronic 
channels. Therefore, this could be one of the major  barriers to the adoption of mobile 
banking, as personal or monetary information could be exposed and used for fraudulent 
activities. Kalakota and Whinston (1997) defined se curity as “a threat which creates 
circumstances, condition, or event with the potenti al to cause economic hardship to data 
or network resources in the form of destruction, di sclosure, modification of data, denial 
of service and/or fraud, waste, and abuse”. Mobile banking also involves greater 
uncertainty and risk to the customer. In the mobile/wireless environment, security can be  
categorised as mobile paymentKenabling application security, network security, and 
device security.  The security mechanism of mobile banking has a positive effect on 
intention to use. Through the following hypothesis,  the study investigates the impact of 
security challenges on mobile banking adoption: 
 
H5: Security has a positive effect on behavioural i ntentions to use mobile banking. 
 
Trust 
Trust can be defined as the willingness to make one  vulnerable to actions taken by a 
trusted party based on the feeling of confidence or  assurance (Gefen, 2000). Mayer et al. 
(1995) defined trust as the “trustor’s intention to  take a risk and proposed the trustor’s 
perception about a trustee’s characteristics”. Masr ek et al. (2012) defined trust in mobile 
banking as “the belief that allows individuals to w illingly become vulnerable to the 
bank, the telecommunication provider, and the mobil e technology after having the 
banks, and the telecommunication provider’s charact eristic embedded in the technology 
artefact”. Trust thus plays a significant role in t he adoption of mobile banking, helping 
customers overcome the fears of security/privacy ri sks and fraudulent activities in the 
mobile environment (Gu et al., 2009; Zhou, 2011; Af shan & Sharif, 2016). Trust is 
enhanced by the security mechanisms provided by mob ile banking services. Customers 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 are more likely to trust the new service if adequat e security is provided for their 
transaction data. The following hypotheses are prop osed to investigate the causal link 
between trust and security: 
 
H6: Trust has a significant effect on the behaviour al intentions to use mobile banking. 
H6a: Security has a positive effect on customer tru st to use mobile banking. 
 
Research Methodology 
The theoretical constructs adopted in this study we re measured by using validated 
multiKitem scales from prior research, adapted thro ugh rewording to fit the needs of the 
current study. SevenKpoint Likert scales (1 = stron gly disagree and 7 = strongly agree) 
were used to measure all the theoretical constructs , since such scales are widely used in 
marketing and social science research (Garland, 199 1). Reliability and validity tests 
were conducted to verify the suitability of the ada pted scales. Cronbach’s Alpha values 
were used to calculate the reliability of the const ructs used in this study, and only those 
items having a Cronbach’s Alpha value of 0.7 or mor e were used (Hair et al., 2006). To 
review content validity, the questionnaire in Engli sh was then shown to a panel of 
experts to judge the appropriateness of the scale. The measurement constructs, sources, 
and Cronbach’s Alpha values are listed in Table 1. The survey data were analysed by 
using SPSS 16.0, and the SEM analysis was conducted  by using AMOS 16.0. 
 
The sample frame used in this study was a list of b ank customers who have operational 
bank accounts in any public, private, cooperative, or foreign bank with branches 
anywhere in India. Due to the unavailability of the  entire banking customer list, as well 
as cost and time constraints related to collecting responses from each individual bank 
customer, this study used convenience sampling to c ollect responses to the survey 
questionnaire. Prior studies of mobile adoption in both developed and developing 
countries have also used convenience sampling as a method to collect data (Luo et al., 
2010; Puschel et al., 2010; Sripalawat et al., 2011 ; Zhou, 2011). 
 
A total of 1000 questionnaires were distributed thr ough a combination of selfK
administration and sending eKmails through personal  contacts that contained a Google 
form with the survey via a link embedded in the mes sage. The researchers work in an

 educational institution where students come from al l states across India. With the help 
of these students, a hard copy of the questionnaire  was distributed across India. The 
purpose of the study was mentioned in the questionn aire, and participation in the survey 
was a voluntary decision. Altogether, 875 questionn aires were collected from bank 
customers (27 were obtained through the Google form ), of which 855 were used in the 
analysis, representing a response rate of 85.5%. Th e sample size can be considered 
robust according to the recommendations of Nunnally  (1978), as cited by Hinkin 
(1998). Among the respondents, 68% were men. 
 
To test construct validity, an exploratory factor a nalysis was conducted by using 
principal component analysis as the extraction meth od and varimax as the rotation 
method. The criterion used to accept items are fact or loadings greater than 0.5 (Hair et 
al., 2006). The results of the factor analysis are presented in Table 2. 
 
Findings 
The demographic profile of respondents is presented  in Table 3, including their gender, 
age, education, occupation, and income. The majorit y of respondents were aged 
between 20 and 29 years (62.3%). The most common ed ucational qualification was 
graduate (49.9%), followed by postgraduate (33.3%).  The majority of respondents’ 
annual income fell between Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 8 lak hs (70.9%). 
 
Hypothesis Testing 
To test the proposed model, structural equation mod elling (SEM) using Amos 16.0 was 
used with maximum likelihood estimation. SEM tests the hypothesised causal 
relationships among multiple variables simultaneous ly and estimates the strength of the 
interrelationships among latent constructs. The two Kstep approach recommended by 
Anderson and Gerbing (1988) was applied in the SEM analysis. The first step is the 
measurement model, which was examined by using conf irmatory factor analysis (CFA) 
to test the reliability and validity of the measure d scale. The second step in the SEM 
analysis was the structural model, which was used t o measure the interrelationships 
among the constructs, test the hypotheses, and test  the proposed theoretical model.

 CFA of the Mobile Banking Adoption Scale 
The dimensionality of the mobile banking adoption s cale was examined by using CFA, 
assessing the overall validity of the measures to c heck whether the constructs (i.e. 
perceived ease of use, computer selfKefficacy, soci al influence, perceived financial cost, 
security, trust, and behavioural intention to use) fit the data set. CFA was also 
conducted to examine whether the measurement items of the mobile banking adoption 
scale loaded in accordance with the pattern reveale d in the exploratory factor analysis. 
The seven factors of the measurement model were mea sured by using the 22 
measurement items (indicators) derived from the exp loratory factor analysis. The results 
of the CFA showed a statistically significant chiKs quare (χ 2 = 708.824, df = 183, 
p < 0.001, χ2  /df = 3.873). The model fit indices in Table 4 exce eded the common 
acceptance level of the fit statistics. Hence, the measurement model adequately fitted 
the data collected from the mobile banking adoption  scale. 
 
After establishing the fit of the measurement model , the next step was to assess the 
unidimensionality of the constructs and establish t he reliability and validity of the 
mobile banking adoption scale. The factors (constru cts) having unidimensionality with 
the measurement items loaded significantly on the u nderlying constructs. All the 
measurement items (indicators) had significant load ing onto their underlying constructs 
(p < 0.01) with the factor loadings varying between  0.5 and 0.922 (Table 5). The 
unstandardised regression weights were also signifi cant from the critical ratio (C.R.) 
values above ± 1.96 (Table 5). Hence, unidimensiona lity was established (Byrne, 2001). 
 
The reliability of the mobile banking adoption scal e was assessed by computing the 
composite reliability (CR) of each of the latent co nstructs (factors). The value of the 
composite reliability coefficient is recommended to  be above 0.60 (Hair et al., 2006). 
The composite reliability values obtained for the m obile banking adoption scale, namely 
computer selfKefficacy, perceived ease of use, perc eived financial cost, social influence, 
security, trust, and behavioural intention, were 0. 63, 0.83, 0.75, 0.61, 0.65, 0.82, and 
0.86, respectively (Table 5), which are all above t he cutKoff point of 0.60. 
 
The AVE, a measure complementary to composite relia bility, reflects the overall 
amount of variance in the indicators accounted for by the latent construct (Hair et al., 
2006). The AVE value of a construct should exceed 0 .50 (Hair et al., 2006). From Table 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 5, it is apparent that the AVE values obtained for the constructs, namely computer selfK
efficacy (0.68), perceived ease of use (0.81), perc eived financial cost (0.74), social 
influence (0.55), security (0.51), trust (0.63), an d behavioural intention (0.76), exceeded 
the cutKoff point of 0.50. 
 
The validity of the measurement model was establish ed by estimating convergent 
validity and discriminant validity. Convergent vali dity was estimated by taking the 
composite reliability and AVE of each construct. Ta ble 5 shows that the composite 
reliability of all the constructs was above the rec ommended value of 0.60 and that the 
AVE of all the constructs exceeded the cutKoff poin t of 0.50 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). 
Discriminant validity can be assessed by comparing the shared variance between the 
constructs and the AVE from the individual construc ts (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Table 
6 shows that the shared variance between the factor s is lower than the AVE from the 
individual factors. Hence, discriminant validity is  established. 
 
Testing the Theoretical Model 
The theoretical model proposed for the study examin es the relationship between the 
dependent variable (behavioural intention to use mo bile banking) and the six 
antecedents, namely perceived ease of use, computer  selfKefficacy, social influence, 
perceived financial cost, security, and trust. The model also tests the relationship 
between computer selfKefficacy and perceived ease o f use. Another relationship 
incorporated into the model is between security and  trust. 
 
The proposed theoretical model and path coefficient s are shown in Figure 2. The R 2 
value  obtained was 0.769, which means that the six indepe ndent variables (perceived 
ease of use, computer selfKefficacy, social influen ce, perceived financial cost, security, 
and trust) together explain 76.9% of the variation in the dependent variable. Trust 
accounts for 11% of the variance explained by secur ity, and perceived ease of use 
accounts for 35.7% of the variance explained by com puter selfKefficacy. The individual 
β values for each independent variable indicate the  significance of the variable in the 
model. The independent variables are suitable expla natory variables if the pKvalues are 
less than 0.05, which indicates significance. Figur e 1.2 shows that perceived ease of use 
(β = 0.066, p = 0.022), computer selfKefficacy (β =  0.265, p = 0.000), perceived 
financial cost (β = 0.069, p = 0.004), and security  (β = 0.649, p = 0.000) are statistically 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 significant. Security has the highest influence (β = 0.649) on behavioural intention to 
use mobile banking followed by computer selfKeffica cy (β = 0.265), perceived financial 
cost (β = 0.069), and perceived ease of use (β = 0. 066). Trust (β = K0.036, p = 0.135) 
and social influence (β = 0.024, p=0.586) are not s tatistically significant, indicating that 
these variables do not influence the behavioural in tention to use mobile banking. 
 
Discussion 
The objective of the present study was to determine  the factors that influence the 
adoption of mobile banking in India. The empirical results identified four factors that 
influence customers’ intention to use mobile bankin g: perceived ease of use, computer 
selfKefficacy, perceived financial cost, and securi ty. The relationships between these 
factors and the adoption of mobile banking were spe cified by H1, H3, H4, and H5. All 
these hypotheses were supported, indicating that In dian banking customers perceive 
these factors as most important in their intention to use mobile banking. 
 
The factor of perceived ease of use represents the ease of learning and using mobile 
banking. The results obtained confirm the significa nt influence of this factor on 
customers’ intention to use mobile banking. Custome rs place high importance on a 
simple, easyKtoKuse interface on their mobile phone  to conduct banking activities. 
 
The significant effects of computer selfKefficacy o n intention to use mobile banking in 
this study indicate that customers expect assistanc e and demonstrations when using 
mobile banking, since it is a new, technologyKfocus ed service for Indian banking 
customers. To accelerate the use of mobile banking,  banks need to concentrate more on 
helping customers use these services. 
 
One inhibitor of mobile banking adoption found in t his study was perceived financial 
cost. Many banking channels are available to Indian  banking customers, such as branch 
banking, ATMs, and Internet banking. Therefore, cus tomers expect the affordability of 
mobile banking to match that of other channels. 
 
Security was found to have a significant influence on the adoption of mobile banking in 
this study. Customers expect banks to strengthen th eir security mechanisms, especially 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 00:47 08 February 2018 (PT)
 
 over wireless networks, where they expect to have t ransaction security and privacy 
protection. 
 
The importance of these four factors was consistent  with the findings of previous 
mobile banking adoption studies conducted in India,  as well as in other developed and 
developing countries (Kleijnen et al., 2004; Lafore t & Li, 2005; Luarn & Lin, 2005; 
Amin et al., 2008; Mallat & Tunaein, 2008; Gu et al ., 2009; KoenigKLewis et al., 2010; 
Dasgupta et al., 2011; Samudra & Phadtare, 2012; Ha nafizadeh et al., 2014). 
 
The research model was found to predict intention t o use mobile banking to a 
statistically significant degree. This study showed  that security, computer selfKefficacy, 
perceived ease of use, and perceived financial cost , in that order, influence customers’ 
intention to adopt mobile banking. The study also f ound that security has a stronger 
influence on behavioural intention than all the oth er variables used in the study, 
demonstrating that security challenges and privacy issues are significant concerns for 
customers using mobile banking, in line with past s tudies of mobile banking (Luarn & 
Lin, 2005; Laforet & Li, 2005; Amin et al., 2008; C rabbe et al., 2009; Norzaidi et al., 
2011; Dasgupta et al., 2011; Yu, 2012). 
 
Computer selfKefficacy was identified as the second  most important factor predicting 
consumers’ adoption of mobile banking. This finding  demonstrates that mobile banking 
remains an emerging channel for Indian banking cust omers, who are still apprehensive 
about using this computerKcentric method, again in line with previous studies of mobile 
banking adoption in India (Dasgupta et al., 2011). Overall, the study identified that 
computer selfKefficacy significantly influences per ceived ease of use and that security 
significantly influences trust (see also Luarn & Li n, 2005; Sripalawat et al., 2011). 
 
Meanwhile, the study found that trust and social in fluence do not play a salient role in 
predicting intention to adopt mobile banking. One r eason for the insignificance of social 
influence might be that customers prefer to decide on their own financial planning 
rather than consult friends (Alawan et al., 2017). Additionally, the trust construct may 
appear insignificant because customers consider ban ks to be among the most 
trustworthy institutions. Past studies have also fo und that trust plays no major role in the 
adoption of mobile banking (KoenigKLewis et al., 20 10; Koksal, 2016).

 The proposed theoretical model explained 76.9% of t he variance in the intention to 
adopt mobile banking, which is higher than the pred ictive power of other wellKknown 
models used in studies of mobile banking adoption, such as UTAUT (56%) (Venkatesh 
et al., 2003) , UTAUT2 (74%) (Venkatesh et al., 2012) , the TAM (40%) (Davis, 1989), 
TAM2 (52%) (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000), TAM3 (53%) (V enkatesh & Bala, 2008), 
TPB (57%) (Ajzen, 1991), and DTPB (60%) (Taylor & T odd, 1995). 
 
Theoretical and Managerial Implications 
For researchers, this study provides a foundation f or the further advancement of the 
acceptance and use of technology. By specifying the se relationships, it addresses an 
important gap in adoption research.  
 
This study helps bank managers focus on initial tru st building to facilitate and accelerate 
the usage of mobile banking. Mobile banking service  providers need to adopt 
technological structures, such as third party secur ity certificates, to enhance trust. Banks 
should also offer customer services during and afte r mobile banking transactions. Banks 
can further encourage customers to use mobile banki ng by implementing adequate 
security mechanisms and prompt customer service thr ough which they can engender 
trust. 
 
The empirical findings of this study can provide gu idelines to banks and other financial 
institutions regarding the key drivers that influen ce mobile banking usage intention, 
which are therefore the aspects that will increase usage. For instance, the empirical 
support of the hypothesis (which specifies the rela tionship between secure transactions 
and use intention) suggests that to increase the us age of these services, device 
manufacturers and service providers should enhance the security features of mobile 
devices. To enhance customer trust, efforts are req uired to build relevant policies, 
regulations, and legal frameworks. Business practit ioners must improve their data 
transmission services and ensure privacy protection  for users. Periodic analyses of 
managerial and technical procedures are also requir ed to protect transaction data and 
user information. 
 
To attract new customers to these services, custome r awareness must rise and technical 
support must be offered. Indian banks should build a mobile banking system that is easy

 to use, as well as one that has a clear explanation  of banking services and a simple 
interface. To increase customers’ confidence in the  use mobile banking (i.e. selfK
efficacy beliefs), banks should increase the awaren ess of mobile banking by uploading 
online demonstrations or providing usage instructio ns in the mass media. 
 
The negative impact of the financial cost incurred by using mobile banking can be 
eliminated by displaying charges on the bank’s webs ite. Since mobile banking is 
relatively new to Indian banking customers, banks s hould increase awareness among 
customers with various promotional strategies. Beca use no significant difference in the 
intention to use mobile banking exists between diff erent age categories, banks can target 
all age categories and encourage them to use mobile  banking. More banks should start 
implementing mobile banking services and encourage their customers to use them. 
 
Limitations and Future Directions 
This study has some limitations. It did not study t he influence of moderating factors, 
such as the availability of alternative channels, t echnology readiness, and demographic 
factors. The demographic factor of gender and age w ere not added as constructs in the 
theoretical model, nor was their influence measured  in the structural model. The study 
did not use other independent variables that might predict usage more accurately. 
Another limitation of this study is that a convenie nce sample was used that may not be 
an effective method of representing the entire popu lation. Hence, the results must be 
interpreted cautiously, especially when generalisin g. 
 
This study suggests certain directions for future r esearch. First, future research could 
carry out empirical studies to test and validate th e theoretical model. Further conceptual 
and empirical work might also aim to specify the re lationships between other categories 
of antecedents and willingness to use mobile bankin g. For instance, future research 
could focus on antecedents such as technological re adiness, mobile interface quality, 
perceived usefulness, and compatibility and examine  their relations to customers’ 
decision to use mobile banking.  
 
Second, this study focused on constructs suitable f or mobile banking, which involves 
monetary transactions. Future research could carry out further conceptual and empirical 
work to measure customers’ perceived service qualit y and satisfaction level with mobile

 banking services. Building trust is also important when adopting mobile banking, since 
the vulnerability of wireless networks is high. Hen ce, trust formation in the initial stage, 
along with continuous trust building, are important  topics of future research. Similarly, 
future research might also investigate the differen t characteristics of the adopters and 
nonKadopters of mobile services.
