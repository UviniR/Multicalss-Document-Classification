Trust: mediator between mobile money
adoption and usage and ﬁnancial inclusion
George Okello Candiya Bongomin andJoseph Ntayi
Abstract
Purpose –Recently, a large body of research has been devoted on the role of trust in shaping different
types of transactions, especially in rural financial development. Trust is a set of expectations shared by allthose who engage in an exchange. Indeed, the ‘‘rule of the game’’ suggests that no trusting party in a
transaction should act opportunistically. Consequently, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of
trust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion of MSMEs indeveloping countries with a specific focus on rural Uganda.
Design/methodology/approach –A quantitative survey-based study was used and responses
obtained from 379 MSMEs located in northern Uganda were analysed using partial least square-PLSversion 3.0. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed from scales and items used in previousstudies referenced in internationally recognised journals to elicit responses from the MSMEs.
Structural equation modelling was used to test the models to arrive at a final empirical model derived
from the data.
Findings –The authors found evidence that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to
increase the scope of financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries. Moreover, when individual
effect was determined, trust also had significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Thus, the study
results imply that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to improve the level of financialinclusion of MSMEs in developing countries.
Research limitations/implications –The study used cross-sectional data to document the relationship
between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion and to establish the mediating effectof trust in the relationship. Future research could use relevant longitudinal data to verify other benefits oftrust.
Practical implications –The results present trust as a significant factor for FINTECH financial services
marketing and growth. Specifically, data privacy and effectiveness of the mobile telephone network ismore likely to help consumers to bridge the gap between participation and non-participation on the
mobile money platform. Customers’ data sent over the mobile network of providers should be
protected from unnecessary access and usage by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) staff andunauthorised persons and agents. Data protection protocols should be set by the MNOs to avoidunnecessary access and use of customers’ data.
Originality/value –Globally, Fintech scholars have examined the role of mobile money in promoting
financial inclusion. However, there is insufficient evidence on the mediating effect of trust in the
relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion, especially among ruralMSMEs. This study invents a novel direction on the importance of trust in creating transaction efficiencyby eliminating opportunism and fraud with in the Fintech ecosystem.

1. Introduction
Universally, there is no clear definition of micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The
World Bank refers to it as enterprises employing 300 employees. According to the European
Commission, MSMEs are firms that have less than 250 employees or that generate up to 50
million Euros in annual turnover ( European Commission, 2017a ). The KfW defines it as firmsGeorge Okello Candiya

Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) defines it asenterprises employing a maximum of 50 people in its operation.
Accordingly, nascent entrepreneurship literature indicates that MSMEs are the backbone to
economic growth and development, especially in developing countries.
Beck et al. (2005)
observe that MSMEs contribute significantly to employment and the gross local product in
developing countries. Additionally, Herr and Nettekoven (2017) also argue that they are
sources of innovation and increased productivity. Consistent with the Schumpeterian theory(1934), MSMEs and start-ups trigger innovation and boost productivity by spurringstructural change in an economy.
Thus, for MSMEs to stimulate economic growth and development, they need sufficient
financing at the early stage of growth to promote more start-ups and investmentopportunities to increase productivity and more efficient asset portfolios (
World Bank, 2008 ).
Indeed, MSMEs need finances to invest more in income generating enterprises that
improves livelihood, creates more employment, and boost economic growth.
However, scholars like Hashi and Krasniqi (2011) ;Nichter and Goldmark (2009) ;Audretsch
et al. (2011) observe that indigenous MSMEs located in rural areas lack access to financial
services for growth. The MSMEs are unable to reach their full potential because of difficultyof credit and financial access.
Beck and Cull (2014) found that access to finance was the
most significant obstacle for MSMEs located in rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed,the conventional traditional banks do not have local branches to serve the rural communities
due to the high cost of operation and small loan size offered to micro-enterprises,
information asymmetry, and lack of infrastructure. Besides, the interest rates charged onloans offered by the existing banks in the rural areas are usually high with no long termcredit for MSMEs (
Ardic et al. , 2012 ). This is further worsened by the lack of collateral and
complicated documentation requirements among MSMEs in developing countries. Thus,this makes it very difficult for MSMEs to get affordable, adequate, and convenient finances
to sustain their survival and growth as stipulated by
Beck (2007) . Contextually, the Financial
Sector Deepening Uganda –FSDU (2016) reveals that the share of credit to the private
sector stands at 11 percent with only 25 percent of business owners having access toformal financial services, yet, MSMEs contribute over 6.3 percent to the gross domesticproduct and creates over 80 percent of the jobs in Uganda (see for e.g.
Okello et al. , 2018 ;
Uganda Investment Authority, 2016 ). In addition, the FinScope survey (2018) also indicates
that only 36 percent of the adult population in Uganda have access to both formal andinformal financial services.
Conversely, with the advent of the new-age digitally viable technology, scholars like
Aker
and Mbiti (2010) ;Donovan (2012) ;Lochan et al. (2010) ;Morawczynski (2009) ;Jack and
Suri (2014) ;ACCION (2017) ; CGAP (2015); and Abraham (2007) suggest that mobile
phones have the potential to integrate the poor population, especially those engaged inmicroenterprises with the financial system to cause significant benefits. According to the
World Bank (2018) ;Demirgu ¨c¸-Kunt et al. (2018) ;Suri and Jack (2016) ;Dupas and
Robinson (2013) ;Muralidharan et al. (2016) ;Economides and Jeziorski (2016) ,t h e
mobile telecom networks through mobile money financial service has caused significantstrides toward access to financial services among the unbanked population indeveloping countries. This is due to its broad coverage and usage as opposed to thetraditional bank branches. The mobile money services can significantly drive down the
cost of delivering financial services, especially to the rural MSMEs who lack access to
formal financial services. Indeed, in the developing world, mobile telephony is bringingmore people into the mainstream financial system. The World Economic Forum estimatesthat the adoption and use of digital finance like the mobile money could generate anadditional $3.7 trillion in global GDP by 2025.
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jHowever, whilst digital enrolment through the use of mobile phones technology has
promoted access to financial services in a convenient manner and at a reduced cost,
especially among the unbanked population engaged in micro-enterprises, trust remains a
great concern and a potential barrier to its adoption and use (see for e.g. Be´langer and
Carter, 2008 ;Dahlberg et al. , 2003 ;Brynjolfsson and Smith, 2000 ).Morawczynski (2017)
observes that with the rampant cases of mobile money fraud, mobile money users are more
concerned with the trust in the telecom companies and its employees who connive to
defraud users over the mobile money platform. More so, McKnight et al. (2002) also
contend that in the advent of more threat of cybercrimes and the possibility of remotely
hacking customers’ phones, trust has remained a vital factor in adoption and use of the
digital financial services. Trust in the mobile money service provider and mobile moneyagent are important drivers of mobile money usage, and the lack of which can discourageMSMEs from taking up mobile money accounts. Previously, between 2009 and 2013,
Uganda experienced a significant increase in financial inclusion driven by the mobile money
innovation from 500,000 registered users in 2009 to 7 million active users in 2016.Nevertheless, according to the FinScope survey data (2018), only 39 percent of the adultpopulation in Uganda remains the active and frequently users of mobile money accounts
with the barriers of hard to send and receive money.
While previous studies like
Aker and Mbiti (2010) ;Wesolowski, Eagle, Noor, Snow, and
Buckee (2012) ;Muto and Yamano (2009) ;Nampewo et al. (2016) ;Donovan (2012) ;Lochan
et al. (2010) ;Morawczynski (2009) ;(Jack and Suri, 2014 ) suggest that use of mobile money
can transform and ease access to financial services, especially in developing countries,they fail to integrate the trust element in their analyses. Besides,
Choi and Kim (2012) ;
Schaupp and Carter (2005) ;Xenakis and Macintosh (2005) have used trust effect on
acceptance of information systems. However, they do not apply it to study mobile money inthe Fintech ecosystem. Contextually,
Baganzi and Lau (2017) examined the extent to which
mobile money users’ trust and risk perceptions affect mobile money services adoption in
Uganda. Unfortunately, they use mobile money agents from the supply side as their mainrespondents and not the users. Hence, this study intends to establish the mediating effect oftrust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion
of MSMEs in developing countries with a specific focus on rural Uganda.
2. Literature review
2.1 Mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion: trust as a mediator
Theoretically, McKnight, Cummings and Chervany (1998) postulate that at the initial
relationship, people use whatever information they have such as perceptions to adopt and
use digital-based channels like the mobile money services. They argue that individuals gothrough two stages in potential interaction with digital-based channels, i.e. an exploratorystage and a commitment stage. These stages are not meant to be definitive but to
approximate the process of how individuals decide over time to utilise or not to utilise such
channels. The credible information is gained only after the truster (i.e. a mobile money user)has both engaged in trust related behaviours (e.g. disclosing personal information) andassessed the “trustworthiness” of the vendor by observing the consequences of those
behaviours. Accordingly, individuals form trusting beliefs early but these may change as
they gain experience with the trustee. This helps them to make trust inferences.
Malaquias and Hwang (2016) observe that trust is crucial because it reduces users’ fears
and worries about mobile money transactions. This lessens the opportunistic intentions byMobile Network Operators (MNOs) to take advantage of the mobile money users
(
Jarvenpaa and Todd, 1997 ;Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky, 1999 ). Indeed, trust plays a central
role in helping mobile money users to overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity becauseit makes them comfortable in sharing personal information, makings payments andpurchases, and transacting over the mobile money digital platform. The MNOs need to
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jengender sufficient trust to persuade first-time users to transact over the mobile money
platform.
The Global Findex Survey 2018 reveals that suspicion is one of the many factors leading to
low financial inclusion and access to financial services by individuals. This is because oflack of trust about the financial services’ providers. According to
Lal and Sachdev (2015) ,
trust in mobile money service refers to satisfaction with the financial products, mobile
network connectivity, agents’ reliability, and the expectations that the intended transactions
will be fulfilled over the mobile money platform.
McKee et al. (2015) ;Donovan (2012) ;Tobbin and Kuwornu (2011) observe that the mobile
service providers’ characteristics and the environment in which they operate may have a
significant bearing on the level of consumer trust in adoption and use of mobile money
services.
Indeed, technological innovation such mobile money, which involves sharing personal data
of consumers, remains a significant concern for most customers. The customers need to
have trust in the system through which money is transferred and delivered over their mobile
phones or over the counter. Therefore, convincing customers to make their personal
information “public” remains a big challenge in adoption and use of mobile money platform
(Kasekende, 2017 ).
Xinet al. (2013) argue that in achieving a successful implementation of mobile payment
services, it is crucial to understand the extent to which consumers have knowledge and
concern about the mobile payment technology. Duane, O’Reilly, and Andreev (2014)
suggest that mobile-based financial system depends on the amount of users’ control,
reliability, security, and the reputation of the entity in-charge of the system to attract and
sustain service uptake.
Additionally, Baganzi and Lau (2017) also suggest that financial services’ providers through
the mobile money platform should ensure confidentiality of consumers’ information by
having control over what information they choose to share. The consumers should be incontrol of what, when, to whom, and for what purpose they share their data to build trust in
continued adoption and usage of the mobile money system. Similarly, the mobile money
service provider’s competency, honesty, and benevolence can result into increased
adoption and use of mobile money services, thus, scaling up adoption and use among the
unbanked population.
Furthermore,
Au and Kauffman (2008) also contend that the mobile money services
should be designed to foster consumer confidence, reduced uncertainties and perceived
risks to increase the likelihood of wider consumer adoption and usage. The privacy and
security of consumers over the mobile money platform should be guaranteed by the
mobile money service providers and the mobile network operators. Therefore, here we
hypothesize that:
H1. Trust significantly mediates the relationship between mobile money adoption and
usage and financial inclusion.
2.2 Mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion
According to the World Bank, financial inclusion mean individuals and businesses alike
having access to affordable financial products and services that meet their needs in a
sustainable and responsible way. The World Bank views access to financial services as a‘critical step’ towards reducing poverty and inequality. Financial inclusion allows people to
save for family needs, borrow to support a business or build a cushion against an
emergency. Scholars such as
Aker and Mbiti (2010) ;Wesolowski, Eagle, Noor, Snow, and
Buckee (2012) ;Muto and Yamano (2009) observe that access to financial services is crucial
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jfor development because it enhances resource mobilisation needed for productive
investment and facilitates consumption smoothing among households.
However, majority of the population in developing countries have been excluded from
access to financial services because of the high cost associated with delivering the
services, especially in the rural areas. Klapper (2018) suggests that digital technology
such as mobile money has driven much of the progress in financial inclusion (see alsoGlobal System for Mobile Association-
GSMA, 2017 ). Most of the unbanked population,
especially in Sub-Saharan Africa have accessed financial services through accounts on
mobile phone.
Indeed, the CGAP (2015) argues that in order to solve the problem of costly delivery of
financial services to the unbanked population in the rural areas, the use of digital financial
services like the mobile money can be much cheaper and convenient to deliver financialservices to seemingly the large unbanked population in rural areas. Mobile money canenable the unbanked and underserved markets to have access to formal financial services
through the mobile phone that can uplift their quality of life (see for e.g. Bank of Uganda,
2015;
Chauhan, 2015 ).
Nampewo et al. (2016) observe that the mobile money platform offers broad range of
financial services like savings, credit, payments, remittances, and insurance to the MSMEsat a cheaper cost and at their convenience. Furthermore,
Donovan (2012) ;Lochan et al.
(2010) also contend that mobile money service helps in improving the productivity and
efficiency of the unbanked microenterprise owners by avoiding the lengthy queue time,
reducing transaction cost and leakage, and improving security (see also Aker and Wilson,
2013 ).
Findings by Morawczynski (2009) revealed that mobile money helped women to save
money from interference caused by their male counterparts and vice versa. Additionally,
Stuart and Cohen (2011) also found that M-Pesa users in Kenya were in a better position to
manage their financial shocks by receiving more remittances due to the flexibility, ease of
access, and less transaction cost over the mobile money platform (see also Jack and Suri,
2014 ). Hence, here we generate the hypothesis that:
H2. Mobile money adoption and usage significantly affect financial inclusion.
2.3 Trust and mobile money adoption and usage
Studies such as Federal Reserve Bank (2017) ;Malaquias and Hwang (2016) ;McKnight
et al. (2002) ;Ivatury (2004) ;Porteous (2007) observe that with the increase in threats from
cybercrimes and the possibility of hacking into the customers’ data, trust remains a vitalfactor in determining adoption and usage of the mobile money technology. Thus, there is
need to promote trust to overcome risks and threats in using mobile money services as it
becomes popular (
Kasekende, 2014 ;Njoroge, 2016 ).
According to Donovan (2012) , the belief by users that providers and the MNOs will keep
their hard-earned money safe and help them in using it whenever required, can drive theadoption and usage of mobile money among the under banked population (see also
Tobbin
and Kuwornu, 2011 ).
Correspondingly, McKee et al. (2015) argue that users’ confidence and belief in the mobile
money services, providers’ integrity, and the agents’ necessary experience and knowledge
to fulfil their tasks, can attract users to continue using the mobile money services to access
financial services.
Luoet al. (2010) also state that consumers who have strong trust in structural assurance will
believe that their financial and privacy data will be protected against transaction loss. Thiswill lead to improved adoption and use of mobile money services for greater financialinclusion. Findings by
Dahlberg et al. (2003) ;Pousttchi (2003) ;Zmijewska et al. (2004)
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jrevealed that trust, security, and cost strongly influenced adoption and use of mobile
payments in Finland. Conversely, here we state the hypothesis that:
H3. Trust significantly affects mobile money adoption and usage.
3. Methodology and study direction
3.1 Design
The data for this particular study were collected through a cross-sectional research
approach, which allowed data to be collected over a specific point in time. The main reason
for using this approach was because it helps the researcher to gather a large amount ofdata over a shorter period of time. Besides, this particular approach helps the researcher to
eliminate the problem of recurrent mistakes in the instrument used for data collection that is
common with longitudinal research approach. Additionally, this approach does not alsosuffer from the problem of unavailability of samples used in previous observations as in
longitudinal study since data is collected over a specific point in time. Thus, the data for this
study were collected from selected MSMEs from northern Uganda identified for this study.
3.2 Study variables
Three variables were used in this study to provide answers to the hypotheses developed inthis study. The main variables for the study were mobile money adoption and usage, trust,
and financial inclusion. Therefore, measures were developed and modified to investigate
the variables stated above. The variable of mobile money adoption and usage wasmeasured using 19 items that were adopted from previous scholars like
Okello et al. (2017)
who used it to study mobile money in the same context. Besides, the variable of trust was
measured using 16 items adopted from Baganzi and Lau (2017) ;Luoet al. (2010) that were
found to be reliable and valid to be used in studies integrating trust concept. Finally, the
concept of financial inclusion was measured using 19 items adopted and modified from
Okello et al. (2016) ; ACCION (2011); AFI (2010) ;/C20Ciha´k,et al. (2012); Claessens (2006) .T h e
reliability and validity of the items were tested before being adopted for the current study
and a five-point likert scale beginning with 1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-not sure,
4-agree, and 5-stronly agree was used in this study. This was due to its clarity, simplicity,versatility, and its wide use in collecting data in social science research (Likert, 1932; John,
2010;
DeVellis, 2003 ). The survey questionnaire with the items used to measure the
variables under this study is appended in the Appendix section.
3.3 Data and data collection
The data for this study were collected from MSMEs located in Gulu district, northern
Uganda. The MSMEs were identified based on Uganda Bureau of Statistics, 2010/2011
Census of Business Establishment (COBE) in Uganda, which indicated that there were
36,640 MSMEs in northern Uganda. The data from COBE was used in this study because itprovides accurate information about registered business establishments in Uganda. Thus, a
sample size of 379 MSMEs was selected based on the guide for sample size determination
by Krejcie and Morgan (1970). The respondents were randomly selected from those MSMEswho use mobile money services. A semi-structured questionnaire with both open and
closed ended questions was used to collect responses from the selected MSMEs. The data
were collected by two research assistants who directly administered the questionnaires tothe respondents. The data collection covered the period from March to April, 2018. Overall,
a total of 379 questionnaires were administered to MSMEs who were randomly selected for
this study. Whereas 379 MSMEs responded in the study, 364 responses were valid and
usable for this study.
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j3.4 Data analyses and assessment
The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship
between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion of MSMEs with aspecific focus on rural Uganda. The data analysis for this study was performed at two levels.The first level involved capturing the data into statistical packages for social sciences(SPSS) to perform preliminary analysis. The second level involved the use of partial leastsquare (PLS) to establish the reliability, validity, measurement model, and the SEM model.Therefore, data collected from the field were sorted, verified for wrong scoring and missinginstruments, serially numbered and captured into the SPSS. Checks for missing values,outliers, and normality were performed on the data to ensure that they were good enough forfurther statistical analysis in PLS. Frequencies were generated for all the items and theresults showed that there were some elements of missing values in the data. The missingvalues in the data were missing-at-completely random (MCAR) and less than 5 per cent,which were recommended for replacement according to
Hair et al. (2010) and Field (2005) .
Thus, the missing values in the data were replaced using linear interpolation that isconsidered the best data replacement method as stipulated by
Field (2005) . Furthermore,
assessment for outliers was also performed by running the box plot test. The results showedthat there were no outliers in the data, and hence, they were good for further statisticalanalysis. Additionally, tests to establish whether the data were normally distributed werealso carried out on the data. Assumptions for test of parametric data were performed basedon skewness and kurtosis, Kolmogorov –Smirnov and Shapiro –Wilk tests, and
multicolinearity. The results revealed that the skewness and kurtosis standard errors werefound to be well within the satisfactory threshold ( /C02 and þ2) for all constructs and items
separately (
Hair et al. , 2010 ). Accordingly, the results generated from Kolmogorov –Smirnov
and Shapiro –Wilk tests indicated that all the items had values non-significant at P >0.05 and
suitable for further statistical test. Besides, the variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance totest for multicolinearity revealed that all the variables had VIF and tolerance values abovethe recommended threshold of less than 10 and above 0.2, thus, multicolinearity was not aproblem in the data (
Hair et al. , 2010 ;Field, 2005 ). Therefore, based on all the above
assessment, the data was found to be fit for further statistical test in PLS.
3.5 Reliability and validity
The test for reliability was performed to evaluate the internal consistency of the items used tomeasure the variables. The consistency of the items is measured by Cronbach’s
a
coefficient. The rule of thumb is that the coefficient values of the reliability should be above0.70 as recommended by Nunnally (1978);
Bagozzi and Yi (1988) ; Cronbach (1950). The
results of the composite reliability generated in PLS revealed that all the variables hadCronbach’s
acoefficient above the 0.70 thresholds. Correspondingly, the average variance
explained (AVE) were assessed to show convergent validity. The results showed that all thevariables had convergent valid above the recommended threshold of 0.50 according to
Fornell and Larcker (1981) ;Hair et al. (2010) . The content validity for the items was
assessed based on experts, practitioners, and scholarly views. Furthermore, a pilot study
was also carried out to modify the instrument for the main study. More so, the convergent
and discriminant validity between the constructs were also determined by running the crossloadings in PLS measurement model.
3.6 Mediating effect involving measurement and structural models
According to Hair et al. (2010) , mediation exist between variables when the predictor
variable accounts for some variance in the mediator variable, and the mediator variable alsoaccounts for variance in the outcome variable. Conversely, some effects of the predictor
variable on the outcome variable go through the mediator to cause effect on the outcome
variable and the mediator also exerts effect on the outcome variable. Hence, in the process
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jof establishing mediation, the rules set by Baron and Kenny (1986) should be achieved for
the mediation test to proceed. Indeed, associations should exist between the three variables
i.e. the predictor, mediator, and outcome variable to determine the mediation effect.Additionally,
Hair et al. (2014) also argue that two models (measurement and structural)
should be constructed to determine the mediation effect. Consequently, Chin (1998)
suggests that a measurement model is constructed to test for reliability and validity; and astructural model is constructed to test and confirm the hypotheses generated in the study,
the effect size, and the predictive relevance of the model through coefficient of
determination (
Hair et al. , 2014 ).
3.6.1 Measurement model in Smart-PLS. The measurement model is constructed to
determine the convergent and discriminant validity of the manifest and latent variables. The
content validity involves measuring all constructs included and represented in particular
theories used in the study ( Crocker and Algina, 1986 ;DeVellis, 1991 ; Gregory, 1992). Thus,
factor loadings are generated in PLS to assess content validity among the different
constructs as stipulated by Hair et al. (2010) . The rule of thumb is that if any item loaded
higher on other constructs than their loading, it will be deleted. However, if the deletioncause no improvement on the AVE, then there is no need for deleting such items. Similarly,
composite reliability is generated in the measurement model to determine reliability of the
constructs. The composite reliability for the variables should be above 0.70 cut-off point as
recommended by Nunnally (1978);
Bagozzi and Yi (1988) . Conversely, the measurement
model is constructed to ensure that all the constructs are valid and reliable to avoid violation
and to allow for structural model construction. Indeed, the measurement model (outer
model) is assessed based on the results of the content validity, convergent validity, and
discriminant validity. The results for the factor loadings and cross loadings, and factor
loadings significant for the manifest and latent variables are shown in Tables II andIII.
3.6.2 Structural model in Smart-PLS. According to Hair et al. (2010), a structural model is a
model combining all the manifest and latent variables under study into one complex model
with the error terms. It combines the exogenous and endogenous variables together with
their manifest into one main model to explain a concept being studied. Indeed, structuralmodel is an extension of the relationships between the manifest and latent variables through
a measurement model into a structural model. Furthermore,
Hair et al. (2010) also argue that
the structural model shows the interrelationships among latent constructs and observable
variables in a proposed single model derived from a sound theoretical underpinning. Thus,
structural equation model in PLS was used to examine the model in this study. The PLS-SEM
was used because it is a modelling technique that combines multiple independent and
dependent constructs and their measurement errors into a single model according to Karim
(2009). Besides, it is very robust and sound in estimation and establishing construct and
content validities than Covariance-Based SEM as recommended by Afthanorhan (2013) .
Thus, a structural model was constructed to test and confirm the hypotheses generated in
this study, the effect size, and the predictive relevance of the model through coefficient ofdetermination (
Hair et al. , 2014 ).
4. Results
The results from this study indicated that from 379 responses that were obtained from the
selected MSMEs, 364 responses were valid and usable in this study. This accounted for 96
percent response rate in this study. From the demographic perspective, the results
indicated that on average, most (54 percent) of the MSMEs were owned by female ascompared to the male. This means that most MSMEs are owned by women in search of
livelihood for their household members. Indeed, women are the food basket for their
household members, especially in under developed markets in rural Africa. Accordingly, the
results also revealed that the average age of the respondents was between 26-33 years as
compared to those who were in þ50 age bracket. This means that most (35 percent) of the
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jMSMEs owners who participated in this study were youthful. This implies that most MSMEs
businesses in under developed markets require intensive efforts to handle the dynamics ofthe business environment. Besides, the results showed that on average, most (48 percent)
of the MSMEs were owned by individuals who had attained secondary level of education as
compared to those who had attained postgraduate qualifications. This means that mostMSMEs owners in under developed markets can read and write in the process of runningtheir businesses. This could be attributed to the adult literacy programs common in most
developing countries funded by different donors. Furthermore, the results also indicated
that most (41 percent) MSMEs surveyed were small-scale enterprises in contrast to themedium size enterprises. This means that most small-scale businesses are easier to begindue to low capital and labour requirements at the initial stage of its establishment. Inaddition, the results also showed that most (46 percent) of the businesses that were used in
this study had been in operation for 6-10 years as compared to 9 percent that had existed
for more than 15 years. This means that most MSMEs die before they celebrate their 10thbirthdays due to several challenges among others, which include lack of finance to growtheir businesses. Conclusively, the results indicated that 80 percent of the MSMEs ownerswho participated in the study had smart-phones. This confirms the high level of mobile
phone penetration in under developed markets that are used for different purposes mobile
money inclusive. This shows the strength in the use of digital financial services in spurringthe growth of financial inclusion since a large number of the rural population ownsconnected mobile phones. Accordingly, over 62 percent of the respondents confirmed thatthey always use their mobile phones for withdrawals of money while operating their
businesses. The demographic profiles of the respondents are indicated in
Table I .
4.1 Reliability and validity
Smart-PLS was adopted to construct the measurement model to test for the reliability and
validity of the constructs under this study. Reliability was tested using Cronbach’s a
coefficient, while convergent and discriminant validities were tested by the AVE. The resultsof the composite reliability showed that all the variables had Cronbach’s
acoefficients
greater than 0.70 as recommended by Nunnally (1978); Bagozzi and Yi (1988) ; Cronbach
(1950). The composite reliability for the variables were: mobile money adoption and usage =
0.831; trust = 0.680; and financial inclusion = 0.702. Indeed, all the results were above therecommended cut-off point of above 0.7 as suggested by Nunnally (1978). The compositereliability results are indicated in
Table IV .
4.2 Measurement model
The measurement model was constructed to determine the convergent and discriminant
validity of the manifest and latent variables. The measurement model was assessed based
on the composite reliability and Cronbach’s ato assess internal consistency, and evaluation
of outer loadings of the indicators together with the AVE to measure convergent validity.
Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion was used to assess the convergent and discriminant
validities. The outer-loadings and AVE were generated and the diagonal values (square
roots of AVE) of the constructs were compared with the diagonal correlation values of the
variables under study. The outer-loadings and AVE were used to assess convergentvalidity, while the diagonal correlation values were used to assess the discriminant validity.The results of the AVE indicated that all the variables attained figures that were above therecommended 0.50 with mobile money adoption and usage = 0.598; trust = 0.834; and
financial inclusion = 0.653. All the results showed that all the constructs had AVE that were
above the recommended 0.50 threshold. The AVE results to assess convergent validity areindicated in
Table IV . Besides, the Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion test results for the
diagonal correlation values showed that all the variables had square root of above 0.7,which constituted of mobile money adoption and usage = 0.773; trust = 0.790; and financial

variables correlations, therefore, confirming discriminant validity of the constructs according
to Hair et al. (2011); Henseler et al. (2009) . The results to assess discriminant validity are
indicated in Table V .
4.3 Structural model
According to Hair et al. (2010) , the structural model is constructed to show the
interrelationships among latent constructs and observable variables in a proposed single
model derived from a sound theoretical underpinning. Therefore, structural equation
model in PLS was used to examine the model in this study. The PLS-SEM was
constructed to test and confirm the hypotheses generated in this study, the effect size,
and the predictive relevance of the model through coefficient of determination ( Hair et al. ,
2014 ). The results are indicated in Table VI .Table I Demographic pro ﬁles of the respondents

support to H2of the study.
Furthermore, the structural model results also revealed that trust and mobile money

jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jsize, for larger sample size, coefficient of determination R2is used to explain the predictive
relevancy of the model. Thus, when variables referred to as predictor variables exertsignificant effects on outcome variables, the b-value should be significantly different from
zero based on t-statistic test. The results from this study indicated that the direct and indirect
effect of mobile money adoption and usage through trust explains 40.7 percent variation infinancial inclusion. This study corroborates with recent findings by
Thakur and Srivastava
(2014) , which revealed that R2determined within a conceptual model has substantive
explanatory power. This is in line with Cohen (1988) who recommends that R2above 0.26 is
considered substantial in explaining the effect of the predictor variable on the outcomevariable. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model was relevant to predict financialinclusion of MSMEs, especially in developing countries. The results are shown in
Table VII .
Similarly, the quality of the model was examined by determining cross-validated
redundancy. This was done through blindfolding technique in PLS. The condition is thatsome data values should be removed, which would be estimated as missing values. Theomission distance for the blind folding running is seven and after which certain values wouldbe generated and a comparison made to test how close the real result is from the assumedresults. Therefore, the rule for the predictive relevance is that the value must be above zero
as it is applicable in this study. The results from this study yielded the cross-validated
redundancy as indicated in
Table VII . The figures were above the recommended threshold
of zero as specified by Hair et al. (2016) .
4.5 Effect size of the model
The effect size is an objective and standardised measure of the magnitude of the observed
effect ( Field, 2005 ). The effect size of the model should be determined because they give an
objective measure of the importance of an effect, while the importance of R2value of the
dependent variable is to show the strength of the model. Thus, a change in R2by omitting
one dependent variable in the model can also be used to assess the contribution of theomitted variable on the endogenous constructs (
Hair et al. , 2014 ). The effect size is
computed by excluding an exogenous variable from the model and including theexogenous construct in the model to compare the change in R
2to determine the effect size.
Therefore, drawing from the work of Field (2005) , the effect size is categorised to include
small effect = 0.10; medium effect = 0.30; and large effect = 0.50. Indeed, the results fromthis study indicated that mobile money adoption and usage and trust exerted 0.210 onfinancial inclusion ( Figures 1
and2). The results are shown in Table VIII .
5. Discussion
The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship
between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion of MSMEs in developingcountries with a specific focus on rural Uganda.
The results from this study indicated that there is a significantly mediating effect of trust in the
relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. This findinglends support to H1derived in this study. Indeed, technological innovation such as mobile
money, which involves sharing personal data of consumers, remains a significant concern for

transferred and delivered over their mobile phones or over the counter. Xinet al. (2013) argue
that in achieving a successful implementation of mobile payment services, it is crucial tounderstand the extent to which consumers have knowledge and concern about the mobilepayment technology. Besides, Duane, O’Reilly, and Andreev (2014) suggest that mobile-
based financial system depends on the amount of user s’ control, reliability, security and theFigure 1 PLS SEM algorithms with both direct and indirect effects
Figure 2 PLS SEM algorithms with t-vales and p-values
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jreputation of the entity in charge of the system to attract and sustain service uptake. Consistent
with Baganzi and Lau (2017) , financial services’ providers through the mobile money platform
should ensure confidentiality of consumers’ inform ation by having control over what information
they choose to share. The consumers should be in control of what, when, to whom, and forwhat purpose they share their data to build trust in continued adoption and usage of themobile money system. In the same vein, the mobile service provider’s competency, honesty,and benevolence can result into increased adop tion and use of mobile money services, thus,
scaling up adoption and use among the unbanked population engaged in micro-enterprises.
More so, the results from this study also showed that mobile money adoption and usage
significantly affect financial inclusion.
Klapper (2018) suggests that digital technology such as
mobile money has driven much of the progress in financial inclusion (see also Global System forMobile Association-
GSMA, 2017 ). Indeed, Demirgu ¨c¸-Kunt et al. (2018) contend that mobile
money financial service has caused significant strides toward access to financial servicesamong the unbanked population in developing countries due to its broad coverage and usageas opposed to the traditional bank branches. Scholars like
Nampewo et al. , (2016) observe that
the mobile money platform offers broad range of financial services like savings, credit,payments, remittances, and insurance to the MSMEs at a cheaper cost and at their convenience.Additionally,
Donovan (2012) ;Lochan et al. (2010) also contend that mobile money service helps
in improving the productivity and efficiency of the unbanked microenterprise owners by avoiding
lengthy queue time, reducing transaction cost and leakage, and improving security (see also
Aker and Wilson, 2013 ). This finding is consistent with Morawczynski (2009) who revealed that
mobile money helped women to save money from interference by their male counterparts andvice versa. Similarly,
Stuart and Cohen (2011) found that M-Pesa users in Kenya were in a better
position to manage their financial shocks by receiving more remittances due to the flexibility,ease of access, and less transaction cost over the mobile money platform. This finding agreeswithH2that mobile money adoption and usage significantly affect financial inclusion.
Additionally, the results from this study also revealed that trust has a significant and positive
effect on mobile money adoption and usage. This finding provides support for H3of this
study.
Donovan (2012) observes that the belief by users that providers and the MNOs will
keep their hard-earned money safe and help them in using it whenever required, can drivethe adoption and usage of mobile money among the under banked population.Furthermore,
McKee et al. (2015) also suggest that users’ confidence and belief in the
mobile money service, providers’ integrity, and the agents’ necessary experience andknowledge to fulfil their tasks, can attract users to continue using the mobile money servicesto access financial services. Indeed, consumers who have strong trust in structuralassurance will believe that their financial and privacy data will be protected againsttransaction loss (
Luo et al. , 2010 ). This will lead to improved adoption and use of mobile
money services for greater financial inclusion. This study corroborates with Dahlberg et al.
(2003) ;Pousttchi (2003) ;Zmijewska et al. (2004) who revealed that trust, security, and cost
strongly influenced adoption and use of mobile payments in Finland.

jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL jof MSMEs in developing countries with a specific focus on Uganda. Thus, the following
conclusions can be drawn from this study.
The results from this study showed that there is a significant mediating effect of trust in the
relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. This findinglends support to H1derived in this study. The mobile money services should be designed to
foster consumer confidence, reduced uncertainties and perceived risks to increase thelikelihood of wider consumer adoption and usage. The privacy and security of consumers’data over the mobile money platform should be guaranteed by the mobile money serviceproviders and the mobile network operators.
Besides, the results from this study indicated that mobile money adoption and usage
significantly affect financial inclusion. This finding supports H2that mobile money
adoption and usage significantly affect financial inclusion. It can be deduced that to solve
the problem of costly delivery of financial services to the unbanked population in the rural
areas, use of digital financial services like the mobile money can be much cheaper andconvenient to deliver financial services to the unbanked population. Mobile money canenable the unbanked and underserved markets to have access to formal financialservices through the mobile phone that can uplift their quality of life.
Furthermore, the results from this study also revealed that trust has a significant and positive
effect on mobile money adoption and usage. This finding is in line with H3of the study. The
trust among the users that the mobile network connectivity will function as promised and thatagents will perform their role rightly with customers’ funds and fulfilling individuals’ transactions,will result into more mobile money adoption and use among users such as MSMEs owners.
7. Implications and direction for policy
The results from this study presents significant trust factors and policy implications forFINTECH financial services marketing. Specifically, data privacy and effectiveness of themobile telephone network is more likely to help consumers to bridge the gap betweenparticipation and non-participation on the mobile money platform. Customer data sent over
the mobile network of providers should be protected from unnecessary access and usage
by MNOs staff and unauthorised persons and agents. Data protection protocols should beset by the MNOs to avoid unnecessary access and use of customer data.
In addition, there should be effective mobile telephone network with no major network break
down and timeout. The providers of the mobile money services should inculcate trust in the
users by ensuring reliability and consistency of the network system operability.
Furthermore, the government of Uganda through Uganda communication commission
(UCC) and the central bank (Bank of Uganda) should also design new financial sector laws,
specifically for the mobile money sector for purposes of consumer recourse and punishmentof fraudsters over the mobile money platform. Stringent laws should be set to reprimandMNOs staff and agents who connive to swindle customers’ monies through fictitioustransactions. Besides, victims of mobile money frauds should be compensated for lossessuffered through dubious transactions. This may promote uptake and sustainability of themobile money digital channel to spur financial inclusion, which is imperative towardsreducing poverty.
Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing literature on mobile money by showing
that trust significantly and positively mediates the relationship between mobile moneyadoption and usage to enhance the level of financial inclusion of MSMEs, especially in therural areas. The trust factor enable individuals to develop the interest in adoption andcontinued use of mobile money services. Therefore, practitioners, designers of mobilemoney financial products, and MNOs should work towards improving trust in the provisionand consumption of mobile money products so as to attract more and new users.
jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j8. Limitations and future study
The study used cross sectional data to document the relationship between mobile
money adoption and usage and financial inclusion, and the mediating effect of trust inthe relationship. Future research could use relevant longitudinal data to verify other
effects of trust. This study has taken MSMEs as the main source of data among the
financially excluded. Thus, it limits generalisation to the other mobile moneyconsumers. Additionally, this study focuses, specifically on the mobile money services
on the Fintech ecosystem. It does not take into consideration the other financial
systems.
