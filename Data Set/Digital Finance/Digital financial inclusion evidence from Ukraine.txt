The article examines the influence of the current stage of economy digitalization on the 
financial inclusion in Ukraine. The purpose is to assess the level of financial inclusion 
in the country, to determine the dominant influence of price and non-price barriers 
to access to financial services for the Ukrainian population when compared to other 
world countries and to define which part of the adult population is able to join the 
formal financial services system through the use of innovative channels and financial 
service systems. Based on the methodological approaches proposed by the World Bank 
and the G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators, the authors analyze the real t raditional and 
digital access opportunities of the general public to financial services in Ukraine com -
pared to other countries across the world. Particular emphasis is placed on overcoming 
existing non-price barriers that impede formal financial inclusion of the Ukrainian 
population. The research findings stress the need to adhere to the basic principles of 
digital financial inclusion in order to regulate activities of financial institutions and 
their agents in the digital provision of financial services, strengthen regulatory con -
trol over the use of innovative financial products and service systems, and protect the 
rights of consumers of financial services in Ukraine.Svitlana Naumenkova (Ukraine),  Svitlana Mishchenko (Ukraine),

INTRODUCTION
The lack of the general population access to formal financial services 
reduces the level of citizens’ welfare and their social prot ection, leads 
to increased social tension in society, which ultimately slows the devel -
opment of the country’s economy as a whole.
The economic downturn in Ukraine increases the share of the finan -
cially excluded population, complicates citizens’ access to financ ial 
services in the most convenient due to price and non-price barr iers. 
Eliminating these barriers is a priority for the stable development of 
the Ukrainian financial system. The use of modern digital infrastruc -
tures is a key factor in increasing public access to formal financial 
services.
In view of this, there is a need to assess the level of digital financial in -
clusion that is based on providing high mobility for financial services 
consumers and flexibility of financial services compared to tradition al 
channels and systems. In the context of widespread use of financial 
innovations and modern services and channels of digital financial 
services to the population, it is necessary to clarify the list of basic 
financial services, providing access to which is crucial for the stable © Svitlana Naumenkova, Svitlana

1. LITERATURE REVIEW
Recent years have witnessed considerable atten -
tion to financial inclusion. This is due to the need 
to tackle poverty, involve the wider population in 
the formal financial system, and ensure the eco -
nomic development of countries. In 2017, about 1.7 
billion adults (31% of the world’s adult population) 
in the world did not have access to financial ser -
vices (World Bank Group, 2018).
According to the World Bank, financial inclu -
sion and access to finance are different concepts. 
Financial inclusion is defined as the proportion of 
adults who use financial services. However, lack of 
use does not necessarily mean lack of access. Some 
people may have access to financial services at rea -
sonable prices, but they choose not to use them for 
religious and other reasons, while other people’s 
access may be restricted by high costs for these 
services or regulatory barriers. Therefore, the key 
issue is the extent to which lack of inclusion stems 
from the lack of demand or the presence of barri -
ers that prevent individuals and firms from access -
ing financial services (World Bank Group, 2014).
Given that, real consumer access to financial ser -
vices is considered their timely provision in a 
consumer-friendly manner and at a price that is 
acceptable to the consumer and cost-effective, or 
economically rational, for the financial institution 
providing the service (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2017).
In view of this, financial inclusion is considered 
through the lens of consumer (population and 
small business) access to formal financial servic -
es and is based on the absence of all kinds of ob -
stacles and barriers (price and non-price) for their 
timely and complete rec eipt (Naumenkova,  2015).
Financial inclusion is assessed on the basis of 
quantitative and qualitative indicators of 1) access, 
2) quality, 3) usage and impact:
1) the access is determined by the availability of 
service infrastructure (financial institutions, their branches and offices, technical facilities, 
agent network, means for remote access to ser -
vices: Internet, mobile communication, etc.);
2) the quality of financial services for consum -
ers is evaluated in terms of price affordabili -
ty, uninterrupted service, effective consumer 
protection system, etc.;
3) the usage is considered with regard to un -
derstanding the essence of the service by the 
consumer, the population’s financial literacy, 
the positive impact of the service on quality 
of life, etc.
Hannig and Jansen (2010) analyzed regional 
trends and arrived at positive findings about tak -
ing the financial inclusion measures in countries 
where 25 percent of households receive incomes 
equal to or below USD 2 per day. Jin (2017) ob -
tained results on the impact of financial inclusion 
on wealth creation, reducing poverty, and improv -
ing social protection for citizens.
According to Sarma and Pais (2011), the situation 
in the banking sector does not have a clear im -
pact on financial affordability, unlike the owner -
ship structure. However, Han and Melecky (2013) 
emphasize the positive impact of measures to in -
crease access to bank deposits as a traditional sav -
ings service on financial stability. Morgan and 
Pontines (2014) described channels for increasing 
financial services availability, identified the posi -
tive effects of increased inclusion, and focused on 
the shortcomings related to regulation and control.
For a more detailed analysis of the impact fac -
tors and specific differences between countries, 
Honohan (2008), Park and Mercado (2018) have 
proposed to calculate the Financial Inclusion 
Index.
Financial inclusion opportunities of the popula -
tion are determined by the modern trends of inno -
vative development of the financial sector (Allen, 
2012) under proliferation of remote financial ser -196Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 16, Issue 3, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/imfi.16(3).2019.18vices, use of digital and mobile money and inno -
vative systems.
Fintech Revolution opens new opportunities for 
financial inclusion (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). 
This applies in particular to the use of digital mon -
ey, mobile accounts (Sarma & Pais, 2011), and the 
issuance of biometric smart cards (Karthik et al., 
2016). Changes in the payment landscape in the 
current environment and the possibility of its us -
age for financial inclusion are covered in the WBG 
and BIS joint document (World Bank Group, 2016).
Klapper and Singer (2017) highlighted the ben -
efits and challenges of implementing electronic 
payments by public authorities to citizens in the 
government-to-person (G2P) system. Gabor and 
Brooks (2017) analyzed the creation of fintech-phi -
lanthropy-development complexes that combine 
behavioral economics with forecasting algorithms 
via implementing the “Know Thy (Irrational) 
Customer” concept to accelerate access to finance.
Using financial innovation makes it possible to 
create new products and services, develop effec -
tive data processing and storage models, help ex -
pand customer reach, reduce cost, and improve 
financial services provision. Zimmerman and 
Baur (2016) described managing the risks arising 
in the process of digital financial services; in par -
ticular, risk management in the area of mobile 
money and mobile accounts was explored by Jack 
and Suri (2014).
It should be noted that recently in the field of re -
mote financial services, there exist convergence 
and unification of national models. This promotes 
the introduction of standard approaches to the 
regulation of the financial sector and the protec -
tion of the rights of financial services consumers 
(Mishchenko et al., 2018). In addition, there is a 
combination of different forms of agency and re -
mote servicing (World Bank Group, 2016).
In Ukraine, the strategic objectives of the finan -
cial sector digital development are outlined in 
the Concept of the Development of the Digital 
Economy and Society of Ukraine for 2018–2020 
(Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, 2018). Urgent issues 
of financial inclusion based on ensuring the bal -
ance between solving local problems, promoting innovation, risk management and consumer pro -
tection in Ukraine were discussed at the Second 
Financial Inclusion Forum (The National Bank of 
Ukraine, 2019).
2. DATA AND METHODS
Digital financial inclusion determines the possi -
bility of access to formal financial services for the 
general public based on the implementation of ba -
sic principles of digital interaction between finan -
cial intermediaries and consumers, the use of in -
novative financial products, services, digital chan -
nels, as well as customer service and fund raising 
systems (Figure 1).
The digital financial inclusion core principles are 
the basis for the financial service digitalization. 
They are also consistent with the G20 Principles 
for Innovative Financial Inclusion (GPFI, 2011) 
and other generally accepted documents.
Thus, for digital financial inclusion, a remote 
method of servicing is the key. It allows consum -
ers to obtain services not directly from financial 
institutions, but from third parties, namely agents 
or other third-party intermediaries who usually 
provide services based on an agreement concluded.
In addition, the use of remote models requires the 
interoperability of such service schemes, access to 
payment systems and communication infrastruc -
ture, as well as compliance with the requirements 
for the protection of customers’ personal data and 
information of financial institutions.
In order to protect consumer rights effectively, it 
is important that the financial institutions and 
their agents are regulated in the digital provision 
of financial services. Financial institutions should 
be responsible for their own actions and those of 
their agents within the limits set out in agency 
agreements, regardless of whether such actions 
are directly or indirectly mandated. In addition, 
financial services must meet the customer needs 
and be provided at a cost that is affordable to con -
sumers and acceptable to suppliers.
There is also an increased control over the addi -
tional risks (or relocation of existing ones) in the 197Investment Management and Financial Innovations, Volume 16, Issue 3, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/imfi.16(3).2019.18financial services process that arise when man -
aging and storing customer accounts and funds, 
making payments, engaging agents in the process 
of creating and using the customer interface, etc.
The Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion 
(GPFI) developed a system of indicators approved 
by the G20 in 2012. In 2013, GPFI presented an 
updated list of these indicators structured by 
directions:
• access;
• service usage (by population and SMEs); and
• service quality. 
In addition, the list includes quality indicators ac -
cording to the following areas:
• financial literacy and capability; 
• market conduct and consumer protection;
• barriers to use. In 2016, indicators of the use of digital payments 
and access to digital infrastructure were added to 
the list (GPFI, 2016).
Given the international practice and the existing 
limitations as to obtaining and generalizing infor -
mation on the issue, it is advisable to follow the 
Global Findex methodological approaches and 
perform analyses using G20 Financial Inclusion 
Indicators. Figure 2 presents the sequence of data 
analysis using these indicators to assess the level 
of digital financial inclusion.
The focus of the analysis was on a set of indicators 
that allow for distinguishing the proportion of 
adults with active accounts at formal financial in -
stitutions and the ability to access them and subse -
quent digital financial services (access to and man -
agement of their own finances, including payment 
of bills, online purchases, receiving funds through 
digital channels and service systems) (see Figure 2).Figure 1. The digital financial inclusion componentsSource: Developed by the authors.

3. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
An analysis of the financial inclusion indicates 
that in 2017, only 63% of adults in Ukraine had 
formal financial institution accounts. Among 
working-age citizens, this figure was 70% be -
ing significantly lower than that in the EU (97%). 
However, there is a gradual decrease in the share 
of the Ukrainian population not included in the 
system of formal financial services. Thus, in 2011 
the level of the financially excluded population 
reached 59%, in 2014 it was 47%, and in 2017 it 
decreased to 37% (Table 1).The largest proportion of the financially excluded 
adults is observed in the poorest, out of the labor 
force and rural groups, varying between 68-75% 
of the respective group respondents. In addition, 
the share of women with no accounts in financial 
institutions was significantly higher than in the 
EU countries.
Public inclusion in formal financial services is 
hampered by the existence of barriers. The main 
barriers to public access to formal financial servic -
es can be divided into two groups:
• related to the financial institution activities: 
lack of trust in financial institutions, financial 
services are too expensive, financial institu -
tions too far away; and
• unrelated to the of financial institution activi -
ties: religious reasons, lack of necessary docu -
mentation, family member already has an ac -
count, no need for an account.
The abnormally low development of financial in -
frastructure when compared to other countries 
is an extremely negative tendency impeding the 
physical access of the population to financial ser -
vices. Thus, the number of bank branches per 
100,000 adults in Ukraine decreased almost 7.5 
times during 2009–2018: from 3.22 to 0.43, while 
in most European countries this figure ranges be -
tween 30-40 (Table 2).
The growth of ATMs in terms of population cov -
erage and penetration rates is increasing, which 
positively impacts payment terms. However, the 
remoteness of financial institutions has a nega -
tive impact on the availability of saving services

cial banks (% of GDP) in Ukraine decreased from 
34.1% to 24.8% (Figure 3). In 2017, the share of 
adults borrowing not from financial institutions 
but relatives and friends has increased from 32% 
to 36% compared to 2014.
According to the results, the lack of funds to open an 
account is the main reason for excluding the popu -lation of certain countries from the formal financial 
services system. For most countries across the world, 
this figure exceeds 50%, for lower middle-income 
countries it is 76.7%, and it amounts to 58.4% for 
Ukraine. It should be noted that in Ukraine the main 
reasons for the population exclusion from the formal 
service system are related to the activity of financial 
institutions. Thus, for 50.3% of the respondents from 
those with no financial institution accounts, the Table 2. Number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in selected countries i n 2009–2018

to innovative financial services is approaching 63%, 
and for youth this figure exceeds 86%. However, 
using the Internet to pay bills and do shopping on -
line is low, 22.9% and 21.7%, respectively (Table 3). 
Critically low are the values of Internet usage by 
rural populations – within 18-23%.

institution account is a necessary prerequisite for 
the population inclusion in the system of formal 
financial services, but it is worth paying attention 
to the focus of using the account. Significantly, in 
2018, only 21.0% of private sector citizens used 
formal financial institution accounts to obtain 
wages, indicating a high level of income shadow -
ing (Figure 5).
According to the authors, digital financial inclu -
sion provides an extremely high level of popula -
tion mobility and flexibility in financial servic -
es through access to an account using a mobile 
phone or the Internet. In Ukraine, only 18.1% of 
adults have this opportunity, while in highly de -
veloped countries this figure exceeds 51.8%. The 
coverage of the population by traditional payment 
card service channels in Ukraine is 39.1%, which 
corresponds to a similar indicator for the up -
per-middle-income countries – 38.1% (Figure 5).
According to the analysis, the results have been ob -
tained on the level of financial inclusion of adults 
through the use of traditional and digital channels 
and services (see Table 4).
The results show that in Ukraine, the availability 
of financial services using traditional channels 
and services is almost 60%, while the possibility Source: Developed by authors according to the Global Findex Database.

CONCLUSION
The study concludes that the financial service infrastructure in Ukraine i s unbalanced, and the level of 
digital financial services remains relatively low compared to Europea n and middle-income countries.
The main reasons for the limited access of a large number of consumers to financia l services in Ukraine are:
1) compulsive removal (financial isolation) resulting from hostilit ies, terrorism, and natural disasters;
2) forced removal due to lack of trust in financial institutions, their remot eness, high tariffs, etc.;
3) voluntary refusal due to lack of income or demand for financial products and se rvices;
4) unequal access of citizens to financial services in some regions of the coun try;
5) low interest or limited ability of non-banking financial institution s to provide certain types of fi -
nancial services using digital service channels;
6) inadequate legislative and regulatory control for the provisio n of certain types of services and the 
use of individual channels and innovative tools;
7) low public awareness of the use of innovative products and services.
Increased use of financial innovation in the financial sector requi res a renewed confidence in financial 
institutions, improved risk management for both clients and financial i nstitutions that may arise in the 
implementation and use of financial innovation.
The principal directions towards increased innovative accessibil ity of financial services of financial in -
stitutions, which should be under the constant control of the National C ommission for State Regulation 
of Financial Services and the National Bank Ukraine, include:
• state regulators must clarify the criteria for identifying and listin g basic financial services that fi -
nancial institutions can provide using digital channels and service sy stems;
• identifying and removing barriers excluding certain consumer cat egories from financial services;
• monitoring of tariffs for basic and innovative financial services;Table 4. Financial inclusion indicators by features of financial services to population in Uk raine and
