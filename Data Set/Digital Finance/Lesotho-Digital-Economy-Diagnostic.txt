  v | P a g e  ABOUT THE  DE4A  DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS IN LESOTHO  
 
 
This assessment of Lesotho’s digital economy development has been initiated as part of the World Bank 
Group’s (WBG) Digital Economy for Africa initiative  (DE4A) , which was launched in 2018 to support the 
African Union -led Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa. The initiative aims to ensure that every 
individual, business , and government in Africa will be digitally enabled by 2030.  
The assessment maps the strengths and weaknesses that characterize the national digital economy 
ecosystem (see Figure 1) and identifies challenges and opportunities for future growth . The relate d 
diagnostic framework is based on a standardized methodology focused on five key foundations.  It looks at 
five, foundational elements of the digital economy:  
● Digital Infrastructure: the availability of affordable and quality Internet , which is instrument al to 
bringing more people and businesses online.  
● Digital Platforms: the presence and use of digital platforms that can support greater digital 
exchange, transactions, and access to public services online.  
● Digital Financial Services: the ability to pay, sa ve, borrow, and invest through digital means, which 
is key to financial inclusion and increasing the e -commerce market.  
● Digital Entrepreneurship:  the presence of an ecosystem critical to widening and deepening digital 
economic transformation, which support s entrepreneurs, startups, and bigger companies to 
generate new products and services that leverage new technologies and business models, including 
private platforms.  
● Digital Skills: the development of a tech -savvy workforce with both the basic and advance d digital 
skills to support the increased adoption of technology and innovation and to enable investments in 
high value -added services.

vi | P a g e  Digital transformation is reshaping our global economy  and permeating every sector and aspect of our 
daily li ves, changing the way we learn, work, trade, socialize, and access public and private services and 
information  (Figure 2).  In 2016, the global digital econ omy was worth some $11.5 trillion ,  equivalent to 
15.5 percent of the world’s overall Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ). It is expected to reach 25 percent in less 
than a decade, quickly outpacing the growth of the economy  overall . However, countries like Lesotho  are 
still currently capturing only a fraction of this growth and need to strategically invest in the foundational 
elements of their digital economy to keep pace.   
Universal adoption and the effective application of digital  technology is expected to characterize 
economies of the future, shaping their ability to succeed in the global marketplace and offer a better 
quality of life for their citizens. Disruptive technologies are already altering traditional business models and 
pathways to development, yielding significant efficiency and productivity gains, and increased convenience, 
as well as supporting better access to services for consumers. Well -functioning digital economies thus may 
offer innovative products and services an d the potential to achieve faster economic growth, as well as 
creat ing more job opportunities. But d isruptive technologies coming onto the market also carry risks that 
need to be managed and mitigated ; for example, they may cause job losses in industries a ffected by 
structural change and automation. Assessing where strategic investments and interventions need to be 
made is a critical first step to enabling growth in the digital economy.

vii | P a g e  This report aims to highlight opportunities to develop Lesotho’s digital economy with a special focus on 
policies that can bridge the digital divide and help Lesotho achieve the DE4A targets.  Based on quantit ative 
and qualitative assessments  and the results of an in -country fact -finding mission, diagnostic findings provide 
practical and actionable recommendations that inform country digital economy targets and decisions on 
priority areas for development . The m ission resulted in a series of in -depth, background papers on each of 
the DE4A’s five pillars (digital infrastructure, digital platforms, digital financial services, digital 
entrepreneurship, and digital skills. They propos e a mix of possible policy reform s and interventions that 
directly address the need  for harnessing the economic and social benefits digital economies bring and the 
support for mitigating risks.

 xii | P a g e    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
 
 
Lesotho’s development agenda relies on its ability to create jobs and promote private sector growth. The 
second National Strategic Development Plan of 2019 aims to transform the country from a consumer -based 
economy to a producer - and export -driven economy. It emphasizes the government ’s commitment to 
engaging citizens and empowering individuals , characterizing t he digital economy as something that holds 
promise for meeting these objectives but not a s a panacea. In light of Lesotho’s challenges with poverty and 
unemployment, a special focu s is need ed on inclusiveness and participation in the digital development 
process.  
Globally, the digital economy has become an important driver of economic growth, innovation, and 
improved service delivery. Digitalization is fast changing the fundamental patterns of economic and social 
activity in our societies. Internet  users worldwide increased  from 1 billion in 2005 to around 4 billion by 
2018. The digital economy ’s contribution is expected to grow from 15.5 percent to a quarter of global GDP 
between 20 16 and 2026. Closing the digital infrastructure gap in Africa  can yield clear economic benefits, 
create much needed jobs , and lead to better services for consumers , complement ing development in 
human capital and improvements in other foundational areas .   
This report uses the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) methodology to conduct an examination of the five 
pillars of the digital economy in Lesotho  based on extensive desk research and interviews of a wide array 
of government  entities and other stakeholders , and focusing on  digital infrastructure, digital platforms, 
digital financial services, digital entrepreneurship , and digital skills . The report aims to highlight 
opportunities to further develop Lesotho’s digital economy , with a special focus on policies that can bridge 
the digital divide. Practical and actionable recommendations are put forward to aid decision -making, 
constituting a mix of possible policy reforms and investments .  
The report’s diagnostic findings show that  the digital economy is underutilized in Lesotho , though it  holds 
significant potential for national development. A coordinated , holistic approach is needed for building an 
inclusive digital economy  in the country . Improved digital connectivity can only make  a transformational 
impact on economic opportunity and stimulate inclusive growth if it is combined with improvements in 
digital skills and literacy, access to digital payments and other financial services, and support to digital 
entrepreneurs. The government ’s ability to  foster a strong , enabling environment,  develop platforms such 
as digital identity schemes , and leverage technology for improved efficiency and service delivery is key to 
progress in many of thes e areas. The combined effect of these improvements is larger than their sum.   
High -quality  and affordable broadband Internet  is a key foundation of the digital economy.  It contributes 
to enhancing productivity, facilitating information exchange, and impro ving service delivery across 
economies . Although great strides have been made in improving Lesotho’s digital infrastructure,  the 
country’s  adoption and use of technology is lagging. Although 97 percent  of the population was covered by 
a 3G network and 71.4  percent  by a 4G network by 2018, demand remains modest. About two thirds of the 
population  of Basotho are not using the Internet  regularly , pointing to a wide digital divide. Weak 
competition in the b roadband market remains a challenge and contributes to the high cost of 
communication services and low Internet  use by businesses and consumers. The telecommunications 
regulatory environment is , in many ways , sound, and Lesotho has one of the best performi ng universal 
service funds in Africa, but the regulator’s independence is hampered by its stake in the sector, creating a 
perceived conflict of interest. Efforts at improving affordability should be prioritized by promoting more 
competition and sharing  of infrastructure.  Demand -side measures looking at device affordability and at 
stimulating demand could encourage more adoption. The government  should consider ways of reduc ing its 
role in the telecommunications market and keep ing its levies and taxes reasonable. Overall, a more strategic 
approach to promoting universal access is encouraged.  xiii | P a g e  Public and private digital platforms are critical elements of a digital economy . Digital technology offers 
potential for enhanced efficiency,  transparency , and service delivery in the public sector, but the 
government ’s efforts in this field appear fragmented and slow moving. Lesotho ranks among Africa’s lowest 
performers in the United Nations’ global e-Government  Development Index (EDGI). The state of institutional 
readiness for digital platforms is low, particularly with respect to Internet /mobile platform savviness and 
the sustainability of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) projects. Existing ICT tools in the 
public sector are no t fully utilized and the interoperability of different systems is lacking. Private digital 
platforms have not yet found a proper footing in Lesotho and few locally developed , platform -based 
business  models exist.  However, progress is being made : Lesotho is  one of the few countries in Africa with 
a biometric National ID . The ID  has been rolled out to 85 percent  of the eligible population and is piloting an 
Application Program ming  Interface ( API) to facilitate verification and the authentication of identity by third 
parties. Additionally, s everal government -to-Business (G2B) services have been developed and adopted 
with success. Going forward, a  strategic , government -wide approach is needed, combined with an improved 
focus on the quality, accessibility , and interoperability of existing systems. Steps towards a more data  driven 
and citizen centric approach are recommended. The ability to integrate government  data directly into 
private platforms and services through open APIs would support the development of private platforms. 
Gaps in Lesotho’s regulatory framework need to be addressed to facilitate the adoption and expansion of 
digital platforms.   
Digital financial services (DFS) comprise a broad range of financial products and services  delivered 
digitally , such as payments, transfers, savings, credit, and insurance. They constitute a key enabler for 
transactions and financial inclusion in the digital economy.  DFS are crucial for Lesotho in the transmission 
of remittances, notabl y from South Africa, that play a vital role in many Basotho livelihoods.  Inward 
remittances contribute 17 percent to the country’s GDP. Developments in this sector in Lesotho have been 
led by mobile operators and banks. Consumers have been eager to adopt t hese services , and m obile money 
especially has successfully driven financial inclusion in Lesotho. The enabling and regulatory environment  
to support further innovation and market entry  is still quite rigid . The government  could demonstrate 
leadership by m oving ahead to both use and accept electronic payments across its government  services to 
businesses and citizens. The f ocus should also be on developing interoperability between different products 
and services and on improving consumer protection.  
Ensuring the availability of digitally literate citizens and a digitally competent workforce will enable 
economies to reap the benefits that a digital society brings.  Digital skills have a high priority in national and 
sectoral development strategies and plans, but their implementation remains insufficient, constituting a 
clear bottleneck for Lesotho and an area where policy and i nstitutional reforms are needed. Lesotho’s 
performance in digital skills needs to be understood against the broader context of education and human 
capital development : Lesotho scores 0.37 on the  World Bank’s 2018  Human Capital Index and is ranked 143 
out o f 157 countries. Digital skills development in Lesotho is hampered by the low level s of basic literacy 
and numeracy skills , with  a wide gap in basic level digital literacy. Measures to improve digital skills could 
have a significant impact on the country’s  growth and development . Small - and medium -sized  businesses, 
as well as large corporations, collectively indicate that there is a much higher demand for skilled ICT 
professionals than there are ICT professionals  available and willing to work in Lesotho . However, these 
measures n eed to be backed up by an  improved strategic focus and better data. Many of the key challenges 
reflect those that appear more broadly in  the formal education system and require improvement in the 
learning infrastructure, curricula, pedagogy , and upgrading of teachers’ competences.  There is an 
opportunity for p artnerships with the private sector to be expanded to fill these gaps and to  promot e 
innovation in digital skills development.  
Digital entrepreneurship creates new markets, products , and services and helps in the adoption of new 
technology and business models in the economy.  It can contribute to net employment growth and help 
enhance competitiveness and productivity. Vibrant digital entrepreneurship ecosystems are needed to help 
digit al entrepreneurs flourish . Such ecosystems encompass  a conducive business environment  that support s 
organizations, provide access to early -stage financing , and nurture s talent. Lesotho’s digital xiv | P a g e  entrepreneurship ecosystem is considered nascent, especially in comparison to its African peers. The 
country  is further disadvantaged by its small market size, cost of data, and brain drain to South Africa,  
viewed by investors as a more attractive  market. There are a limited number of IT firms operating in Lesotho 
and they face constrained growth due to a limited customer base.  The diagnostic finds tha t the quality of 
existing program s and services is inadequate for supporting the growth of idea -stage and early -stage 
entrepreneurs. Digital entre preneurship should find a clear champion in the public sector . It could be  
stimulated by increasing the quality of support programs, promoting access to finance , and leveraging the 
regional networks that exis t across  Southern Africa.   
The findings suggest that there is a need to shift the emphasis from supply to demand -side measures in 
Lesotho.  The digital services market is relatively underdeveloped and actions to to develop better local 
content, digital government  service s, and improved digital skills could encourage the adoption of technology  
and its use among the population. Looking beyond Lesotho’s borders is also necessary for the digital 
economy to flourish. As a small , landlocked country and market, Lesotho’s dependence on its neighbors, 
most notably South Africa, is high. But regional digital integration could provide major benefits, by 
promoting access to regional infrastructure  and to digital products and services , and by opening markets 
for Basotho entrepreneurs.  
Based on the analysis, three broad , priority  areas emerge as opportunities for Lesotho , illustrating where 
public and private efforts are needed to accelerate the digital economy . The  full list of  detailed 
recommendations is included in Annex 1, and all recommendations are elaborated  upon fully under 
individual chapters of the report.  
Priority 1: Improve the enabling environment for the digital economy  
The priority  area focuses on addressing noted policy, legal , and regulatory gaps, and stimulating the enabling 
environment for digital technology  adoption and us e. The measures outlined under this priority can assist  
Lesotho in increasing Internet  adoption , as well as in improving the use of its digital infrastructure  and 
advancing the development and use of its digital platforms and financial services . The f oundational pillars 
of digital development are linked to this priority concern with digital infrastruc ture and digital financial 
services. The i nterventions recommended under this priority include  the following : 
• Enhanc ing policy direction  for the development of the digital economy in Lesotho , by building upon 
the draft  national  broadband  strategy to guide  the deployment of digital infrastructure deployment  
and bridge the digital divide . The policy should be designed and drafted by the M inistry of 
Communication, Science and Technology (MCST)  in cooperation with  public and private sector  
stakeholders.  
• Improv ing the legal and regulatory environment for the digital economy by addressing identified gaps 
in legislation, with immediate priority given to passing the bills on cybersecurity and e -transactions , 
for which the ministry responsible is MCST.  Other important areas to address include data protection, 
consumer protection , and intellectual property.   
• Consider reducing the role of the state in digital  infrastructure development and identify ways to 
leve rage state -owned digital infrastructure in  more strategic ally. Priority should be given to divesting  
state -owned shares in  the West Indian Ocean Cable Company ( WIOCC ) and considering  how the fiber  
optic assets of the Lesotho Electricity Company  (LEC) could be used more effectively for improving 
national broadband connectivity.  This recommendation should be taken forward by the M inistry of 
Finance (MoF)  and MCST.  
• Improving the regulatory environment for digital financial services , including simplifying Know -Your -
Customer ( KYC) and Customer Due Diligence ( CDD ) requirements, lowering costs for remittances, 
improving market entry and interoperability, establishing a collateral registry and strengthening the 
regulatory institutions. T he party responsible for  taking these recommendations forward is in most 
cases the Central Bank of Lesotho ( CBL).  xv | P a g e  Priority 2: Drive digital transformation and demand by strengthening  public sector platforms  and 
infrastructure  
The priority area focuses on improving the public sector’s ability to  guide  digital transformation in Lesotho, 
both by : a) improving the leadership and coordination  of digital government  transformation ; b) enhancing 
the infrastructure and shared digital pl atforms that the ministries and agencies can use ; and, c) enhanc ing 
citizen -facing digital service delivery. Recommended interventions under this priority include the following:  
• Building upon the National Strategic Development Plan II, deepen the approaches to digitization in 
the identified sectoral and thematic priority areas. These approaches may be used as key components 
of more comprehensive , whole -of-government  approach to government  in Lesotho . Such an approach 
would defin e the roles, responsibilities , and coordination mechanisms between relevant ministries and 
agencies , and guide invest ments  in skills and capacity development  within key ministries and 
government  entities driving digital policies.  
• Ensuring that government  has the necessary infrastructure  and connectivity and that these are widely 
used. Specific measures  for government  infrastructure  can include : purchasing  Internet  bandwidth  in 
bulk  for the government ’s own use ; investing in shared services and enterprise systems ; protecting and 
storing government  data , including cybersecurity and data rescue and recovery facilities ;, enforcing 
standards ; and providing technical support for the operation and maintenance of government  systems . 
The MCST has a coordinating function within this agenda.  
• Increas ing interoperability between platforms for increased efficiency and service delivery by 
leveraging experie nces from the national identity system and enhancing the digital payment  
infrastructure.  A well-developed digital identity system can offer a platform for authenticating and 
verif ying services , which  should be used consistently where needed . Digital p ayments  can introduce 
significant  efficiencies and offer new ways to transact with the government . The government  should 
take gradual steps to adopt digital payment  options  across the various services it offers, including paying 
taxes and fees , and receivi ng social grants . Increased collaboration between MCST,  the Ministry of 
Home Affairs ( MoHA ), and CBL may further support the advancement of interoperability between 
critical platforms . 
• Develop ing citizen -facing digital public services to drive demand, access , and efficiencies.  Digital  
government  transformation should be based on a  user -centered approach  that responds to citizens’  
needs . To enhance the quality of the services delivered, it would be beneficial to develop monitoring 
and evaluation  tools for citizen -facing platforms and for  robust citizen feedback mechanisms . Moving 
towards the progressive digitization of government data would improve the ability to innov ate for 
service delivery in the private sector. Given that there are relatively few existing digital public services 
in Lesotho, the government  may want to consider how the agenda should be coordinated among the 
responsible ministries.  
Priority 3: Strengt hen the digital ecosystem through digital skills and entrepreneurship  
The priority area focuses on efforts needed in Lesotho for improving the digital skills of the population, 
ranging from basic entry -level skills to advanced digital talent and know -how. In addition, key actions are 
outlined for improving t he conditions and support mechanisms  for Basotho entrepreneurs to develop digital 
products and services for local and international markets . Both  areas offer significant potential for public -
private cooperation. Recommended interventions include:  
• Developing a  strategy and defining the implementation mechanisms for digital skills development in 
Lesotho . These efforts should be underpinned by a new digital skills framework and improved ways to 
monitor and collect data about existing skills. The education system should prioriti ze: a) expanding 
partnerships between industry and education : b) standardizing curriculum, assessment and pedagogy : 
and, c) improving achievement in foundational literacy. The responsible ministry for these actions is the 
Ministry of Education and Training (MET)   
• Improving digital infrastructure and connectivity in research and educational institutions  by 
establishing a Nationa l Research and Education Network  in Lesotho , resulting in lower cost s for  xvi | P a g e  Internet  bandwidth  and improved access to educational re sources. The commitment for establishing 
the N ational Research and Education Network (N REN) is already stated in the NSDP II.  
• Improve the coordination  and implementation of the digital entrepreneurship agenda,  among others, 
by identifying a public sector entity to coordinate activities  and catalyz e private sector champions  to 
support entrepreneu rship  programs, improv ing access to finance , developing the capacity of existing 
innovation hubs , and making sure Basotho entrepreneurs can benefit from regional and pan -African 
support programs. The M inistry of Trade and Industry (MTI)  should take responsibility over most of the 
activities.

Official Use  1. INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
Lesotho is a landlocked country with a population of about 2.0 millio n people . It is distinct in its 
mountainous terrain and  it is surrounded geographically by South Africa. With a 2017 GDP per capita of 
US$1 ,324, Lesotho is  a lower -middle -income country, but  still relatively poor by Southern African 
standards.  Over the past decade, it has experienced strong GDP growth , averaging around 3  percen t per 
annum , but experienced a slowdown after the droughts of 2015 –2016.  The economy is dominated  by public 
spending and agriculture, which contributes around 7.4  percent  to the country’s GDP and provid es 
sustenance to over 70 percent of the population.  Basotho migrant s, work ing mainly in neighboring  South 
Africa , make  a vital contribution to livelihoods through remittances. Lesotho is a member of the Southern 
African Customs Union (SACU) and government  spending is highly dependent on SACU revenues. As well as 
finding public spending inefficient  and hig h, the World Bank’s 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostic  (SDC) 
identified Lesotho’s weak business environment, poor access to finance, lack of skills and infrastructure, as 
constraints for economic growth.1, 
Lesotho is sparsely populated , and its population largely young and rural.  Unemployment is high with 32 .8 
percent of the working age population unemployed in the 3rd quarter of 2016 .2 Life expectancy is relatively 
low at 56 years . The persistence of poverty in Lesotho is strong despite economic growth in the past 15 
years. Lesotho’s poverty rate as measured by the national poverty line fell from 56.6 percent in 2002 to 49.7 
percent in 2017. By the international poverty line, 27.3 of Basotho were classified as poor in 2017. Although 
this is low when compared with other countries in Sub -Saharan Africa,  it is high among other lower -middle -
income countries and in the region  overall . Urban areas recorded strong poverty reduction , while rural 
areas’ poverty levels stagnated, adding to an existing urban –rural divide. The main channel out of poverty 
appears t o be secondary and higher education, which disadvantages rural areas where educational 
attainments are lower .3 The UN Economic Commission for Africa estimates that Lesotho would require 
5percent  annual GDP growth to significantly reduce poverty4.  
Strides have been made in improving Lesotho’s  digital  infrastructure, but its adoption and use of 
technology is lagging.  This is demonstrated by the low standing of Lesotho on the World Bank Digital 
Adoption Index measuring the adoption of technology by businesses , government , and citizens  (Figure 4). 
About  two thirds5 of Basotho are not regularly using the Internet , pointing to a wide digital divide that has 
been difficult to close.  Weak  com petition in the broadband market remains a challenge and contributes to 
the high cost of communication services and low Internet  use by businesses and consumers.  Lesotho suffers 
from a persistent digital divide, and multi -faceted problems around affordability, the lack of Internet -
enabled devices, limited demand , and poor digital skills hinder progress towards universal access.  
Lesotho’s private sector makes limit ed use of digital technologies.  In the private sector, digital technology 
can change the way economies of scale are achieved, particularly through e -commerce and digital 
payments. The digital economy may provide the better matching of buyers and sellers in  a competitive 
marketplace. Shifting cash into digital accounts for government  payments, remittances, Small and Medium 
Enterprise (SME) payments, and agricultural value -chain payments can enable broad -based participation in 
digital economy. Data from the W orld Bank Enterprise Surveys 6 show that only 15 percent of formal 
manufacturing and services firms in Lesotho have a website , compared with 31 percent of firms in Sub -
Saharan Africa  (SSA) . Few Basotho firms engage in e -commerce to attract international cu stomers. A recent

Official Use  e-Trade Readiness Assessment by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) 
identified the high price of connectivity, low uptake of technology , and low level s of digital skills and access 
to financing as bottlenecks i n developing e -commerce in Lesotho .7 A small local ICT industry has emerged  in 
Lesotho, held back by the small local market.  
The digital economy offers potential for enhanced service delivery in the public sector, but the Lesotho 
government ’s efforts in this field appear fragmented and slow moving. Lesotho ranks among Africa’s 
lowest performers in the United Nations’ global e-Government  Development Index (EDGI) , falling below the 
continental average and below other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries ( see 
Annex 6). Lesotho has taken first steps to develop e-Government  through investing in government  data 
cente rs and an online presence , but its efforts  are not well coordinated . Examples of successful initiatives 
include the national digital ID system and various G2B services offered online.  The 2019/2020 government  
budget reiterates commitment to accelerate the implementation of e-Government  services , and plans are 
underway to establish 46 community e -services centers, housed in branches of the Postal Services  and 
agencies countrywide.8 By ramping up its efforts to digitaliz e governance, Lesotho would be making services 
more efficient, accessible , and better targeted.

Basotho consumers have been rapid adopters of new technology in the form of mobile phones and mobile 
payments. However, limited digital skills  hold back the extent of their adoption and use of digital products 
and services. Although  Lesotho has a relatively high literacy rate in the Sub-Saharan Africa n context , with 
77 percent of adults and 87  percen t of youth  classified as literate ,9 human capital development remains 
weak . The country ranked 143 of 157 countries in the World Bank’s 2018 Human Capital Index  (HCI)10. The 
limited digital literacy hold ing back the adoption and use of digital products and services  restrict s the growth 
potential for digital businesses. Lesotho suffers from an exodus of skilled people to South Africa, which 
constitutes a drag on competitiveness and les sens the interest of companies hoping to grow their operations 
in Lesotho.  This constitutes a major challenge for Lesotho, with a limited pool of skilled labor and a small 
domestic market.

Official Use  Improved digital infrastructure can only achieve the desired trans formational impact if combined with a 
capable public sector, investments in digital skills and literacy, increased access to digital financial 
services , and ramp ed up support for digital start -ups and existing businesses. A holistic view to developing 
the digital economy is required. The following chapters of the report  will provide a diagnostic and offer 
recommendations on the five foundations of the digital economy in Lesotho . The report will examine, in 
turn, challenges concerning the policy and legal en vironment, digital infrastructure, public digital platforms, 
private digital platforms, digital financial services, digital entrepreneurship, and digital skills.  This report 
reviews how the digital divide affects the foundations of the digital economy and provides policy options 
for bridging the digital divide .

Official Use  2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS   
 
 
2.1.  THE DIGITAL POLICY AND LEGAL LANDSCAPE IN LESOTHO  
Well -defined policy direction and the ability to design national strategies and execute them are key to 
developing an  enabling environment for the digital economy. Lesotho has followed a sound model for ICT 
sector development, including independent sector regul ation and strong private sector participation. The 
telecommunications market was liberalized in the late 1990s  and followed by policy and legal steps to keep 
on par with the technological evolution taking place in the sector11. Lesotho’s  ICT Policy of 2005 and 
Communications Act of 2012 set the path for infrastructure expansion  and growing the digital services 
market.  
However, Lesotho currently lacks a comprehensive national digital policy or strategy that could provide 
policy direction,  principles, objectives , and monitoring and evaluation ( M&E ) arrangements for advancing 
digital development . As a consequence, c onvening stakeholders around a shared vision for the country is 
problematic . Although th e Ministry of Communications, Science an d Technology (MCST) has a definitive  
overall responsibility for designing and implementing  ICT policy , there is a lack of clarity about how ICT  policy  
interfaces with other sectoral policies and the mandates of other ministries and agencies12.  
In the absence of an up -to-date digital policy or strategy, t he five -year National Strategic Development 
Plan  (NSDP) has a guiding role in  Lesotho’s development efforts. The first NSDP  2012/13 - 2016/17 
identified ICTs as the backbone of a modern economy , contrib uting to the reduction of risks associated with 
urbanization, poor infrastructure, poverty, unemployment , and inequality. In June 2019, Lesotho finalized 
its second National Strategic Development Plan 2018/19 to 2022/23 (NSDP II) , titled In Pursuit of Economic 
and Institutional Transformation for Private Sector -led Jobs and Inclusive Growth . It aims to transition from 
a “consumer -based economy to a producer - and export -driven economy” by emphasizing private sector 
development and prioritizing citizen -centric development. Further more , the NSDP II underscores the 
Government  of Lesotho’s commitment to citizen engagement, empowerment , and participation in 
development.  
Technology and Innovation has been identified as one of the four key productive sectors in  the NSDP II. 
Four key priority areas (KPAs) designed to foster job creation, inclusive growth , and poverty reduction 
have been identified . The KPAs —and the medium -term outcomes the NSDP II desires —are shown in Figure 
5 below, with the outcomes directly re lated to the digital economy , highlighted.

In support of the implementation of the NSDP II, the government recently concluded : the creation of 
“economic labs ” designed to determine the countr y’s strategic development priorities; crowd ing in 
private financing to support its priorities; and increas ing its ability to deliver on its policy commitments . 
Outcomes of these economic labs were centered on NSDP II’s four priority sectors and , as part of the 
process, investment proposals that would support these sectors were solicited. There were 17 projects 
proposed14 in the tech and innovation sector with an expected 2.132 billion Maloti, equivalent to around 
US$140 million, investment , which  would create a projected 2,943 jobs by the end of the NSDP II period.  
The current state of legislation and regulation results in regulatory uncertainty and constitutes a 
bottleneck for digital economy development in Lesotho.  Several  gaps  outlined below  were identified as 
part of this diagnostic , requiring action to impr ove the enabling environment for both public and private

Official Use  sector digitalization . The diagnostic in this respect reinforces the messages from several recent studies by 
the WBG15, Research ICT  Africa  (RIA)16 and UNCTAD17.  
Lesotho’s cyber security preparedness is relatively low across all dimensions.  ITU’s Global Cybersecurity 
Index 201518 ranked Lesotho on last tier for both the regional (18) and worldwide (29) rankings with a score 
of 0.00. In 2017, Lesotho still ranked 143 with a score of (0.090). The WBG together with the University of 
Oxford conducted a cybersecurity assessment in Leso tho in 2019, with key results enclosed in Annex 9. 
There are a lack of strategies, institutions , and legal instruments to regulate and positively improve 
cybersecurity in Lesotho , and t he private sector is concerned about the level of the country’s risk ex posure . 
The Government of Lesotho  has been draft ed the initial version of the Cyber security and Cyber crime Bill  in 
201319, but effort s to finalize it have not yet led to new  legislation being passed. Lesotho has benefitted 
from international expertise in the drafting process , improving the quality of the draft bill . For example, the 
draft bill was reviewed by the Council of Europe in 2019.  
Having an e -transactions -ready legal environment is crucial to the development of the digital economy , 
but Lesotho lacks a clear legal and regulatory framework to enable online transactions.  While the 
Consumer Financial Protection Policy  is now in place, with support from the WBG, the Electronic 
Transaction s and Electronic Commerce Bill  has still not been adopted by the national Parliament20. With 
assistance from ITU, the Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce Bill  was drafted in 2013 and has 
subsequently been  through multiple rounds of review . The long -awaited enactment of the bill would clarify 
rules for the authorization of electronic transactions  and help to develop a safe and secure environment for 
consumers, businesses , and the government to rely on  electronic transactions.  
Consumer protec tion in Lesotho is presently regulated through fragmented pieces of legislation but there 
is no comprehensive legislation  that protects customers in Lesotho from unfair business practices . There 
is no provision for consumer protection in e -commerce. The cu rrent , eight  consumer rights ’ regulations  in 
Lesotho are set out in the Consumer Protection Policy 2013 , which is aligned with the UN Consumers’ Rights 
Protocol. There is a Consumer Protection Bill under legislative discussion that aims to set out the appropriate 
regulations and establishment of institutional structures to enhance consumer  protection in Lesotho. It has 
specific provisions for insurance, microfinance , and banking supervision.  Consumer protection rules should 
be tailo red for the full range of digital services and products. Such updates would best be combined with 
pro-competition regulation to ensure that digital platforms and digital start -ups are well -designed, secure, 
and operating in the context of market contestabi lity. 
The Data Protection Act  (DPA) from 2013 is somewhat out of date , given the rapid growth in data flows 
in the global digital economy , and therefore presents  significant  weaknesses . The DPA is not fully aligned 
with Europe an Union ( EU) General Data Protection Regulations ( GDPR ) and the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development ’s (OECD ’s) standards and guidelines. For instance, it sets out a mandatory 
breach notification obligation but not set a timeframe within which to report the incide nt, nor does it set 
out any standard or approach for technical measures to secure stored data. The DPA would  also need  
revisions to how sensitive data is defined and handled, and  introduce  amendments for data minimization 
principles, as data controllers ma y refuse requests by data subjects to access and correct data that is 
inconsistent with accepted practices.  Additional amendments could consider whether data subjects should 
be provided with additional rights, such as the right to data portability, right o f objection , and the right to 
withdraw consent to processing in order to improve individuals’ perception of sovereignty over their data.

19 International practice usually takes a markedly different approach to regulati ng cybersecurity as it does to cybercrime laws. For example, in the 
UK, the 1990 Computer Misuse Act deals with cybercrime and offences against computers, whereas cybersecurity is separately re gulated pursuant 
to the 2018 Network and Information Security R egulations. This is on the basis that cybercrime and cybersecurity are two different areas of law, 
with cybercrime rooted in criminal justice in contrast to cybersecurity regulations which are mainly related to information s ecurity standards.

Official Use  Moreover , the DPA sets out the Data Protection Commission (DPC) as the main authority to enforce the law ; 
however, the DPC has not been established yet and the law has therefore not been enforced since its 
enactment . Amendments are recommended to improve accountability and governance  and especially the 
independence of the Commission. Lastly, t he current act appears to unduly restrict data sharing within the 
public sector. Accelerating this process  would be needed  to ensure proper enforcement of the law.  
Other areas where weaknesses are apparent include competition law, intellectual property (IP) and 
access to information. Although competition in the digital communications markets is  well regulated 
through the Communications Act, general competition law presents an area where Lesotho could have 
stronger legislation in place . It is understood eff orts are underway21 to formulate a law to enable the 
formation of a competition commission. IP in Lesotho is protected by a law that dates to  1997 , and the 
country’s IP protection regime is not well regarded by stakeholders interviewed for this study. Lesotho’s 
lack of a specific law on access to information hampers efforts at developing a more responsive digital 
government and leveraging open data for development. Similarly, the lack of a Collateral Registry Bill  
prevents the establishment of an e -collateral registry. The Collateral Registry Bill  passed the Lower House 
of Parliament but  is still currently under consideration.  
Stakeholder consultations also indicated that modest understanding among some lawmakers of the scope 
of the digital economy and the workings of digital platforms create d an impediment to the development 
of a better legal and policy framework . In order to increase the degree of attention and the capacity to 
address ICT issues in parliament, an e -Government subcommittee has been established and first convened 
in May 2019, but its roles and responsibilities are still being defined. There are also capacity gaps in the 
capacity of the Office of Parliamen tary Counsel (OPC) with respect to the technical aspects of  drafting 
legislation  related to the digital economy . The combination of challenges with drafting legislati on and the 
need to build more technical understanding of digital platforms has proven to b e a major hinderance to 
Lesotho’s institutional readiness.  
RECOMMENDATIONS   
The resolution of key regulatory gaps should be a priority to improve the enabling environment for both 
public and private sector digitalization .  
R1. Address gaps in legislation . Lesotho’s regulatory framework need s to be updated  to be made more 
conducive for digital economy development. Existing draft legislation especially should be promulgated 
as soon as possible . Based on this diagnostic, the following prioritization is recommended:  
R1a. Passing t he Cybersecurity and Cybercrime bill should be prioritized to promote trust  and 
security  in the digital economy. The current advanced draft of the bill has already gone  through 
multiple rounds of reviews. The responsible ministry for this bill  is the Ministry of Communications, 
Science and Technology.  
 
R1b.  Passing the Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce bill should be fast -tracked by 
making sure it is on th e agenda of relevant bodies . For instance, the process sh ould be integrated 
into the Investment Climate Steering Committee Agenda and placed as high priority in the Cabinet 
agenda and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  
R1c. Legislation  for remaining gaps  should then be developed building upon best practices and 
regional frameworks22, but also by consulting stakeholders . These actors should be consulted 
during  the drafting process and focus ed on provisions that are practical for public and private sector 
actors to both comply with and/or enforce. In addition to the two priority bills above, important 
legislation to focus on include s the Consumer Protection Bill, Data Protection Act, the Act on  
Intellectual Property, the Collateral Registry Bill and competition -related legislation.

THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  
Fast, high -quality and affordable broadband Internet  is a key foundation of the digital economy.  It 
contributes to enhancing productivity, facilitating information exchange, and improving service delivery 
across the economy. The effect of increased broadband access on economic growth and employment has 
been  well documented23. Based on recent analysis by the World Bank24, closing the digital infrastructure 
gap in the East and Southern Africa region could result in 1.5 percentage point growth increase in economic 
growth per capita. If complemented by expansion in human capital development, the growth effect could 
increase to 3.87 percentage points.  
Lesotho has consistently followed a sound model for ICT sector development, including independent 
sector regulation and strong private sector participation.  Lesotho was amongst the earliest of countries in 
SADC to reform its ICT  market in the 1990s, adopting technologically neutral licenses for offering converged 
services. Telecommunications infrastructure has developed considerably, with three international gateways 
offering access to submarine cables landing in South Africa. Th e national backbone and backhaul networks 
are relatively well extended across the country. Furthermore, Lesotho’s Universal Service Fund (USF) is well 
performing an d has been credited with improving access to mobile communications services in remote 
locati ons. 
The NSDP II of Lesotho25 outlines the development of enabling infrastructure, including digital 
infrastructure, as one of its key goals. Within the ICT sector, the NSDP II aims at focusing on five areas: 1) 
Improving ICT Access and Use, 2) Improving S ector Regulation, 3) Enhancing e -Government Services, 4) 
Improving Digital Economy Uptake , and 5) Improving Governance of ICT Sector.  The emphasis on ICT 
infrastructure, adoption and use has been carried over from the first National Strategic Development P lan 
2012/13 –2016/17, demonstrating a longer -term commitment to ICT as a key foundation for development. 
The full list of objectives is provided in Annex 2.  
Despite several preconditions being in place, Lesotho has not been able to fully benefit from the 
expansion of its digital infrastructure.  Lesotho was ranked 133th26 on the 2017 ICT Development Index, 
(IDI) behind its neighbors South Africa (92), Botswana (105) and Namibia (118), largely due to limited use 
and demand of the country’s broadband infrastructure.  Based on statistics from the International 
Telecommunication Union ( ITU), only 27.4  percent  of the po pulation used the Internet  regularly in 201727. 
Competition in the mobile and fixed broadband markets remains inadequate  and, despite the open market, 
no market entries in recent years have taken place.  
 
THE STATE OF DIGITAL INFRA STRUCTURE IN LESOTHO  
Inter net Access  
Mobile broadband provides the primary means for people to get online  in Lesotho.  Despite the early 
introduction of fixed broadband in the 1990s, the introduction of mobile broadband based on 3G and 4G 
technologies has resulted  in mobile operators becoming the leading providers of broadband services. 
According to a 2016 survey by RIA28, more than 85  percent  of individual Internet  users indicated that they 
first used the Internet  on a mobile device, demonstrating the role that mobile connectivity plays. Mobile

Official Use  broadband coverage has been steadily growing in Lesotho.  According to the Glob al System for Mobile 
Communications (GSM) Association ( GSMA ) data ( see Table 1), 97  percent  of the population was covered 
by a 3G network and 71.4  percent  by a 4G network by 2018.  Full coverage maps are provided in Annex 3. 
Considering Lesotho’s difficult and mountainous terrain, progress on coverage has been rapid, although 
faster 4G services are only available in urban areas29. 
Based on ITU statistics used for benchmarking in thi s study, 27.4  percent  of Basotho used the Internet  
regularly in 2017  (see Table 1), compared to around 10  percent  in 2013. The level of Internet  access in 
Lesotho is , however , lower than in its regional neighbors in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. Although 
recent accurate statistics do not exist, b ased on a household survey from 201630, RIA defined Lesotho’s 
Internet  penetration to be at 32.5  percent , implying a significant ly higher actual rate of access  than the ITU 
statistics.  
Overall mobile subscriptions in Lesotho stood at 106.6 per 100 inhabitants in 2017, driven by multiple 
SIM-card use. Based on GSMA estimations the country was home to around 2.42 million mobile 
subs criptions in 2018. Although the overall market remains saturated, growth in 3G and 4G has remained 
strong with customers using more and more data. Mobile broadband penetration is relatively high, at 49  
percent  according to ITU (2017) and 56  percent  based o n the Lesotho Communications Authority’s (LCA) 
own reporting from 2018 (cut off point March 201831). GSMA estimates that Lesotho ha d 0.67 million unique 
mobile Internet  users in 2018. Based on the 2016 household survey, 44.5  percent  of mobile phone owners 
reported owning an Internet -enabled device in 2016, although the operators ’ own figures estimate this to 
be lower32. Data use in Lesotho has grown rapidly33, with consu mers moving towards over -the-top (OTT) 
services and increased sophistication of use.  
Internet use in Lesotho is strongly determined by age, settlement and education34. Whereas most Basotho  
in the 15 –24 age bracket were using the Internet  in 2016, this drops to 12.6  percent  in the 45 –54 and 6.3  
percent  in the 55 –64 age group categories. Education level appear s to strongly correlate with Internet  use 
as well: close to 90  percent  of individuals with a tertiary degree used Internet  against 32 .7 percent  for 
individuals with primary education only. Use dropped to 4.9  percent  for individuals with no completed 
primary education. Spatial differences are also clear: more than half of the urban population used the 
Internet , but only 17.6  percent  of the rural population were connected  (see Figure 6). Gender does not 
appear to be a strong factor of influence for access and usage in Lesotho.

Fixed broadband penetration in Lesotho is very low, around 0.2  percent  based on data from 2016, one of 
the lowest in Southern Africa and well below the global average of 13.6  percent36. Constitut ing a very 
small segment of the overall broadband market,  it comprised government ministries and agencies, 
enterprises and individual customers in the Maseru area, with altogether 3 ,849 subscriptions in 2018 
reported by LCA37, with a downward trend: subscript ions contracted by around 1 ,800 between 2017 and 
2018. Fixed broadband typically provides a more stable and faster connection than mobile and will form a 
crucial part of the next generation infrastructure mix. It is especially important in the case of high -bandwidth 
use cases, such as high -definition digital content streaming. However, deploying fixed  lines can be costlier 
than mobile broadband, requiring more civil work , and is in some cases more difficult , due to geographical 
barriers or sparse population  density.   
Affordability and Quality of Service  
Although mobile broadband coverage gaps are closing, affordability remains a concern.  Voice prices in 
Lesotho are in line with the regional average but remain relatively high compared with the best performing  
markets in Africa38. Based on RIA’s Mobile Price Index39, the cheapest mobile broadband product on the 
market would have cost US $4.18 in Q2/201 9, compared with US $6.96 in South Africa, US $8.99 in Botswana 
and US $11.13 in Namibia. However, contrasting prices with Lesotho’s lower income levels provides a 
different view . Based on ITU price data from 2017, 1GB of mobile broadband data appear to cost 8.79  
percent  of Gross National Income per Capita ( GNIPC ), well above the UN Broadband Commission target of 
2 percent  and higher than in neighboring countries.40 There are structural issues with pricing that work 
against poorer consumers: postpaid data is cheaper than prepaid, and people with less disposable income 
also end up buying smaller data bundles, which are costlier than large ones. The price of Internet -enabled 
devices constitutes a bottleneck for the adoption of Internet  among lower income consumers41.  
The fixed broadband market is significantly less developed than mobile, and prices are much higher than 
the regional average ( see Figure 7). Average fixed broadband prices in Lesotho are about 30 percent higher 
than the average in Sub -Saharan Africa, which restricts the use of ICT services by businesses and consumers. 
According to BDRC Continental, a 2 Mbit/s fixed broadband connection in Leso tho in December 2017 would

and lack of competition result in missing economies of scale in this part of the market.

Quality of Service is uneven in Lesotho. While overall international bandwidth has expanded, coverage of 
fiber -optic backbone networks is still limited to urban areas. Further more , 4G services are not av ailable 
outside of urban areas. Accurate , up-to-date comparative data of download speeds is not easily available 
for Lesotho. The largest operator Vodacom indicates43 that average download speeds in their network in 
March 2018 were higher than in Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo  or Mozambique, standing 
at 18.9 Mbps. In any case, Internet  speeds in rural areas are significantly lower than the average. Leso tho 
currently has one Internet  Exchange Point (IXP), the Lesotho Internet  Exchange, managed and funded by 
the LCA. An IXP allow s Internet  players to interconnect with each other and ensure local traffic is exchanged 
locally, improving latency and removing  high fees for international transit.

Market Structure and Competition Environment  
Currently, there are two Mobile Network Operators ( MNOs ) on the market: Vodacom Lesotho (VCL) and 
Econet Telecom Lesotho (ETL) . Vodacom maintains a comfortable lead over its rival with 64.8  percent  
market share at the end of 201844. VCL has been in Lesotho for over 20 years, launching its first commercial 
GSM services in 1996 and its 4G services in 2014.  It has also launched experimental 5G standard -based 
services45. VCL is 80  percent -owned b y the Vodacom Group, while the remaining 20  percent  is held by 
Sekhametsi Enterprises, a group of local investors. ETL has been in the market since 2002 , launched its 4G 
services in 2015, and in its current form is the result of a merger between the fixed line incumbent Telecom 
Lesotho and the mobile operator Econet Ezicell Lesotho in 2008. Lesotho also does not have any Mobile 
Virtual Network Operator (MVN Os) in the market, although the regulatory framework would allow for their 
entry46. 
Weak competition in the broadband market is a contributing factor to the relatively high costs of 
communication services and low Internet  use by businesses and consumers.  Despite the best efforts of 
the government to introduce more competition in Lesotho, the effective duopoly of VCL and ETL has been 
difficult to break with little interest from new entrants. The weak competition is reflected in the lack of 
standardized low -cost, high -value bundled services, which are available in other countries in Africa  
ETL is the biggest operator in the fixed line market with both ADSL and FTTH47 offerings , with  the latter  
available only in Maseru. In addition, there are two Internet Service Providers ( ISPs), ComNet and L EO, but 
their market share is small and concentrated in Maseru . Both ISPs  indicate an interest in expanding their 
services beyond the capita l, but high pric es of leased lines and wholesale bandwidth form an obstacle.  
Both MNOs also operate in the wholesale market.  Additionally,  LEC Communications  (LECC) , a subsidiary 
of the Lesotho Electricity Company (LEC) holds a Network Infrastructure Facilities License  and operates as 
a fiberco . Its business model is based on commercializing the fiber assets of LEC , designed to lease dark fiber 
to MNOs  and ISPs. LECC has a possible interest in start ing to provid e managed bandwidth to ISPs and to 
investigate the feasibility of building a national open access wholesale network , including last mile access, 
but so far this has not materialized.  
The government owns shares in several companies offering telecommunicatio ns services, which may 
result in a conflict of interest. Following the privatization of Lesotho Telecom, the government still retains 
30 percent of ETL. It also owns 100 percent of LECC , as well as a stake in the Eastern African Submarine 
Cable System (EAS Sy) through the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC). WIOCC is a special purpose 
vehicle created to enable parties that lacked the capital to participate in EASSy to gain direct access to the 
capacity from the cable. That LCA holds a stake in WIOCC crea tes a  perceived  conflict of interest, with LCA 
acting as a market player and a regulator, although  LCA holds the government’s shares in trust and  the 
management of the network is carried out externally by WIOCC. Operators are reluctant to provide 
commercia l data to LCA as they view them as a competitor in the sector, leading to distrust among the 
market players. This was a point of concern for all operators interviewed for this study. The government

46 Under the Lesotho Communications Authority (Licensing Classification and Fees) R ules 2018, companies that wish to operate as an MVNO 
require a Network Services licence from the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA). The rules state that an “MVNO licence is granted only when 
there is an agreement with a host ” 
47 At June 2018 ETL’s fibr e-optic plans ranged in price from LSL155 per month for a data allowance of 5GB to LSL5,865 for 950GB.   
13 | P a g e  
Official Use  does however recognize these concerns , as is reflected in the new National Strategic Development Plan II 
that outlines the need to develop a framework for divesting from both E TL and WIOCC48. 
 
First Mile: International Connectivity  
As a landlocked country, Lesotho is dependent on its neighbor South Africa for international connectivity. 
Through three international gateways49, Lesotho has access to the submarine cables landing in South 
Africa50. This part of the market is open and competitive and , in principle , non-discriminatory. However, VCL 
and ETL have direct and more favorable access to international capacity through their regional network 
infrastructure and parent companies.  
WIOCC provides a point of presence for the EASSy su bmarine cable in Lesotho to provide interest entities 
with direct access the cable. Although the government’s investment in WIOCC was intended to dramatically 
improve access to high -speed and low -cost bandwidth, benefits have been slow to materialize. It i s unclear 
if WIOCC prices are more competitive than purchasing capacity from South African wholesalers across the 
border, which operators are free to do. Further more , the ongoing conflict of interest through LCA’s 
shareholding in WIOCC is impeding the government’s ability to effectively regulate the sector. The use of 
the cable by market players is limited. ETL is currently WIOCC’s biggest customer by purchasing 2x1Gbps 
capacity.  
While the total , available international bandwidth has been increasing rapidly , demand for bandwidth 
remains relatively low . The p redominance of mobile broadband and limited broadband offerings skew user 
consumption patterns toward lower bandwidth services and content. Lesotho’s overall international 
bandwidth capacity is around 30, 000 Mbps, growing nearly 36  percent  over the past 2 years51. Only 17  
percent  of the available capacity is currently being utilized52, and there is ample room to meet growth in 
data consumption . 
Middle Mile: Backbone Networks  
Backbone investment in Lesotho has been concentrated primarily on major urban areas and on inter -
town routes.  The national backbone and backhaul networks are relatively well extended across the 
country53 by ETL, LECC and VCL. Significant investments have been made in recent year s to expand or 
upgrade the backbone. ETL has been working on the gradual modernization of its legacy network, investing 
over LSL 100 million in the process. LECC has altogether laid around 600km of fiber using Optical Ground 
Wire (OPGW) cables on their ele ctricity lines with an additional 300km to be built. And while VCL mostly 
utilizes LECC’s network under an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) agreement, it has also built routes from 
LECC power substations to its base stations. The ETL and LECC backbone networks are described in Annex 
4. Further links are being built through financing from the African Development Bank ( AfDB ). However, there 
is still heavy reliance on microwave for backhaul.  The need for reliable backhaul will inc rease with extending 
4G beyond the urban areas, requiring possible further investments in the fiber -optic backbone.  
Last Mile: Internet Access  
As outlined above, MNOs have played an important part in extending broadband connectivity in Lesotho.  
The last  mile is mostly built and operated by the main vertically integrated operators ETL and VCL, with a 
very minor role played by the two ISPs ComNet and LEO. Lesotho performs well in terms of its mobile 
broadband coverage with 97  percent  of the population cove red by at least a 3G signal, making excellent 
progress towards the DE4A target of 100  percent  mobile broadband coverage by 2030. Lesotho does not

Official Use  have any operators focusing specifically on the use of unlicensed spectrum , such as WiFi for Internet  access. 
In 2018, the LCA reported 53 Internet  Cafes in Lesotho providing public access to the Internet . 
Lesotho currently has no independent tower operators in the market and relies on the MNOs to build out 
their own infrastructure or agree on infrastruct ure sharing . A specialized tower operator54 could alleviate 
cost pressures and provide efficiency gains to the existing MNOs . Many mobile operators in Africa have 
followed this route to reduce costs and focus on their core business.   
The smaller ISPs are d isadvantaged by the vertically integrated structure of the market , resulting in 
relatively high wholesale prices. Their dependence on the major operators and the lack of open 
competition in the wholesale market makes accessing reasonably  priced unbundled l eased lines difficult 
and restricts the ISPs ’ ability to offer competitive retail services at scale, or to extend their services to smaller 
towns and villages55. Although they can access capacity through WIOCC, it is unclear if this offers any price 
advant ages.  
Lesotho is one of the few countries in Africa to have a well -functioning Universal Access Fund (UAF). The 
UAF was launched in May 2009 to develop and expand telecommunications services to remote and 
underserved areas not attractive to private sector  operators.  The UAF spends its full allocation of funds 
annually and maintain s an administrative cost below 20  percent . The UAF receives contributions from the 
LCA, the government and from private sector operators , which are  required to contribute 1.5  perc ent of 
their net operating income to the fund. To date, the UAF has financed 47 base stations across all 10  of 
Lesotho’s  regions , providing connectivity to 158,500 people , and connected 40 schools to the Internet  with 
an additional 10 schools receiving technology, digital literacy training and Internet  access. Through its e -
Government project, the AfDB has contributed to the fund by co -financing 75  percent  of five B ase Receiver 
Stations (BTS)  in 2017 –-2018 and aim s to scale up this work in the second phase of the project. The UAF also 
intends to support the roll out of public WiFi  to stimulate demand for broadband.  
Invisible Mile: Policies and Regulation  
Lesotho has a sound institutional framework in place for the ICT sector and digital infrastructure 
development.  The MCST has the overall responsibility of sector policies and legislation. Strong support for 
ICT sector development has been provided by both the first and the second NSDPs  of Lesotho. The current 
sector legal and regulatory framework is based on the Communications Policy of 2008 and the 
Communication Act of 2012. The government’s priority is achieving universal Internet coverage at 
affordable prices. Lesotho is however missing an up -to-date national broadband policy, strategy or a plan. 
Efforts at developing a National Broadband Policy since 2015 have stalled and the draft policy that was 
developed was never adopted or published56. According to the MCST, the work has continued in recent 
years —with the intention to develop a more concrete broadband plan —but this work has also not led to an 
adopted document. The most recent view of what the government’s current objectives  are can be found 
from the NSDP II , which outlines the following priorities: i) i mprove ICT Access and Use, ii) improve 
Regulation in the ICT Sector, iii) enhance e -Government services, iv) improve Digital Economy Uptake ; and, 
v) improve Governance of the ICT Sector . 
The LCA is Lesotho’s independent telecommunications regulator, also m anaging the UAF.  Lesotho has 
taken active steps to promote the growth of the ICT sector including an overhaul of the licensing 
framework to enable technology neutral licenses57. In terms of hierarchy, the LCA implements policies that 
are developed by the M CST, although there is a concerted level of coordination between the two bodies.

56 Gillwald, A., M. Deen -Swarray, and Mothobi. .(2017 ) 
57 LCA issues technology neutral  licenses which enable operators to provide a range of services subject to compliance with license terms and 
conditions. In March 2013, LCA introduced a converged licensing regime that simplified the licensing procedures. In 2018, the  LCA updated the 
Licen sing Classification and Fees Rules which aimed to “ align the regulatory framework with the evolving technology and national development 
imperatives .” There are four types of authorizations under this new framework including individual, class, permit and re gistration.   
15 | P a g e  
Official Use  Lesotho has a score of 67.83 out of 100 on the ITU Regulatory Tracker Index58, which is good by regional 
standards. The two weaker pillars on the index include the regulatory regime (score 16/30) and competition 
framework (score 18.33/28), indicating weaknesses in enforcing regulation and promoting a pro -
competitive market environment.  The current regulatory regime and licensing framework has been 
especially effective for expan ding mobile network coverage in Lesotho.  
Although t he LCA’s first attempts to regulate interconnection agreements dates to July 2007 ,  they were 
unable to enforce any decisions until they were backed by the Communications Act of 2012 , when a new 
glide path for a period of three years was established. Nonetheless, interconnection rates can be regarded 
as high when compared to neighboring  countries. The structure of the current interconnection regime 
ultimately  benefits VCL as the larger  operator. The World Bank has suggested59 to consider moving into a 
Sender Keeps All regime on interconnection fees but , based on the interviews carried out for this study, this 
proposal has not yet gained support.  
There is concern about high sector levies  and taxes in Lesotho. Operators in Lesotho are subject to 
regulatory fees and a requirement to contribute to the UAF. Currently, the LCA imposes an annual regulatory 
fee of 4  percent  of Net Operating Income (NIO) on all operators. This can be regarded as high by regional 
standards and against international best practice (see Annex 10 for benchmarking ) 60.The USF contribution 
stands currently at 1.5  percent  of NIO and can be increased to up to 2  percent  as per the LCA Act. This is 
higher than in a number of peer countries  (see Annex 10 ). In March 2018, the Value Added Tax ( VAT) for 
telecommunication services was increased from 5  percent  to 9 percent , with the expectation that it will 
further go up to 12  percent  and gradually be raised to be on par with the general VAT rate of 15  percent . 
This move would bring the VAT rate in line with South Africa. Even if partially absorbed by the operators, 
these VAT increases will impact retail pricing and raise the co st of communication for consumers.  
Based on the LCA (General) Rules of 2015, the LCA may require a licensee to share its communications 
infrastructure with another licensee on a first -come, first -served basis, through a cost -based pricing 
structure and no n-discriminatory terms and conditions.  In practice, infrastructure -sharing agreements in 
Lesotho have been voluntary and based on agreements between the market players, not designated by the 
LCA. It is the general view of operators tha t infrastructure  sharing is currently working, although problems 
with getting access to necessary ducts were mentioned by several  market players. This is a concern , 
especially in Maseru , where all fiber runs underground. Information on existing infrastructu re is hard to 
come by and not publicly available. The operators have joined forces and developed a M emorandum of 
Understanding  (MoU) on infrastructure sharing in 2018, also encouraging the government to develop rules 
around a “dig once ” policy.  
 
CONSTRAINT S TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET  DEVELOPMENT  
The overall state of Lesotho’s digital infrastructure is relatively robust but  marked by an inability to fully 
turn the existing strengths into consumer benefits.  As a result, Internet  adoption —by individual s, 
businesses and the public sector —is lagging.  Lesotho has made remarkable strides in a short period of time 
in extending voice and data communications to its citizens. The government’s chosen strategy has been 
marked by a mobile -first approach, and equating  Internet  access with access to mobile broadband is 
currently the norm. Fixed line access has been left a marginal role. Some of the key constraints include:  
• The current , vertically integrated market structure provides little incentive for either MNO to 
introduce strong price competition . Wholesale prices remain high, which create a barrier for 
market entry and for a scale up of services by independent ISPs or MVNOs.  Additionally, the

16 | P a g e  
Official Use  relatively high interconnection fees ultimately benefit the largest opera tor and squeeze out 
potential market entrants. A bigger gap between wholesale and retail prices , as well as lower 
interconnection fees , could enable smaller players gain foothold in Lesotho.  The wholesale market  
remains largely unregulated . 
• The state’s rol e in the market creates a perceived obstacle for effective regulation . The LCA’s  role 
in WIOCC has made it difficult for the regulator to collect market data and has been a factor in the 
wholesale market  being  left unregulated , although significant market share has been identified .  
• The lack of a coordinated approach to infrastructure build out and sharing can lead to unnecessary 
duplication . The lack of a coordinated dig once policy for fiber roll  out may not be adequate for 
Lesotho and,  combined with a voluntary model of infrastructure sharing and high expenses for 
build -out, can lead to higher than necessary costs.  
• The relatively high sector levies and taxes raise the cost of communication for consumers, even if 
operators are partially  able to absorb these costs . Rising VAT creates a scenario where prices are 
likely to increase in the near future and may further contribute to the unaffordability of services.  
• Finally, encouraging the adoption and use of broadband networks and services r elies heavily on 
driving demand for services. In Lesotho, international bandwidth appears underutilized and 
demand for data -heavy services remains  low. There are a lack of digital public services that could 
drive adoption and demand. The price  of Internet  enabled devices also restricts use.   
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
Improving the affordability and quality of Internet  services should be an important priority for further 
development in Lesotho. Faster, cheaper and more reliable Internet  will help Lesotho’s businesses connect 
to markets and improve productivity. The recommendations below aim to address the key issues inh ibiting  
the growth of high -speed Internet  in Lesotho. The market entry of  new players , able to challenge the existing 
MNOs  and disrupt the current duopoly model , would be beneficial for Lesotho . This  could be facilitated by : 
enforcing the stronger regulation of wholesale prices ; lowering the price of interconnection fees for smaller 
competitors ; and promoting infrastructure sharing.  
R2. Develop a strategy to bridge the digital divide  and guide broadband development . The government  
should establish an actionable national strategy for closing the gaps in Internet  access  and extending 
digital opportunity to all its citizens.  This could be most realistically done by revisiting and completing the 
draft broadband strategy that has been in development by the MCST. The successful finalization  and 
implementation of th e strategy would  probably require external support. The broadband strategy co uld also 
be a subset of a broader digital economy strategy for Lesotho.  
R3. Considering r educ ing the role of the state in the development of ICT infrastructure and leverage state -
owned digital infrastructure assets in a more strategic way . As part of the NSDP II, the government  has 
already expressed its intention  to develop a framework for divesting from WIOCC and reducing its  role in 
Econet61. Divesting from WIOCC should be prioritized in the short term. Taking this step would clarify the 
LCA’s position as an independent referee  in the wholesale broadband market. In addition, the government 
should consider how the valuable fiber assets owned by LEC and managed by LE CC could be further 
leveraged, for example, through bringing in private partners to assist with their commercialization. The 
burgeoning idea of the LECC building a national , open access wholesale network should be investigated as 
part of such a process , if proven commercially viable .  
R4. Strengthen Lesotho’s independent regulator while keeping costs reasonable . The current fee of 4 
percent  of Net Operating Income  charged by LCA is significantly higher than the fees charged by regulatory 
 
61 Econet has performed poorly in recent years and its liquidity indicators are a cause for concern, which could prompt the gove rnment to 
consider steps to divest from its ownership in the operator61.  
17 | P a g e  
Official Use  authorities in the region . Best practice in Africa is around 1 percent and the regulatory levy should be used 
strictly for the cost recovery of the expenditures incurred by the reg ulator.  In time, the government could 
consider rationalizing the regulatory fees in line with comparable markets.  
R5. Encourage the development of the wholesale broadband market . Subsequent  to the resolution of the 
WIOCC issue , the LCA should pay more attention to the regulation of the wholesale market segment of 
the broadband value chain.  The p romotion of : passive and active infrastructure sharing ; strengthening of 
open access rules ; implementation of transparent cost -plus who lesale pricing ; and the determination of 
regulatory remedies and local loop unbundling  would ensure that service providers have access to the newly 
developed networks on an open and non -discriminatory basis, which would help the market grow.   
R6. Set up and implement a  coordinated approach to digital infrastructure build -out with the private 
sector . A dig once policy, relying on real time information related to existing infrastructure, guidelines for 
rapid deployment and a coordinated way of accessing rig ht of way should be considered.  In order to 
promote competition, attract more investment  and increase coverage , it is essential that an effective access 
policy is developed and enforced. This would result in effective access to civil infrastructure , such a s ducts 
and poles held and managed by incumbents.  
R7. Promote the affordability of broadband -enabled devices and consider widen ing opportunities for 
individual access through device subsidies . Ways to alleviate high prices for Internet -enabled devices 
could be explored to stimulate the adoption of smartphones. The government c ould  consider lessening 
excise duties and other taxes on devices , and/ or subsidizing their purchase, e.g., through the USF . Subsidies 
should be targeted , as a priority , at lowest income consumers , to reduce digital gaps.   
R8. Purchase bulk Internet  capacity  for the government  in order to achieve scale . The government could 
move to a centralized model for procuring data in bulk to stimulate competition by aggregating demand.  
Similar models have been implemented with success in WBG -financed projects, for example , in Uganda and 
Malawi. This would entail the  government  purchasing large volumes of international bandwidth and related 
services for Ministries, Departments and Agencies ( MDAs ) over an extended period ( e.g.,  10 years).  As part 
of this process, service providers would be  able to benefit from heavily reduced , wholesale prices for 
bandwidth.  
Spurring the adoption and use of broadband services will also require significant efforts to drive demand  
and build digital skills . Specific interventions should be designed to promote  the use of services that are 
attractive to potential consumers, such as e -Government  services, digital payments and social media. 
Likewise, it is  important to invest in the development of digital skills n eeded to use technology efficiently, 
targeting especially those parts of the population with less formal education . These will be further 
elaborated in the forthcoming chapters of this paper.   
 
2.3.  DIGITAL PLATFORMS PILLAR  
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS  
Digital platforms are critical elements of a digital economy . According to the African Union Digital 
Transformation Strategy62, “digital public platforms —which may be provided by the government or through 
hybrid models in partnership with the pri vate sector —serve as a layer on which multiple public and private 
sector organizations can build new or better services and solutions.” They are often part of wider e -
Government systems  designed to leverage ICTs and to enhance transparency, accountability and efficiency 
in public administration and service delivery. “ Private or commercial digital platforms  include multisided 
marketplaces that ‘enable producers and users to create value together by interacting with each other’63 
 
62 Forthcoming  
63 Still et al (2017)   
18 | P a g e  
Official Use  and facilitate ‘matching, sea rching, exchanging, transactions, etc.’” They support a business environment 
where producers and consumers/users are able to create value through digital interaction, and “provide the 
place for collecting, sharing and aggregating data, performing analytics  and delivering new and improved 
services and goods.”64 
Digital platforms can serve people, businesses, and government agencies in all aspects of life, including in 
healthcare, education, commerce, transportation, and other public benefits . For the value o f these 
platforms to be maximized, they must be able to share critical information through an interoperability 
framework. Assessing the enabling environment for the further development of platforms is critical to the 
overall understanding of digital econom y in Lesotho. This diagnostic will first assess the foundations for 
digital platforms  (see Figure 8). The foundations include cornerstone public and private sector platforms, 
the enabling environment in which the platforms are developed and used, and the interoperability and/or 
availability of shared services. The analysis will also consider use-cases  that drive the uptake and use of 
digital economy , and additional platforms and functionalities  that enhance efficiency and service delivery.

THE STATE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS IN LESOTHO  
The landscape of public and private sector platforms in Lesotho is steadily evolving with the introduction 
of various back -end and front -end systems, applications and services; however, Lesotho still lags behind 
regional comparators significantly . Lesotho ranks among Africa’s lowest performers in the United Nations’ 
global digital development index, the EDGI , falling below the continental average and that of other SACU 
and SADC countries (see Annex 6).

Lesotho’s Cornerstone Public Sector Platforms  
Lesotho has most of the cornerstone , digital public sector platforms in place, although the level of 
development of their functionality varies . Each platform is discussed in turn below.  
Digital Identification Systems . Lesotho is one of the few countries i n Africa with a fully biometric National 
Identification Document ( ID), rolled out to approximately 85 percent  of the eligible population (1.1 of 1.2 
million) . The roll out of biometric National IDs was led by the MoHA, Department of National Identity and 
Civil Registry (NI D-CR), which is mandated to issue national IDs and passports, maintain a population 
registry, and issue birth and death certificates.  The NID-CR platform is an integrated system based on civil 
registration data, which includes birth, marriage and death registration, biometric details (photo, 
fingerprints)  and passport data  for Basotho over the age of 16.  Through itself a secure platform with user 
interface, the system links the front -end processes with the back -end database and updates it daily. Children 
are automatically linked with their biometrically verified parents and issued a unique , lifetime number , 
carried from birth to death. While uptake  of the biometric ID has been high, further efforts are required to 
reach populations in hard -to-reach areas  that do not yet have an ID.  
The National ID platform has the potential to become important for ‘government to people’67 transfers ,  
for example for the payment of agricultural subsidies, social cash transfers, or processes of identity 
 
66 Also known as ‘e -commerce ’ this allows vendor to provide services or products directly to a consumer via a website for direct purchase from the 
company or a retail marketplace that connects consumers to multiple companies and brands.67 G2Cplatforms   focus on service delivery across a 
variety of sectors with the aim of delivering said service in the most efficient (cost -effective and time -sensitive) way possible for citizens. Platforms 
may also share data to improve transparency as well as encourage research and business innovation .

20 | P a g e  
Official Use  authentication for bank accounts and small business loans to support private sector growth , among other  
things . Technical assistance to further expand the functionalit y, security, and use of the ID system is being 
supported through the World Bank ID4D Global Program .  
 
 
Financial Management Systems . An Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) is 
provided to all line ministries by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) , Office of the Accountant General . The 
IFMIS system utilizes Epicor software and was originally installed in 2009 with EU and Department for Box 1. Spotlight on Digital ID: Lesotho as a Pioneer in Africa  
In 2009, the Government of Lesotho decided to provide all citizens with a biometric national ID as a 
foundation for other critical government systems. As a result, in 2011, the government passed the 
National Identity Cards Act and the Dat a Protection Act. The transition to a digitized and centralized ID 
system began in 2013 . Over the course of three years, enrollment reached over 85  percent  of the eligible 
population. The Department NID -CR is now piloting an API to facilitate verification and the 
authentica tion of identity by government agencies (e.g. pensions and payroll) and the private sector (e.g. 
banks and insurance companies).  
Roll-out of the NID was the cornerstone of the 2018 –19 biometric census of civil servants and civil 
pensioners, which leveraged  the NID to verify and authenticate  the identity  of civil servants,  identify 
anomalies  within the government payroll,  and eventually  improve the efficiency of government spending 
on wages and civil pensions . Similarly, the NID is being used for the Old Age  Pension (OAP) proof of life 
verification exercise. The envisioned interface with the HR management system , OAP system,  and 
National ID platform would ensure that the National ID becomes the unique identification number for 
these types of government paymen ts. The credit bureau has also launched the Credit Information 
Sharing Initiative , which matches consumers with identity data  to access credit . 
A generic interface has been developed  that  enables the NICR platform to be connected to the digital 
platforms o f other public and private sector entities. At the time of the assessment, the following 
government systems ha d a basic connection to the NID platform for making queries: MCST ’s e-services 
platform; Ministry of Labor; Ministry of Tourism; Old Aged Pensions ; Ministry of Public Services . Due to 
increased instances of fraud in the financial services sector, the private sector has also already 
demonstrated interest in the National ID system for authentication. Recently, the first MOU for data 
protection with third -party users  was signed between a commercial bank and  the MoHA . Additionally, 
the use of the generic interface with the bank’s systems has been tested. T he next phase of 
improvements to the NICR system  will include increasing service p roviders’ ability to conduct biometric 
authentication  and increasing the robustness of the platforms’ data privacy and protection 
functionalities.   
However, a  number of steps will still need to be taken before Lesotho’s existing legal framework is 
ready t o support data sharing with the  public and private sector . The scope of permitted disclosures 
may need to be amended to  cover the categories of recipients and data sharing purpos es envisaged by 
the government, particularly for administering pensions and sa lary payments to public servants . Data 
minimization principles should be adopted, and governance arrangements bolstered to improve 
accountability and transparency . Sector -specific template agreements for ID data sharing with 
government agencies or the priv ate sector, as well as a data sharing code of conduct, may also help to 
reinforce individual privacy rights, improve transparency and build confidence.  Cybersecurity legislation 
may also be considered to provide legal protections, especially to critical di gital infrastructure.  
  
21 | P a g e  
Official Use  International Development (DFID ) financing68, but the system was only partially utilized and experienced 
major challenges with improper use due to i nadequacies in:  
• Infrastructure , e.g. Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) issues , and a weak 
relationship with MCST resulting in the lack of software, core network and data center maintenance, 
joining of insecure workstations with IFMIS;  
• capacity (e.g. large percentage of untrained users, no onboarding of new users, no ongoing training, 
weak quality control);  
• support (e.g. weak business processes, reliance on consultants, high turnover, ineffective and mis -
mapped help desk); and  
• change management (e.g. limited change management due to pressure to “go live ,” the lack of 
integration of software into business pra ctices, limited use for financial control, a bypassing of 
approval and password protections, and transactions  still occurring outside the system).  
IFMIS69 was subsequently upgraded in early 2019 , using financing from the World Bank , and is configured 
as a government -wide platform to support budget execution by all line ministries. IFMIS implementation 
has the aim of being a single platform for public financial management of the Consolidated Fund . 
Utilization of the IFMIS facilitates national budget development, execution and financial control , by 
requiring all MDAs to execute and control their budgets through the IFMIS. As of now, IFMIS only connects 
central -level MDAs and supports their operations in the districts through sub -account ancies of the Office of 
the Accountant -general. Further roll -out (to District Councils) is dependent on connectivity and associated 
configuration, capacity building and change management. The IFMIS platform provides access to the 
“treasury single account” system provided by the CBL, the central bank,  for the execution of cash 
transactions related to the revenue and expenditure budget, including the payment of civil servants’ salaries 
and old age pensions. The government is also moving to digitiz e back -office process es and is moving to 
digital payments for paying out  old-age pensions . Digitization has already resulted in efficiency gains 
through the removal of persons erroneously receiving pensions. The Lesotho Revenue Authority 
electronically collects tax p ayment and the data is integrated into IFMIS.  
Human Resource Management . The Government of Lesotho uses a Human Resource Management 
Information System (HRMIS)70 to manage the size and structure of the civil service, maintain employment 
records, and manage  its payroll.  The payroll module has been used to process payroll for 55,000 plus civil 
servants and pensioners since July 2016; and the core modules have been rolled out to 32 line ministries. 
Additional modules have been purchased but are not in use. In the views of the Government of Lesotho and 
HRMIS experts familiar with the Lesotho context, the original system relied on an off -the-shelf modular 
software that was not sufficiently customized to the HR business processes of Lesotho. There are also 
control  weaknesses related to data entry and validation. In an effort to address these challenges and 
leveraging financing from the World Bank, the government has completed biometric census of civil servants, 
civil pensioners, and village health workers to “clean” its HR records by authenticating the identities and 
employment status of those on the government payroll. There is a link between the HRMIS’ payroll function 
and IFMIS, wherein IFMIS validates the availability of government  funds , before initiating a dis bursement 
from the Central Bank. However, payroll transactions are not yet fully automated.71 The government 
recently undertook  a detailed assessment of the HRMIS system  and business processes. S imultaneously , it 
was informed by the HRMIS vendor that the existing system would no longer be licensed for clients in region. 
As a result, the government is procuring a new system with a view of  customiz ing it to its existing business 
 
68 The EU was the primary donor and DFID supported a Treasury Advisor for the Treasury department and formation of IFMIS Impleme ntation 
Work Groups (EU, 2013).  
69 The IFMIS platform runs on the EPICOR 10.2 - IFMIS Platform for Budget Management  
70 The HRMIS platform runs on the Resource Link Platform with operations and maintenance provided through NGA, as South Africa b ased firm . 
71 At the moment there is an interface to upload payroll system to the ledger for I FMIS, but this is not yet automated. Importing and validation of 
electronic payroll files is still done manually.   
22 | P a g e  
Official Use  processes.  The new system would also interface  data from the biometric census of civil service with the 
NICR system, the HRMIS  and, eventually , the Old Age Pensions database  to facilitate cross -checking .  
Even with the procurement of a new system , analogue challenges will remain , including clarifying the 
types of payments that should occur through the payroll versus other government payment platforms , 
and change management for the successful implementation of the upgrades . There are some payroll 
transactions that still lie outside of the HRMIS system , including several grades of civil servants paid from 
local government budgets; separate accounts for paying teachers who are also nuns; and, temporary 
employees being paid directly from the treasury ’s single account as vendors. There are also non -payroll 
trans actions that are completed through the HRMIS system , such as stipends for schools that collect data 
on behalf of the water and energy utilities  and allowances for Chiefs , processed as salary payments to 
Senators. Changes to these procedures will require a clear , authorizing environment and smooth change 
management to ensure the HR platforms are optimized to increase government efficiency. Also, all support 
activities are currently handled by the system’s vendors, not government IT employees. There is no use r 
support structure in place. Therefore, the Ministry of Public Service would also need to take stock of their 
internal IT staffing requirements as part of change management and an effective system operations and 
maintenance.  
Digital Procurement Systems . Lesotho does not have an electronic procurement system and limited 
information on tender no tices and contract awards is published in the government portal, through which 
prospective bidders can download the bidding documents.72 The Procurement Policy Advisory Division 
(PPAD) under the MoF is responsible for monitoring public procurement and the management and disposal 
of assets. PPAD requires annual procurement plans from various ministries at the beginning of each fiscal 
year, but the plans are not available in the public domain. Vendor registration with the PPAD is mandatory 
for doing business with the government and the PPAD hosts the central database of vendors. But the PPAD 
still does not have its own web portal. Yet, the IFMIS capture s supplier information and records requisitions 
and orders. In 2012, an initiative to develop a Public Procur ement Management Information System began  
and will be evaluated during an upcoming e -procurement readiness assessment . The a doption and 
implementation of such a system would further develop these functions and increase accountability and 
competition , as we ll as support ing sourcing from local S mall and Medium Enterprise s (SMEs) . Further more , 
a new public procurement law is being drafted and may have a bearing on how e -procurement develops in 
the coming years.  
 
Lesotho’s Cornerstone Private Sector Platforms  
Lesotho has few cornerstone private sector platforms in place and lags behind comparators in this regard . 
Each platform is discussed below.  
Digital Payment Platforms . Digital payment platforms are underdeveloped with few public and private 
sector platforms  enabled for online payments . Only a handful of government agencies offer digital 
payment options , such as payments for land tax and construction  permi ts. Currently most  Child Grants 
Program (CGP) payments are paid by Cash in Transit (CIT) , which provides  cash payments in pre -packed 
envelopes marked with barcodes for improved security, accounting and reconciliation, while just less than 
25 percent  of the payments are made digitally via mobile money. For the OAP  program, pensioners are paid 
cash in hand at pay points with relatively poor measures of recordkeeping and reconciliation. However, the 
Pensions Department of the Ministry of Finance is developing a new system where pensioners can be paid 
digitally via Lesotho Post Bank ( LPB, the state -owned commerci al bank) or mobile money (particularly 
MPesa)  as an alternative to cash payments. The new system is being designed and will be piloted and rolled 
out in 202073. Ultimately, the government would like to develop  harmonized payments systems across all 
social assistance programs ( the CGP, OAP, and Public Assistance Program). Public enterprises for water and 
 
72 Portal is accessible at https://www.gov.ls/document -category/tenders/  
73 Regarding the new system, it is not yet fully known what the uptake of e -payments will be among the pensioners; however, measures will be 
put in place to expand the share of e -payments over time. A cash option is being kept but will be designed in a more secure way.   
23 | P a g e  
Official Use  electricity also allow customers to pay their bills via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data ( USSD ), 
online and mobile platforms. Consumer  demand for digital payment platforms has , to date , remained low; 
stakeholders noted that, by and large, citizens prefer to pay through traditional paper -based banking , as 
people do not trust that their transactions will be secure  or that  their payments will reach  the intended 
recipients.  
Digital Commerce and Marketplaces . Both international indices and stakeholder consultations indicate 
that Lesotho has a low state of readiness for digital commerce and marketplaces. The three key indices 
for private sector platfor ms (see Table 2) place Lesotho in the bottom quartile , which indicates that growth 
potential is limited and improving the enabling environment is key. Most e -commerce and digital 
marketplaces used are international platforms based outside of Lesotho. Leadi ng platforms include e -
commerce giants such as Asos, Amazon South Africa, and eBay, but ideally, Lesotho would have a market 
mix that enables specialized local e -commerce platforms hosted by SMEs to piggyback on the availability of 
global platforms. Annex 5 lists the digital commercial platforms and marketplaces in use in Lesotho. The 
number of platforms/applications in Lesotho is low and not all platforms function well. Further more , 
stakeholder consultations indicated that private sector platforms are unab le to grow their user base and 
reach scale, due to challenges with marketing (e.g., domain, or the platforms can not be found easily) and 
business development.  
Webhosting  and Domains . Stakeholders cited the unavailability of local webhosting and domains as a 
barrier to public sector efficacy and private sector growth. For example, government  ministries do not 
have a protected e -mail system and even cabinet -level officials use private email accounts to conduct  
government  business. Few web domains are hosted within Lesotho. A 2016 report by the RIA group 
indicated that the number of local websites and applications was so low that they could not evaluate it on 
its own , and instead used the number of Facebook user s as a proxy to measure locally generated web 
content.  
 
Lesotho’s Digital Platform Use -Cases and Applications  
Main platform use -cases and applications in Lesotho are discussed below.  
Digital Service Delivery . Numerous platforms are designed for service delivery across sectors,  such as 
agriculture and trade.  While development of a government e -portal is in the pipeline, most of these public 
platforms are not interoperable or readily interfaced with e -payment infrastructure. The platforms are 
brief ly discussed below , and platforms develop ed by non -profits are highlighted in Annex 5 . The platforms 
discussed begin with those that are least developed and functional , moving to the more developed and 
functional. Ordering the discussion in this way reveals that the more developed, functioning platforms are 
managed by semi -autonomous agencies and entities, implying that autonomy in HR and decision -making 
processes has, th us far, been an important factor in platform development in Lesotho.  
• E-Legal Information System . In December 2018, the Law Reform Commission began using a digital 
platform to categorize and make publicly available statutory laws that were promulgated betw een 
1800 to 2016. Lexis Nexis (Pty) was engaged to provide this service and the work is expected to be 
completed in June 2019.  
• E-Credit Bureau . The e -credit bureau gathers credit data about legal persons and use s it for credit 
history and , sometimes , to es tablish a credit rating. Lesotho’s e -credit bureau is third -party 
developed, maintained, and operated, but the license for the system is issued by the Central Bank.  
• Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC) Information Portal . This platform is operat ed 
by the LNDC and includes information about foreign direct investment, lending to SMEs, special 
economic zones, the property management of industrial shells, export promotion and government 
shares in private companies.  
• Customs and e -Single Window . Lesot ho uses the Automated System for Customs Data  (ASYCUDA)  
World system, which is an import/export/trade logistics system  created by UNCTAD and managed  
24 | P a g e  
Official Use  by the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA). The platform allows the various transactions required for 
customs c learance —such as health and safety clearance , and the collection of duties —to occur 
through a portal , greatly increasing efficacy at border crossings. The system is being upgraded to 
provide backup and redundancy measures for  the data collected. Under WTO TFA Article 10.4, 
countries are required to have a digital “single window ” trade platform. Single window enables 
those importing, exporting, or transiting goods through a port of entry to submit documentation to , 
and/or comply with , the data requirements set by  the relevant authorities. Lesotho’s single window 
is under development and managed by LRA.  
• Digital Livestock Registry . The livestock registry is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Security and allows livestock owners to tag their lives tock and report missing and stolen cattle 
through an SMS -based mobile application. Stakeholders indicated that this platform has been 
successful in the recovery of numerous livestock , as well as in conflict prevention when livestock -
ownership has been call ed into question.  
• One Stop Business Facilitation Centre (OBFC) . The OBFC is both a brick and mortar center and a 
web -portal that allows new businesses to access and complete the more than 20 separate 
procedures required to start a business in a single loc ation. The OBFC portal was configured by 
UNCTAD and is managed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in collaboration with the 
Chamber of Commerce  and Industry (LCCI) . The portal aggregates several e -services , including e -
construction permit s and ele ctronic requests for Tax ID.  
• E-Land Registry . The Land Administration Authority (LAA) relaunched its digitized system in 2016. 
The platform is for tracking the land registration and deeds and data obtained from land surveys, 
the surrender of lease rights and land -related disputes. The system can alert the LAA to overdue 
land transactions and has increased the degree of efficiency in the land administration system. For 
example, land taxes can now be paid digitally. Additional phases of the system’s developm ent will 
expand its functionalities over the next 2  to 3 years.  
• Lesotho Integrated Transport Information System and Road Accident Data Management System . 
The existing traffic and transport information management system is being updated in order to 
moderniz e and harmonize services , which include services on driver licensing, vehicle registration , 
and vehicle inspection. In parallel the  Road Accident Data Management System is being developed, 
which aims to offer a superior platform for recording and reporting  accidents  in order to enable the 
development of programs and policies for improved road safety in Lesotho.  
Digital Citizen Engagement and Feedback Platforms. The use of digital citizen engagement and feedback 
platforms in Lesotho has not yet begun. Citizen feedback mechanisms in general are few and there is no 
centralized avenue for gathering citizen feedback. This is reflected in Lesotho’s ranking as 185th (out of 195) 
in the world on the E -Participat ion Index (EPI ). The Office of Prime Minister (OPM) , Public Sector 
Effectiveness Unit, with support from the World Bank Public Sector Modernization Project, is completing a 
scoping exercise for a pilot digital citizen feedback mechanism. While this activit y is in the very early planning 
stages, the platform would include : web -based data entry/collection, SMS communication, response 
analysis and reporting application, an SMS gateway connected to a long/short code for connectivity , and a 
couple of phones for making voice calls to service beneficiaries. Initially, piloting will focus on a single service 
in a priority sector such as education, health or transportation. Future phases of support for e -governance 
may scale up the system across sectors. There also h as been a proposal by the government  to establish a 
national , one stop call center in the OPM, to allow citizens to call in for complaints and the OPM to monitor 
service delivery across ministries. The Ministry of Health is in the process of establishing a n in-house contact 
center to facilitate the logging and resolution of complaints  as well . If these contact centers are approved 
and established, then citizen feedback mechanism s will be run using these systems and only one additional 
layer for response ana lysis may be required. The c onsolidation of contact centers into a single , centrally 
managed center  would be ideal, helping to clarify the responsibilities involved in its procurement, 
maintenance and use across governmen t.

Open Data Platforms . In Lesotho, there is an emerging Open Data Initiative being introduced by civil 
society and academia but there is no apparent buy -in from high -level public or private sector actors. 
Further more , many key public records and datasets have not been fully digitized, such as the company 
registry, land registry, procurement data, and climate data, and there is not yet an electronic document 
management sys tem for the governmen t. The assessment revealed that the re is a  perception, especially 
among parastatals, that government  data do not need to be widely shared . This perception  is a significant 
disincentive to developing platforms for data sharing. Stakeholders indicated that the lack of publicly 
available data slows innovation and creates hesitation on the part of potential foreign investors. There is 
significant room for Lesot ho to leverage digital platforms to increase accessibility to data, perhaps giving  
priority to types of data that would facilitate investments in the economy and innovation.  
Social Media Platforms . While Internet  use in Lesotho is still relatively low (see chapter on digital 
infrastructure), social media use is growing, providing an opportunity to increase access to information 
about goods and services. While there are no robust statistics available about how Baso tho use different 
social media platforms, about 86  percent  of Internet  users access social media, primarily through mobile 
connections. Usage of Facebook is known to be only 22.6 users per 100 inhabitants on average , however .74 
Lesotho has not reached the point where MDAs and businesses are levering social media to support 
information -sharing and marketing.  
 
CONSTRAINTS TO DIGITAL PLATFORMS DEVELOPMENT  
The enabling environment —particularly the legal framework, interoperability framework, capacity, and 
chan ge management —is the major obstacle to  greater development  of the digital platforms in Lesotho.  
 
74 Gillwald, A., M. Deen -Swarray, and Mothobi. O. (2017 ) Box 2: Lack of interoperability framework  
Most  public sector  platforms in Lesotho  are developed independently by government  line 
ministries —mostly without u sing standardization protocols —and w ere not designed to be linked to 
any other platforms or a shared services system.  MDAs have worked with numerous vendors from a 
wide range of international firms to develop their platforms and thus their interoperability 
mechanisms, such as Application Pro gramming Interface s (API), will have to be designed individually. 
Further more , there is no coordination or centralized knowledge base for digital platforms.  
Some MDAs and private sector entities are also using interoperability as a means of cost recovery. 
The MoHA, LPB,  and various mobile money providers will charge per hit for the use of their respective 
APIs to authenticate identity and issue pension payments, for example. While this method of cost 
recovery is not atypical, it has delayed progress in crea ting interoperability across key platforms, and 
many potential users do not want to pay for authentication services.   
As a standards ’ promoter, MCST has attempted to set guidelines to facilitate interoperability among 
public sector platforms and with private sector platforms.  The use  of common hardware and software 
across government  has been promoted. Now, MCST is pursing opensource, op en architecture, and 
open interface requirements for all IT vendors in contract s with the Government  of Lesotho. The 
Ministry has developed protocols for interfacing the different platform s said  to be  used for the IFMIS 
platform and MTI’s Business Registry . However, most MDAs interviewed were unaware of these 
standards.  
Enhancing the interoperability of platforms for service delivery will encourage their use and increase 
demand for Internet  and digital services, especially in rural areas.  This should be tak en into account 
in future financing and technical support for e -Government in Lesotho.   
26 | P a g e  
Official Use  The c enter of government  does not have and/or has not conveyed a strong drive to foster an enabling 
environment for Lesotho’s digital economy. Th is lack of drive has contributed to a digital platforms ’ 
landscape where public and private sector digital platforms are few, exist mainly in isolation of each other, 
and are most often present where there is strong leadership and , also, a relatively high le vel of digital skills. 
The k ey constraints to digital platforms ’ development are discussed below . 
Lesotho’s policy and legal framework for digital platforms is underdeveloped an d is part and parcel of the 
major constraint s affecting the advancement of publ ic and private sector digital platforms . Several 
significant legislative gaps are to be filled, as is further detailed above in Section 2.1 . In order to increase the 
amount of attention and the degree of capacity needed to address ICT issues more effective ly in parliament, 
an e-Government  subcommittee has been established . It first convened in May 2019. It is envisioned that 
MCST’s ICT department would become the de facto  e-Government  authority reporting to the 
subcommittee.  
There is a lack of government  strategy  to guide policymaking for e-Government . As a result , the definition 
of roles and mandates  of various government  entities, as well as the allocation of  resources and capacitie s 
across government  entities , remain unclear.  MCST, which acts de facto  as the lead agency for e-
Government , is not well positioned  to provide strategic guidance across multiple institutions that have 
different needs and priorities, and coordination between MCST and other MDAs does not function 
optimally.   
A range of technical skills and capacities exist and could support digital plat forms; however, by -and-large, 
they are not present or retained in the public sector . Government  capacity is viewed as weak , with  a 
perceived flight of talent from the public sector to the private sector and often to outside of Lesotho. This 
results in more  reliance on international technical expertise. The issue of public sector digital skills is 
explored in more detail in the digital skills chapter below.  
The state of institutional readiness for digital platforms is low, both in the public and private sec tor, 
particularly with respect to being Internet /mobile platform savvy and ability to reach sustainability for 
ICT projects.  For example, there are no Lesotho -based dedicated apps for the delivery of commercial or 
public services, and organizations did not  indicate plans to roll out such mobile platforms in the near future. 
There are multiple donor efforts to support the development of digital platforms, but the government  has 
no coordinated means to sustain them after donor funds are exhausted.  
Change man agement is not embedded in MDAs, something that  hampers the adoption of digital 
platforms and decreases likelihood of their sustained use.  Stakeholders cited instances of passive 
resistance to the increased transparency, accountability and efficiency that digital platforms could bring, as, 
for example, digital platforms may reduce opportunities to interact outside the protocols. Outsourcing ICT 
expertise also slows organizational adoption.  
Lesotho’s digital platforms landscape is highly fragmented and not designed in a way that supports the 
development of an interoperability framework.  As discussed above, there are numerous platforms housed 
in individual MDAs or private entities, developed separately, mostly without utilizing standardization 
protocols or co nsidering linkages with any external platforms.  
Lesotho is not yet able to leverage shared services to deliver platforms across MDAs or to decentralize to 
rural areas.  While MCST manages the existing government  network and aims to centralize the hosting of  IT 
systems and data,75 at present, many MDAs have their own servers or infrastructure. MDAs interviewed 
complained that the central data center ’s connectivity is too slow, and that downtime can last as long a s a 
 
75 There is a centralized Tier 2 data center in Maseru, and new Tier 3 data center 130km from Maseru is being built for disaster  recovery. This 
infrastructure supports the government ’s e-services portal and will be used for the government  email system that is  under development. A 
combination of physical and cloud storage is used. However, informed protocols are missing about which data should be stored where, e.g., 
whether sensitive identity data should be stored on the cloud.   
27 | P a g e  
Official Use  day. The MDA -specific data centers are not designed to ensure data security, data archiving and digital 
preservation, increasing risk s to governmen t data.  
The distinct advantage that digitization provides to increasing access in rural and hard -to-reac h areas has 
not yet been realized . Improved shared services , matched with interoperability , will create demand for 
improved connectivity and digital services.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
While there are myriad reasons why the development of digital platforms in Leso tho is characterized by 
nascency and disjointedness, the critical constraint is the current enabling environment. Bolstering the 
enabling environment for digital platforms in Lesotho is thus the key to unlocking their growth and 
development. The recommenda tions below seek to enhance the enabling environment and develop 
foundational digital platforms and platforms for service delivery and citizen feedback.  
R9. Improve government  leadership, coordination and the capacity for digital platforms . A whole -of-
government  approach , enacted by strong leadership and coordination , would support the development 
and maintenance of platforms, digital integration , and the enhancement of digital skills within the public 
sector . Developing a national approach to  e-Government , in combination with strong leadership , is critical 
for creating an authorizing environment that would enable success. This could be achieved by : a) clearly 
delineate d roles, responsibilities  and lines of accountability , and clear reporting on digital platforms as part 
of the digital economy;  b) build ing internal capacity to improve standardization, develop software and 
interfaces for interoperability, basic maintenance, vendor and contract ma nagement , and reduce reliance 
on external support; and c) systematically institut ing change management and training programs prior to 
and after the launch of new public sector platforms, building on lessons learned from the roll  out of larger 
platforms suc h as IFMIS and HRMIS.  
R11. Expand the accessibility, interoperability, quality and functionality of existing public digital service 
delivery platforms . Given the expansive landscape of MDAs individually developing service delivery 
platforms, the Government  of Lesotho should focus on optimizing their existing platforms prior to rolling 
out new platforms.  The NID or national identity platform presents  a str ong use case for interoperability that 
could be further developed and from which lessons learned could be shared across government . Further 
opportunities to link up with digital payment systems should be leveraged , to the extent possible (see 
recommendatio n 17). Having a robust , shared services and enterprise architecture could result in large 
efficiency gains for the government . Introducing more platforms into a highly diffuse landscape w hich 
already has  wide variation in the quality of platforms and weak adherence to standardization protocols 
could contribute to challenges with interoperability and potentially increase costs to government  because 
of poor contract and/or vendor management. Therefore the government  should establish an 
interoperability framew ork and set goals for service quality and monitor progress therein. Ideally, public 
sector platforms would operate on common digital infrastructure, software, information systems and 
services , which  can be re -used by any MDA. There would also be common IT standards, and interoperability 
would be enforced.  
R12. Develop citizen -facing digital public services to drive demand, access and efficiencies. The approach 
to digital transformation should revolve around user -centered design that places the needs and desires 
of citizens  at the forefront  to drive demand . A survey of existing platforms, their level of performance, and 
basic demographic information about their users would be critical to measuri ng the impact of these 
activities. Incentives would need to be in place that would encourage compliance with these standards. In 
addition to monitoring and evaluations, developing robust citizen feedback mechanisms would en hance the 
quality of services del ivered. The government  should formulate conscious and targeted CivicTech strategies 
within a whole -of-government  approach, which focuses on developing dedicated platforms for citizens to 
engage with government  beyond information sharing and social media, e .g., in terms of user satisfaction, 
accountability, e -consultation and e -decision making.   
28 | P a g e  
Official Use  R13. Boost the creation of private sector platforms , notably by improving public -private cooperation . The 
government  should explore incentives, such as including tailored access to finance, to encourage the 
development of local private sector platforms . Moving towards the  progressive digitization of government  
data (or open data) would also create an enabling environmen t for data -driven innovation.  However, 
incentives should be carefully crafted and avoid mandatory local sourcing , which would be likely to distort 
the market. The government  should increase private sector developers’ ability to integrate government  data 
directly into their platforms to offer new application and services, e.g., through open APIs.  However, as 
discussed above, the Government  of Lesotho has no policy stance or active initiatives on open data. Lack of 
access to data stifles the development of pr ivate sector platforms that rely on such data for market research 
and product development. The government  could consider developing an open data platform and incentive 
mechanisms that encourage MDAs to collect and publish their datasets on a routine and co ntinual basis.  
2.4.  DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES  
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES  
Digital financial services (DFS) are a critical enabler of a digital economy. They comprise a broad range of 
financial products and services, such as payments, transfers, savings, credit, insurance, securities, financial 
planning, and account statements, that are delivered via digital/electronic technology, including through a 
payment card, online, or via a mobile phone76. The digital financial service ecosystem consists of banks  and 
non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), e.g. money transfers operators (MTOs)  and MNOs , and is usually 
superintended by central banks as the leading  regulatory authority.  
Digital technologies offer an opportunity to provide  financial services at a much lower cost and enable 
significant  productivity gains across the economy.  DFS can provide individuals and households  with 
convenient and affordable channels through which to receive payments, pay for services and buy utilities,  
as well as to save and borrow. Firms  can leverage DFS to more easily transact with their customers and 
suppliers, thereby deepening the prospects for an enlarged e -commerce ecosystem, as well as to build 
digital credit histories and seek financing. Govern ment s can use DFS to increase efficiency and accountability 
in various payment streams, including for disbursement of social transfers and receipt of tax payments.   
Lesotho aims to harness the opportunities presented by efficient and affordable DFS to foster financial 
inclusion, increase access for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME ) to finance , and broaden 
prospects for job creation.  By offering the possibility of reach ing more people, e.g. , in rural areas, and at a 
lower cost, than traditio nal banking services based on a brick and mortar service delivery model, DFS make 
it easier for populations previously excluded from accessing financial services to leapfrog into the financial 
services ecosystem. The government  has positioned financial inc lusion as a critical  component of 
development in the NSD P II, the 2014 Financial Sector Development Strategy  (FSDS) , and the National 
Payment Systems (NPS) Vision and Strategy Document , which recognize that advancing financial inclusion 
in Lesotho will lar gely depend on leveraging innovative financial services, with an emphasis on mobile 
money services and digital banking services. A diverse, sound, efficient and low risk digital financial services 
delivery model would also improve the quality of financial services available and help create a transactional 
history of users , including the credit history valuable in helping  financial service providers mak e decisions 
on users , especially borrowers.  Digital financial services are  set to be enhanced by their integration with the 
national ID system that is being rolled out (see chapter on digital platforms).  
DFS are also crucial for Lesotho in the transmission of remittances , notably from South Africa , that play a 
vital role in many  Basotho livelihoods. Inward remittances contribute 17 percent to the country’s GDP77 
and surpass other forms of inflows , including portfolio investments, official development aid (ODA) and

Official Use  foreign direct investment (FDI)78. Although inward remittances dec lined from a peak of US$600m in 2006 
to about US$326 in 2016 due to changing labor patterns, they remain significant , with opportunities to 
create digital disruption and increase financial inclusion.  
 
 
Lesotho has made significant progress in the modernization of its payment system79, which provides a 
solid foundation on which to anchor innovative developments in digital financial services.  The financial 
sector is dominated by banks and MNOs that  are fas t embracing payments digitization in their product 
offerings; however, digitization in savings, lending, and insurance is yet to gain traction.  Hence this chapter 
mainly focuses on the payments segment  of digital financial services.   
 
 
THE STATE OF DIGITAL  FINANCIAL SERVICES IN LESOTH O 
Impact of DFS on Financial Inclusion  
Overall, 46 percent of Basotho adults (aged +15) had a formal financial account in 201780. Although this is 
slightly higher than the average account ownership for SSA that stands at 43 percent, it is much lower than 
the 58 percent for lower middle -income countries. Compared to regional peers, Lesotho is on par with 
Zambia but lags  behind  Namibia and South Africa by a wide margin (see Fi gure 9, left).  Account ownership 
varies depending on socio -demographic factors: y oung adults (aged +15  to 34), rural residents, adults 
belonging to the poorest 40 percent of the population, and females are less likely to own an account.  
Financial inclusion  has been growing fast, driven by an increase in mobile money  penetration.  In 2017, 28 
percent of the adult population owned a mobile money account, compared to the 33 percent that owned

80 World Ban k (2017b) .  Box 3: Overview of the financial sector in Lesotho  
Lesotho’s financial sector mostly comprises actors in the banking and insurance sector, MNOs 
providing mobile money services, and some informal financial service providers (FSP):  
• Banks : The banking sector consists of three South African banks (Stan dard Bank, Nedbank and 
the First National Bank of Lesotho (FNB) ) and LPB, the only locally  owned bank.  
• Insurance companies : The insurance sector in Lesotho is relatively well developed in 
comparison to S ub-Sahara Africa (S SA) averages and is expanding mor e rapidly than the rest of 
the economy due to the high uptake of funeral insurance.  
• MNOs : MNOs, namely Econet and Vodacom , facilitat e wallet -based transactions and transfers 
through mobile wallets , EcoCash (since 2012) and M -Pesa (since 2013), for each of  the MNOs 
respectively.   
• MTOs : Four international MTOs currently operate in Lesotho (Western Union, Moneygram, 
Mukuru and World Remit). Retail shops are also involved in the remittances space; for instance, 
Shoprite’s money transfer system allows individuals to send money from Shoprite stores in 
South Africa to corresponding Shoprite stores in Lesotho. Other players include the Lesotho 
Post Office and TEBA1. 
• Other FSPs : Other FSPs available on the market include NGOs, Savings and Credit Cooperatives 
(SACCOs), Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA), Rural Savings and Credit Groups, and 
unregistered money lenders ( Machonisas ).  
30 | P a g e  
Official Use  a bank account81. Overall, account ownership  by Basotho adults  increased from 18 percent in 2011 to 46 
percent in 2017  (see Figure 9 - right).   On closer inspection, account ownership at a financial institution only 
increased by 15 percent age points, which reveals that mobile money allowed 13 more p ercent of the adult 
population to be come  financially included.  
Figure 9: Transaction account ownership and financial inclusion in Lesotho, 2017 (Data: Findex)  
  
Account usage , however,  remains low, especially among younger adults , revealing the critical  role that 
DFS could play to enhance and diversify financial behaviors in Lesotho . For instance, only 47 percent of 
those who have a financial account reported having made a withdrawal fr om the account over the past 
year . Eight  percent of financial institution accounts are dormant with only 51 percent having had money  
deposited in them. The main reason s cited for this are that financial institutions are expensive, branches are 
far away, an d potential account holders have insufficient funds. Formal borrowing practices remain limited ; 
only 5 percent of adults ha d accessed credit from financial institutions.  
DFS Practices  
Despite reported increases in the use of digital payments, a lot remain s to be done to boost DFS in the 
country. Digital payments are slowly but increasingly being used in Lesotho , with 38 percent of adults  
having made or received a digital payment in the p revious  year , compared to 1 0 percent who used a debit 
card , as of 201 7 (see Figure 10 )82. Similarly, payments for utility bills using mobile phones ha ve surpassed 
bill payments through a financial institution account or in cash: of all adults having paid utility bills in 2017, 
59 percent paid by mobile phone, compared to the 19 percent who used bank accounts , and the 26 percent 
who used cash. By contrast,  usage of other digital financial services remain s limited:  
• Confirming diagnostic findings outlined in the chapter on digital platforms, e -commerce is still at a 
very nascent stage in Lesotho since only 1 percent of the population ha d bought something onli ne 
over the p revious  year.   
• The use of mobile  and web  banking remains  limited , as only 9 percent of adults had accessed their 
bank accounts using online and mobile platforms.  It is much lower in rural areas , with only 25 
percent of account holders having  used mobile banking.  
• Only 3 percent of adults  received wages through a mobile account (compared to the 8 percent who 
received wages into a bank account).  
Lesotho remains a cash economy and significant efforts are needed to kickstart Lesotho’s digital financial 
transformation. About 10 percent of all adults earn their wages in cash and most purchases are cash -based.  
The economy is mostly agriculture -based an d payments for agricultural produce are mainly made through

a mobile phone. Concerted efforts aimed at empowering consumers to be financially literate an d aware of 
DFS are thus necessary. Unless embraced by an informed population, the benefits derived from accessible 
and affordable DFS are valueless.

Role of the Different Actors in  Provision of DFS   
Banks . As the dominant providers of financial services, banks in Lesotho are fast embracing digitalization 
and are pushing aggressively for digital financial service delivery designed to give way to Internet  and 
mobile -based frontline service provision. All commercial banks have a deliberate digitization strategy to 
deliver services using mobile and web platforms and have plans to remodel services delivery at branches —
from traditional services to digital, self -service, and use branches as consulting centers. Generally, banks in 
Lesotho are perceived by the public, corporates and SMEs as providing product offerings and services at a 
high cost for the size of the country. There is general recognition that the provision of services must be 
broader than banks. In this context, banks are realizing that the entry of MNOs in the payment services 
space provides an opportunity to build symbiotic partnerships that can benefit both parties in providing 
services at reasonable costs.  
The CBL and all commercial banks are participating in the SADC regional cross border payment system, 
the SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System (SIRESS).  A low value credit scheme that will 
allow for bank -to-bank, bank -to-non-bank and non -bank-to-non-bank transfers is currently being 
implemented on the backbone of the SIRESS. Apart from widening the options for sending cross -border 
remittances to Lesotho and across the region, the scheme will create opportunities for digitalizing 
remittances  as more players compete in the provision of services. Ultimately, this is expected to reduce 
costs.  
 
32 | P a g e  
Official Use  MNOs. EcoNet and Vodacom play a critical role in the retail payments space. Their marketing strategy was 
based on aggressive promotion, e.g. based on redu ced retail prices for airtime,  to ramp up numbers fast to 
get a critical mass of mobile money users and then switch to encourage transactions. Large sums of money 
are now transacted across the platforms despite the general perception that the mobile money service was 
formulated for small amounts of money. In 2016, both MNOs collectively processed transactions worth 
about M4.21 billion (CBL, 2016). However, w ith the two MNOs only providing basic mobile money wallet 
services for domestic and cross -border tran sfers, there is scope for expanding services provided in this 
regard.   
Fintechs . The growth of the fintech industry in Lesotho has remained subdued with Vodacom ’s M-Pesa 
and Econet ’s EcoCash currently being the only two disruptors in the provision of financial services. 
Innovative mobile payments apps like Zapper, Snapscan, and other QR code -enabled systems are yet to find 
their way into Lesotho’s market. The low levels of innovation have kept the costs  of DFS high, and uptake 
of services and competition low, leading to continued over -reliance on traditional banking delivery channels.  
Yet, there is potential for growth as evidenced by two fintechs, Cassava Smartech and Sapro, both currently 
seeking licen ses from the Central Bank. The absence of explicit provisions in the current regulations in 
support of such developments can lead to delays , as regulators seek clarity and certainty.  The lack of venture 
capital and lack of locally based funds for supportin g innovative entrepreneurs in Lesotho restricts the 
growth of local fintechs, an area discussed in more detail under the entrepreneurship chapter of this report.   
Regulatory and Policy Environment  
The authorities in Lesotho recognize the importance of an e nabling legal and regulatory environment, 
robust financial infrastructures and low -cost deliver y channels to allow market entry and innovation in 
the digital financial services ecosystem.  In this context, there ha ve been concerted efforts to reform the 
NPS or payments system  and review the legal and regulatory framework. Plans are underway to allow n on-
bank service providers  to connect to t he payments system . These plans , if achieved , will facilitate full 
interoperability, improve access, and ultimately boost financial inclusion, inter alia.  
The CBL Act of 2000 constitutes the main piece of legislati on governing the CBL’s powers as the monetary 
authority of the country.  The foundational instrument of regulatory legislation is the Financial Institutions 
Act of 2012, which establishes the CBL as the regulator of banks and NBFIs. The Payments Systems Act  
(2014) empowers the CBL to exercise oversight over payment systems, clearing  houses and securities 
settlement systems.  Other pieces of legislation under the purview of the CBL are the Data Protection Act of 
2011 and the Credit Reporting Act of 2012, with the Credit Reporting Regulations of 2014 paving the way 
for the establishment of the credit bureau.  
The Financial Institutions (Agent Banking) Regulations of 2016 provide a framework within which banks 
can engage agents to act on their behalf in the provis ion of financial services.  However, in their current 
format the regulations appear to apply to banks only and thus exclude other financial institutions such as 
Micro -Finance Institutions ( MFIs ). While banking agent regulations allow for exclusivity, the agents engaged 
by MNOs are governed by a different set of rules that explicitly forbid exclusivity arrangements.  Thus, the 
possibility of regulatory arbitrage exists in the engagement of agents by payment service providers.   
The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) superintends issues related to money laundering and proceeds of 
crimes, draw ing its authority from the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act of 2008. FIU requires 
the mandatory reportin g of information from accountable institutions on issues related to money 
laundering, financing of terrorism, suspicious transactions and those above stipulated thresholds.  
The Issuers of Electronic Payments Instruments Regulations of 2017 , issued in acco rdance with the NPS 
Law, constitute s the main legal instrument cover ing innovative developments in financial services.  
However, in their current form , the regulations appear inadequate to sufficiently support such 
developments, particularly where fintechs (other than MNOs) are concerned.  For instance, f rom a legal 
perspective , the provision of digital credit is currently not possible , since digital signatures are not  
33 | P a g e  
Official Use  authorized , although there are plans by some institutions to offer this.  The ongoing review of the legal and 
regulatory framework governing payments and digital financial services is expected to address this gap.   
Infrastructure Retail and Credit  
Retail payment infrastructure is well developed with an Automated Clearing House (ACH) comprising the 
Maseru Image Automated Clearing House (MIACH) and the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system 
constituting the main retail payments infrastructure. However , only commercial banks have direct access 
to the ACH.  The three banks headquartered in South Africa use card switching in South Africa while Lesotho 
Postbank uses its own local network.  Currently there is no interoperability between the mobile money 
walle ts provided by the two MNOs.  With no central infrastructure that supports retail payments 
interoperability amongst commercial banks and across different types of financial service providers , 
interoperability will continue to be restricted.   
CBL is using th e services of Compuscan, a private Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) , to which all credit 
providers regulated by the CBL are mandated to connect.  The CBL is exploring ways of consolidating the 
data collected by the CRB to develop credit scoring by 2020 , as wel l as to facilitate systems that will make it 
possible to generate credit reports via mobile phones.  The use of alternate data is gaining traction and could 
help in access to credit for MSMEs, particularly in the informal sector .  
Currently the collateral registry has not been operationalized . The e -Collateral Registry is fully  functional, 
but not launched because the requisite legal updates are still pending in parliament , as discussed in Section 
2.1. Once the Bill is passed into Law , it will p ave the way for the implementation of the e-collateral registry.   
Remittances  
MNOs, MTOs , retailers and bureau de change have progressively partnered in the provision of services , 
significantly easing access to remittances in Lesotho . Econet Telecom Lesotho has partnered with 
WorldRemit and Flash South Africa in providing inbound remittances services using its Ecocash mobile 
wallet . Likewise, Vodacom has partnered with Mukuru in providing services through its mobile network and 
M-Pesa a gents.  When it comes to domestic transfers , although most are still transmitted through a financial 
institution account (for the 48 percent of adults who either received or sent money domestically over a 
period of a year), domestic transfers through mobile  phones are rising, as 23 percent of adults used mobile 
accounts.  
However, despite the entry of non -bank  financial service providers in the remittances space, gaps in 
innovation and outreach remain , as evidenced by the fact that most of these remittances are not 
digitalized and are often cashed out at the respective providers’ outlets . MNOs, MTOs and retail stores , 
such as Shoprite , provide a rich network of non -bank financial service providers who , with technological 
developments , can significantly improv e the DFS landscape and provide affordable remittances services. 
Reducing remittance costs would be beneficial to the poor. Reducing barriers would encourage new 
entrants in the remittances market, and the competition would likely drive down the cost of se nding money 
across borders83. 
Leveraging Government  Payments  
The Government  of Lesotho has an elaborate social protection progra m to cushion the vulnerable and 
elderly from the effects of poverty , which could be further leveraged to boost DFS adoption . The OAP , a 
universal , non-contributory social pension administered by the Ministry of Finance , is the largest safety net 
program in the country.  As discussed in Section 2.3, despite its wide coverage, benefiting all Basothos age 
70 years and above (approximately over 83,000 persons), all benefits are currently disbursed in cash84. With 
more than 4 percent of its population above 70 years old receiving a monthly pension equivalent to about 
US$40 per month, digitizing this program would help  to boost account ownership numbers.  Furthermore,

CONSTRAINTS TO DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT  
The uptake and usage of DFS in Lesotho is hampered by various challenges, most of which relate to the legal 
and regulatory framework and to market development issues . 
• The legal and regulatory framework is inadequate to address the legal issues associated with DFS:  
- The current framework does not provide enough incentive to facilitate the entry and growth 
of fintechs , able to bring innovation into the market.  
- The absence of an electronic payments law means that digital signature s as a method of 
verifying transactions cannot be used, reducing opportunities for the provision of DFS, such 
as digital credit.  
- As discussed above (see chapter on the policy and legal landscape ), a lack of legal 
instruments to regulate cybersecurit y causes severe risks to the sector.  
- Similarly, legislation on consumer protection is insufficient, while a robust consumer 
protection regime is key to building trust in DFS.  
• The lack of int eroperability among banks on card -based transactions, between MNO mobile 
money wallets, and from mobile money wallets to bank accounts across all providers, creates 
inefficiencies, poses inconveniences to customers , and is a significant constraint to achie ving 
wider penetration of DFS.  Inefficient interoperability arrangements limit the ability to move money 
through different providers. As discussed above, plans by CBL to implement a national switch and 
make a change in this direction are underway. The nati onal switch will facilitate interoperability in 
retail payments by allowing seamless transact ions across various payment streams, including 
mobile payment services.  
• Customer -oriented KYC and CDD requirements are considered constraining and onerous.  The daily 
transactions limits are deemed low and discourage customers who may wish to send higher 
amounts than allowed. Moreover, banks are required to do KYC on existing customers annually, a 
situation that is viewed as stringent. Lastly, on cross -border  remittances, while South Africa relaxed 
documentation required to send money, some banks and MTOs have not incorporated the changes 
into their systems, and Basotho immigrants who do not have an ID are unable to send money.  
• While banks can do agent bankin g in accordance with the relevant regulations, the reach of these 
agents continues to be limited and constrained by exclusivity arrangements.  This constitutes a 
missed opportunity for the banking sector to reach more people, especially in rural areas.  
• Agent liquidity management issues prevent greater uptake of digital payments. Customers get 
discouraged from using mobile money when they repeatedly experience situations where agents 
cannot provide cash -out facilities. Although the MNOs are working on addres sing this situation, it is 
expected that some hard -to-reach areas will continue to experience challenges.  
• The current over -reliance on cash for government -to-person (G2P) transfers limits the usage of 
digital financial services.  The public sector has a rol e to play in the promotion of mobile payments, 
and G2P disbursements can be a strong driver to facilitate rapid adoption of DFS.  
• The cost of sending cross -border remittances from South Africa to Lesotho is high and acts as a 
barrier to the use of formal c hannels for sending money . Because of the high costs, migrants are 
forced to use informal means , using  trucks, buses or migrants themselves carrying the cash across 
the border. An opportunity is therefore lost for using formal channels for sending remittan ces and 
digitizing them to increase financial inclusion.   
35 | P a g e  
Official Use  • Low levels of digital skills , both in the private sector and  the general population (see the chapter 
on digital skills) , hinder s the development of DFS . Low levels of financial literacy pose yet another 
barrier to the development of DFS . Despite efforts by the governme nt, as well as by banks and 
other organizations to promote financial literacy, these levels remain low, particularly in rural areas. 
Overall, about 75  percent  of low -income earners d o not have the necessary skills and knowledge 
needed to make informed financial decisions85. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
Enabling conditions exist for a DFS ecosystem to expand in Lesotho are  but they c ould  be greatly enhanced 
by a stronger regulatory framework, the expansion of digital infrastructure and of platforms available to 
consumers , and the increased  engagement of key stakeholders, both private and public , in the use of DFS . 
Below are some key recom mendations, which if implemented, will result in a DFS ecosystem in Lesotho that 
mirrors global developments.   
R14. Stimulate the DSF market by improving market entry and interoperability . The ongoing review of the 
legal and regulatory framework is commendable and should be accelerated  to facilitate entry of fintechs 
in the DFS ecosystem.  An increase in the number of players and fintech  startups in the market will enable 
faster development o f the whole DFS  ecosystem.  Additionally, implementation of the switch to promote 
interoperability  in digital financial  transactions should be accelerated . Achieving full i nteroperability 
between MNO mobile wallets , and wallets and bank accounts , can greatly enhance the uptake and use of 
DFS in Lesotho. Agent interoperability should also be enhanced through measures that support the 
provision of multiple services, competition amongst providers  and wider choice for cu stomers .  
R15. Increase the use of the credit registry  and complete the establishment of a collateral registr y. Public 
registries , such as a collateral registry,  integrated with the national ID system , can help foster traceability 
and digital footprints of consumers.  They are useful in creating information for specific individual 
consumers that can be used by DFS providers to make decisions varying from credit suitability  to eligibility 
for receiving social grants . They  can also reduce  informat ion asymmetry among financial service providers 
related to individual consumers and entities. Such benefits result in the acceleration of DFS uptake, reduce 
the cost of delivery , and broaden outreach.   
R16. Allow simplified  customer -oriented KYC and risk-based CDD  requirements for low -value bank 
customers . Simplified KYC requirements for low -value bank customers, as is the case with mobile 
operators ’ KYC standards, will enable banks to reach the mass market , reduce the costs of regulatory 
compliance , and deepen financial inclusion.  The CBL has developed an internal risk -based framework for 
the application of KYC requirements by banks on a case by case basis.   
R17. Reduce overreliance on cash by the public sector  by adopting digital payments . There is a real need 
to get government  MDAs  to use plastic and mobile money in collecting fees and revenues.  A mass DFS 
uptake by government  will result in more and more people using digital methods , e.g. to make tax payments  
or to receive social transfers . A cost benefit analysis86, conducted by the United Nations Development 
Program  (UNDP ) in 2018 to identify and measure the benefits of transforming G2P social grant payments 
and LRA collections from cash to electronic means revealed that the government  and other relevant 
stakeholders would benefit immensely through cost savings.  While developing systems to leverag e digital 
payments  in all programs , the government should also devise a strategy to improve the uptake of e -
payments  by beneficiaries , for instance by developing confidence among old age pensioners in the use of 
digital tools.  
R18. Make efforts to l ower costs for remit tances  together with the private sector . There is need to engage 
MTOs and banks to lower costs for remittances, both for cross -border and domestic transfers, as the cost

86 This was conducted on the Child Grant Programme and the Lesotho Revenue Authority E -Tax Project   
36 | P a g e  
Official Use  of remitting ha s been increasing in the recent past. Given Lesotho’s reliance on remittances, this sector 
should be prioritized for the development of innovative DFS business models that could reduce costs .  
R19. Strengthen the supervisory and oversight capacity of the CB L and  foster cooperation amongst 
regulators . Technological developments always bring additional pressure for central banks to react with 
appropriate policies and regulatory measures in order to prudently manage risks arising from such 
developments. The CBL could benefit from capacity -building to help it respond to developments in digital 
financial services.  There is also scope for strengthening the cooperative framework amongst regulators , 
including the CBL, the FIU and the LTA . This would benefit  both t he regulated entities and the regulators, 
prevent regulatory arbitrage, promote information sharing and remove any impediments that may hinder 
exchange of information.  
 
2.5.  DIGITAL SKILLS PILLAR  
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL SKILLS 
ICTs are transforming life and work experiences , and are associated with significant productivity gains, 
the development of new markets, and innovation in products and services.  Central to these developments 
are digital skills, which are important enablers of tran sforming economies . Ensuring the availability of 
digitally literate citizens and a digitally competent workforce will enable economies to reap the benefits that 
a digital society brings. For Lesotho, a country that needs  innovative ways to stimulate econom ic growth, 
empowering its citizens with digital skills could have a significant impact on the country ’s growth and 
development  as part of a broader digital economy . 
 
Lesotho subscribes to the aims of the African Union to lay the foundations for a vibrant d igital economy 
by 2030 and recognizes that digital skills are a critical component of the digital economy.  This is 
exemplified in Lesotho’s NSDP II , which emphasizes the importance of digital skills development to facilitate 
economic development. Over the past 15 years, several , strategic , government  documents have been 
developed indicating a commitment to developing the digital skills of the people of Lesotho. Some key policy 
documents include: the ICT Policy for Lesotho , developed in 2005, which laid the foundation for developing 
a society that is ICT literate and capable of producing local ICT products and services . The Curriculum and 
Assessment Po licy of 2008 references ICT as a contributing subject to creativity and entrepreneurial skills, 
and advocates the development of a knowledge -based society and competition at the global level in areas 
including technological development.87 In more recent ye ars, the  NSDP I was developed as a poverty 
reduction strategy that guides policy decision making and resource allocation. One of the strategic 
objectives articulated in the plan is to attain a well -developed human resource base to produce world -class 
skills and expand access to ICT. 88 The new NSDP II includes strengthening human capital as one of its key 
performance areas, with the aim of developing enhanced skills for employment. Digital skills are needed to 
achieve this outcome. The objectives related to  the development of ICT infrastructure and use (see Figure 
16 in the annexes) include demand -side measures , such as the promotion of ICT literacy. The Medium -Term 
Education Sector Plan for 2016 –2026 commits to supporting the development of bridging program s for 
school leavers to ensure that they attain the desired level of skills in mathematics, science, ICT, and the 
English language. 89 Currently, a National ICT in Education Policy  is being drafted and is envisaged to provide 
specific clarity and strategic direction in terms of digital skills.  
 
Underpinning the development of digital skills are basic foundational skills that include literacy and 
numeracy . Digital competences, apart from the most basic (such as using a mobile phone for voice calls or

Official Use  simple messages) cannot be developed without foundational literacy and numeracy skills. In 2017, Lesotho 
ranked 159th out of 189 countries on the Human Development Index, placing it in th e low human 
development category. Lesotho scores 0.37 on the  World Bank’s 2018  HCI and is ranked 143 out of 157 
countries. Children can expect to complete 8.7 years of pre -primary to secondary school by age 18 . However, 
when years of schooling are adjusted for quality of learning, this is only equivalent to 5.5 years, resulting in 
a learning gap of 3.2 years (Figure 11). Lesotho’s quality of basic literacy education negatively impacts 
foundational skills essentia l for post -secondary studies and the labor market. Workplace demands in the 
21st  century require foundational skill sets that enable employees to work collaboratively, think critically, 
communicate effectively, and function in diverse settings. There is a need to learn how to use modern 
technology quickly, solve complex problems, understand how to learn, and understand complicated 
systems. Further more , the ability to read, write, perform arithmetic and mathematical operations, listen, 
and speak are crucial.   
 
However, the current education system in Lesotho does not adequately prepare its learners to access 
these skills.  Although the general literacy rate is higher than the average for Sub -Saharan Africa, the 
performance of grade 6 learners in literacy and i n numeracy is very poor; junior secondary learners show 
poor performance in mathematics and science, and high school leav ers perform poorly in leav ing 
examinations.90  
 
Figure 119: Learning gap (years) based on the World Bank’s HCI for Lesotho91 
 
Digital skills exist on a spectrum of various  levels of complexit y. In this report, a digital skills pyramid is 
applied as a framework to analyze the current state of digital skills development in Lesotho. It is premised 
on the principle that digital skills exist on a spectrum from basic to advanced levels of complexity. Basic 
digital skills refer to the foundational ability to operate information and communications equipment and 
make effective use of various software applications , such as word processing, spreadsheets, Internet 
searches, and so on. At the next level, digital specialist skills refer to the ability to design, develop, and 
maintain digital tools, carrying out tasks such as web design, programming, and managing ICT systems. At 
the advanced level are e -business skills, which refer to a more complex range of abilities to apply, create, 
and invent new business models, products, and services using digital technologies. Figure 12 illustrates the 
digital skills pyramid.

THE STATE OF DIGITAL SKILLS IN LESOTHO  
 
Basic Digital Skills  
Basic digital skills are developed mainly through the formal education system , and to a lesser extent 
through employer -led training, private training companies, and non -state actors.  Basic digital skills are 
introduced into the formal curriculum at grade 4 level; however, challenges such as a lack of electricity93, 
unavailability of ICT equipment, and the inadequacy of teachers’ ICT skills hinder effective implementation. 
Secondary schooling offers some prospect of digital skills development  (see Box 4) , and attendance at higher 
education institutions (HEI) present s a greater likelihood of digital skill attainment, since these institutions 
routinely teach basic digital literacy. The secondary education enrolment rate of 53.8 percent94 and HEI 
enrolment rate of 9.8 percent95 suggest that a high percentage of the population might not have basic digital 
skills. Out of all mobile phone owners in 2016, 44.5 percent owned an Internet enabled device and 32.45 
percent96 of the whole population used smartphones to access the Internet , demonstrating some level of 
basic digital literacy.97 These figures suggest that a significant proportion of the population do es not have 
basic digital skills and that the skills gap can at worst be estimated to be at around 2/3 of the population.

Official Use  Some well -established and well -resourced private 
primary and secondary schools have computer 
laboratories that are used to teach basic digital literacy.  
However, t hese schools are few and afforded mainly by 
parents at the upper end of the income bracket. Most 
primary schools do not have electricity, and only 174 out 
of 335 secondary schools have access to power. Limited 
resources and implementation capacity, difficu lt terrain, 
and challenging climate are factors that have contributed 
to shortages of adequate classrooms.98 Efforts , such as 
the initiative by the LCA to equip 40 schools with 
computers , have been helpful in addressing some of the 
challenges faced in bridging the gap in basic digital skills 
development.  The World Bank -financed Education 
Quality for Equality project is also providing connectivity 
and supporting the provision of equipment , such as 
computers  and iPads in some schools. For out -of-school 
youth, non-formal education programs are provided 
through various entities to teach literacy, numeracy, and 
life skills, as well as some junior and secondary -level 
courses. However, there are n o clearly articulated 
strategies to teach digital skills to this population.  
 
Private digital skills training providers and informal ICT 
skills providers offer opportunities for basic digital skills 
development . A few ICT training companies operate in 
Leso tho and they primarily offer courses that develop 
skills in using office tools such as Microsoft Office, 
electronic communications, accounting software, and 
similar software packages. Skills development hubs are 
an avenue through which digital skills are n urtured in the 
country. For example, The Hub in Morija is a creative technology laboratory that provides affordable 
Internet access, online resources, and digital skills workshops to the local community. T he training provided 
includes basic digital literac y, film, photography, animation, video editing, and writing. Other avenues 
through which basic ICT skills are developed include community skills development hubs , such as Basali Tech 
and the Girl Coding Academy, and initiatives such as Africa Code Week, wh ich teach digital literacy and 
coding skills to teachers and school -age children.

and Progressive Science Initiative (PMI -

The Ministry of Education and Training 
(MET) is piloting a new approach of teaching 
and learning mathematics and science 
through technology in 17 public junior 
secondar y schools. The approach , called 
Progressive Mathematics Initiative and 
Progressive Science Initiative  (PMI -PSI), uses 
open source materials aligned with the 
national curriculum. Interactive board and 
polling devices are utilized in the classroom 
to allow i nstant feedback from students and 
formative assessment by the teachers. The 
classroom setting was modified to allow 
group work and to enable social 
constructivism among students. Grade 8 to 
Grade 10 teachers and MET trainers were 
trained three times a year  from  2017 
onwards to cover the curriculum. This 
enhanced pedagogy has improved not only 
teachers ’ in-classroom practice but also 
their content knowledge in the subject they 
are teaching. The impact on student learning 
achievement will be known after the 
completion of secondary (high) school exit 
exams.    
40 | P a g e  
Official Use  Digital Specialist and Advanced Skills  
Specialist and advanced digital skills are 
developed mainly through higher 
education degree programs , such as 
computer science, information systems, 
business information technology, and 
mobile computing . Three universities in the 
country offer degree programs in : 
Computer Science, Engineering in 
Computer Systems and Networks, 
Information Systems, Business  Information 
Technology, Mobile Computing, and others. 
More recently, the National University of 
Lesotho (NUL) began providing courses in 
Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and 
has introduced a postgraduate program in 
Cybersecurity and Digital Forens ics. To enhance its digital skills ’ offering, it also provides students 
preparatory programs for professional certifications , such as CISCO networking. A list of ICT Courses offered 
by Lesotho’s tertiary institutions is attached in Annex 7. Lesotho does no t currently have a National Research 
and Education Network (NREN ) (Box 6), which would allow research and education institutions better access 
to fast Internet bandwidth, educational resources and support international cooperation. Establishing one 
could support improving the quality of higher education and help improve the institutions’ attractiveness.  
 
 
 
There is a chronically low enrollment rate in ICT -related fields and a high attrition rate over the course of 
three - or four -year degree programs, resulting in low graduation rates and low numbers of professionals 
with digital specialist skills . For example, NUL data  show that few university students major in ICT -related 
fields; in 2018 , the university had only 18 graduates in computer science  from a cohort that began with 40 
students . Figure 13 shows the enrollment trends by field of study. Although more females than males are 
enrolled in university education in Lesotho, very few females enroll in ICT -related programs at HEIs —and 
of those, even fewer choose computer science as their specialization.99  
 
 
99 Interview  by authors : National University of Lesotho  Box 6: The absence of a dedicated National Rese arch and Education Network (NREN)  
Lesotho does not currently have a dedicated  NREN in place , although it has expressed the intention to 
establish one as part of the NSDP II . This risks uneven, expensive and unreliable access to Internet  
facilities by resea rch and education institutions. A dedicated NREN could also enhance international 
cooperation in education and research  and provide the means to enhance pedagogical approaches by 
facilitat ing access to the education and research resources of all its member s, as well as to global 
resources . A good example of a well -functioning REN is the SANREN, South Africa’s National Research 
and Education Network, comprised of a national backbone, several metropolitan rings, and dedicated 
long -haul circuits to reach insti tutions and campuses. Currently it connects 1,031 sites and is operated 
by TENET (the Tertiary Education and Research Network of South Africa) on a non -profit basis . Box 5: The Girls Coding Academy  
The Girls Coding Academy is a start -up movement 
founded by seven women who formed part of the 2017 
Africa Code Week trainer cohort. This experience inspired 
them to share their knowledge through educating, 
mentoring, and equipping young women and girls with 
technological skills , and through  innovating. The Academy 
aims to reduce the gender gap by encouraging young 
women and girls to pa rticipate in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields through 
offering a range of coding programs in different forms. 
Examples include summer/winter coding camps, 
computer skills development for women, and school 
coding clubs.  
Altho ugh the Academy is still quite new, it has partnered 
with Vodacom Lesotho and Educate Her , and has 
experienced great interest and demand for the programs 
they offer.

Employer s also play a role in the development of digital specialist skills . While employers have positive 
perceptions regarding the quality of specialist and advanced digital skills development in the country, 
graduate development programs are often needed to enhance the performance of new employees. These 
programs are provided th rough in -house training interventions or are contracted to external IT training 
companies. The a vailability of specialist and advanced digital skills is negatively impacted by a history of 
brain drain from Lesotho to South Africa and other countries100. South African employers struggle to find 
ICT professionals and many of Lesotho’s ICT graduates and skilled workers migrate mainly to South Africa 
or elsewhere in search of better employment opportunities, more competitive wages, and a more 
sophisticated digit al sector.101 On the other hand, Basotho digital professionals working outside the country 
create important networks that can be leveraged for tapping into regional knowledge and markets.  
 
Skills migration presents an  opportunity for Lesotho to contribute to the growing demand for digital skills 
in the region , but unless matched by inflow and an increased ability to recruit talent from abroad, this 
migration will make it more difficult to meet the need for skilled prof essionals in Lesotho.  According to 
2016 census data, there are just over 179 ,000 Basotho household members residing outside the country. In 
addition to low -skilled emigrants, Lesotho experiences structural emigration of highly  skilled workers 
towards South  Africa and to OECD countries. While reasonable by international comparison for a landlocked 
country, this has impact on highly skilled sectors of the economy. The 2017 IOM Labour Migration 
Assessment102 recognized the problem and r ecommended a number of ac tions to address the outward 
migration of highly -skilled individuals , including streamlining work and immigration permit processes, 
encouraging Basotho nationals to come back to Lesotho for managerial or other short -term positions , and 
tying the supply of graduates in highly skilled sectors more closely together with demand side information.  
E-Business Skills  
Entrepreneurial activity in ICT -related fields tends to be focused on software development, IT systems 
installation and maintenance, and training.  E-business activities , in the sense of creating new business 
opportunities or devising new ways of doing existing business are limited. As mentioned in a World Bank 
report focusing on apparel, horticulture, and ICT,103 the Business Registry, which is the ma in source of 
business demographic information ,104 indicates that in 2018 there were only 10 firms (collectively employing

Digital Skills Demand  
Employer demand for basic  digital skills is  high. It has become commonplace for many employers to require 
that potential employees have basic digital skills. Small and medium businesses, as well as large 
corporations, collectively indicate that there is a much higher demand for skilled ICT professi onals than 
available supply. In the education sector, the need for teachers with specialist knowledge sufficient to teach 
core ICT skills, integrate ICT in their teaching practice, and provide basic technical support is reportedly high. 
There is concern th at, while Lesotho has focused on increasing school enrollment, the quality of education 
and its relevance to the labor market has been neglected, and the country lags other SACU countries in 
terms of the quantity and quality of ICT skills, level of trainin g, and the education and skills needed for  
tomorrow’s workforce.105  
Lesotho’s economy is dominated by the public sector, which remains the formal economy’s largest 
employer, on which even the private sector contractors are dependent . The current and envisaged rollout 
of e-Government services has substantial demand for specialist and advanced digital skills in terms of 
technical management and support.  Stakeholders cited numerous technical skills needs for improving and 
expanding digital platforms in L esotho , ranging from skills to maintain ICT infrastructure to skills to code and 
develop the platforms themselves.  These include challenges related to:  
• digital infrastructure , including administering data center, configuring network security, and 
installin g digital infrastructure in hard -to-reach areas;  
• system design and implementation , including designing technical specifications and quality 
controls, and accessing hard -to-reach areas for digitization of analog documents;  
• procurement and contract managemen t, such as negotiating with software and hardware vendors, 
determining appropriate budgetary allocation s, defining realistic timelines for procurement, and 
moving procurements forward when authorizing agents lack familiarity with technical issues; and  
• performance management , such as coordinating between  different ministries, increasing the 
reliability of reporting, establishing baselines, and ensuring the attendance of high -level officials in 
necessary trainings.  
 
The LCCI , which represents private sector entities ranging from small and medium enterprises to large 
corporat ions, also indicates that there is a much higher demand for highly skilled ICT professionals than 
is available.  Large private sector companies , such as Vodacom Lesotho, Econ et Telecom Lesotho, and 
Standard Bank are among the largest employers of professionals with advanced digital skills. Additionally, 
new projects , such as the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, the second compact from 
the Millennium Challen ge Corporation, and increased diamond mining collectively require a workforce with 
specialist and advanced digital skills. Although the quality of IT specialists is perceived as high, the number 
of graduates entering the workforce annually is inadequate fo r the number of positions available. A 
compounding phenomenon is the high turnover rate of staff with advanced digital skills. Although IT 
specialists are quickly absorbed into the labor market, they tend to stay for short periods in their positions —
which might reflect the growing competitiveness of such skills within and beyond the country’s borders.  
 
CONSTRAINTS TO  DIGITAL SKILLS  DEVELOPMENT  
The i nsufficient availability of digital skills is holding back the potential for a vibrant digital economy in 
Lesotho. There is a much higher demand for digital skills, at all skill levels, than the current supply can satisfy.  
Several  challenges constrain effective digital skills development in Lesotho:  
 
105 AfDB  (2018)   
43 | P a g e  
Official Use  • Specific policy guidance for conceptualization and development o f different levels of digital skills 
is lacking. While there are several national policies directly or indirectly recognizing the need for 
digital skills development, there is no clear national conceptualization of what digital skills entail, or 
how they should be developed.  Currently, decisions on which programs higher education 
institutions offer are based largely on individual decisions or anecdotal observations, rather than  a 
systematic nation -wide strategy.  
• Digital skills development in Lesotho is hampered by the low level of basic literacy and numeracy 
skills. The quality of primary and secondary science and mathematics education, and limited 
enrollments and graduates in S TEM or ICT -related higher education programs are concerns. This 
problem is underpinned by weak foundational skills in literacy and numeracy.  
• Basic ICT infrastructure and technical support are insufficient. Although ICT is included in the 
school curriculum beginning at grade 4, many schools have no electricity, computers, and other 
basic requirements for digital skills development. Furthermore, where such structures exist, the 
technical support for teachers and administrators, as well as maintenance of ICT e quipment, is often 
inadequate.  
• Funding for digital skills development is inadequate . Education is allocated an average of 23.3 
percent of Lesotho’s annual government budget, which translates to 9.2 percent of GDP. 106 Even 
though this is significantly high er than other countries in the region, the amount allocated does not 
adequately cover digital skills ’ development needs relating to infrastructure, human resource 
development in ICT skills, or digital content access and development. Related to this is the digital 
skills development of teachers. Teachers are expected to facilitate the learning of digital skills; 
however, most in -service teachers do not have ICT skills , and pre -service training only provides 
digital skills development at an elementary level.  
• Deliberate linkages between digital skills development activities and the needs of the labor 
market are not apparent . Reliable data regarding the number of existing jobs, envisioned jobs, and 
the digital skills required to perform in those jobs are not av ailable. Data about  the digital skills 
requirements by the labor market , and the extent to which the demand is supplied , would be helpful 
for manpower planning purposes.  
• Availability of specialist and advanced digital skills is negatively impacted by a lo ng history of 
constant brain drain from Lesotho to South Africa and other countries . South African employers 
struggle to find ICT professionals , and many of Lesotho’s ICT graduates and skilled workers migrate 
mainly to South Africa or elsewhere in search o f better employment opportunities, more 
competitive wages, and a more sophisticated digital sector.  
• Cross -border talent recruitment costs and procedures  are not optimized . The NSDP I  states  the 
government’s objective of developing strategies to attract and build core skills.107 However, several 
structural problems appear to block or frustrate the entry of skilled personnel from other countries 
into the Lesotho labor market.  For instance, obta ining work permits in cases where ICT skills are in 
short supply is a lengthy and challenging process108. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
Lesotho stands to benefit from economic gains by moving toward developing a digital economy and 
putting in place strategies to meet its Digital Moonshot target relating to digital skills development by 
2030.  Strengthening the education system , in particular in rural areas , and increasing the number of ICT 
graduates that Lesotho produces yearly, will support technology adoption by citizens and businesses, 
promote a more dynamic digital public sector, and help reduce the digital divide. The recommendations 
below seek to enhan ce digital skills in Lesotho, focusing on activities that would likely bring concrete and

Annex 8.  
R20. Creat e a strategic focus for digital sk ills development , operationalized by the development of a 
digital skills framework and strategy . This effort should be underpinned by improving digital skills data 
collection and research , providing reliable and timely data that provides an accurate pict ure of skills 
supply and demand.  Several policy documents reference digital skills development, but Lesotho would 
greatly benefit from the development of a  consolidated strategic policy framework , including measures to 
monitor implementation p rogress . This work should be preceded by development of a digital skills 
framework109 defining and describing each of the digital skills levels which correspond to the current and 
anticipated demand for these skills.  A synchronized response that identifies labor market needs, analyses 
the national digital skills gap, and coordinates strategies for skills development from basic to advanced skills 
would optimize yields of efforts and resources. To plan effectively , concrete data is required pertaining to 
the national digital skills gap in terms of skills demand and supply. Future activities could include a 
systematic national digital skills gap analysis  and a comprehensive digital skills development strategy . Lastly, 
it would be beneficial to  convene stakeholders in digital skills conversations  to create buy -in for the strategy .  
 
R21. Improv e physical infrastructure and human resource development  in the education sector , including 
establishing an NREN . A functional e -learning ecosystem has elements related to physical infrastructure, 
learning content, and facilitators of learning processes.  In Lesotho many schools lack electricity, 
connectivity, ICT equipment, educational content, and teacher training. I n order to concentrate and 
optimize the few available resources, government may consider a targeted response that focuses ICT only 
on certain grades within the school system (such as grade 7, grade 10, and grade 12 classrooms)110. ICT 
teacher training and s upport also needs to be scaled up . A Schools ICT Support Center that provides 
technical support to teachers and school administrators could be established , possibly staffed by IT 
professionals within universities, government ministries , and students undert aking ICT degree programs.  
Establishing an NREN could have a significant positive impact on the quality of higher education and 
research in Lesotho.  An NREN could provide sustainable and affordable access to broadband connectivity 
to Basotho universities, research and other tertiary education institutions, but also potentially to Technical 
and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutes, and Teac her Training Colleges . The G oL could 
support the establishment, and later recognition of the NREN , through ICT or education laws and through 
waivers of operator license fees , for example.  
R22. Standardiz e curriculum, assessment, and pedagogy to 21st  century workplace demands . Adopting  
21st  century learning standards for secondary school completion and establishing pre -service and in -
service teacher development that strengthens teachers’ pedagogical skills would be helpful in enabling 
Lesotho to be co mpetitive in the global economy. Twenty -first century skills , such as skill sets relating to 
thinking skills (e.g., thinking creatively, making decisions, solving problems) and personal qualities (e.g., 
responsibility, sociability, self -management)  are fou ndational to employability and entrepreneurship. 
Additionally, curricula could be expanded to include topics such as financial literacy, including making 
payments electronically, digital entrepreneurship and an introduction to digital media in civics educa tion. 
Equipping teachers with strategies to develop these skills is a vital component of preparing learners for the 
modern labor market.  
 
R23. Strengthen foundational literacy, mathematics, and science achievement . Increasing p rimary, 
secondary, and post -school education participation, retention, and attainment rates  are crucial to build 
the basic foundational skills underpinning digital skills . In particular, pursuing ICT -related degree programs 
requires a solid foundational kn owledge of mathematics and science. Significant efforts are in place in an 
 
109 Such a framework should be based on internationally recognized frameworks such as the EU’s DigComp and U NESCO -UIS’s Digital Literacy 
Global Framework

Quality for Equality Project. More investment is , however,  needed. The g overn ment  needs to consider 
taking deliberate steps to improve learner attainment by equipping subject teachers with adequate content 
knowledge.  
 
R24. Expand partnerships between industry and education , including opportunities to develop ICT 
careers . The private sector and all levels of education should partner to  create a more demand -driven 
curriculum,  enhance digital skills and foster Lesotho’s competitiveness in response to rapid technological 
change . Industry engagement could apply to all levels o f education, helping to shape digital skills curricula 
in order that school graduates become empowered consumers  and creators  of digital products and services. 
Lesotho should benchmark promising models in Africa for bridging industry and education for adva nced 
digital skills development, including Andela (andela.com), Refactory (refactory.id) and the Meltwater 
Entrepreneurial School of Technology (meltwater.org and Box 7 below). Pathways between school and post -
school curricula need to be created or strengt hened for learners to pursue ICT careers . Options  might 
include mandatory service on the completion of bursary -funded programs, or work -based learning 
arrangements between higher education institutions and industry, with the possibility of appointing 
students after graduation. Another strategy to develop ICT capacity is to streamline work permit processing 
for expatriates, while also developing local expertise.  
 
2.6.  DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP PILLAR  
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
Digital entrepreneurship is a key pillar of a digital economy and is linked to continued economic growth, 
wealth creation and higher standards of living111. Digital entrepreneurship, seen to encompass the launch 
of new ventures in the digital sector112,113, also including digital private sector platforms, brings the digital 
economy to life. Digital ventures offer new products and services, leverage new technology and business 
models, and open new markets. They can contribute to net employment growth and hel p enhance the 
competitiveness and productivity of the economy.  
The NSDP II envisions targeted efforts to promote digital entrepreneurship in Lesotho. It is based on the 
premise that technology and innovation hold the potential to generate inclusive growth  and help the 
country transit ion to an information -oriented society. Furthermore, it hypothesize s that growth of MSMEs 
into viable business ventures will largely depend on a sound innovation ecosystem and strong support 
system  for entrepreneurs114. 
Vibrant digital entrepreneurship ecosystems are needed to help digital entrepreneurs flourish . They  
encompass support organizations (such as incubators, accelerators, innovation hubs and co -working spaces) 
and early stage financing (such as seed, angel, impact investment, venture capital, and grants). Furthermore, 
vibrant ecosystems require specific ski lls (both technical and business ones), access to markets, and an 
overall conducive business environment that motivates the creation and use of novel digital technologies. 
This diagnostic thus looks into six factors that constitute a digital entrepreneursh ip ecosystem115 and that 
 
111 World In tellectual Property Organization  (WIPO), 2018.  
112 The term ‘Digital Entrepreneurship’ most commonly refers to the process of creating a new — or novel —Internet enabled/delivered business, 
product or service. The definition used here includes startups that b ring new digital product or service to market. Welsum, v. D., World Bank Group,

THE STATE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN LESOTHO  
Lesotho’s digital entrepreneurship ecosystem is considered nascent, especially in comparison to the 
known markets of South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria , and to similarly sized markets of The Gambia, 
Eswatini, and Mozambique. Lesotho is further disadvantaged by its small market size  and high  Internet cost, 
and this is further compounded by brain drain to South Africa, viewed as a more opportunistic market. 
Accordi ng to the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) 116, Botswana and South Africa are ranked the 
highest within Sub -Saharan Africa , with Botswana’s overall GEI ranking as 52 and South Africa’s overall GEI 
ranking as 57, out of 137 countries benchmarked. While Lesotho is not included in the rankings, its market 
size is comparable to The Gambia ranked at 117, Mozambique ranked at 124, and Eswatini, which is more 
highly ranked at 86117.  
There are a limited number of IT firms operating in Lesotho and they face constrained firm growth due to 
a limited customer base.  Additionally, many of these firms do not consider themselves digital startups since 
they largely provide networking and hardware services to private clients and the Lesotho government. More 
specifically, they view themselves as provisioning IT services ve rsus developing innovative solutions. There 
are a limited number of nascent and emerging digital startups, such as Technify118 and Enigma IT119.  
A clear distinction between growth entrepreneurship programs and youth employment/TVET and other 
active labor ma rket policies (ALMP) is required.  There are a plethora of programs loosely described as 
supporting youth entrepreneurship and youth employment with overlapping objectives and without a clear 
distinction between : (a) livelihood support for disadvantaged gro ups including youths ; (b) support for 
unskilled or semi -skilled youth employment ; and, (c) technical and vocational education (TVET) programs. 
This has led to a fragmentation of mandates, roles and responsibilities with overlapping and duplicating

outputs and results.  
 
Policy Framework and Business Enviro nment for Digital Entrepreneurs  
Overall, the Government  of Lesotho is committed to improving the regulatory and business environment. 
Supported by the WBG’s Private Sector Development Competitiveness project and the AfDB’s Economic 
Diversification Support Program, Lesotho has made gains in the WBG’s Ease of Doing Business rankings. 
Lesotho currently ranks 120 out of 190 on the overall Ease of Doing Business  rankings and 84 for starting a 
business120121. The figure below compares Lesotho’s Ease of Starting a Business ranking to Southern African 
peer countries. Improvements in Lesotho’s regulatory environment are well -documented in the WBG’s 
“Unlocking the Potential of Lesotho’s Private Sector: A Focus on Apparel, Horticulture, and ICT” report122. 
Figure 13: Lesotho’s 2020 Ease of Starting a Business Score  
 
Several positive developments were recorded in recent years, i ncluding the opening of the One -Stop 
Business Facilitation Center and the establishment of the Credit Bureau. Furthermore, the process of 
obtaining construction permits was streamlined with the introduction of electronic systems in August 
2017123. The PIU124 is committed to Ease of Doing Business reforms on starting a business, resolving 
insolvency, getting credit, and trading across borders.  
In Lesotho, the realities of running a digital company or IT firm are no different than the reality of running 
a (M)SME: firm size is constrained due to their focus on the (small) local market and lack of access to 
financing for scale.  Firm growth of Basotho digital startups is constrained by the population’s lack of trust 
in online systems, low level of Internet acc ess by the population, minimal technology adoption by firms, and 
weak IT skills across the overall population. During stakeholder consultations, it was implicitly understood 
that opening and running a business was not the most significant hurdle.  
Despite the National Strategic Develop Plan’s (NDSP) stated commitment to improving the digital 
entrepreneurship environment125 more specifically, there is a lack of a clear government counterpart for 
these initiatives. There is a lack of clarity on which ministry or governing body will champion the initiatives

business.

Official Use  relating to digital entrepreneurship under NSDP II.  There is also a lack of clarity on mandates which ministry 
or governing body regulates e -commerce  and online transactions.  
Digital entrepreneurs interviewe d perceived governance and regulatory frameworks as weak. The two 
examples with high importance include the Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce Bill and the 
Computer Crime and Cybercrime Bill, which have not yet been adopted , although drafting has been ongoing 
for several years, and legislation on intellectual property, which is seen as outdated and difficult to enforce.  
Lack of a sound and robust legal and regulatory environment is constraining the emergence and growth 
of e-commerce.  Lesotho’s  current legal and regulatory frameworks lack the necessary laws and regulations 
to ensure the correct functioning of e -commerce related services. Bills are being prepared to cover 
Consumer Protection and Competition, but political instability has delayed consideration of the bills. This 
has also resulted in the population’s lack of trust in online transactions and the fear of being scammed 
through e -commerce channels. Linked to the national ID system, the use of electronic and digital signatures 
can mitiga te this and ensure online and high assurance transactions.  
Concerted action from key public and private sector actors is required to address critical gaps in the 
entrepreneurship ecosystem  in five intersecting areas: (i) strengthening the policy and regula tory 
environment and institutional capacity and coordination ; (ii) expanding access to early stage finance ; (iii) 
building an entrepreneurial culture, developing skills, and a talent pipeline ; (iv) helping entrepreneurs 
access new market opportunities ; and, (v) enhancing the capacity and quality of business support services.  
Further to small market size, limited broadband penetration in Lesotho is constraining opportunities for 
Basotho digital startups.  Wide availability of affordable and quality Internet , the backbone of enabling the 
digital economy , will be instrumental to bringing more people and busine sses online and thus creating a 
more thriving ecosystem for digital entrepreneurs. Increasing Internet penetration is also associated with 
higher private sector productivity. Research indicates that firms that adopt digital technologies are 26 
percent more  profitable than their competitors who do not. There is evidence that improving Internet 
penetration in developing countries will promote service industries and increase exports126.  
Support Organizations  
There are 12 main active entrepreneurship support pr ograms currently in Lesotho that  could be 
considered as programs providing support to growth entrepreneurs , that is, skilled entrepreneurs 
motivated by pull factors to turn their innovative ideas into successful ventures (as opposed to necessity or 
livelih ood entrepreneurs driven by push factors). These programs are all relatively recent, small in terms of 
investment size and beneficiaries, primarily concentrated in Maseru , and (in their current form) of limited 
scope, impact and scalability , as well as not  fully leveraging the considerable resources that are available in 
the regional entrepreneurship ecosystem , especially in neighboring South Africa. None of the programs has 
a robust result monitoring system to track and report outcomes and impact , and most  programs provide 
rudimentary training and very limited follow on technical or financial support.  
Existing institutions and public sector support programs that provide support to MSMEs include:  The 
Ministry of Gender and Youth, Sports and Recreation’s Soci al Compact and Youth Entrepreneurship 
Program , which offers seed capital of 40,000 Maloti (approximately US $2,500)127 to micro -businesses. 
Basotho Enterprise Development Corporation (BEDCO), a parastatal agency within the Ministry of Small 
Business, Co-oper atives and Marketing (MSBCM) , provides business support services to MSMEs, primarily 
in the garment, carpentry, and light manufacturing sectors. In partnership with the Lesotho Revenue 
Authority and Standard Lesotho Bank, BEDCO runs the BACHA Entrepreneurial project designed for yout hs, 
graduates, and individuals that focus on providing business management skills and mentorship. The 
government has launched the Pemandu Economic Labs to encourage FDI and job creation in the agriculture,

has been selected as a priority project under the lab, but implementation is still in its early stages.  
Additionally, BEDCO is involved in at least five of the programs in various roles based on its mandate to 
support growth entrepreneurship.  However, capacity and resource challenges hinder its ability to provide 
the required strategic direction, focused support and policy coordination to strengthen the ecosystem. The 
designation of a lead government agency to champion the growth entrepreneurship agenda will facilitate 
improved public sector coordination and collaboration. Support from development partners could also be 
better harmonized. There are opportunities to strengthen collaboration amongst the various development 
partner initiatives and benefit from the collective experience of the various programs.  
 
Due to small market size, public sector support programs to MSMEs, such as the Social Compact and 
BEDCO’s BACHA,128 are sector agnostic, with few MS MEs categorized as digital or digitally  enabled 
enterprises . Use of technology amongst BEDCO supported MSMEs is notably limited . Existing programs 
primarily provide business management training (such as accounting and HR). Digital entrepreneurs and 
startup s, on the other hand, require technical training, access to equipment (such as laptops, mobile 
phones), in addition to business management support. Additionally, none of these programs focus on linking 
entrepreneurs to existing funding sources, such as gra nt-funding mechanisms or angel investors, who 
typically fund idea, prototype, and seed -stage companies.  
Out of the existing entrepreneurship support programs, there are a limited number of institutions that 
provide targeted business support services to digital entrepreneurs.  Notably, these include Vodacom’s 
Innovation Park, located in Maseru, and the Innovation Hub at the National University of Lesotho (NUL), 
located in Roma. Both institutions were established within the last few years and the curriculum is  still 
evolving. Moreover, NUL’s Innovation Hub primarily supports hardware prototyping in more traditional 
sectors such as concrete production, agriculture, food production, and other light manufacturing services. 
Limkokwing University, a private undergra duate institution, runs the Limkokwing Entrepreneurship 
Acceleration Platform (LEAP)129 that provides a year -long entrepreneurship training to final year students; 
however, very few project teams are focused on ICT.  
The quality of existing program and serv ices is seen as inadequate for supporting the growth of idea -stage 
and early -stage entrepreneurs.  In the case of Lesotho, business support services to digital entrepreneurs 
are considered at incubation stage, which refers to training activities that support idea and prototype stage 
entrepreneurs or startups. Typically, startups receive incubation support for a period of two to three years. 
During this period, they are matched with mentors and receive support on securing pre -seed or seed 
funding. In Vodacom’s Innovation Park program, which supports six startups per cohort, beneficiaries 
receive up to a year’s worth of services but can continue to access the Innovation Park workspace, including 
private conference room, computer equipment, and Internet. Since its establishment in 2015, Vodacom has 
supported 24 Basotho startups , and feedback from its program alumni is mixed. Entrepreneurs from the 
first intake stated that the program was unstructure d and provided inadequate support. An entrepreneur 
from the second intake noted Vodacom had incorporated this feedback to improve the quality of its 
program for the second intake. Currently, there are no active acceleration programs130 in Lesotho.  
Business  incubation programs for ICT companies were recently introduced into the ecosystem.  As a result, 
more established IT firms, firms that have been operating for at least five years, did not cite an affiliation 
with a business support program or familiarity w ith startup topics such as building a financial model, access 
 
128 BACHA is the only public MSME support program.  The GoL  has implemented youth employment programs that overlaps with entrepreneurship 
support programs.  
129 There are two enterprise support programs that use the same acronym, LEAP. In the case of Limkokwing University’s LEAP progra m, this is 
separate from BEDCO’s  BACHA program. It introduces entrepreneurship as a possible career pathway where as BEDCO’s program targets existing 
MSMEs.  
130 In contrast to incubation programs, acceleration programs are shorter in length, typically six months, designed to support th e scale-up of growth -
oriented startups. This is accomplished through targeted business advisory support and rapidly matching startups to mentors a nd sources of early -
stage capital.

viable pan -African networks that provide grant or seed funding.  
There are very limited op portunities currently for networking, information sharing and interactions 
amongst entrepreneurs. The Entrepreneurs Network (TEN) is very promising and beginning to establish 
linkages to the southern African ecosystem and has the potential to develop into a full -fledged, ecosystem 
networking hub. Examples of collaboration amongst the various programs are few; most programs appear 
fragmented , and there are missed opportunities for establishing linkages as well as for sharing experiences 
and resources. The li mited opportunities for networking amongst the various service providers and the 
absence of a coordinating entity hinder collaboration.  
Critical ecosystem building initiatives are underway.  GrindNation, a Maseru based co -working space, aims 
to launch activ ities to grow the ecosystem, including the establishment of a fund that will provide targeted 
business advisory support to its portfolio. It currently provides limited incubation support to ICT teams from 
Limkokwing’s LEAP program. The Hookup Dinner131, a n etwork anchored in South Africa, offers enterprise 
development support to Basotho MSMEs and digital startups. Additionally, the Hub Morija, located 40 
kilometers outside of Maseru, offers digital skills training to youth, especially girls. While the Hub is  a 
member of the AfriLabs’ innovation network132, it is categorized as a digital skills provider, with an emphasis 
on photography, animation, and creative services, and a secondary focus on entrepreneurship.  
The Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technolo gy (MEST), an Accra -based institution, is actively 
recruiting young Basotho for its entrepreneurial training program. MEST, which initially targeted Ghanaian 
youths, is now open to participants from across Africa. For the 2019 –2020 intake, six out of 100 a ccepted 
applicants are Basotho, and the program plans to recruit more for future cohorts133. See Box 7 below for

MEST was launched by The Meltwater Foundation, the not -for-profit arm of Meltwater, in 2008. The

as Entrepreneurs -in-Training (EITs) , complete a graduate -level course in software dev elopment, 
business and communications, with a focus on practical implementation. It is taught by a staff of global 
experts and practitioners from Europe and the US.  
The MEST program provides rigorous entrepreneurial training and extensive hands -on project work 
designed to ensure EITs master industry -proven methodologies for developing startups. This 
coursework is supplemented by guest lecture rs, bringing in the experiences and insights of 
internationally  recognized executives and successful entrepreneurs.  
The course culminates in an investor pitch and the chance to receive seed funding and enter the MEST 
incubator, with a goal of scaling up across African markets. In addition to the Accra headquarters, 
MEST has opened incubators in Lagos, Nairobi, and more r ecently, Cape Town. To date, MEST has 
invested in over 50 startups across industries from Software as a Service (SaaS) and consumer Internet, 
to e-commerce, digital media, agri -tech, fintech , and healthcare IT.  
The MEST methodology is widely viewed as prov iding rigorous digital skills training and digital 
entrepreneurship support.

Official Use  Financial Capital  
Access to finance in Lesotho primarily refers to receiving loans from commercial banks, which is better 
suited to MSMEs and ill -adapted fo r digital startups.  Aspiring Basotho digital entrepreneurs raised the 
concern that commercial banks do not lend to digital startups. Th is limited ability to raise additional funds 
is constraining  the growth of small firms. In more developed or emerging eco systems, idea - and early -stage 
entrepreneurs also seek grants or launch crowdfunding campaigns , in addition to bootstrapping or receiving 
“love money” (more colloquially referred to “friends, family, and fools”).  
Access to early -stage finance is very limi ted due to lack of angel investors, limited grant -funding 
mechanisms, and also because entrepreneurs do not have information about nor access to existing 
financing opportunities in the region.  During stakeholder consultations, the Lesotho Enterprise Assist ance 
Program (LEAP), a government  fund executed through the WBG’s Second Private Sector Competitiveness 
and Economic Diversification Project, was the only funding opportunity mentioned. Unfortunately, the GoL 
has failed to provide funds for two consecutive  years, and the PIU proposed extraordinary measures to use 
funding from the WB G project in order to keep this activity operational and to prevent 
entrepreneurs/beneficiaries going into insolvency. The future of LEAP is largely unclear due to a lack of 
support from the GoL. All stakeholders interviewed mentioned starting their busines s through self -funding 
or love money. Many were unaware of grant funds, and loans from commercial banks were identified as the 
primary source of expansion capital due to  their  lack of awareness on sources of early -stage capital, linkages 
to early -stage fin anciers, and how to secure funds from these sources. It is is unclear if the Paemandu 
Economic Labs initiative will succeed in attracting FDI for new innovative projects, or what the sources of 
investment capital will be. The efforts from the Lesotho Natio nal Development Corporation (LNDC), are 
primarily concentrated on investment promotion.  
The GoL does have two , competing , partial credit guarantee fund programs (PCGF):  one run by LNDC, 
focusing on export oriented larger firms , and one run by MSBCM, targe ting MSMEs. The latter has not been 
particularly successful due to limited uptake by the financial institutions and limited capacity of the PCGF to 
fulfill its mandate. The World Bank has helped redesign the guarantee program to enhance the leverage of 
public funds and , if the new design can be operationalized, this could boost the availability of financing for 
MSMEs in Lesotho. The guarantee fund could include specific categories to also fund digital enterprises.  
There are untapped opportunities to leverag e resources from angel investors, the Basotho diaspora, and 
venture capital funds  which are active in South Africa.  However, the absence of a healthy pipeline of 
investible ventures is a key constraint for potential investors and there is potential for the government  to 
partner with private investors in setting up seed funding facilities.  
To address this critical financing gap, the Vodacom Trust which funds the Innovation Park, is exploring 
the establishment of a seed fund. There is an opportunity for the G oL to partner with Vodacom on the 
implementation of the seed fund.  
Markets  
Lesotho’s domestic digital market is small and there is a need to enable companies to access international 
digital markets. Aside from a small domestic market, there is low acceptan ce of ICT technology , which is 
also reflected in the low level of ICT graduates at university (see chapter on digital skills). Only 35 percent 
of the country’s population knows how to use the Internet , and 15 percent assert s it does not believe it 
need it. Thus, there is an imperative to internationalize services in order to achieve greater scale. For 
example, in Madagascar , which also has a small domestic market for ICT services, many Malagasy firms 
serve international clients.  
Despite eagerness to access to other international markets, digital startups lack networks, startup capital, 
and knowledge on how to achieve cross -border expansion.  This is attributed to weak intermediaries, or 
innovation hubs, wh ich currently provide limited  support on market expansion.   
52 | P a g e  
Official Use  Basotho entrepreneurs also expressed a desire to maximize opportunities within the existing domestic 
market , which is currently reliant on South African imports.  Entrepreneurs and local industry players felt 
that initiatives,  such as developing the local value -chain , would allow them to penetrate the local consumer 
market. This primarily refers to the manufacturing, agriculture, textiles, and service sectors.  
The general population of Lesotho is reluctant to make orders online  despite the availability and usage of 
mobile payment systems such as Vodacom’s M -Pesa and Econet’s EcoCash. Only one -third of the 
population made a digital payment in 2018 and only 10 percent of the population has a debit card. See the 
Digital Financial S ervices chapter for more details.  
Stakeholders also cited limited ICT usage beyond mobile banking and mobile money transactions. For 
instance, only 15 percent of formal firms have a website and only 45 percent use email, which is much lower 
than the average for Sub -Saharan Africa. This is based on a variety of factors , including the high  cost of the 
Internet, limited access to equip ment (see chapter on digital infrastructure), and  a lack of online trust  due 
to scams, including forex trading scams. This is reflected in the limited uptake for e -commerce (see chapter 
on digital platforms). Most startups receive cash payments due to the inoperability of mobile money 
payment systems and commercial banks.  
While women’s participation in the labor force is on par with their male counterparts, the team did not 
encounter any established women -led IT firms. The NUL also stated  the low numbers of  women 
matriculating in ICT -related studies. However, during a startup roundtable organized as part of the 
stakeholder consultation, there was an equal representation of emerging female and male startup134 
founders. While this is promising, the quality and type of support these startups receive will be critical and 
linked to recent global efforts to further customize support to women entrepreneurs (for example through 
initiatives funded by the Women’s Finance facility) , and to efforts to promote gender -lens investing.  
Government efforts to adopt digital technologies are currently not seen as an attractive opportunity by 
existing IT firms. Confirming diagnostic findings discussed in the chapter on digital platforms, several IT 
firms cited the main challenges as limited willingness to utilize digital technologies in public service delivery, 
and a lack of digital skills and capacity in government. The MCST is widely viewed as a key champion to drive 
ICT procurement, but there has been little interest or uptake i n light of the forthcoming AfDB infrastructure 
project. The government procurement framework also suffers from a lack of transparency , which could be 
mitigated with the introduction of an electronic procurement system. The limited number of Basotho IT 
firms providing services to various ministries and agencies referred to  the lack of timely payment, often 90 
days or longer, as a key operating constraint highly detrimental to small firms with limited cash reserves.  
Entrepreneurship Culture and Talent  
The presence of new and young firms (age five years or younger) is perceived to be a result of job scarcity 
rather than a vibrant entrepreneurship culture. Digital startups are commonly viewed as opportunity 
entrepreneurs. In contrast, many Basotho entrepr eneurs are considered necessity entrepreneurs. WBG 
Enterprise Survey and the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics Business Register data also reveals that many of these 
firms do not grow. Micro - and small firms account for 97 percent of all firms in the country; y et over half of 
employment is in large firms.  
The previous chapter discussed in length the low digital literacy and low ICT skills among the general 
population . Additionally, as noted above, data from NUL show that few university students major in ICT -
related fields, and even fewer ICT students are women.  
Similar to other markets, digitally skilled individuals tend to pursue traditional employment opportunities 
versus launching digital startups. Given the constrained access to finance environment , and limi ted market 
size, many individuals seek traditional jobs because it offers financial stability. As discussed in the above 
 
134 Many of the roundtable startup participants had launched their enterprise within the last two years and are categorized as early  stage.   
53 | P a g e  
Official Use  chapter on digital skills, many of Lesotho’s ICT graduates end up being absorbed by the South African labor 
market, which offers more c ompetitive wages and a more developed digital sector.  
 
CONSTRAINTS TO DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT  
Limited broadband penetration across the country and the high cost of Internet and Internet -enabled 
devices ( see the chapter on digital infrastructur e), low uptake of digital technology and of platforms 
beyond mobile banking and mobile money transactions (see the chapter on digital platforms), and 
insufficient availability of digital skills at all skill levels (see the chapter on digital skills), const rain local 
market opportunities and hamper the growth of digital entrepreneurship in Lesotho. With Lesotho’s 
market for IT and ICT services being small, firms struggle to scale up their operations, which subsequently 
hinders their ability to enter internat ional markets.  
Several  other pressing gaps in key inputs and regulations are holding the country’s digital entrepreneurs 
back : 
• The lack of angel investors and the limited number of local grant -funding mechanisms leave 
startups with limited access to early -stage finance.  Awareness of regional and pan -African 
financing opportunities is also limited.  
• The legal and regulatory framework is not optimized to foster entrepreneurship. Remaining 
regulatory gaps (see the chapter on the policy and legal landscape ) and the lack of faith in regulating 
bodies are critical constraints to the development of a vibrant ecosystem for digital 
entrepreneurship.  
• The small domestic market for digital services constrained by still low uptake of the I nternet 
restricts the grow th potential of innovative companies.  Digital entrepreneurs would thus benefit 
from better connectivity to regional/international markets.  
• Growth entrepreneurship support programs and initiatives are in short supply, and their quality 
remains limited. There is only a handful of institutions providing targeted business support services 
to digital  entrepreneurs. Furthermore, these services require further structure and development, 
notably to include more systematic access to mentors, either from the local b usiness community or 
to established programs in South Africa, and linkages to sources of startup capital.  
• Overall, diversity and inclusivity in the sector are insufficient . The u nderrepresentation of women 
in digital startups is a missed opportunity, refl ecting the lack of incentives for individuals and 
organizations to invest in women -owned startups and the absence of gender -lens crowdfunding 
and impact investments.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
A number of  priority actions could be undertaken in partnership with the public and private sector s to 
further facilitate the development of digital entrepreneurship, which can in turn help create 
opportunities, find solutions to development problems, and generate much needed jobs.  
R25. Identify a public sector entity to coordinate digital entrepreneurs hip activities . The Government of 
Lesotho should identify a public sector actor t o coordinate digital entrepreneurship activities, specifically 
to facilitate links to related initiatives implemented by various ministries and to engage in policy dialogue 
with regulatory authorities. In markets such as Nigeria and Kenya, this falls under the purview of the 
Ministry of Communications or a national ICT authority. In Nigeria, the National Innovation Technology 
Development Agency (NITDA), established a subsidiary , the Office for ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
(OIIE), to specialize in cultivating and expanding Nigeria’s ICT and entrepreneurship activities across the 
country. More recently, the Government of Senegal established an agency responsible for digital  economy  
54 | P a g e  
Official Use  initiatives, the Délégation Générale à l'Entreprenariat Rapide (DER). In the case of Lesotho, the MTI, or the 
MSBCM, could be empowered as the coordinating body in close coordination with the LCA and MCST.  
R26. Catalyze existing private sector cha mpions . Private sector actors, such as Vodacom Trust, are well -
positioned to champion the growth of Lesotho’s nascent digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. Corporate 
actors can fast track new initiatives for early -stage and growth -stage startups. In Lesotho’ s nascent 
ecosystem, corporates are well -positioned because of their multi -country business networks  and can 
further link emerging digital entrepreneurs to established regional networks and provide access to 
education, skills, and funding, vis -à-vis an Ope n Innovation program.  
R27. Increase awareness and deepen linkages to regional and pan -African digital entrepreneurship 
support programs . Both the WBG’s 2018 private sector diagnostic in Lesotho and the DE4A assessment 
revealed that local entrepreneurs are  unaware of regional and pan -African digital entrepreneurship 
support opportunities.  Programs such as Finland’s Southern African Innovation Support (SAIS) program and 
the WBG’s XL Africa (Annex 8) demonstrate a need for a viable, regional approach that suc cessfully supports 
the scale -up of growth -oriented digital entrepreneurs, especially those sourced from smaller markets. Given 
Lesotho’s small market size and its landlocked position within South Africa, many Basotho are already 
looking for opportunities b eyond Lesotho.  
R28. Provide technical assistance and capacity building to existing innovation hubs, with an emphasis on 
linkages to early -stage financing and mentorship . Train -the-trainer programs for local innovation hubs, 
with an emphasis on cross -border  expansion, mentorship, and access to finance would be critical to 
growing the local entrepreneurship ecosystem. The quality of services currently offered by business 
development services providers needs to be improved to better serve emerging and growing digital 
startups. Like other African markets, the culture of mentorship is also underdeveloped and access to finance 
presents an especially acute challenge. In the absence of an emerging investment culture, linkages to more 
developed regional hubs (such as  Cape Town, Nairobi, Lagos) will be critical , especially since Lesotho 
enterprises will need to expand to new markets to achieve profitability and growth. Improved business 
advisory support should also cover topics o f how to achieve cross -border expansion,  including how to 
navigate regulatory environments and the resources available to achieve this, and should be emphasized as 
part of the business skills programming offered by business development service providers.  
R29. Incentivize early -stage investments from the private sector . The Government of Lesotho could 
incentivize private investors to invest in local startups.  Given the nascency of the ecosystem, angel 
investors would provide much needed financing to emerging and existing digital enterp rises that are likely 
to be seeking modest sizes of investment. Since there is a small pipeline of investment -worthy digital 
enterprises, this should be broadened to include investments into SMEs operating in other sectors. 
Incentives should also be specif ically crafted to promote investment in women -owned startups.  
R30. Introduce digital entrepreneurship curricula into secondary and tertiary education . Digital 
entrepreneurship curricula emphasize the development of technical and business management skills , 
identified as critical skills gaps among Basotho youth. To date, youth employment programs in Lesotho 
have limited efficacy due to ineffective program design, overlap with other initiatives, and lack of financial 
sustainability135. Th ese can be addressed by introducing digital entrepreneurship programming into 
Lesotho’s education curriculum. Encouraging self -employment in high -productivity sectors can drive 
Lesotho’s economic diversification agenda and create high -value jobs for its population.  
 
  
 
135 This is based on a WBG 2016 assessment of Youth Employment Programs in Lesotho that reviewed 16 programs including programs s ponsored 
by the Government of Lesotho, internation al donors, and private -sector actors.

Official Use  3. CONCLUSION : A WAY FORWARD  
 
 
The digital economy has globally become an important driver of economic growth, innovation, and 
improved service delivery. Digitalization is fast changing the fundamental patterns of economic and social 
activity in our societies : how we learn, work, do business, and communicate with one another. Internet 
users worldwide grew  from 1 billion in 2005 to a bout  4 billion by 2018. The contribution of the digital 
economy is expected to grow from 15.5 percent to a quarter of global GDP b etween 2016 and 2026. Every 
dollar invested in ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2018 could yield US$5 by 2025. Closing the 
infrastructure gap in Africa, complemented by strengthening other foundational pillars , can yield clear 
economic benefits, create much needed jobs , and lead to better services for consumers.   
 
The diagnostic findings in Lesotho show that this potential is still very much underutilized . Lesotho has 
been able to expand access to digital infrastructure and services, but domestic demand  remains modest. 
The telecommunications regulatory environment is in many ways sound, but regulation could be more 
effective to promote more competition and consumer benefits. This report puts forward a number of 
recommendations to this end, to advance aff ordability  and promote infrastructure sharing and  consumer 
demand. The government may consider ways of reduc ing its role in the market and of keep ing its levies and 
taxes reasonable.  
A holistic approach to digital economy development is necessary to maximize Lesotho’s chance for 
attaining its digital potential.  Rather than implementing multiple, fragmented interventions, a coordinated 
and high -level cross -boundary approach that maximizes complementarities is needed for building an 
inclusi ve digital economy.  To advance towards an inclusive digital economy that can foster Lesotho’s 
potential, a set of recommendations are proposed with actions aimed at solving the challenges identified 
across its foundations . A summary list of all recommendat ions is provided in Annex 1.   
Digital government platforms are an area that could drive both demand for Internet access as well as 
enable a more efficient and citizen -centric public sector, but a lack of coordination and capacity hamper 
the government’s ef forts in this field . A strategic government -wide approach is needed, combined with 
improved focus on quality, accessibility and  the interoperability of existing systems. Steps towards a more 
data -driven and citizen centric approach are recommended.  
Mobile  money has successfully driven financial inclusion in Lesotho, but the enabling environment is still 
quite rigid and needs more flexibility to support further innovation  in digital financial services . The 
government could demonstrate leadership in this fie ld by moving to use and accept electronic payments. 
While promoting innovation, focus should also be on improving interoperability and consumer protection.  
Digital skills constitute a clear bottleneck for Lesotho and an area where policy and institutional  reforms 
are needed . Measures to improve digital skills need to be backed up by a strategic focus and improved data. 
Many of the key challenges relate to the formal education system and require a renewed focus on learning 
infrastructure, curricula, pedagog y and the upgrading of teacher s’ competence s. Partnerships with the 
private sector could be advanced to promote innovation in digital skills development. Targeted policies that 
boost entrepreneurship and promote skills development programs would increase skilled labor supply, 
boost labor productivit y and reduce poverty136. 
Private digital platforms have not yet found a proper footing in Lesotho  and very few locally developed 
platform -based , business models exist. The ability to integrate government data directly into private 
platforms and services thr ough open APIs would benefit the ecosystem. Digital entrepreneurship is still 
nascent in Lesotho and could be helped by raising the quality of support organizations, improving access to 
funding , and leveraging regional networks for access to expertise and markets.  
The findings suggest that there is a need to shift the emphasis from supply to demand -side measures in 
Lesotho.  The digital services market is relatively underdeveloped and actions to to develop better digital 
 
136 World Bank Poverty Assessment: Lesotho (2019) Forthcoming.   
56 | P a g e  
Official Use  government services  and local conten t and improve digital skills could encourage technology ’s adoption and 
use among the population. Looking beyond Lesotho’s borders is also necessary for the digital economy to 
flourish. As a small landlocked country and market, Lesotho’s dependence on its n eighbors, most notably 
South Africa, is high. But regional digital integration could provide major benefits by promoting access to 
regional infrastructure  and digital products and services , and opening markets for Basotho entrepreneurs.   
Based on the analysis, three broad priority areas emerge as opportunities for Lesotho , illustrating where 
both public and private efforts are needed to accelerate the digital economy. The full list of detailed 
recommendations is included in Annex 1, and all recommendat ions are elaborated fully under individual 
chapters of the report.  
Priority 1: Improve the enabling environment for the digital economy  
The priority area focuses on addressing noted policy, legal, and regulatory gaps, and stimulating the enabling 
environm ent for digital technology adoption and use. The measures outlined under this priority can assist 
Lesotho in increasing Internet adoption, as well as in improving the use of its digital infrastructure and 
advancing the development and use of its digital pl atforms and financial services. The foundational pillars 
of digital development are linked to this priority concern with digital infrastructure and digital financial 
services. The interventions recommended under this priority include the following:  
• Enhanci ng policy direction for the development of the digital economy in Lesotho, by building upon 
the draft national broadband strategy to guide the deployment of digital infrastructure deployment 
and bridge the digital divide . The policy should be designed and drafted by the Ministry of 
Communication, Science and Technology (MCST) in cooperation with public and private sector 
stakeholders.  
• Improving the legal and regulatory environment for the digital economy by addressing identified gaps 
in legislation, with immediate priority given to passing the bills on cybersecurity and e -transactions , 
for which the ministry responsible is MCST. Other important areas to address include data protection, 
consumer protection, and intellectual property.  
• Cons ider reducing the role of the state in digital infrastructure development and identify ways to 
leverage state -owned digital infrastructure in more strategically. Priority should be given to divesting 
state -owned shares in the West Indian Ocean Cable Compan y (WIOCC) and considering how the fiber 
optic assets of the Lesotho Electricity Company  (LEC) could be used more effectively for improving 
national broadband connectivity. This recommendation should be taken forward by the Ministry of 
Finance (MoF) and MCS T.  
• Improving the regulatory environment for digital financial services , including simplifying Know -Your -
Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements, lowering costs for remittances, 
improving market entry and interoperability, establishing  a collateral registry and strengthening the 
regulatory institutions. The party responsible for taking these recommendations forward is in most 
cases the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL).  
Priority 2: Drive digital transformation and demand by strengthening p ublic sector platforms and 
infrastructure  
The priority area focuses on improving the public sector’s ability to guide digital transformation in Lesotho, 
both by: a) improving the leadership and coordination of digital government transformation; b) enhancing 
the infrastructure and shared digital platforms that the ministries and agencies can use; and, c) enhancing 
citizen -facing digital service delivery. Recommended interventions under this priority include the following:  
• Building upon the National Strategic Development Plan II, deepen the approaches to digitization in 
the identified sectoral and thematic priority areas. These approaches may be used as key components 
of more comprehensive, whole -of-government approach to government in Lesotho. Such an approach 
would define the roles, responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms between relevant ministries and 
agencies, and guide investments in skills and capacity development within key ministries and 
government entities driving digi tal policies.   
57 | P a g e  
Official Use  ANNEXES  • Ensuring that government has the necessary infrastructure and connectivity and that these are widely 
used. Specific measures for government infrastructure can include: purchasing Internet bandwidth in 
bulk for the government’s own use; inves ting in shared services and enterprise systems; protecting and 
storing government data, including cybersecurity and data rescue and recovery facilities;, enforcing 
standards; and providing technical support for the operation and maintenance of government s ystems. 
The MCST has a coordinating function within this agenda.  
• Increasing interoperability between platforms for increased efficiency and service delivery by 
leveraging experiences from the national identity system and enhancing the digital payment 
infrastructure. A well -developed digital identity system can offer a platform for authenticating and 
verifying services, which should be used consistently where needed. Digital payments can introduce 
significant efficiencies and offer new ways to transact with  the government. The government should 
take gradual steps to adopt digital payment options across the various services it offers, including paying 
taxes and fees, and receiving social grants. Increased collaboration between MCST, the Ministry of 
Home Affai rs (MoHA), and CBL may further support the advancement of interoperability between 
critical platforms.  
• Developing citizen -facing digital public services to drive demand, access, and efficiencies.  Digital  
government transformation should be based on a user -centered approach that responds to citizens’ 
needs. To enhance the quality of the services delivered, it would be beneficial to develop monitoring 
and evaluation tools for citizen -facing platforms and for robust citizen feedback mechanisms . Moving 
towards the progressive digitization of government data would improve the ability to innovate for 
service delivery in the private sector. Given that there are relatively few existing digital public services 
in Lesotho, the government may want to consider how the a genda should be coordinated among the 
responsible ministries.  
Priority 3: Strengthen the digital ecosystem through digital skills and entrepreneurship  
The priority area focuses on efforts needed in Lesotho for improving the digital skills of the population, 
ranging from basic entry -level skills to advanced digital talent and know -how. In addition, key actions are 
outlined for improving the conditions and  support mechanisms for Basotho entrepreneurs to develop digital 
products and services for local and international markets. Both areas offer significant potential for public -
private cooperation. Recommended interventions include:  
• Developing a strategy and defining the implementation mechanisms for digital skills development in 
Lesotho. These efforts should be underpinned by a new digital skills framework and improved ways to 
monitor and collect data about existing skills. The education system should priorit ize a) expanding 
partnerships between industry and education: b) standardizing curriculum, assessment and pedagogy: 
and, c) improving achievement in foundational literacy. The responsible ministry for these actions is The 
Ministry of Education and Training .  
• Improving digital infrastructure and connectivity in research and educational institutions by 
establishing a National Research and Education Network in Lesotho, resulting in lower costs for 
Internet bandwidth and improved access to educational resources . The commitment for establishing 
the National Research and Education Network (NREN) is already stated in the NSDP II.  
• Improve the coordination and implementation of the digital entrepreneurship agenda,  among others, 
by identifying a public sector entity t o coordinate activities and catalyze private sector champions to 
support entrepreneurship programs, improving access to finance, developing the capacity of existing 
innovation hubs, and making sure Basotho entrepreneurs can benefit from regional and pan -African 
support programs. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) should take responsibility over most of the 
activities.

 The World Bank Group’s (WBG) XL Africa (https://www.xl -africa.com) program piloted a pan -African startup 
acceleration approach that provided critical support to 20 high -growth companies seeking to raise Series A 
financing defined as $250,000 to $1.5M, cons idered the “Valley of Death” for African startups. Despite the 
proliferation of acceleration programs in Sub -Saharan Africa (SSA), a WBG study on venture acceleration found 
that many of these programs under -delivered on two critical offerings that differen tiate these programs from 
incubation activities: mentorship and access to early -stage financing.  
The WBG’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) Ventures Group invests in startups raising a minimum of $5M, 
but to reach this scale young startups must rec eive critical business advisory support and growth capital. These 
can be provided by acceleration programs, but the overhead costs necessary to operate programs such as XL 
Africa are prohibitive for business enablers and investors.  
To bridge these gaps, XL  Africa sought the involvement of investors and corporate partners throughout program 
implementation, especially during the outreach and selection process. This was critical for entrepreneurs 
because the program did not take equity in these companies but o ffered early exposure and tailored 
programming to increase the likelihood of crowding -in investments into these innovative technology startups. 
For investors, XL Africa lowered the transaction costs of operating an investment readiness program for 
promisin g startups. Following a highly competitive selection process juried by major investor groups, including 
IFC Ventures, 20 African companies —from a pool over 900 applicants (a 2.2 percent acceptance rate) —were 
selected to participate in this bespoke accelera tion program that included: virtual and in -person mentorship 
from a global and local mentor; access to the XL Academy, an online investment readiness curriculum designed 
specifically for African entrepreneurs; a two -week residency in Cape Town, South Afric a, that included learning 
tours, peer -to-peer learning sessions, and pitching sessions at three prominent industry events, AfricArena 
(French Tech conference), Africa Com (the largest tech, media, and telecom conference in SSA), and the African 
Early -Stage  Investor Summit, to source additional partners and investors; and affiliation with the WBG’s brand.  
XL Africa Entrepreneurs  
XL Africa generated strong interest across the continent. The team observed signals of a nascent pipeline that 
requires support be yond the traditional hotspots of Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. The 20 XL Africa companies 
represent eight SSA countries, have created over 500 highly skilled jobs and have over 700,000 users. In Silicon 
Valley, four percent of startups have a female co founder. By comparison, three XL Africa companies have a 
female co -founder (15 percent) and six companies (30 percent) nominated a woman from their management 
team to participate in the Cape Town Residency.  
While the program selection criteria and scoring focused on scalability, many XL Africa companies could also be 
categorized as for -profit social enterprises. The cohort comprised companies in transportation and logistics, 
education, agriculture, HR, data analytics, energy, SME services, and health.   
 64 ANNEX 10: RESULTS OF THE CYBER SECURITY MATURITY MODEL (CMM)  ASSESSMENT  
 The WBG supported the LCA to conduct a cyber security maturity model (CMM) assessment in 
March 2019 in collaboration with the Oxford University Global Center for Cyber Security Capacity. 
Several major weaknesses were identified as part of this exercise.   
• According to the government, critical infrastructure sectors/assets have been identified, but 
this information has not been disclosed publicly. There is  no legislation on Critical 
Infrastructure (CI) Protection in Lesotho.  
• MCST manages the government's Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) assets, including 
the main data center which serves all the ministries. Not all government  agencies have the 
financial and human resources to protect their CII, so they rely on the technical support 
provided by MCST. In addition, there is a lack of communication and coordination between 
MCST and the other agencies on CII’s matters. CI I operators and government have 
established channels of communication to address CI I vulnerabilities and other related 
topics, but they are ad -hoc.  
• There are a lack of skilled people in the cybersecurity field in Lesotho. The public and private 
sectors are facing challenges finding high ly skilled professionals in the country to handle 
cybersecurity protection within their organizations. Yet, there is a high demand for 
cybersecurity education in the country. Whereas public and private universities are offering 
programs in cybersecurity an d the National University of Lesotho has established a center 
for cybersecurity research, no Masters ’ degree programs are available.  
• Professional certifications such ISACA, ISO, COBIT  are not offered in Lesotho , so students and 
professionals often travel t o South Africa to obtain cyber related certifications. The National 
University of Lesotho is trying to establish an examination center for internationally 
recognized professional certifications , probably ISO certifications.  
• Lesotho has not signed either of the two main conventions for cybercrime , namely the 
Budapest Convention and the Malabo Convention which set out international and formal 
cooperation mechanisms to combat cybercrime and protect personal data. There are 
domestic cooperation mechanisms, as t he banking sector often cooperates with law 
enforcement agencies in the investigation of cybercrime cases. This collaboration is informal 
as there is no formal arrangement nor information sharing platform currently in place. Other 
sectors , such as the tele communications sector , require a court order prior to releasing any 
information related to cybercrime.  
• SADC member states, Lesotho included, have agreed to establish a national Computer 
Readiness Response Team (CIRT ) by the end of 2019. Despite an ITU -led process to develop 
a plan for establishing a national CIRT in 2012, to date this has not happened, and the 
government does not have a central registry created to track cyber incidents at the national 
level. According  to a SADC meeting in 2018, Lesotho is one of the countries that is actually 
awaiting the enactment of appropriate legislation to operationalize the national CIRT.
