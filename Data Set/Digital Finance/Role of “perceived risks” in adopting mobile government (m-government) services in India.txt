Role of “perceived risks” in adopting mobile govern ment (m-government) services in India 
 
1. Introduction 
As the landscape of citizen-government is witnessin g remarkable changes with the onset of 
Information and Technology Communication (ITC) revo lution, internet channels have become 
widespread as far as the communication between the citizens and the government is concerned. 
Governments have become internet-savvy and are adop ting e-services for ensuring greater 
transparency and citizen involvement. Furthermore, with gradual innovations in the 
telecommunication sector, government services are n ow being provided such that citizens may 
access and avail government services via their mobi le phones (Hung, Chang, and Kuo, 2013; 
Kim, et al., 2004; Sharma and Gupta, 2004). Besides , the penetration levels of mobile phones 
have increased over the years and this has led to i ncreased usage of mobile phones in the 
remotest corners of the countries. Being easy to us e, mobile phones are providing ample utility 
features, especially with the help of internet. The refore, governments are forthcoming in tapping 
this opportunity of providing government services v ia mobile phones as long as the user avails 
internet facility or basic features like exchanging  SMS (Short Messaging Services) and 
automated replies. However, there are privacy conce rns among the users and citizens do not 
perceive safety while transacting through internet or mobile phones. For instance, there is lack of 
trust among the citizens regarding the adoption and  usage of e-government services (Teo, 
Srivastava, and Jung, 2008). Likewise, there are co ncerns regarding lack of interoperability 
(Otjacques, Hiltzelberger, and Feltz, 2007) which h inder the efficient delivery of government 
services to the users. While there has been ample r esearch on the nature and scope of e-
government services, academic research on the mobil e government (or, m-government) services 
has been negligible (Liu et al., 2014; Wang, 2014; Chen, Vogel, and Wang, 2016). Furthermore, 
m-government is an emerging phenomenon in academic research and the present study seeks to 
contribute to the existing literature. 
As such, m-government has been regarded as a part o f e-government (Lallana, 2004). 
Specifically, m-government is defined as the provis ion of information and services to different 
users and stakeholders (government employees, citiz ens, businessmen, and other sections of the 
society) wherein the user uses mobile phones to acc ess and avail diverse set of public services 
(Ishmatova and Obi, 2009; Lee, Tan, and Trimi, 2005 ; Lee, Tan, and Trimi, 2006). However, m-
government is yet to be launched by many government s and it’s full potential has remained 
largely unexplored and governments are yet to asses s their readiness in terms of launching the m-
government services (Misuraca, 2009; Wang, 2014). G iven the expansion of IT services and the 
improvisation in mobile telecommunication services,  governments may conceive of well-
grounded strategies to launch m-government services  across diverse contexts. In the present 
study, we attempt at underlining the major influenc ers of m-government adoption in India. The 
study invokes theoretical foundations from theories  on Information Technology (IT) adoption 
and usage. Specifically, we refer theory of reasone d action (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975), theory of 
planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), technology acceptan ce model (TAM) (Davis, 1989; Davis, 
Bagozzi, and Warshaw, 1989), innovation diffusion t heory (IDT) (Rogers, 1995), and unified 
theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh, et al., 2003). For the present

study, we invoke constructs drawn from the aforemen tioned theories. In particular, we refer to 
constructs like “perceived risks”, “self-efficacy”,  “attitude 
 and “influence” of significant others which play a  dominant role in determining the “behavioral 
intention to adopt” m-government services in India.  There are five sections of the study: Section 
2 provides an overview of the literature on m-gover nment, Section 3 provides details regarding 
the hypotheses; Section 4 provides a discussion on the research methodology and Section 5 
concludes the study.  
 
2. Literature review 
2.1 A brief on m-government initiative in India 
It has been underlined in extant literature that th e ICT infrastructure should be robust for laying 
down the foundations of e-government services (Ndou , 2004). Similarly, in the case of 
developing countries like India, a well-developed I CT infrastructure is required for successful 
launch and execution of m-government. According to official records, India has an internet 
penetration of 28.3% as per figures of November, 20 15 and this figure is suggestive of the 
“middle-range” (DAI, 2016). Furthermore, with the p opulation growth alongside the adoption of 
mobile phones, the mobile phone subscribers witness ed a significant increment over the years. 
As such, there are more than 1 billion mobile subsc ribers in 2016 in India (Forbes, 2016). Also, 
it has been estimated that by 2020, internet subscr ibers will reach 730 million (Economic Times, 
2016) which implies that there would be an equally magnificent increment in mobile phone 
subscribers.  
For providing m-government services, there is an on line portal for the same 
(https://mgov.gov.in/) which showcases the m-govern ment services for the citizens. It has been 
laid down by the Ministry of Electronics and Inform ation Technology that all government 
websites shall be made mobile-compliant and all gov ernment departments and agencies shall 
design and develop their mobile applications to pro vide services via the mobile platform. Some 
of the m-government initiatives are DrSMS (m-health  information system for providing health 
and medical advice) in Kerala; e-SMS (generation of  alerts of government applications and 
complaints tracking) in Goa; MMPL (payment of elect ricity bills, property tax, water bill, traffic 
dues, etc.) in Karnataka and Mobile seva (facilitat ing the public service delivery through 
different e-government services). Also, there are o ther government services which may be 
accessed and availed via m-government like filing i ncome tax, cooking gas booking, railway 
tickets booking, government information, passport f iling, etc. 
2.2 Related research 
Government performance is influenced by effective c ommunication (Garnett et al., 2008; 
Melkers and Willoughby, 2005; Pandey and Garnett, 2 006) and one of the means of government-
citizen interaction is via provision of m-governmen t services. M-government is often regarded as 
an offshoot of e-government (Rannu, Saksing and Mah lakoiv, 2010). Also, m-government 
encapsulates e-government and mobility (Zefferer, 2 011). Therefore, m-government is a logical 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (AUS) At 04:37 23 February 2018 (PT)
extension of e-government. For instance, timely and  personalized information and services may 
be procured in a more convenient and easier way whi ch facilitates the citizens to complete their 
tasks anytime and anywhere (Yuan, et al., 2010). M- government has several advantages in terms 
of providing affordable services (Liu et al., 2014) . Furthermore, m-government services are 
easily reachable in the nook and corners of the cou ntry and governments can deliver information 
to users irrespective of distance, time, place and adverse natural conditions (Goncalves et al., 
2014; Ntaliani et al., 2008). M-government facilita tes on-time information delivery and there is a 
minimal requirement of literacy required to operate  m-government services conceding that 
operating a mobile phone is easier and doesn't requ ire much sophisticated training (Halewood 
and Surya, 2012). It facilitates in the delivery of  personalized information and facilitates in 
tackling exigencies like broadcast of disaster info rmation or any advisory regarding a calamity, 
for instance (Amailef and Lu, 2011).  
M-government is an emerging phenomenon across the g lobe; however, it has immense potential 
to forge citizen-government ties. Taiwan has adopte d m-government in the form of "Mobile 
Taiwan Program" as early as 2004 (Hung, Chang, and Kuo, 2013). China has been providing a 
number of its e-government services via mobile tech nologies as well (Wang, 2014). For instance, 
"Beijing Real-Time Bus" is an m-government mobile a pplication which provides users with 
information regarding the location of a bus and cal culates the time when the bus would arrive at 
the station (Chen, Vogel, and Wang, 2016). Reddick and Zheng (2017) investigated the extent to 
which future use of mobile apps is possible among C hinese users. Greece supports m-
government through a number of initiatives like Pyt hagoras which is specifically catering to 
providing information and public services pertainin g to the agriculture sector (Ntaliani, 
Costopoulou, and Karetsos, 2008). USA has been impl ementing a number of m-government 
platforms in eco-tourism sector, for instance (Lore nzi et al., 2014). In UK, m-government 
services are active wherein citizens may avail gove rnment services or report maintenance 
complaints via text messaging services (Vincent and  Harris, 2008). Further, Dubai has launched 
an initiative known as m-Dubai where information an d services are provided to citizens on 
mobile phones and Luxembourg's City Government has launched the 'eCity' initiative wherein 
mobile payment may be done for procuring government al services (Misuraca, 2009). However, 
m-government development has remained uneven across  the globe owing to differences in the 
extent of e-government implementation and the devel opment of mobile technologies in a 
country.  
M-government has been defined as "the use of variou s mobile platforms (e.g., cell phones, 
notepads) for deploying government information and services to citizens in a way that is 
independent of time and location" (Liu et al., 2014 : 433). M-government refers to the use of 
mobile technologies to improvise the processes of g overnance or the interaction between users 
and government (World Bank, 2012). One of the major  strengths of m-government lies in the 
provision of government services in the remotest ar eas. Furthermore, m-government services 
may be procured via mobile Internet, pre-installed phone software, SMS, applications (“apps”) 
etc. Such services may be accessed and availed thro ugh mobile phones, personal digital 
assistants (PDAs), tablets, handheld devices, smart  phones, cellular phones, terminals, or other 
devices that are portable (Alrazooqi and De Silva, 2010). Few academic studies have been 
conducted on m-government (e.g., Gang, 2005; Hung, Chang, and Kuo, 2013; Ntaliani, 
Costopoulou, and Karetsos, 2008). For assessing the  quality of m-government services, a service 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (AUS) At 04:37 23 February 2018 (PT)
quality model has also been provided with four para meters such as connectivity, interactivity, 
understandability and authenticity (Shareef, et al. , 2014). Furthermore, it is important that 
citizens should express their willingness to adopt the m-government services much like the e-
government services (Nam, 2014; Shareef, et al., 20 11).  
However, there are challenges linked with m-governm ent. For instance, there are implementation 
challenges associated with m-government because som e consumers have difficulty in entering 
mobile communication market (Grant, 2007). Besides,  m-government services may not be 
launched properly where there are infrastructure is sues or tight legal and regulatory norms. 
Citizens are wary of tapping m-government services on account of surveillance concerns and 
privacy issues. Literature on m-government underlin es the challenges associated with the launch 
and implementation of m-government services. For in stance, in an m-government study based in 
Malaysia, the challenges identified in m-government  usage pertained to security and privacy, 
interoperability issues, mobile usability issues, a ccess speed, quality of service, lack of 
personalization and high cost of mobile access and services (Al Thunibat, Zin and Sahari, 2011). 
Likewise, in a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, it was found that implementation of m-
government faced concerns of trust, information ove rload, additional costs and lack of people 
awareness (Alsenaidy and Ahmad, 2012). In another s tudy, factors such as accessibility, usability 
issues (small screens, small keypads, short battery  life, limited computing power, limited input 
capabilities, limited geographical capabilities) an d application infrastructure issues were 
identified as key challenges for implementation of m-government (Salkute, Kolhe and Veedhi, 
2011). Finally, content distribution is limited due  to limited device capabilities and there is a 
need for personalization for better m-government us age (Abramowicz, et al., 2007). Thus, 
communication content impacts mobile access to e-go vernment services (Bampo et al., 2008; 
Grove et al., 2007; Prins and Verhoef, 2007). Impli citly, diverse set of challenges are being 
encountered in developing and developed countries a s far as the launch and implementation of 
m-government initiatives are concerned. Second, the re are challenges on the part of the user who 
intends to adopt m-government services. 
2.3 Theoretical background for the study 
Different theoretical strands may be invoked to inv estigate the adoption of m-government 
services (Ovcjak, Hericko, and Polancic, 2015). For  instance, the Theory of Reasoned Actions 
(TRA) posits that individual behavior is driven by behavioral intentions where behavioral 
intentions are a function of an individual's attitu de towards the behavior and subjective norms 
surrounding the performance of the behavior (Fishbe in and Ajzen, 1975). The Diffusion of 
Innovations/Innovation Diffusion Theory (DOI/IDT) p osits that individuals are prone to adopting 
innovations contingent upon their degrees of willin gness and five categories of individuals are 
acknowledged-innovators, early adopters, early majo rity, late majority and laggards (Rogers, 
1995). Also, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) p osits that acceptance behavior is determined 
by behavior intentions toward a specific system, wh ere the intentions are determined by attitude 
(a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behav ior of interest), subjective norms (the belief 
that certain individuals who are significant to an individual may approve or disapprove an 
individual's behavior), and perceived behavior cont rol (people's perceptions of the ability to 
perform a given behavior) (Ajzen, 1991, 2001). Furt hermore, the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM), presented by Davis (1989), is an information  systems theory which underlines that 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (AUS) At 04:37 23 February 2018 (PT)
Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) and Perceived Usefulnes s (PU) are the two key parameters which 
determine one's intention to use technology. This m odel was further expanded by Venkatesh and 
his colleagues (Venkatesh, Davis, and College, 2000 ). Then, there is the Unified Theory of 
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) which was propounded by Venkatesh and his 
colleagues (Venkatesh, et al., 2003). According to UTAUT, the key determinants of usage 
intention and behavior are Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and 
Facilitating Conditions. In the present study, cons tructs from a mix of the aforementioned 
theories are being utilized to build the empirical framework. Specifically, we will invoke “Social 
Influence”, “Self-efficacy” and “Attitude” as the m ajor influencers of the users’ behavioral 
intention to adopt m-government services. In additi on, this study shall underline the significance 
of “perceived risks” in adoption of m-government se rvices.  
 
3. Hypotheses 
In the present study, the dependent variable is “Be havioral intention to adopt” (BI) m-
government services. BI is defined as an individual 's subjective probability that he or she will 
perform some m-services (Davis, 1989). Furthermore,  we posit that BI shall be determined by 
factors like “Perceived risks” (PR), “Influence” of  significant others (I), “Self-efficacy” (SE) and 
“Attitude” (ATT). Items for measuring these constru cts have been provided in the Appendix I.  
Perceived risks:  Perceived risk implies an individual’s belief of i ncurring a loss in pursuit of a 
given outcome (Warkentin et al., 2002) which makes an individual wary of adopting a particular 
thing or behavior. In the context of e-government, it has been found that PR influences an 
individual’s adoption of e-government services (Lia n, 2015; Roy et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2017). 
There might be behavioral and environmental uncerta inty which is associated with PR. For 
instance, users find it difficult to exercise full control over the internet owing to its impersonalit y 
and unpredictability (Pavlou 2003). Furthermore, th ere are possibilities of leakage of personal 
information when it is shared via the internet inte rface. Therefore, users are discouraged from 
conducting transactions via the internet. PR may be  linked with dimensions like functional, 
financial, psychological, time, physical and social  risks (Roselius, 1971; Featherman and Pavlou, 
2003). PR in e-commerce has a negative effect on at titude towards the behaviour (Fenech and 
O’Cass, 2001; Shih, 2004). PR antagonizes users who  feel hesitant to try new services 
(Steenkamp, Hofstede and Wedel, 1999) and perceive that availing services via conventional 
means is far better than through online means (Brad ley and Stewart, 2002; Mukherjee and Nath, 
2003; Wang, Lin and Tang, 2003). Given the signific ance of PR, we hypothesize that: 
H1: Perceived risk is negatively linked with adopti on of m-government services. 
Influence of significant others:  As a subjective norm, social influence is premised  on the extent 
to which an individual perceives the influence of o thers in impacting his behavior (Fishbein and 
Ajzen, 1975; Venkatesh et al., 2000) and where the others are significant for him and hold 
relevance for him so much that the usage of a parti cular system is determined by them 
(Venkatesh, et al., 2003). An individual’s preferen ce to engage in a particular behavior is 
determined by the preferences and assessments of th e significant others (Ajzen, 1991; Madden et 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (AUS) At 04:37 23 February 2018 (PT)
al., 1992). Therefore, views from critical individu als may influence the preferences of users 
(Bhattacherjee, 2000; Bhattacherjee and Sanford, 20 06). An individual’s interpersonal 
connections determine his likelihood of using or di scarding a particular activity (Bhattacherjee, 
2000; Montoya et al., 2010). It has been shown that  social influence impacts the usage of 
services like mobile internet (Wang and Wang, 2010;  Zhou, 2011), mobile shopping (Yang, 
2010), mobile banking (Zhou, Lu, and Wang, 2010) an d e-government (Tung and Rieck, 2005). 
In the context of e-government acceptance, an indiv idual’s social environment-including his 
peers and colleagues- influences him (Hung, Chang, and Yu, 2006; Shareef et al., 2011). 
Extending this argument further, it may be hypothes ized that social influence might have a 
significant role on mobile government adoption by t he individual. Therefore, we hypothesize 
that:  
H2: Interpersonal influence is positively linked wi th adoption of m-government services. 
Self-efficacy: Self-efficacy implies the extent to which an indivi dual perceives his competence in 
handling a particular system and this entails that the individual possesses the requisite 
technological knowledge and skills to use the techn ology or system (Seo and Bernsen, 2016). 
Therefore, it is linked with an individual’s convic tion to execute a given behavior (Bandura, 
1997). An individual is able to assess the extent t o which he finds it easy or difficult to perform a 
specific action (Ajzen, 1991, 2001). Furthermore, t here is a linkage between interpersonal 
influence and service communication (Gallivan et al ., 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2008) which 
implies that an individual’s self-efficacy influenc es his ability to interpret any communication 
arising from availing the service. Therefore, in th e context of accessing and availing m-
government services, it is hypothesized that:  
H3: Self-efficacy is positively linked with adoptio n of m-government services. 
Attitude: Attitude has a significant role in predicting an i ndividual’s behavioral intention to use 
and adopt any Information System (IS) or technology  (Bhattacherjee and Premkumar, 2004; 
Heijden, 2003). Attitude implies an individual’s po sitive or negative feeling about performing 
the target behavior (Davis, 1989). Extant literatur e shows that attitude is linked with an 
individual’s behavioral intentions in voluntary set tings such as e-commerce, e-banking, mobile 
government and e-government (Al-Debei, Al-Lozi, and  Papazafeiropoulou, 2013; Alomari, 
Woods, and Sandhu, 2012; Chang, et al., 2005; Hung,  Chang, and Kuo, 2013; Susanto and 
Goodwin, 2013). It may be deduced that in the case of the adoption of m-government services, 
attitude has a significant role to play. Therefore,  it is hypothesized that:  
H4: Attitude is positively linked with adoption of m-government services. 
 
4. Research method 
4.1 Data collection and sample representatives 
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (AUS) At 04:37 23 February 2018 (PT)
For the present study, we solicited responses from actual m-government users. Overall, the 
sample included those m-government users who access ed and availed public services through 
mobile internet, SMS, direct call or a mobile App l aunched by the government. Such m-
government services included availing cooking gas c onnection, application for passport, 
application for filing tax returns, payment transac tions related to electricity usage or phone 
connections, usage of “Narendra Modi” App, etc. Ini tially, we conducted a pilot study with 10 
students pursuing full-time course in business mana gement discipline. They took around 15-20 
minutes in completion of the survey. We solicited t heir views regarding the ease with which they 
were able to understand and answer the questionnair e items. Based on the few suggestions 
recommended by the students, minor changes were mad e in the words of the questionnaire. Also, 
a senior professor teaching courses in e-government  based in a Canadian university helped us in 
refining the constructs and item generation exercis e. All items were measured using a five-point 
Likert scale, with anchors ranging from "strongly a gree" (1) to "strongly disagree" (5). A 
systematic survey was undertaken in October, 2016-M ay, 2017. Following random sampling, a 
total of 550 respondents hailing from different par ts of the country with diverse backgrounds 
were contacted via direct and indirect channels. Qu estionnaire link was posted on many list-servs 
and social media channels. Out of 550 respondents, 311 respondents (56.54%) submitted 
complete responses and hence, these responses const ituted the sample frame for the present 
study. The demographic characteristics of our sampl e respondents are provided in Table 1. While 
the male respondents were 65.6%, female respondents  were relatively less (34.4%). In terms of 
age groups, most of the respondents were of 20-30 a ge group (38.6%) followed by those who 
were from the 31-40 age group (32.3%). There were s ome respondents from the 41-60 age group 
(19.9%). Finally, there was a small section of resp ondents which was above 60 years of age 
(9.3%). In terms of occupational status, a majority  of respondents hailed from the private sector 
(39.5%) followed by those who were students (21.2%) . Some of the respondents were pensioners 
(6.8%) and some were self-employed (12.2%). Some of  the respondents were unemployed 
(3.9%). In terms of educational qualifications, mos t of the respondents were postgraduates 
(63.7%) followed by those who were postgraduate res earchers (20.3%), graduates (15.1%) and 
below graduates (1%). In terms of marital status, a  majority of the respondents were married 
(59.5%). Finally, in terms of the frequency of usag e of m-government services, most of the 
respondents accessed and availed government service s with their mobile phones (71.1%).

4.3 Reliability testing and correlations 
Reliability test was conducted for checking the int ernal consistency of the variables (PR, I, SE, 
ATT, BI). Cronbach's alpha was calculated as 0.912 which shows a high level of internal 
consistency for our scale with the sample. Furtherm ore, Table 2 shows that all the items 
measuring the constructs are desirable and may not be deleted from the analysis. The data were 
analyzed by multiple regression analysis using SPSS  20.0 software. Correlation table is shown in 
Table 3. Behavioral intention to adopt m-government  services is significantly correlated with PR, 
I, SE, ATT apart from demographic variables like ma rital status and gender. For instance, males 
are more likely to adopt m-government services in c ontrast with females. Likewise, married 
respondents are more likely to adopt m-government s ervices in contrast with those who are 
single. However, for select categories, there is si gnificant correlation between frequency of m-
government usage and education qualification with b ehavioral intention to adopt m-government 
services. For instance, there is a significant posi tive correlation between BI and the age group of 
51-60. Likewise, there is a significant negative co rrelation between those who use m-government 
once in a month with BI. Finally, there is no signi ficant correlation between BI and occupational 
background of the respondents.

4.4 Multiple regression analysis 
Whenever the researcher is interested in predicting  the amount or size of the dependent variable, 
multiple regression is useful (Hair, Black, Babin a nd Anderson, 2009). However, regression does 
not mean causation; the relevant theory must determ ine whether one or more explanatory 
variables are causally related to the dependent var iable. In the present study, we aimed at 
determining how much variance in the dependent vari able (BI) could be explained by the 
demographic variables and the other independent var iables (PR, I, SE, ATT). In the model, R2 
which refers to the predictive power linked with th e independent variables, was calculated. The 
alpha-level of significance was set at 0.05. Beside s, we checked for the tolerance values and 
variance inflation factor (VIF) values to check if there was any multicollinearity. The tolerance 
values of all independent variables were greater th an 0.01 and VIFs were less than 10, which 
indicate that multicollinearity is not an issue (Ha ir, 2010).  
Table 4 summarizes the results from multiple regres sion analysis. Conceding that we retained 
dummy variables to capture the impact of the catego rical variables, we categorized age, 
educational qualification, occupation, frequency of  usage, marital status and gender into different 
categories while retaining reference categories. Fo r instance, for gender, we retained female as 
the reference category and for age, we retained Age  group (above 60) as the reference category. 
For occupation, unemployed were retained as the ref erence category while for marital status, 
respondents with “single” status were retained as r eference category. For education qualification, 
we retained those with above postgraduate education  as the reference category and for the 
frequency of m-government usage, we retained those tapping m-government services few times 
in a year as the reference category. In the model, R 2 is significant (p<0.05) which is 0.796 and F-
statistic is also significant (56.499, p<0.05). Res ults indicate that males are more inclined 
towards m-government services in comparison with fe males. Further, marital status does not 
have any bearing on the adoption of m-government se rvices. In terms of demographic variables, 
those who are between 31-50 age group are more like ly to avail and access m-government 
services in comparison with the other age groups. I n terms of occupational status, public sector 
employees are more likely to adopt m-government ser vices in contrast with private sector 
employees. Further, students are not likely to tap m-government services. However, self-
employed respondents are more likely to tap m-gover nment services. In terms of the four 
hypotheses, we find that H1 is supported given that  “Perceived risk” construct is significant and 
it is implicative of the fact that the higher the p erceived risks linked with m-government 
adoption, the lesser is the propensity of the respo ndents to adopt the m-government services. H2 
is not supported because “Influence” was not found to be statistically significant which implies 
that there is no impact of the significant others i n determining m-government usage. H3 is 
supported which implies that “Self-efficacy” is pos itively linked with m-government adoption. 
Finally, H4 is supported which implies that “Attitu de” towards m-government adoption is 
positive.

5. Discussion 
5.1 Conclusion 
The findings from this study leave interest insight s. M-government adoption is high given the 
frequency with which the m-government services are being availed by the respondents. Given 
that H1, H3 and H4 were supported, this is implicat ive of the fact that the respondents perceive 
that adoption of m-government services is safe in I ndia. Respondents have the confidence that 
they will be able to operate m-government services with the help of their mobile phone and they 
possess the required competency. They show a positi ve attitude towards adoption of m-
government services in the future. Males are more l ikely to adopt m-government services. 
However, there are differences in terms of age grou ps wherein middle-aged respondents were 
found to be more adept and prone towards adoption o f m-government services in contrast with 
the youngsters or the old aged. There was no impact  of the marital status on the adoption of m-
government services. In terms of the educational qu alification, postgraduates are more likely to 
adopt m-government services and in terms of the pro fessional affiliation, public sector 
employees are more inclined to adopt m-government s ervices. Similarly, self-employed are more 
likely to adopt m-government services in contrast w ith the unemployed. Overall, the extent of m-
government adoption by users is a function of the e xtent to which the user finds m-government 
to be useful. Furthermore, m-government platform sh ould be user-friendly such that the user 
should be able to access m-government services in a  hassle-free manner. This leaves significant 
pointers for practitioners and policy-makers as wel l as to how should m-government services be

designed in the country. Conceding that m-governmen t services involve transactions which are 
monetary and include revelation of personal informa tion via the mobile interface, users are more 
inclined to adopt m-government services if there is  credibility of such services. Privacy and 
confidentiality of personal information is vital fo r the sustenance of any e-government service 
and this has been validated in the present study as  well because users find m-government 
services safe and trustworthy.     
5.2 Implications for research 
In a recent study, demographic factors were not fou nd to be highly correlated with the use of m-
government (Reddick, 2014). However, in our study, the significance of demographic variables 
was underlined to some extent. Further research is merited to appreciate the significance of other 
demographic variables (socio-economic status, for i nstance) to ascertain m-government adoption 
behavior. Furthermore, cultural variations may be u nderlined in further research. For instance, a 
comparative study may be undertaken to underline th e differences in m-government 
implementation and adoption across developed and de veloping countries. Second, the present 
study was conducted from a cross-sectional perspect ive. Further studies are required taking a 
longitudinal angle wherein the impact of m-governme nt services may be gauged over a period of 
time. Third, quality assessment of m-government ser vices may be significant predictors of m-
government adoption. Therefore, further research is  merited to assess the role of quality metrics 
in m-government adoption. Fourth, further research is required to underline the difference in m-
government adoption in rural versus urban areas in India and the challenges in m-government 
adoption may be investigated in the two domains. Fi nally, further research is required to 
underline the role of individual personality factor s like the Big Five Forces model, for instance.     
5.3 Implications for practice 
Our study showed that there is differential adoptio n of m-government services among the age 
groups. Therefore, the government of India should a dopt novel m-government features to attract 
all the mobile phone users to avail and access dive rse m-government services. Likewise, user-
friendly interfaces should be provided to attract m ore mobile phone users to avail m-government 
services. Likewise, our study found that m-governme nt services are adopted more by those who 
are self-employed or are from the public sector. Ap parently, the message has not percolated well 
among the students and the youngsters. Therefore, w ith the institutionalization of m-government 
services alongside the provision of low cost and af fordable services, the government of India 
should evolve citizen-friendly models for governanc e. Finally, m-government services can go a 
long way in forging ties with the citizens and invo lving them in administrative innovations. 
Therefore, efforts should be made to ensure that m- government services are provided in a user-
friendly and secure manner.
