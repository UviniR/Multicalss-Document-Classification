AmCham Indonesia and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2019 © copyright reservedThe US continues to be one of Indonesia’s 
biggest and most impactful investment partners, with an estimated $36 billion 
invested from 2013-2017. This new figure, 
which adds estimated upstream oil and gas investments to the official statistics, is almost five times the $7.78 billion recorded by the Indonesian government, making the US likely 
the top source of FDI in Indonesia during 
that period.  Numbers
ChallengesImpactBeyond the dollar figures, over many decades US companies have helped lay the foundation for growth in key industries, 
from the extractives sector in the past to the 
digital economy today.
The $36 billion figure is significantly less than the $61 billion in new investment projected in our 2013 report, which could partly be 
due to continued investment restrictions, 
regulatory hurdles and operational challenges. Interviews with key  
stakeholders reveal that many of the government’s reform efforts so far have 
focused mostly on the entry phase of 
investment. More fundamental operational issues remain, constraining much-needed investment growth.Page I
Investment ReportExecutive Summary
ore than a hundred 
years ago, the predecessors of today’s en -
ergy giants, Chevron and ExxonMobil, be -
gan marketing and exploration activities in 
Indonesia with pioneering investments that 
eventually led to the country becoming a 
world-class energy producer. 
In the process, these companies and 
many other foreign investors transferred the technology and expertise necessary for Indonesia to develop its own home-grown 
workforce and energy industry. The skills and 
scale of these multinational energy compa -
nies, in partnership with the people and gov -
ernment of Indonesia, helped spur massive economic growth over many decades. 
That partnership continues as we found 
that the US, with $36 billion invested from 2013 to 2017, remains likely the largest source of FDI for Indonesia. In today’s world, US in -
vestment is also helping to drive transfor -
mation in the economy as apps, Industry 4.0 and unicorns grab the attention away from 
still-vital extractives and commodities. 
“We have to transform from a depen -
dence on natural resources to a compet -
itive and modern manufacturing and ser -
vice-based economy that has high added 
value for the prosperity of the nation and 
social justice for all the Indonesian people,” 
President Joko Widodo said in the inaugu -
ration speech that outlined his priorities for 
his second term in office.
1 
Throughout the next phase of Indonesia’s 
journey, the US will continue to be a reliable partner and source of valuable foreign in -
vestment — both in terms of quantity and 
quality. We will contend in this, our 7th an -
nual US-Indonesia Investment Report, that 
whether we are considering the important 
and continuing legacy of existing industries or the more recent role played by innovative 
and leading-edge tech and health compa -
nies, the US has brought true partnerships, 
core business values and unsurpassed tech -
nology to Indonesia. 
The full scale of US investment in the coun -
try is not often evident from official govern -
ment figures. Statistics from the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) only attributed $7.78 billion worth of investments 
to the US from 2013 to 2017. 
This is far from a complete picture. First, 
it does not account for investments coursed through the regional headquarters of mul -
tinational companies, which are typically  
based in countries such as Singapore or Hong 
Kong and cover a wide number of sectors. 
Second, it does not include the upstream oil and gas sector, which has traditionally been 
one of the major destinations for US capital.

vestment report, AmCham Indonesia, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Unit -
ed States Agency for International Develop -Scale of US  
InvestmentInvestment That 
Makes an Impactment Mission to Indonesia (USAID Indonesia) 
commissioned Ernst & Young Indonesia to 
try to paint a more complete picture of the 
true scale and impact of US investments in Indonesia.
Our research found that once estimat -
ed upstream oil and gas activities are taken into account, US companies invested at least 
$36 billion into Indonesia from 2013 to 2017 
— almost five times the official government figure. This also means the US was likely the 
leading source of foreign direct investment 
(FDI) in Indonesia during that five-year period. No Countries In USD Mn

Beyond the numbers, interviews with gov -
ernment officials and industry leaders also 
show that US companies contributed far more than investment dollars. Directly and 
indirectly, they have served as catalysts for 
the growth of new sectors, provided invalu-able training and knowledge and assisted 
countless entrepreneurs. 
US companies tend to enter the country 
with a “win-win” attitude and create mutually beneficial business relationships, according 
to Sarwi H. Notoatmodjo, the director of leading Indonesian oil and gas service pro -
vider IMECO, which has worked with both ExxonMobil and Chevron Pacific Indonesia over the past decade.  Page II
Investment ReportRecommendationsChallenges to 
Investment Growth
Despite the significant value of existing in -
vestments by US companies, the reality is 
that they could be doing much more. In 2013, 
we reported on the basis of interviews with US companies that roughly $61 billion worth 
of investments were planned for Indonesia in 
the next three to five years. The $36 billion investment figure for 2013-2017, unfortunate -
ly, falls significantly short of that.
We conducted dozens of interviews to 
try to understand why this is the case. Our 
analysis resulted in a key insight: Though the 
government has been deregulating to attract more foreign investors, most improvements 
have only been in the entry phase. Once the 
permits are issued and the businesses are set up, the usual operational and even more funda -
mental problems remain lack of skilled workers, contract and regulatory uncertainty, corrup -
tion preventing further investment and painting 
a discouraging tale for potential investors.
President Widodo himself recognizes this, 
emphasizing in his inauguration speech that the government will make the development 
of human resources its main priority. We are hopeful  this includes a reform of the coun -
try’s outdated labor law, which restricts the ability of companies to manage their work -
force due to costly procedures for layoffs 
and a politicized minimum wage structure, 
consequently affecting productivity.President Widodo launched his second term in office with a strong focus on bureaucratic 
and economic reform and an ambitious goal 
of making Indonesia one of the world’s top five economies by its centennial in 2045. 
To contribute to the government’s efforts, 
we would like to add our learnings from our assessment of the challenges faced by in -
vestors in Indonesia today. 
1. Require public consultations prior to 
the issuance of regulations . Governance 
experts have long contended that a sys -
tematic and effective system of public 
consultations not only leads to better They empower local companies, ranging 
from SMEs that can take advantage of in -
novative small business solutions offered by digital platforms such as Google and Facebook, to those that benefit as contractors for major 
US firms like Qualcomm, HP and Caterpillar. 
They also build a skilled workforce, trans -
fer knowledge and technology and advocate for an improved business environment that 
benefits all. Companies like Cargill and Philip Morris help build skills and capacities in the 
agriculture sector, which is still the country’s 
biggest employer. Tech industry giants like IBM, HP , Microsoft, Facebook and Apple help pro -
vide key tools in the digitalization of Indonesia. 
Taken together, this leaves a profound in -
tangible impact on the country, as evidenced 
by comments from both Indonesian compa -
nies and government officials interviewed for 
this report.Indonesia’s productivity-to-cost ratio was the lowest among five ASEAN countries (In -
donesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam) in 2017, largely because growth of labor productivity in the four other coun -
tries balanced out the increases in their re -
spective minimum wages.
We note that the government has issued 
a number of tax holidays and other incen -
tives to attract FDI, but, as the World Bank pointed out in a recent report,
3 none of these 
are enough if operational issues are not ad -
dressed. Among these issues AmCham has been told repeatedly by investors is the high cost of doing business in Indonesia, mainly 
because of logistics and land acquisition, but 
also due to persistent corruption, including demands for “facilitation” payments, which, 
even if they are not paid, can result in sig -
nificant delays.
The president has also ordered his min -
isters to simplify, cut and trim all regulatory 
constraints, but a mindset that recognizes the need for long-term regulatory certain -
ty is required to attract major investments that will stay in the country for decades. The country remains mired in the practice of in -
troducing new laws and regulations that can significantly change the way companies must run their businesses, including demands for 
greater local content or rules that require 
taking on local partners. It is time-consuming and expensive to cope with new regulations 
that sometimes are issued without sufficient 
public consultation. The cumulative effect of these practices is to paint a less attrac -
tive picture of Indonesia as an investment destination.regulations, but also improves compli -
ance and reduces enforcement costs.  
2. Create a dedicated government body for 
regulatory impact analysis. Having a gov -
ernment body dedicated to this, according to the World Bank, is recognized by most developed countries as a key instrument 
to improve the quality of regulatory deci -
sion-making and can help to substantially 
reduce unforeseen problems or unintend -
ed consequences of otherwise well-inten -
tioned regulations. This includes mapping of potentially overlapping regulations.  
3. Improve coordination and communica -
tions between government bodies. Across 
various industries, this issue is consistent. Even if a regulation is good, inconsistent implementation and communication be -
tween government bodies can diminish its potential impact.  
4. Focus on long-term goals over short-
term gains . A common observation by 
industry players and analysts alike is how 
policymaking in Indonesia is often “re -
active” to needs and issues, instead of 
being a well-thought-out plan for the fu -
ture. With the government focus on 2045, we are hopeful that long-term planning will guide policymaking moving forward.  
Armed with a fresh mandate, the president’s second term has the opportunity to put in 
place meaningful reforms that could guide 
Indonesia out of the middle-income trap be -
fore 2045. To do this will require vision, po -
litical courage and a willingness to challenge corrupt or inefficient practices, special inter -
ests and entrenched bureaucracy. As they 
have over the past century, US companies 
will be here and be ready to invest time and money to support Indonesia’s development 
goals in ways that make a lasting impact.

P. 01—06Chapter1
Our previous investment reports have 
consistently pointed out that official for -
eign direct investment (FDI) figures do not 
paint a complete picture of the scale and 
impact of US investments in Indonesia. 
In 2013, we estimated that US FDI in Indo -
nesia totaled $65 billion from 2004 to 2012, once capital expenditures as well as merg -
ers and acquisitions are taken into account. 
This figure stood in sharp contrast with of -
ficial statistics from Bank Indonesia, which 
showed only $7 billion in net investment flow 
from the US over the same period.
4  
In 2016, we set out to try and quantify 
the totality of the US-Indonesia economic 
relationship, to include not just FDI, but also trade, domestic sales, finance and 
government revenue. Our analysis at the 
time resulted in a staggering figure: $90.1 billion for 2014 alone, equivalent to 10.1 
percent of Indonesia’s total GDP that year.
5
For this year’s report, we sought to esti -
mate how much US companies invested in Indonesia from 2013 to 2017 by taking into 
account economic activities excluded by official government figures. 
According to the Indonesia Investment 
Coordinating Board (BKPM), which the Indonesian government refers to for offi -
cial FDI statistics, US companies invested a total of $7.78 billion over that five-year period, making them the country’s sev -
enth-largest source of FDI. However, this figure does not include investments in ei -
ther the upstream oil and gas sector or 
the financial sector, or in small and medi -
um-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
The oil and gas sector, however, has tra -
ditionally been one of the major destina -
tions of US capital, helping power years of 
strong resource-driven economic growth. 
In 2018, the sector accounted for 7.7 per -
cent of Indonesia’s GDP .
6 Therefore, to get 
a better sense of how much the US has actually invested in Indonesia, we sought 
to estimate how much each country has poured into the upstream side of the in -
dustry, where roughly 90 percent of oil and gas investments go. 
Our calculations resulted in a total of 
at least $36 billion in US investments from 2013 to 2017 — almost five times the BKPM figure — illustrating the scale of economic 
activity not captured by official numbers.

How Indonesian government agencies calculate FDI T
Bank Indonesia follows the International Monetary Fund (IMF) methodology, which 
only considers investments that involve a 
10 percent or more ownership stake in its records. It defines FDI as the direct flow of 
equity, reinvested earnings and other capital 
flows to the country. 
According to the central bank, it relies on 
reports from banks, corporations, external re -
sources and surveys to derive the investment data it uses in its calculations. If it finds incon -
sistencies between any of the sources, it will contact the company in question to resolve it.  
While this method encompasses all sec -
tors, including foreign investments made through financial markets, it also takes into account investment outflows and presents only the final net figure. This resulted in negative US figures for 2014, 2016 and 2017, 
following outflows from the mining and quar -
rying sectors.  
On the other hand, BKPM, which over -
sees promoting investment in Indonesia, 
considers any percentage of ownership by foreign investors as FDI. It defines realized 
FDI as the sum of realized investments as re -
ported by companies to BKPM every quarter 
and validated by its internal unit. 
However, it is also limited in that it ex -
cludes investments in financial markets, which it sees as temporary by nature, and 
in the upstream oil and gas sector, where 
no country-aggregated data was available until this year. o explain how we arrived at the $36 bil -
lion figure for US investments, we have to first understand the limitations of official FDI figures. In Indonesia, two government  agencies compile these numbers: Bank  
Indonesia and BKPM. However, their meth -
odologies differ so significantly that their  
figures are incompatible.

Both BI and BKPM methodologies are also 
limited by their inability to trace investments made through third countries back to their 
ultimate investing country (UIC). 
It is common for US multinationals to 
course investments to Indonesia through regional offices based, among others, in 
Singapore or Hong Kong. Data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that as 
of the end of 2018, nearly half of the over -
all investment position of the US was highly 
concentrated in holding companies. 
US agricultural firm Cargill, for instance, 
has asked its European and Singaporean branches to co-invest in a new manufac -
turing facility in Indonesia. In this case, both BI and BKPM would attribute that investment to Singapore and Europe. 
When Caterpillar first entered Indonesia in 
the 1970s, it was through a dealership agree -
ment with Sime Darby Bhd of Malaysia. A more recent example involves the Sidrap Wind Farm project in South Sulawesi, Indo -
nesia's first utility-scale wind farm. The proj -
ect was constructed by UPC Renewables in collaboration with a local firm. UPC Renew -
ables is a US company but is headquartered in Hong Kong.
While both the IMF and the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Develop -
ment (OECD) recommend recording invest -
ments by UIC on a supplementary basis, there 
is no confirmation whether Indonesia — or any 
country, for that matter — is following this idea.

o get a better sense of how much US com -
panies have been investing in Indonesia, we 
took a look at the oil and gas sector.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Re -
sources records investments in the sector on a per project basis, while the Upstream Oil 
and Gas Regulatory Special Task Force (SKK Migas) only began recording investments by 
source country in January 2019.
In order for us to estimate how much the US 
has invested in the sector, SKK Migas suggested using oil and gas production figures as a proxy. Our calculations (refer to the Annex) revealed a 
total of $28.2 billion in upstream oil and gas in -
vestments from US companies from 2013 to 2017, more than double the second-highest source of investments in this sector. 
When added to the BKPM figure of $7.78 
billion, we arrived at a total of $36 billion in US investments over that five-year period, 
making the US potentially the top source of 
FDI in Indonesia from 2013-2017, overtaking Singapore, which often tops official lists of 
Indonesian investors.   Rank Countries Investment realized

is still not a complete picture. It does not 
take into account investments in the financial sector and SMEs, and it still does not include US investments made through regional offic -

P. 1 22When US companies invest in a country, 
they do not just create jobs: they build

While foreign investment is often assessed 
in terms of numbers—dollars invested, jobs

also brings benefits that go far beyond these figures. 
FDI brings advanced technology, supe -

access to international markets through 
participation in global value chains, the Or -

ambang Prijambodo, the deputy head for 
economic affairs at the Ministry of National 
Development Planning (Bappenas), said the 
government recognized the contributions of US FDI in terms of technology transfer. 
“American investors help drive the econ -
omy, from technology and manufacturing to services. Indonesia has ‘actors’ for the digital 
sector, however, it still needs improvements 
in technology,” he said. 
Information technology giant IBM, for 
example, has long played an integral role in helping shape Indonesia’s IT industry in sup -
port of government goals. It has contribut -
ed to the development of Indonesia’s digital transformation road map, and worked with major Indonesian firms — including 19 of the 
top 20 banks in the country — to provide 
bespoke IT solutions. 
The Industry Ministry’s secretary general, 
Achmad Sigit Dwiwahjono, said the ministry is in talks with several US companies on how they can support digitalization in Indonesia. 
The government is also working with leading 
US chipmaker Qualcomm to help address the circulation of illegal smartphones in the 
black market.
In the oil and gas sector, long a staple 
destination for massive amounts of US FDI, the impact has been substantial over many 
decades. “We owe a lot to US technology, especially in oilfield services,” said Sarwi H. 
Notoatmodjo, the director of leading Indo -
nesian oil and gas service provider IMECO, which has worked with both ExxonMobil and 
Chevron Pacific Indonesia over the past de -
cade. 
This includes, he said, wireline logging and 
perforating technology, directional drilling 
and well cementing, among others. Chevron 
is also known for developing the plans for In -
donesia’s first ultra-deepwater natural gas proj -
ect, as well as bringing in enhanced recovery technologies to maximize oil potential and significantly prolong the life of mature fields.
In terms of renewable energy, Indonesia’s

local companies, ranging from SMEs that can 
take advantage of innovative small business 
solutions offered by digital platforms such as Google and Facebook, to companies that 
benefit as suppliers or distributors for major 
US firms. 
The direct licensees that work with Qual -
comm in Indonesia, for example, get access to the chipmaker’s technology and technical support. This access allows the licensees to 
create unique solutions and customize soft -
ware installation, leading to local innovation. 
In addition, Qualcomm trains its licensees 
on how to use and leverage the technology.  
Device manufacturer HP also works with 
more than 5,000 local business partners across the country for the sale and mainte -
nance of its products in Indonesia, providing 
them with training and certification that rais -
es skills and competencies.
The same story is seen in other industries. 
The long-running Sampoerna Retail Commu -
nity program is operated by tobacco produc -
er HM Sampoerna, owned by Philip Morris International, in cooperation with tens of 
thousands of small shopkeepers throughout 
the country. The owners of these warungs  
receive assistance and training in various 
business skills, including marketing and hu-
man resource development. With improved capacities to run their businesses, these small shops grow and generate jobs, bene -
fitting their respective communities. 
Sampoerna and major US agricultural firm 
Cargill also both invest heavily in educating 
the local farmers they source raw materials 
from. Oil palm farmers in South Sumatra, for example, experienced a 58 percent increase 
in revenue compared to the average earnings 
of local farmers in Indonesia after participat -
ing in Cargill’s development program in 2013.

IMECO’s Notoatmodjo noted that US 
companies tend to enter the country with a 
“win-win” attitude and create mutually ben -
eficial business relationships. 
“Most US corporations understand the 
principles and values of affirmative action 
through the hiring of local people, establish -
ment of joint ventures and/or the appoint -
ment of local agents,” he said.
PT Rekayasa Industri, a contractor for the 
Banyu Urip oil field operated by ExxonMobil 
Cepu, echoed this. 
“It's a milestone for PT Rekayasa Industri 
to be involved in the development of the Banyu Urip field project, from end to end.

Knowledge 
Transfer2.3
hen US companies invest in a country, they 
do not just create jobs: they build a skilled 
workforce. Freeport alone spends $10 million 
annually to train its staff in underground min -
ing activities — the only source of this kind 
of skill training in Indonesia.  
Companies like IBM and Citibank are 
well-known training grounds for IT and banking experts, respectively. Having work 
experience in these companies immediate -
ly increases the marketability of Indonesian 
professionals, who gain world-class skills and 
become highly in-demand talents when they later work for local companies or even the 
government. 
Former State-Owned Enterprises Minis -
ter Rini Soemarno and former Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan, 
for example, are both former Citibankers, while former Inalum president and new dep -
uty minister for SOEs, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, used to work for IBM. It is not unusual to be with a group of senior Indonesian bankers or 
technology executives and realize many of 
them got their starts in Citi or IBM. 
The knowledge transfer recipients are not 
limited to employees. Qualcomm provides telecommunications training workshops for government officials, university students and 
employees of local telecom companies. In 
health care, Pfizer and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) have been helping improve 
the skills of health care professionals across 
the country. 
Pfizer’s EduCare program has helped im -
prove the skills of more than 17,000 health care practitioners as well as the capacity of some 46 hospitals in 20 cities. MSD has also 
trained more than 2,000 health care profes -
sionals through scientific roundtable discus -sions, and this year significantly expanded 
access to its scientific seminars through the 
use of webinars.
Pfizer Indonesia, along with AmCham, also 
organized a healthcare summit this year for the private sector, policymakers and various stake -
holders to discuss ways to enhance access to 
and the availability of innovative therapies for 
improved health outcomes in Indonesia. 
“Our goal is to engage the government on 
how we collaboratively develop new inno -
vative healthcare access schemes through 
public and private partnerships leveraging emerging technologies, creative patient as-
sistance programs, as well as breakthroughs 
in supply-chain mechanisms,” said Anil Argil -
la, the president director of Pfizer Indonesia.
To help build the foundations of Indone -
sia’s digital economy, leading US companies are also helping provide the hard skills need -
ed for Indonesians to fully take advantage of and benefit from internet-based industries. 
Facebook’s Developer Circles program, 
launched in 2017, seeks to equip local devel -
opers with world-class skills and help them network faster and more effectively. The pro -
gram now has 25,000 members across 10 cit -
ies in Indonesia, with each Developer Circle headed by local community leaders, trained 
by Facebook in Silicon Valley or Singapore.
Facebook’s Laju Digital and #SheMeans-
Business programs have also provided digi -
tal outreach and marketing training for more 
than 40,000 entrepreneurs and 5,000 stu -
dents, government officials and community 
members in 41 cities across Indonesia. Its 
Instagram Academy has trained 1,300 entre -
preneurs under the age of 35 using a curricu-
lum designed to empower young businesses to 
grow their sales both domestically and abroad.Perhaps one of the 
more intangible ben -
efits US companies 
bring to Indonesia is their influence on 
corporate practices. 
“Personally, I have 
been learning a lot in 
terms of the values of integrity, good busi -
ness conduct and upholding customer trust 
through quality performance,” IMECO’s 
Notoatmodjo said. 
The drive for higher standards of gover -
nance, both inside and outside corporate structures, creates an impact that extends 
far beyond the bottom line. 
“We think one of the big ways US com -
panies coming into Indonesia, investing and doing business here, beneficially affects not only SSEK and the work we do, but all foreign investors here, is through their advocacy for improvements in the regulatory and invest -
ment regimes,” said Ira A. Eddymurthy, a founding partner of SSEK Legal Consultants and one of Indonesia's most experienced and 
highly regarded lawyers. 
She cited as an example the recent Min -
ister of Manpower decree on positions open for expatriate workers. The US business 
community, she said, used its experience and perspective to push for changes that 
helped produce the best possible decree 
for all stakeholders. Indeed, working with AmCham Indonesia and the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, SSEK and numerous compa -
nies greatly expanded the scope of the new 
decree. 
“An improved regulatory environment, an 
improved investment environment benefits SSEK just as it benefits everyone,” she said. Page 12

Apple also opened three Developer Acad -

Southeast Asia — in collaboration with BINUS 
University in Jakarta, Universitas Ciputra in Surabaya and Infinite Learning in Batam. The 
10-month program includes 200 people in 
each cohort and is free to participants. It is intended to inspire and train the next gener -
ation of app developers by teaching not just the technical side of app development, but also business and design skills, allowing the 
participants to own the intellectual property 
they develop and giving them access to po -
tential customers or backers. The program is 
open, not age-restricted nor does it require 
previous coding experience, and thus aims to boost the entire app economy in Indonesia.  
“Becoming a developer and creating inno -
vative apps for Indonesian society and global customers is a positive step toward building 
a strong digital literacy and ecosystem for 
the future,” BINUS University Rector Harjanto Prabowo said during the Jakarta academy’s 
launch in March.
Pointing to Indonesia’s goal of building 
an economy rooted in Industry 4.0, Indus -
try Ministry Secretary General Achmad Sig -
it Dwiwahjono said, “Strengthening human 
capital through education is a very mean -
ingful investment from the US.”  
In financial services, US ratings agencies 
have long helped connect Indonesia with 
international market participants abroad. By 
providing insights regarding Indonesian rated companies and debt securities, ratings agen -
cies like S&P Global Ratings give international investors confidence to understand the risks involved, as well as ensure that Indonesian 
issuers can diversify their funding and opti -
mize their financing costs. 
Beyond that, S&P Global Ratings in re -
cent years has also been working closely 
with Indonesia’s sole credit rating agency, PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (PEFINDO). 
By providing technical training and other ca -
pacity-building initiatives, S&P Global Ratings 
has been helping strengthen the foundations 
of the domestic debt capital market.
“We have always been a bridge between 
Indonesia and international investment op -
portunities,” said Matthew Batrouney, head

Looking for Real

P . 18When President Joko Widodo was inaugurat -
ed for his second term in October, he reiterat -
ed the goal he has been working toward over 
the past five years: For Indonesia to escape the middle-income trap through economic 
transformation and bureaucratic reform. 
But this time, informed by years of ex -
perience, he added a new emphasis: “Our work should no longer be process-oriented; 
we have to be results-oriented.”
That distinction is key, as Indonesia 
struggles to attract the foreign investment it expects and needs, despite the 16 econom -ic reform packages launched during Widodo’s first administration. Investors were not bowled 
over by the packages — they wanted results. 
Though our study shows that US FDI 
from 2013-2017 is already significantly high -
er than what official figures indicate, the 
fact is that US companies had been pre -
pared to pour tens of billions of dollars more 
into the country. In our 2013 report, we wrote 
that interviews with US companies revealed they had $61 billion worth of investments 
planned over the next three to five years.
Total FDI figures from BKPM reflect the same story, fluctuating between $28.6 billion 
and $32.2 billion over the past five years, 
and struggling to reach the government tar -
get of $35.6 billion in 2018. Total upstream 
oil and gas investment figures were similarly 
on a downward trend from 2013-2017, largely 
due to nationalist resource policies that have steadily limited the space for foreign invest -
ment in favor of local companies.
From a regional perspective, while Indo -
nesia accounts for a third of ASEAN’s GDP , 
it only has about 10 percent of the region’s 
FDI pie, according to OECD figures. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018

Chapter 3Investment Report
Addressing Challenges
The same struggle to achieve the desired 
investment results is seen in Indonesia’s per -
formance on global indicators that serve as benchmarks of economic competitiveness. 
In a ranking comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, Indo -
nesia sits in 4th place in terms of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ratings, which the 
government has been paying special attention to 
since Widodo came to office space (see Table 7). 
From 2013 to 2018, Indonesia made an 
impressive climb on the Ease of Doing Busi -
ness chart, rising from ranking 128th in the list to 72nd place, showing not only the largest 
but the most consistent overall improvement 
among the five countries. During that period, the government released 15 economic poli -
cy packages that revised or revoked around 300 regulations. The World Bank said start -
ing a business, getting electricity, registering 
property, getting credit, paying taxes, trading 
across borders and enforcing contracts all became easier.
However, Indonesia’s progress stagnated 
after the 2018 report, slipping to number 73 in 2019 and 2020 — a long way from the pres -
ident’s goal of breaching the top 40.
11 
In terms of the competitiveness of the 
overall economy, Indonesia’s performance is also slipping. In the World Economic Forum’s recently published 2019 Global Competitive -
ness Index, the country dropped five places to rank 50th — its lowest position in the past seven years — largely due to poor perfor -
mances in the categories of Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT) adop -
tion, financial system and innovation capability. 
By contrast, Vietnam climbed 10 spots to 
number 67 in the latest report. Overall, In -donesia has consistently ranked somewhere 
between Malaysia and Thailand ahead of it, 
and the Philippines and Vietnam below it (see Table 8).  
These indicators clearly matter to the 
country, and they are watched closely by the highest levels of government. In his inaugura -
tion speech, the president emphasized that the old ways of doing things can’t continue. 
“In a world that is full of risk, very dynamic 
and very competitive, we have to continue to develop new methods, new values. We should not allow ourselves to get trapped in 
a monotonous routine,” he said. 
This is a direction we fully support. De -
cades of protectionist policies have proven counterproductive to sustainable economic 
growth, only holding Indonesia back from increased productivity and innovation. 
Despite all the efforts to polish Indonesia’s 
image with investors by making it easier to set up a business and obtain permits, the re -
ality remains that the country is still relatively closed off to foreign investors, especially rel -
ative to Malaysia and Vietnam (see Table 9).
12 
“The reform with the greatest potential 
impact would be to substantially revise the negative list of sectors where FDI is restrict -
ed,” OECD experts said in an interview for 
this report. “Indonesia is one of the most 
restrictive countries under the OECD Reg -
ulatory Restrictiveness Index.” A more open 
revision of the DNI, the negative investment 
list, was prepared in 2018 with substantial input from local and foreign investors. But 
before it could be issued, it was pulled off  
the table, apparently due to political consid -
erations ahead of the 2019 elections. It has 
yet to see the light of day. Country 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020

he president’s first administration justly de -
serves praise for many major infrastructure 
improvements and key bureaucratic reforms, 
particularly the launch of the Online Single Submission (OSS) system. Armed with a fresh 
mandate, his second term should now turn 
its attention toward deepening bureaucrat -
ic reforms to make a greater impact on the 
business operating environment, and reach -
ing its investment targets. 
As helpful as some of the initiatives are 
from Widodo’s first term, they are far from 
complete. A common theme that emerged from our interviews is the need for the gov -
ernment to follow through on its plans and commitments — something the president himself noted during his inauguration.
“Oftentimes bureaucrats will report to me, 
saying that the program has been carried out, that the budget has been spent, that the 
accountability report has been completed,” 
Widodo said.
“When asked, they reply, ‘The program 
has been carried out, Pak.’ But when I check in the field, when I ask the people, it turns out that the public have not received the 
benefits [of the program]. It turns out that 
the people have not felt the results.”
This is a tale most businesses, whether foreign or local, can relate to. Once the per -
mits are issued and the businesses are set 
up, the usual operational and even more fun -
damental problems remain — lack of skilled 
labor, low productivity, tax uncertainty, high 
logistics costs, overregulation, inefficient 
bureaucracy, corruption, regulatory incon -
sistency — slowing down further investment 
and painting a discouraging tale for potential 
investors. Importantly, negative experienc -
es in the field reverberate strongly back at 
corporate headquarters, where Indonesia is 
just one country among many competing for the investment dollars of any given multina -
tional company. Regulators need to under -
stand that investors talk to one another and share their experiences. Missteps can have 
long-lasting results.
Government officials themselves recog -
nize this. “After the OSS and tax holidays are done, problems in the operational stage — 
land acquisition, electricity, other aspects of the supporting environment — also need 
improvements,” the Industry Ministry’s Ach -
mad Sigit Dwiwahjono said.
Our interviews with corporate execu-
tives and analysts revealed three main ar -
eas where deeper reforms are needed for 
Indonesia to achieve its targets. 125

The shortage of skilled workers consistent -
ly comes up as a pain point for investors. 
It was therefore encouraging to see human 
resource development at the top of the pres -
ident’s list of priorities for his second term, 
with an emphasis on improving skill levels 
and inviting global talents. The appointment of Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim as minis-
ter of education and culture further created 
optimism that new innovations in the educa -
tion sector can be found.
13 Makarim breaks the 
mold for education ministers because of his 
business background and the fact that he does 
not represent a traditional constituency for the bureaucracy. It will be fascinating to see if Ma -
karim, one of the most innovative businessmen in Asia, can make progress on reforming and modernizing the conservative and entrenched 
education bureaucracy. Both local and foreign 
investors have consistently told AmCham that the national curriculum, with its emphasis on 
rote learning, is out of date with international 
trends that emphasize problem solving, collab -
oration and intellectual exploration.Reforms are also needed to address peren -
nial issues of low productivity and legal con -
straints that make managing a workforce in 
Indonesia more difficult than in neighboring 
countries.
Though Indonesia’s output per worker in 
2017 ranked above the Philippines and Viet -
nam, its five-year productivity compound -
ed annual growth rate (CAGR) for 2013-2017 
fell below those two countries (see Figure 1). 
Vietnam’s productivity per employed person saw a 5.51 percent CAGR during that period, 
followed by the Philippines with 3.66 percent. 
Indonesia came in third with 3.39 percent, slightly above Thailand’s 3.36 percent and 
Malaysia’s 3.14 percent.
Once wages are brought into the analy -
sis, Indonesia’s productivity ratio falls to last place among the five comparative ASEAN 
countries (see Figure 2). This is largely be -
cause the growth of labor productivity in 
the four other countries has been able to 
balance out the increase in their respective minimum wages.

Compounding the problem are a host of

As with labor issues, it is encouraging to see 
the president prioritize changing regulatory 
constraints and continuously reforming the

“All regulatory constraints must be simpli -
fied, cut and trimmed,” the president said in his inauguration speech.
“The simplification of the bureaucracy 
must continue in a massive way. Investments that create jobs must be prioritized. Long procedures must be cut down. Convoluted 
bureaucracy must be trimmed,” he added.   
Between 2006 and 2015, the Ministry 
of Finance eliminated 1,474 regulations, or about 60 percent of the total.
14 It has also 
announced 25 new regulations to simplify business processes and tax identification 
number registration. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, for its part, has also 
removed 186 irrelevant or redundant regu -
lations.
15 
But more needs to be done. The World 
Economic Forum index on the burden of 
government regulation, which measures the difficulties companies face in complying with 
public administration requirements (i.e. per -
mits, regulations, reporting), showed Indone -
sia improving only slightly from 4.0 in 2013 to 4.1 in 2018. Much of the improvement has so 
far focused on the early investment phases, while significant hindrances to growth and 
expansion during the operational stages re -
main. In other words, it is one thing to attract 
investment, it is quite another to treat exist -
ing investors well.
It was again therefore encouraging to hear 
President Widodo push for a new omnibus 
law that will override several regulations that 
hamper job creation, business operations and overall investment. But a mindset that rec -
ognizes the need for regulatory certainty is crucial. Increasing divestment requirements imposed on foreign companies in the oil and 
gas, mining and even the EPC (engineering, 
procurement and construction) sectors are already serving as cautionary tales for oth -
er foreign companies considering entering Indonesia. 
While the government focuses on issuing 
tax holidays and other incentives to attract foreign investors, companies increasingly say these are not key deciding factors for investment decisions because competing 
countries offer the same lures. The World 
Bank’s recently released report, Global Eco -
nomic Risks and Implications for Indonesia, 
points out that no amount of tax incentives 
or holidays is enough to attract FDI if oper -
ational issues are not addressed. 
“Indonesia must surprise investors with 
bold reforms that create credibility that In -
donesia is really open for business, certainty 
that rules are predictable and not discre -
tionary, and compliance with the President’s 
policy,” it said. 
More important, executives say, is the 
certainty that they would have room to grow, control their own business decisions, 
manage their labor forces and make long-
term plans without fear of sudden regulatory shifts that might result in forced divestment 
or other changes.

Addressing ChallengesCost of Business
All the factors so far discussed contribute 
to uncertainty surrounding the cost of con -
ducting business in Indonesia. While tax in -
centives mean reduced costs at the start, it is often not enough to outweigh the high 
costs of business operations. 
For instance, land acquisition is consid -
ered the most challenging phase of infra -
structure development, with the Coordinat -
ing Ministry for the Economy acknowledging 
that 44 percent of problems surrounding 
infrastructure projects concern land acqui -
sition.
16 If even the government struggles with 
land acquisition, then no wonder costs are sharply higher for private enterprises. 
The president has emphasized that the 
government will continue to prioritize infra -
structure construction, due to the country’s 
logistics costs remaining persistently high, even after the $400 billion infrastructure 
program during the first Widodo term. 
While Indonesia’s spot in the World Bank’s 
Logistics Performance Index (LPI), which measures a country’s performance on trade 
logistics, climbed 17 places to 46th in 2018 
from 63rd in 2016, it still lags behind Malaysia, 
Thailand and Vietnam, the latter of which jumped 25 places to rank 39th in 2018. 
This is because the LPI not only measures 
infrastructure, but also looks at international shipments, logistics quality and competence, 
tracking and timeliness. Among the compo -
nents of LPI, Indonesia scored below most of 
the other large ASEAN countries on customs 
and logistics quality and competence in 2018.  
Corruption, including “facilitation” pay -
ments, also raises business risks and costs. Indonesia’s efforts to reduce graft have so 
far had limited overall impact, with its perfor -
mance on the Corruption Perception Index 
ranking at 89th out of 180 countries in 2018. 
The September 2019 passage by the outgo -
ing legislature of the amended Corruption 
Eradication Commission (KPK) law has also 
raised concerns that the body is being sub -
stantially weakened.

Technology 4.1
Indonesia can become a valuable part of the technology industry’s global supply chain if it addresses human capital needs, eases regulatory constraints and strengthens protection 
of intellectual property rights. If it fails to do these things, it risks missing out on being a 
key part of the global supply chain. mid the government’s strong push to expand the man -
ufacturing sector and increase the focus on all things 
tech, investments in the sector have struggled to grow. 
In fact, government data show that investments in trans -
portation, storage and communications have declined 
by a five-year compounded annual rate of 28 percent. 
Our interviews with various stakeholders revealed 
that despite the imposition of local content requirements to force more domestic manufacturing, limitations in 
terms of skilled labor, logistics and research capabilities as well as regulatory constraints weigh more on investor 
decisions to enter or expand in Indonesia. 
This is largely because most electronic devices to -
day are manufactured through global supply chains that span several countries. However, Indonesia’s costlier and 
inefficient logistics, along with import duties and restric -
tions, make the country less competitive as a base for 
production than others like Thailand and Vietnam. 
For instance, there has been an increase in the with -
holding import tax rate on electronic products to protect domestic producers.
17 However, a number of products 
that saw higher taxes are not available domestically, which means the goal to protect domestic producers 
instead resulted in higher local prices for consumers. Consequently, this encouraged consumers to purchase 
electronic products overseas and smuggle them into 
Indonesia, resulting in a loss of tax income for the gov -
ernment.
While a 2018 Ministry of Finance regulation on govern -
ment-borne import duties for certain industries allows tech companies to file for tax refunds, the lack of clarity 
in the requirements has so far meant industry players 
have been unable to take advantage of it. In practice, the refunds can be delayed for years and result in costly 
audits that are difficult to resolve. 
In terms of permits, companies need a letter of rec -
ommendation from the Ministry of Industry before im -
porting electronic products, which needs to be renewed 
every six months. This creates a “blackout” period during the renewal process when no importation can be done. 
By contrast, other Southeast Asian countries have a 
system for automatically renewing import licenses to prevent these kinds of situations, creating an operating 
environment more conducive to doing business. 
Indonesia also requires that imports of electronic 
products are inspected at the source country — a pro -
cedure not seen in other countries with large electronic 
manufacturing industries — which often creates delays.  While we understand that many of these restrictions 
are aimed at forcing companies to manufacture locally, 
Indonesia does not yet have the high technology envi -
ronment needed to support the fabrication of special -
ized components, such as semiconductors. Absent a well-developed supply chain, Indonesia is not generally attractive to high-tech manufacturers. Additionally, the 
goal of generating tens of thousands of jobs through 
more domestic electronics manufacturing is challenging, as many of these tasks are increasingly being done by 
robots.
However, the industry’s experience over the last few 
years with how local content requirements were rede -
fined and relaxed in some cases to address the realities 
of the industry has created some optimism that these constraints could be addressed by the government. 
In 2017, the Ministry of Information and Communica -
tions Technology decided to exempt non-smartphone devices from local content requirements following feed -
back from industry players. They argued that the restric -
tions would have made several products more expensive or unavailable in the local market. 
The ministry also redefined “local content” beyond 
hardware and software to include innovation develop -
ment. This allowed Apple, for example, to open a de -
veloper academy and use it to comply with the local content requirement on iPhones.
Aside from production issues, tech companies in In -
donesia also face challenges protecting their intellectual property. A stronger ecosystem to protect intellectual property rights is needed.
For instance, there are concerns that Article 4 of the 
2016 Patent Law could be read to significantly limit the range of products that can be patented in Indonesia and 
made available to Indonesian consumers, including new 
forms of software. More clarification is needed to an -
ticipate the growing number of innovations in the digital 
economy era from both local and international start-ups.   
Enforcement is also weak, which means that regard -
less of existing legal protections, the reality is that it remains very difficult for companies and individuals to 
go after those who infringe on their intellectual property rights. 
In the latest Special 301 Report from the Office of the 
US Trade Representative on the protection of intellectual property rights, Indonesia remains on the priority watch 
list due to the lack of adequate and effective IP protec -
tion and enforcement.A

ith Indonesia home to the fourth-largest population in the world, it’s easy to see why 
the digital economy holds so much promise 
for the country. 
The market value of the country’s digital 
economy could grow almost fourfold from $27 billion in 2018 to at least $100 billion by 2025, according to a study by Google and 
Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek. 
A McKinsey report adds that the sector could produce 3.7 million new jobs by then.
18  
On his first day on the job, Indonesia’s new 
minister for information and communications 
technology (ICT), Johnny G. Plate, said he believed Indonesia could produce more tech 
unicorns and even a hectocorn — a start-up 
valued at $100 billion.
19 
Indonesia definitely has the momentum. 
Between 2014 and 2018, the internet pen -
etration rate grew from 29 percent to 46 percent.
20 In October, just before Widodo’s 
first term as president ended, the massive 
Palapa Ring project was officially launched, 
connecting the capitals of 514 districts and cities across Indonesia to high-speed internet. 
Despite several delays, the amendment 
to the data localization requirements under Government Regulation (GR) No. 82/2012 was also issued after a multi-year process 
of advocacy and discussion. The regulation, 
GR71, removes a key regulatory constraint by allowing private companies, in most cases, 
to maintain their data centers offshore. The 
revision process also showed that the gov -
ernment is increasingly willing to engage and 
listen to industry players. 
Despite this progress, there is still much to 
be done. While Indonesia’s internet penetra -
tion rate is projected to grow to 77 percent 
by 2025, that would still put it behind the 2019 numbers of neighbors like Malaysia at 
80.1 percent and Thailand at 82.2 percent, 
according to figures contained in a 2018 report from the communications ministry. Internet ac -
cess is also uneven, with only 21 percent of people in poor areas connected to the web, in contrast to 91 percent in more affluent regions. 
This disparity has an impact on the coun -
try’s digital literacy, and could be one of the reasons Indonesia is not producing enough 
programmers and tech engineers. With Go -
jek founder Nadiem Makarim heading the 
Ministry of Education and Culture, there is 
optimism that the mismatch between the 
country’s graduates and the jobs of the fu-ture can eventually be reduced. President W

Digital Economy 4.2
Given the potential of Indonesia’s digital economy, the government should take the lead in 
adjusting its regulatory approach to adapt to the sector’s fast-changing needs.  Indonesia’s projected

by 2025, which is still 
behind the 2019 numbers of Malaysia and Thailand
As regulators around the world struggle to keep pace with the needs of the digital 
economy, a progressive approach to data 
governance that redefines how information is accessed in the digital era is winning in -
vestor confidence. 
While it has long been a right for law 
enforcers to demand access to informa -
tion needed for investigations — such as financial records or corporate correspon -
dence — the advent of cloud storage has 
changed the way things work. With more 
and more companies storing their data with third-party providers of digital stor -
age services or data centers, the question of how that information can and should be accessed by law enforcers must be revisit -
ed to keep pace with modern technology. 
If the Corruption Eradication Commis-
sion needs a record of emails exchanged 
between an executive and a government 
official, can they compel a third-party tech company that is merely hosting the data to disclose and decrypt the data? If the police need to access financial records 
involved in a money laundering case, can 
they demand these from the data center where the suspect’s bank stores its infor -
mation? Or should the police only be able to demand this information directly from the bank — as they have done in the past? 
A number of governments around the 
world are now agreeing that how law en -
forcers access data for evidence has to be 
aligned with the new nature of information 
in the digital era. To do so, data centers are being designated as “trusted data zones/
areas,” a neutral space where customers 
can be reassured that law enforcers do not use third-party cloud service providers as 
an inappropriate loophole to access that 
information without legitimate companies having notification. 
The principles underlying these “trust -
ed data zones/areas” recognize that data center operators do not own any of the data entrusted to them for safekeeping. Its customers retain ownership and rights to 
that information. The principles also rec -
ognize that law enforcement access needs 
should be directed at the rightful owners 
of that data, and that governments would 
not demand backdoor access or encryp -
tion keys.
A commitment from the government to 
these principles can already unlock mil -
lions of dollars in potential investments in 
data centers, which would help improve 
Indonesia’s digital infrastructure, and in turn power the growth of smart cities and 
create more unicorns. 
“Analogue ways of doing things have to 
be reviewed to see if they still work in the digital era,” AmCham Managing Director 
A. Lin Neumann said. “It would be difficult for Indonesia to achieve its digital econo -
my goals without progressive policies that recognize that access-to-data rules need to change.”Redefining data access principles for the digital eraWidodo has reportedly asked him to amend the curriculum to ensure that it is flexible enough to keep pace with the changing labor 
market. 
Even with increased access to the inter -
net, cybersecurity and data privacy con -
cerns are holding back consumers from fully 
adopting digital e-commerce and financial services, according to the Indonesian Inter -
net Service Providers Association. This lends urgency to the need for the legislature to pass comprehensive personal data protec -
tion and cybersecurity laws, but ideally after extensive consultation with stakeholders and industry players. 
It is therefore encouraging to hear the 
new ICT minister name among his key pri -
orities the passage of a comprehensive 
personal data protection law, the further development of IT infrastructure, and the 
improvement of digital skills.
In addition, a wider review to identify reg -
ulatory roadblocks to the development of the digital economy is needed, such as those related to data sovereignty, the balance be -
tween data protection and data innovation, the adoption of digital signatures and an -
alogue rules governing data access by law 
enforcement (see related box).
We are hopeful that the new administra -
tion will build on the gains of the past five years and create a a more flexible regulatory 
environment that is comfortable with con -
stant innovation, where new products and 
services like digital platforms and super-apps 
that do not fit into any existing categories will not have to spend years waiting for regula -
tors to catch up with them.

ndonesia’s creative economy could receive a much-needed boost following President 
Widodo’s decision to upgrade the sector’s 
regulator to a ministerial level. The Ministry of Tourism is now the Ministry of Tourism 
and Creative Economy, as it was under the 
administration of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; it is now headed by 
Wishnutama Kusubandio, a former journalist 
and founder of NET TV. 
The move has both advantages and dis-
advantages. Triawan Munaf, the former head of the Indonesian Creative Economy Agency (BEKRAF) during the president’s first term, said the body only acted as a facilitator with 
limited powers. A ministry, on the other hand, 
has the authority to create or remove regu-lations as needed. However, a ministry is also 
often seen as a standalone entity, which can 
make coordination difficult. This means that greater emphasis on coordination among 
government agencies is crucial. 
In his initial interviews, Wishnutama dis-
cussed the needs and potential of the coun -
try’s tourism sector — a key area the govern -
ment wants to develop. The risk, however, I

Intellectual property protection and market access barriers continue to be the two key 
factors constraining investments into this sector.The United States 
was the top export 
destination for 
Indonesia’s creative products at 30.25 
percent in 2018, 
followed by Japan at 6.79 percentis that less attention could be paid to the 
creative economy, which still faces a number 
of challenges.    
Foremost among these challenges is 
copyright protection. While there have been gains over the past few years, it is evident 
there’s more work to do. 
A joint effort by various government 
agencies spearheaded by the ministries of law and human rights and communications and information technology led to the block -
ing of over 480 copyright-infringing websites between 2015 and 2018. These resulted in significant reductions in visits to illegal video 
and music piracy sites, with the second most 
popular site shutting down in November 2018.
21
A report from the Office of the US Trade 
Representative also noted industry-led ef -
forts to develop an Infringing Website List to help prevent the placement of advertise -
ments on such websites. After acceding to 
the Madrid Protocol for the international regis -
tration of trademarks in 2018, it also noted that 
Indonesia has issued implementing regulations.
However, government agencies have so 
far been unable to address “domain hopping,” a common tactic used to evade govern -
ment-ordered site-blocking by redirecting domains. Two of the most popular infringing websites, indoxxi and lk21, frequently change 
their domain names to evade government 
efforts to block them, posing a big threat to the development of the motion picture and 
television industries. 
Aside from this, an article in the Copy -
right Law provides a broad internet exception that could undermine the ability of copyright 
holders to control the manner and means by which they authorize the availability and 
dissemination of their content. 
Criminal case structure and penalties 
under the Copyright Law have also been weakened, with minimum mandatory statu-
tory criminal penalties removed. Article 95 of the law also appears to mandate media -
tion before a piracy case can be prosecuted, leading to fewer prosecutions.
Market access barriers also continue 
to deter foreign investment in the creative economy. Although Indonesia now allows 100 percent foreign direct investment in the production of films and sound recordings, as well as in film distribution and exhibition, the US trade report notes that content restric -
tions continue to undermine growth. Planned implementing regulations to the 2009 Film Law include a local film screen quota of 
60 percent, which negatively impacts film 
distribution due to a lack of local films with wide audience appeal. Even the Association 
of Indonesian Film Producers (APROFI) does 
not support the quota.
22 
In terms of local content production, the 
industry is hampered by the usual prob -
lems related to skilled workers and access to funding. Few formal educational institu -
tions cater to the needs of creative indus-tries, while the entrepreneurs and SMEs that venture into the sector often struggle 
with limited access to capital. According to 
BEKRAF and Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data in 2017, many of these SMEs are not eligible 
for financial loans because they are neither 
registered as limited liability companies nor possess intellectual property rights.
23 
While foreign investments in movie 
screens have gone up as a result of the re -
moval of film distribution from the negative investment list in 2016, film production has 
not taken off. A complex and cumbersome 
series of regulations, censorship hurdles, conflicting ministries to deal with and a deep 
suspicion of foreign filmmakers have combined 
to keep Indonesia an unattractive destination for Hollywood productions. It is hoped that 
the new ministry can streamline what could 
be an important source of both revenue and skills transfer for the local industry — not to 
mention showcase Indonesia’s natural beauty 
for Hollywood audiences. 
US companies are eager to support In -
donesia’s creative economy, and in fact the United States was the top export destination for Indonesia’s creative products — such as 
fashion, crafts and food products — at 30.25 
percent in 2018, followed by Japan at 6.79 percent.

n the back of Indonesia’s impressive effort to 
bring hundreds of millions of people under 
the national health insurance scheme, the 
country’s pharmaceutical sector saw a strong 8.3 percent compounded annual growth rate 
between 2014 and 2018 — a competitive per -

during the same period.
25  
This same strong growth, however, was 
not reflected in foreign investment numbers, despite government efforts to develop local manufacturing for active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (API). From 2013 to 2017, invest -

of generic and over-the-counter medicine, 
as well as traditional treatments, declined by 
5 percent CAGR. 
The downward trend was seen even after 2016, when the government opened up API manufacturing to 100 percent foreign own -
ership in order to reduce imports. While that move may have brought in a few millions of dollars of investments to establish API fac -
tories, bigger challenges and considerations are weighing down investor decisions.
As with other industries, most modern 
medicines are manufactured through a global supply chain linking key production centers in various parts of the world. In terms of API 
— the raw materials that go into a drug — 
India and China dominate the global mar -

Indonesians can gain tremendous benefits from leading health care innovations around 
the world if regulatory constraints to foreign investment in this sector are eased.Indonesia's 
pharmaceutical 
sector saw a 
strong 8.3 percent compounded 
annual growth rate 
from 2014-2018cus its attention on developing its clinical 
research sector. In 2018 alone, $179 billion 
was spent globally on clinical research and 
development, and this figure is expected to grow to $213 billion by 2024.
27
Indonesia hardly gets a share of this 
spending because it has regulated itself out 
of the market. In addition to a lack of trained 
and experienced clinical researchers and doctors, there are crippling prohibitions — 
known as Material Transfer Agreements — on 
local blood samples being exported or ana -
lyzed abroad. In effect, Indonesians cannot 
participate in global clinical research trials.  
While the Ministry of Health asked the 
pharmaceutical industry association three years ago to create a road map for clinical 
research in Indonesia, no subsequent steps to implement it have since been taken. 
There is renewed optimism among inves-
tors that the new health minister, Dr. Terawan Agus Putranto, who is known for conducting 
his own research into new treatments for 
stroke patients, will recognize the impor -
tance of clinical research for Indonesia and 
lead efforts to build an environment that is 
conducive for this. 
These issues, however, again just concern 
Indonesia’s ability to attract new investment. Equally, if not more, important to investors is regulatory certainty once they are operating 
in the country. 
For example, bureaucratic procedures 
involved in the introduction of new medical products — ranging from getting permits to 
importing and distribution — have discour -
aged foreign pharmaceutical companies 
from bringing in innovative health solutions 
that could otherwise benefit Indonesians. 
Two major laws introduced over the past 
five years—the 2014 Halal Law and the 2016 Patent Law—have also raised substantial concerns over certain provisions and creat -
ed regulatory uncertainty that has discouraged further investment. These issues were partially addressed after years of discussions between 
government officials, industry stakeholders and 
associations like AmCham Indonesia. 
The Halal Law, which went into effect in 
October 2019, mandates that all pharmaceu -ticals and medical devices be certified halal, 
or permissible under Islam. Fortunately, the 
law’s implementing regulations include grace periods of up to 15 years before all drug and 
medical device manufacturers have to com -
ply. Rules on recognizing certifications by 
foreign halal bodies were also eased. With 
active debate still under way on the full im -
plementation of the Halal Law, it is too early 
to analyze the full impact it may have on the 
health care industry. 
While more clarity is needed in terms of 
how the grace period will be implemented, the fact remains that the Halal Law could 
impede the ability of Indonesians to access the best treatments available. Some critical 
drugs and vaccines do contain porcine en -
zymes and it is unlikely that drug companies 
will be able — or willing — to develop entirely 
new products just for the Indonesian mar -
ket. There are concerns halal certifications 
could dictate treatment options, instead of 
a drug’s suitability or efficacy. While non-ha -
lal products may still be sold under the law, 
the requirement to label such products as 
non-halal is expected to have major market 
repercussions.
For the Patent Law, the Ministry of Law 
and Human Rights is preparing an academic paper to serve as the basis for an amend -
ment to be tabled in parliament next year 
that would hopefully correct onerous local

owered by a young population with a growing 
middle class, Indonesia’s financial services 
sector could be poised for significant growth. 
For decades, the story of the financial 
services sector in Southeast Asia’s largest economy has been one of underperfor -
mance: banking and insurance penetration 
rates were among the lowest in the region, 
capital markets were underdeveloped and 
financial illiteracy was high. 
As of 2017, less than 40 percent of Indo -
nesia’s adult population had a bank account, less than 7 percent had credit cards and only 2.5 percent owned insurance policies. The In -
donesian stock market only accounted for 47 percent of GDP in 2018, compared to 113 per -
cent for Malaysia and 98 percent for Thailand.
28  
But market conditions are changing, with a 
fast-growing middle class demanding growth in both personal and corporate financial ser -
vices. From 2017 to 2018 alone, peer-to-peer 
lending platforms say they have witnessed a 680 percent increase in disbursed loans to 
$1.4 billion.
29 
Our interviews with key stakeholders re -
veal that progressive policymaking respond -
ing to the changing nature of the industry and reflecting well-tested global experience 
will help ensure that financial services will 
meet demand. This means addressing com -
plex and ever-increasing regulations and 
protectionist policies that have been keep -
ing investors away and constraining growth. 
It also means increasing financial literacy, 
such as by educating the public regarding 
the required mindset change on insurance from the no-longer-viable belief in “family 
protection” to trusted, well-regulated “insti -
tutional protection.”
According to Fitch Ratings, for instance, 
cumbersome regulations mean that bond 
issuance in Indonesia normally takes six months, as opposed to two to three weeks in 
countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. P

Financial Services 4.5
Increasing financial inclusion and financial literacy in Indonesia begins with providing in -
vestors the regulatory environment they need to safely operate and grow. Powered by a young population 
with a growing middle class, Indonesia’s financial services 
sector could be poised for 
significant growth.
In the capital-intensive insurance industry, 
the 80 percent cap on foreign ownership30  
makes it difficult for multinational firms to 
enter Indonesia, because of difficulties in 
finding a suitable local partner. The cap also makes it difficult for the company to even -
tually grow, since the local partner might not be able to support the additional capital re -
quirements – persistent challenges that have 
been confirmed in our interviews.
Existing local licenses, held by companies 
holding out for offers from potential foreign investors, can be very expensive. Often, ma -
jor issues in terms of professionalism and 
quality of operations are hidden during dis-
cussions, requiring a detailed understanding 
of a potential partnership that could con -
tribute to the 20 percent local ownership 
requirement. The lengthy return-on-invest -
ment period involved also attracts little inter -
est from other Indonesian entities.
From 2016, Indonesian insurers have also 
been required to reinsure all “simple risks” 
— life insurance and most property and ca -
sualty insurance — only with domestic rein -
surers. While the move was aimed at helping develop the local industry — another “local 
content” requirement — it has instead raised 
overall risk by forcing companies to retro -
cede their businesses to those with lower 
credit ratings, low capitalization and ques -
tionable transparency. 
A sustainable approach would focus on 
building a skilled workforce that is ready to 
respond to the growing needs of financial services companies. There are only about 
200-300 certified actuaries in Indonesia, a 
figure that is growing slowly,
31 but work per -
mits for foreign workers have been limited and difficult to secure. While the government has been easing work permit regulations for expatriates in general, these efforts have not 
yet extended to the insurance sector. 
Policies that create a more organic in -
crease in demand will also contribute to sounder development. A strictly enforced 
mandatory third-party insurance coverage requirement, such as third-party liability au -
tomobile insurance for example, would help fuel the growth of the industry. It would not only increase appreciation and demand for 
insurance products in general, it would also 
create a more secure environment for the general public.
Finally, ensuring that all these financial 
services have a safe space to grow through the passage of sound data protection and 
cybersecurity regulations is critical both 
from the consumer’s and investor’s per -
spectives. Multinational financial services 
companies have to be assured that the local 
companies they work with have sufficient data protection policies in place, and that they can 
easily move data across borders as needed.  
President Widodo’s first term saw a 
marked improvement in consultative policy -
making, such as in accommodating the views 
of the private sector on the implementing regulations of the 2014 Insurance Law. Fi -
nancial regulators have also been open to new technologies such as cloud storage and blockchain, and created regulatory sandbox -
es to test innovative fintech solutions. If the same approach can be applied and amplified to other issues in the financial services sec -
tor, the next five years could see tremen -
dous progress toward Indonesia’s financial inclusion goals.

Agriculture 4.6
Addressing the sector’s fundamental issues, like low productivity and limited land and labor resources, in addition to reliable production data and ensuring a fair playing field, 
are needed to encourage investment.trengthening the agriculture sector has al -
ways been a priority for President Widodo. 
In 2016, the government eased foreign in -
vestment rules in the sector. Over the past 
five years, it worked on improving irrigation 
infrastructure, increased farmer subsidies for 
seeds and fertilizers, and provided modern farming tools to increase productivity. 
And the efforts appear to have been pay -
ing off: Between 2010 and 2017, the sector’s GDP grew an average of 3.7 percent per year, 
according to BKPM, exceeding the govern -
ment target of 3.5 percent.
24 From 2013 to 
2017, investment in the sector also grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 23 percent.  
But significant challenges remain, accord -
ing to industry players, which could affect the country’s capacity to attract further in -
vestment in agriculture. 
One recurring issue  is the lack of reli -
able and accurate data on production and 
consumption of agricultural products, which often leads to misguided policies in terms of 
import quotas or restrictions that then lead 
to shortages and price spikes. 
Is there enough corn produced domesti -
cally to supply industry and consumers? The government says yes and restricts imports; industry says no and is frustrated by barriers 
to imports. The net result? Investments have 
been cancelled that require an assured sup -
ply of corn as a raw material. In one recent 
instance, the government imposed restric -
tions on corn imports after the Ministry of 
Agriculture claimed the country had a sur -
plus.
33 However, this claim was later found 
to have been based on faulty data, leaving 
companies short of supply for the domestic 
feed industry. The same problem has been seen in rice and other food products, with 
each case ending in a pledge from govern -
ment officials to address the data issue. 
Underneath this persistent problem is the 
desire to be self-sufficient in food production 
without addressing underlying productivity issues like land supply and technology. The 
result has instead been food supply instabili -
ty that ends up hurting consumers. Self-suf -
ficiency may sound good as a slogan but giv -
en interconnected global supply chains and 
scarce arable land as urbanization increases, it is both impractical and virtually impossible 
for most countries to attain.Indonesia’s crop and livestock productiv -
ity remains significantly low due to the lack 
of research and development, as well as slow adoption of modern farming techniques.
34
Bigger challenges, however, include the 
declining amount of land and labor resources 
for the sector. While agriculture continues to 
be Indonesia’s biggest employer, research has shown a shift in the structure of the sector’s 
workforce as farmers age and youth show 
little interest in farming. 
Data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS) also 
shows that land available for farming de -
clined by 8.4 percent in 2018 from 7.1 mil -
lion hectares a year earlier, as farmers sell 
their land for industrial purposes. While ag -
ricultural land is still available outside Java, 
food production is still heavily dependent on 
crops from Java, which has the most fertile 
soil. Farming in the regions also comes with higher risks due to logistical difficulties.
Improvements are also needed to the 
traditional agriculture value chain, which involves multiple informal intermediaries 
between farmers and consumers that lead 
to higher costs — in other words, powerful and shadowy domestic cartels that control 
production and prices illegally. Supporting 
infrastructure for food products is also in short supply, especially cold storage facilities 
for processed meat and seafood. 
For example, Indonesia’s seafood industry 
requires 14 million tons of cold storage ca -
pacity per year, almost double the current 
capacity of 7.5 million tons. Although the government has relaxed foreign investment 
rules for cold storage, foreign companies 
have been hesitant to enter the market due to infrastructure issues, such as unstable 
electricity supply and an underdeveloped 
road network, especially outside Java.
35
Consistent with the findings in other sec -
tors, government efforts to attract investors 
into the agriculture industry have so far fo -
cused on the entry phase — easing permits 
and licenses, as well as foreign investment 
caps. It is now time to pay more attention 
to fundamental operational needs, like labor and productivity issues, in addition to trust -
worthy production data, addressing domes-tic cartels that restrain trade, and ensuring 
the fair playing field that would provide busi -
ness certainty over the longer term.S

he past few months saw two of the biggest 
regulatory issues facing the consumer goods 
industry achieve some resolution: the pas-
sage of the new Water Resources Law, and 
the issuance of the implementing decree for the 2014 Halal Law. 
In September, the House of Representa -
tives passed the new Water Resources Law, ending years of legal uncertainty created by 
cancellation of the 2004 Water Law by the 
Constitutional Court in 2015. The new law aims to create a better balance between the 
constitutional need to recognize water as 
a public commodity, and the needs of the business community to access this resource 
to provide the public with other basic needs. 
It achieves this by still allowing private 
businesses to access surplus local water supply, after the needs of state enterprises 
are met, and only upon receiving licenses from relevant government bodies. Earlier plans 
to require companies to allocate 10 percent 
of their profits to water conservation were dropped, showing that the government is lis-
tening to the inputs of the business community. 
The next challenge is ensuring a similar 
consultative process will be adopted in the drafting of the implementing decree for the 
new law.
The sweeping 2014 Halal Law has also 
raised significant concerns over increased regulatory burdens and higher compliance costs for a wide range of companies. But 
after years of consultations and discussions, 
the implementing regulation from the Minis-try of Religious Affairs was finally signed on 
Oct. 16, just a day before the law was due to 
formally come into effect. 
The government showed considerable 
flexibility in addressing the implementation of the new law, working with industry to adopt a phased approach that should give companies 
time to adjust to the new environment. 
Unfortunately, the initial phase of halal 
implementation under the government’s new Halal Certification Body has been marked by confusion and a lack of capacity, according 
to numerous companies and other stake -
holders. Companies have been faced with 
looming deadlines and a massive new bu -
reaucracy that may not be ready. The old 
system, under the Indonesian Council of 
Ulema (MUI), has not been fully integrated 
into this new official agency, and in the ini -
tial phases companies are having difficulty 
registering new products.
There are already requests from industry 
for the government to step in to avoid any economic setbacks from the implementation 
of one of the most all-encompassing halal regulations in the world. There are also con -
cerns over exactly how cross-certifications from foreign halal bodies will work. Timelines have been written into the regulation but 
questions remain. More ministerial decrees 
are expected to outline which food, beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products must 
be certified halal, and by when.   
These regulatory issues complicate an op -
erating environment for consumer goods com -
panies already facing consumer headwinds. 
At the start of the year, perhaps buoyed 
by the election season, 75 percent of respon -
dents in a survey by Nielsen said they were 
more optimistic about their financial condition compared to five years ago.
36 But for the most 
part, consumers are still holding back spending 
on fast-moving consumer goods and allocat -
ing more of their budgets to transportation, 
education, health care and savings or loans. 
The threat of slower sales growth is com -
pounded by import restrictions on certain commodities used as raw materials, as well 
as higher import tariffs imposed last year on 
more than a thousand consumer goods. 
While Finance Minister Sri Mulyani In -
drawati said the policy was issued to ad -
dress the country’s ballooning trade deficit, she agreed earlier this year to review it if it 
disrupted the supply chain for exports — a 
concern raised by local and foreign industry players alike.

fter a challenging decade as Indonesia sought to redefine its relationship with its extractive 
industries, prospects for the mining and oil 
and gas sectors may be looking up, partic -
ularly as strong commodity prices globally 
helped boost the industry in 2018.  
President Widodo began his new term 
indicating he is dedicated to removing con -
straints to new investments and arresting the 
continuous decline in the country’s oil and gas production. The coordinating minister 
for maritime affairs and investment, as well 
as the energy and mineral resources minis-ter have both been told to help reduce the 
country’s oil and gas imports — and conse -
quently the trade deficit — by raising domes -
tic oil and gas production levels. 
Environment and Forestry Minister Siti 
Nurbaya Bakar also said the president asked 
her to support a massive deregulation package 
comprising 74 laws to boost investment with -
out abandoning environmental preservation.  
These are challenging but not impossible tasks. Indonesia’s proven oil and gas reserves are 
still globally significant, according to the In -
donesian Petroleum Association, and half of the basins in the country have yet to be explored. 
Indonesia’s mineral resources are likewise 
still considered superior to those of many other countries. However, practically no ex -
ploration is being done, largely due to laws 
that call for forced local processing and di -
vestment. Indonesia received less than 2.5 
percent of the global exploration budget 
from 2006 to 2014, and just around 1 percent 
from 2015 to 2018.
38  
Clearly, Indonesia’s natural resources are 
still attractive, and there are global inves -
tors keen on helping Indonesia maximize the potential of these resources. But our 
interviews with key stakeholders show the 
country’s regulatory environment is a major stumbling block.

of investors, making Indonesia less attractive 
as an investment destination compared to 
other countries.39  
In mining, continuing uncertainty regard -
ing exports and the mandatory processing of mineral ore, contract extensions and divestments have muted interest by many 
new investors and led some major players 
to leave, such as Newmont, which sold its stake in the Batu Hijau mine in 2016 to a local 
group, partly due to government pressure to 
build a smelter and other issues. 
While mining companies can be estab -
lished with 100 percent foreign ownership, the mandatory divestment required by the 2009 Mining Law during the 5th to 10th years 
of operations at unclear valuations creates a 
big risk for multinationals to undertake.
40 Ad-
ditionally, the divestment requirement could 
also result in higher costs to the government 
for environmental rehabilitation after explo -
ration/exploitation.41 The huge investment 
required to build a modern mine calls for 
long-term certainty, which Indonesia has 
been unable to grant. 
The inconsistent policies over the years 
regarding a ban on exports of mineral ore to support the development of a domestic processing industry have also contributed 
greatly to the uncertain environment. In the 
latest iteration, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has announced that In -
donesia will stop nickel exports beginning Jan. 1, 2020 — two years ahead of schedule — to ensure continuing local supply for new 
smelters being constructed.  
In an industry that operates under long-
term plans spanning at least 10-15 years, these frequent policy changes again create 
a level of uncertainty. 
The slowdown in the oil and gas and 
mining sectors has also significantly hit the heavy machinery industry, which is grappling with its own set of regulatory issues. Most 
heavy equipment companies in Indonesia 
are factories catering to both domestic and export demand. However, regulations on the 
import of required parts are often either in -
consistent or subject to frequent and sudden 
changes. Often, the non-tariff barrier to im -
port spare parts and components is linked to local industries making similar products. However, in many cases the local products do not meet international companies’ quality and/or quantity demands.
Dwelling times at Indonesian ports still av -
erage 3.45 days — longer than the 2.3 days in Vietnam and Thailand and 1.5 days in Malay -
sia
42— creating an issue for exporters. Worse, 
Indonesia’s port handling fees total $9,627 on 
average, more expensive than $5,052 in Singa -
pore, $4,493 in Manila and $5,511 in Hong Kong.43 
Industry players do, however, recognize the 
efforts made by the government to partially 
ease the regulatory burden over the past few 
years. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has revoked more than 180 reg -
ulations, leading to an improvement in Indo -
nesia’s performance in the Fraser Institute’s 2018 Investment Attractiveness Index from 
84th (out of 91) to rank 70th (out of 83). 
Industry players have also noted the gov -
ernment’s increased efforts to discuss issues with them before making policy decisions. 
But these efforts only remove a small chunk from the boulder of regulatory issues that 
investors see when they look at Indonesia. 
Though the government has increased 
efforts at consultation, little of the industry feedback is reflected in the actual policies 
and regulations issued. While the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is making an 
effort to listen to companies, inconsistences 
are also found in the implementation of reg -
ulations between the central and local gov -
ernments, and even between ministries. The net result is that Indonesia is losing out on tens of billions of dollars in potential foreign 
investment in both oil and gas and mining. 
In fact, regulatory uncertainty has long 
been raised by industry players as the key problem in the mining and oil and gas sec -
tors. With the government’s renewed thrust 
to bring investors back in, we are cautiously 
hopeful that this concern will truly be heard. 
There are numerous pending major invest -
ments, some of which we noted as far back 
our 2013 investment report, which could yet 
be realized — if companies are given clear and fair rules and the opportunity to operate 
free from the threat of forced divestment or 
the potential premature loss of concessions before a fair return on investment is real -
ized. Unfortunately, by the very nature of the business, companies do not like to discuss their future plans in public, nor to disclose 
investments that were not made.

in office with a clear focus on economic and

economy.
“Our dream is that by 2045, Indonesia’s 
gross domestic product will have reached $7 trillion. Indonesia will have become one of 
the top five world economies with a poverty 
rate nearing zero percent,” the president said in his inauguration speech. “That is what we 
must head toward.”
With the five priorities he outlined all re -
lated to economic and bureaucratic reform, it is clear the president recognizes the crucial 
role of the business community in achieving this dream. Developing Indonesia’s human re -
sources to create a better skilled workforce, continuing the construction of much-need -
ed infrastructure, simplifying or cutting down 
unconstructive regulations, massive reform 
of the bureaucracy, and economic transfor -
mation toward a modern manufacturing and 
service-based economy are all important 
initiatives that would address many of the concerns raised by investors.
To contribute to the government’s reform 
efforts, we would like to add our assessment of the challenges faced by investors in Indo -
nesia today. Across various sectors, we found a number of similar underlying issues: the need to systematize consultations with key stake -
holders and regulatory impact assessments, to improve coordination and communications between government bodies, and to focus 
on long-term goals over short-term gains.

tion and commu-
nications between 
government bodies.
Focus on long-term goals over 
short-term gains.The president has raised the need for public consultations several times before, and a 
number of government agencies have shown improvement in this regard.44 But consisten -
cy in implementation could be strengthened by systematizing the consultation process, 
such as through a government regulation, similar to what advanced countries like the US 
and Japan do. 
In fact, according to the OECD, the public notice-and-comment system is seen as 
particularly important for lower-level rules and regulations, because it provides scrutiny of the regulatory processes inside ministries.
45 It not only leads to better regulations, but 
also improves compliance and reduces enforcement costs.
The government should regularly conduct assessments of the real impact of new reg -
ulations before signing them. Many well-meaning regulations have created unintended 
consequences because of a lack of comprehensive understanding of their wide-ranging 
impact. Regulatory impact assessments, which, according to the World Bank, are recog -
nized by most developed countries as a key instrument to improve the quality of regulatory 
decision-making, involves conducting cost-benefit analyses and recognizing that doing 
nothing or maintaining the status quo are available options as well.
The Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) recognizes this need and 
agrees it would be good if Indonesia had a designated task force assigned to oversee the links between existing and new regulations, and to analyze the overall impact of new regulations on the country as a whole.
46 In other countries, task forces such as this exist 
as government bodies dedicated to this function. Indonesia could demonstrate its com -
mitment to reform by following suit.
Across various industries, this issue is consistent and has been communicated regularly to AmCham by member companies. The clear delineation of responsibilities between 
government bodies is needed because inconsistent implementation even of good regula -
tions can diminish positive results. Ministries still produce regulations that contradict each 
other, the tax regulator and the sector regulators often disagree on the interpretation of 
tax rules, one ministry will refuse to issue a permit for a project that another government 
agency has cleared, or the local government will release new regulations that contradict those from the central government.
The role of the coordinating ministries becomes more important in this regard. It is 
encouraging to hear the president give his new coordinating ministers the power to veto regulations within their domain that contravene the policies of the president or other 
ministries.
47
This is a good start that could eliminate many of the inconsistencies that unnecessarily 
increase the burden on business players. We hope a similar approach can be adopted to improve the consistency between the central government and local governments as well.
A common observation by industry players and analysts alike is how policymaking in Indo -
nesia is often “reactive” to needs and issues, instead of being based on plans for the future.
Long-term planning for policymaking, for example, would have led the government 
earlier on to draw up a progressive education reform program to anticipate the workforce 
needs of the future instead of clinging to an outmoded curriculum that leaves students 
unprepared for today’s world.
With the government’s focus on 2045, we are optimistic again that long-term planning 
would guide policymaking moving forward, laying the groundwork for sustainable pros-perity in the decades to come.1

Next StepsArmed with a fresh mandate, President Widodo’s second term has 
the opportunity to put in place meaningful reforms that could guide Indonesia out of the middle-income trap before its centennial in 2045. 
To do this will require vision, political courage and a willingness to 
challenge current corrupt practices, special interests and entrenched bureaucracy. 
“In a world that is full of risk, very dynamic and very competitive, 
we have to continue to develop new methods, new values. We should 
not get stuck in a monotonous routine,” the president said during his 
inauguration.  
We look forward to these new methods and new values from 
the Indonesian government. As they have over the past century, US companies will be here and be ready to invest time, ideas, new 
technology and money to support Indonesia’s development goals in 
ways that make a significant and lasting impact.

Next StepsAnnexMethodology to 
Estimate Oil & Gas Investments from Each Country
The official foreign direct investment (FDI) 
statistics per country from the Indonesia In -
vestment Coordinating Board (BKPM) does not include the oil and gas (O&G) sector be -
cause this type of data was not available until 
January 2019.
Prior to 2017, the responsibility for record -
ing investments in the O&G sector fell under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 
(MEMR), which had the authority to license projects. However, it only recorded invest -
ments per project, and not in terms of the source country.
At the beginning of 2017, this task was 
delegated to BKPM under MEMR Regulation No. 14/2017. BKPM subsequently requested the Upstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Special 
Task Force (SKK Migas) to start recording in -
vestments by country, which the latter began 
doing in January 2019.
To come up with the investment figures 
in the oil and gas sector, we adopted the following approaches: 
1. To provide a fair comparison, we ex -
cluded investments made in the explora -
tion stage, because there is little-to-no recent exploration activity in Indonesia 
and the majority of current oil production 
(and investment) is from existing fields.48  
2. Following consultations with SKK Migas, 
we decided to use O&G production figures as a proxy to determine the contribution 
of each country to upstream O&G invest -
ments. This is because most upstream in -
vestment goes to production, ranging from approximately 50 to 70 percent (taken 
from the years 2013 – 2017), while the rest goes to other activities such as devel -
opment, exploration and administration.  
3. We also took into account the time period 
for an upstream investment to be realized in the production stage. According to O&G experts, this could take approximately two 
to three years for existing fields and up to six 
years for a new field.
49 Therefore, the propor -
tion of O&G production and the top produc -
ers in each subsector are taken two years after the investment period. This means we used the 2015 numbers for O&G production 
and top producers to derive the upstream 
investment in 2013.48 https://sumatra.bisnis.com/
