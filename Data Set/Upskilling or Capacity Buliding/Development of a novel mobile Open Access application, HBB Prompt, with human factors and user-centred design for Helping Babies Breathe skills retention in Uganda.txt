Abstract 
Background: Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is a life ‑saving program that has helped reduce neonatal morbidity and 
mortality, but knowledge and skills retention after training remains a significant challenge for sustainability of impact. 
User ‑centred design (UCD) can be used to develop solutions to target knowledge and skills maintenance.
Methods: We applied a process of UCD beginning with understanding the facilitators of, and barriers to, learning 
and retaining HBB knowledge and skills. HBB Master Trainers and frontline HBB providers participated in a series of 
focus group discussions (FGDs) to uncover the processes of skills acquisition and maintenance to develop a mobile 
application called “HBB Prompt” . Themes derived from each FGD were identified and implications for development 
of the HBB Prompt app were explored, including feasibility of incorporating strategies into the format of an app. Data 
analysis took place after each iteration in Phase 1 to incorporate feedback and improve subsequent versions of HBB 
Prompt.
Results: Six HBB trainers and seven frontline HBB providers participated in a series of FGDs in Phase 1 of this study. 
Common themes included lack of motivation to practise, improving confidence in ventilation skills, ability to achieve 
the Golden Minute, fear of forgetting knowledge or skills, importance of feedback, and peer ‑to‑peer learning. Themes 
identified that were not feasible to address pertained to health system challenges. Feedback about HBB Prompt was 
generally positive. Based on initial and iterative feedback, HBB Prompt was created with four primary functions: Train‑
ing Mode, Simulation Mode, Quizzes, and Dashboard/Scoreboard.
Conclusions: Developing HBB Prompt with UCD to help improve knowledge and skills retention was feasible and 
revealed key concepts, including drivers for successes and challenges faced for learning and maintaining HBB skills. 
HBB Prompt will be piloted in Phase 2 of this study, where knowledge and skills retention after HBB training will be 
compared between an intervention group with HBB Prompt and a control group without the app.

Background
Despite a significant reduction in global neonatal mortal -
ity from 1990 through 2018, approximately 2.5 million 
newborns die annually. These newborn deaths represent 
nearly half of the 5.3 million children under five who die 
each year [1]. The proportion of newborns who contrib -
ute to under-five mortality has been growing and the gap 
between reduction of childhood and infant mortality is 
rising. This is because strategies for newborn mortality 
reduction are challenging to implement [2]. The top three 
causes of newborn deaths continue to be prematurity, 
intrapartum-related events, and infection [2]. Approxi -
mately 10% of babies require help after birth in high-
resource settings, compared with 15% in low-resource 
settings [3, 4]. Skilled personnel who can resuscitate 
babies immediately after delivery save lives [5, 6]. Stand -
ardized training through the Helping Babies Breathe 
(HBB) program has been shown to improve newborn 
resuscitation skills [7, 8].
The HBB curriculum, currently in its second edition 
(HBB 2.0), was designed to train frontline health pro -
viders in low-resource settings to provide life-saving 
interventions for newborns [9]. HBB has been taught in 
over 80 countries and has been shown to reduce neona -
tal mortality and morbidity [10]. HBB training materi -
als are standardized with a flowchart that illustrates the 
steps in the HBB algorithm, accompanied by a facilitator 
flip chart that provides all the teaching prompts for HBB 
workshop delivery. The training program emphasizes 
the practice of individual steps, key skills, and integra -
tion of skills into the delivery setting through simulation. 
Illustrations and a green-yellow–red colour scheme are 
used to visually guide providers through the HBB algo -
rithm. In Uganda, the HBB program has been deployed 
with the help of international health implementing part -
ners in collaboration with the Ministry of Health due 
to the relatively high costs of HBB training [11]. One of 
the most essential skills HBB teaches is how to ventilate 
a newborn struggling to breathe, and to start doing so 
within one minute after birth, referred to as the Golden 
Minute. Skills deterioration after initial training is a sig -
nificant barrier to sustained impact of programs like HBB 
[12]. Low dose high frequency (LDHF) practice, use of 
simulation, refresher training, and supportive supervi -
sion are strategies that help reduce the decay of skills 
over time [13–17]. However, implementing initial train -
ing, refresher training, and supportive supervision are 
all costly and resource intensive, particularly in settings where births occur at smaller facilities in rural commu -
nities spread out over a large geographic region [11]. 
Since 2010, the Ugandan Ministry of Health alongside 
implementing partners have been scaling up training for 
healthcare workers who look after newborns across the 
country using the HBB program. As of 2014, HBB was 
offered in more than 40% of health facilities [18].
Mobile health solutions have been increasingly popular 
as smart devices are ubiquitous. Their rate of ownership 
in low- and middle-income countries has grown expo -
nentially, with over 5 billion unique users worldwide in 
2019 [19], making it especially attractive when designing 
solutions aiming to reach large audiences [20]. In 2018, 
there were 19.8 million unique mobile phone users in 
Uganda, with half of these subscribers using the inter -
net on their mobile phones [21]. This represents mobile 
internet penetration in 23% of the population. Of these 
users, only 16% had a smart phone compared with the 
average of 30% of users having smart phones in Sub-
Saharan Africa [21]. Mobile applications have been tested 
in numerous settings within healthcare and medical edu -
cation with varying success. Thoughtful development to 
optimize usability and utility for the target population is 
important [22–24]. Design processes with iterative pro -
totyping have been successfully used to develop mobile 
apps for various purposes, such as supporting lifestyle 
interventions for cardiovascular health [25], clinical 
decision-making for osteoporosis treatment [26], and 
self-management for dementia patients [27]. Apps tar -
geted towards newborn health [28–34] have been cre -
ated and evaluated previously, some employing UCD, but 
none have informed their design by exploring the cogni -
tive processes of learning newborn resuscitation skills. 
Understanding the underlying preferences, perceptions, 
facilitators and barriers that drive behaviours can help 
tailor the development of features and functions of apps 
[25, 35, 36]. Applying UCD and assessing human factors 
during the development of a mobile app can enhance 
user experience and increase the effectiveness of the tool.
In this paper we describe the UCD process of the devel -
opment a mobile app (HBB Prompt) to improve knowl -
edge and skills retention after initial HBB training.
Methods
Study overview
The study was conducted at Mbarara University of Sci -
ence and Technology (MUST) in southwestern Uganda.

Prompt. More details regarding the entire study can be 
found in the protocol paper [37]. Further details includ -
ing the focus group discussion (FGD) guides for Phase 1 
can be found in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2.
Objectives
The overall objectives of the study were to apply a UCD 
framework to develop a mobile app to enhance HBB 
knowledge and skills maintenance (Phase 1) and to test 
its effectiveness in a pilot setting (Phase 2). The objective 
of Phase 1a of the study was to understand the facilita -
tors and barriers to learning and maintaining HBB skills 
for providers with varying levels of experience with 
newborn resuscitation. Information from Phase 1a was 
incorporated into modifications of HBB Prompt version 
0 (v0) to create version 1 (v1), which was used in Phase 
1b UCD testing. Subsequently, the objective for Phase 
1b was to evaluate how HBB Prompt v1 does or does not 
meet the needs of HBB users and how it could be feasibly 
improved prior to pilot testing in Phase 2 of this study. 
See Fig. 1.
Participant recruitment
Participants for Phase 1 were recruited by letter from 
a register of previously HBB-trained healthcare work -
ers who reside and care for newborns in southwestern Uganda. Participants who responded and who were able 
to attend the scheduled FGD sessions were included in 
the study. Inclusion criteria for the first focus group was 
any healthcare provider with HBB trainer experience (i.e. 
received previous training in HBB and also completed 
the HBB Master Trainer Course) allowing them to teach 
the HBB curriculum. Inclusion criteria for the second 
focus group was frontline providers who had previously 
received HBB training.
Phase 1: mobile app development
HBB Prompt v0 development
Study co-investigators collectively used their knowledge 
and experience with the HBB program, resuscitation 
education, and mobile app development to create foun -
dational features of HBB Prompt v0. In particular, we 
sought to leverage strategies that have previously been 
shown to improve skills retention, including LDHF prac -
tice, use of simulation, refresher training, and supportive 
supervision [10, 38, 39]. This provided a framework for 
our two software developers to build features of the app 
that we anticipated HBB trainers and providers would 
request. The basic functions that were identified as most 
important were: training videos and information portal, 
self-practice mode and group simulation mode, knowl -
edge assessments, and a practice dashboard.

Fig. 1 Overview of HBB Prompt study. The HBB Prompt study is divided into Phase 1, where there were iterative UCD cycles to develop HBB Prompt 
and Phase 2, where the HBB Prompt app will be piloted. During Phase 1, HBB trainers formed one focus group (FGD 1) and HBB providers formed 
the second focus group (FGD 2). Each group went through Phase 1a and 1b separately to facilitate UCD of HBB PromptPage 4 of 15 Chan et al. BMC Med Inform Decis Mak           (2021) 21:39 
The HBB Prompt app is an Android-based application 
that can run on smart devices with an Android Operating 
System, Version 4.0.3 and above. The Android platform 
was chosen due to lower cost and higher penetration of 
Android devices in Uganda and other low- and middle-
income countries. The app was designed using Android 
Studio 3.0, an Integrated Development Environment pro -
vided by Google for design and development of Android 
apps. HBB Prompt, once installed, does not require inter -
net connectivity; however, when internet connectivity 
is detected, it automatically logs usage data to a remote 
Linode server, which it maps according to device Inter -
national Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEIs). Usage 
data tracked does not require runtime or dangerous 
permissions and therefore users do not need to be con -
cerned about access to potentially sensitive data on their 
accounts. The app does not have access to audio or video 
recording, the camera function, or location data. Usage 
data recorded include user identification, date and time 
of login, time spent on each page of the app, and scores 
on quizzes or simulations. The app is designed to solely 
track in-app use, which is intended for education and 
practice only and not for direct patient care. The logged 
data can later be exported in comma-separated values 
(csv) format for further analysis.
Phase 1a
Two separate focus groups underwent the same sequence 
of exploratory activities: discussion of personal experi -
ences with newborn resuscitation, facilitators and barri -
ers to learning HBB knowledge and skills, perceptions of 
the timeline in acquisition of knowledge and skills, and 
generation of ideas on how to maintain and sustain HBB 
knowledge and skills. The composition of each focus 
group was primarily divided by HBB training experience 
so that input could be elicited separately from trainers 
(FGD 1) and frontline users (FGD 2) of the HBB curricu -
lum. See Additional file 1 for details.
Phase 1b
The same focus groups were invited back to help co-
design and provide feedback to improve the HBB Prompt 
v1. Participants explored the app, simulated use of 
the app and provided feedback regarding app content, 
interface, navigation, functionality, customizability, and 
usability. Two iterations of UCD feedback sessions took 
place prior to finalizing the app for Phase 2 pilot testing. 
See Additional file 2 for details.
Analysis
FGDs were recorded and thematic analysis was con -
ducted, where investigators independently coded com -
ponents of the transcript to highlight needs and mental models of the participants. These independent codes 
were aggregated and synthesized in order to uncover 
main themes consistent across investigators. After each 
iteration, categories and themes were reviewed together 
with the software developers to incorporate feasible 
improvements to HBB Prompt.
Results
Participants
The first focus group comprised six HBB trainers who 
were all physicians and the second focus group com -
prised seven midwives. Table  1 describes the demo -
graphic characteristics of the participants in each FGD, 
including level of practical and simulated experience with 
newborn care, emergency training, and comfort with 
mobile devices.
Phase 1a
Exploring personal experience, facilitators and barriers
Themes that emerged from FGDs are summarized in 
Table  2. Important factors that motivated HBB learning 
and skills maintenance were supportive supervision and 
self-esteem. Additionally, continuing medical education 
opportunities, peer-to-peer learning, refresher courses, 
and timely feedback were all identified as positive driv -
ers. Barriers identified were lack of equipment and health 
system issues such as inadequate transport for escalation 
of care.
Timeline of learning HBB and perceptions of what 
was difficult to learn and remember
Participants explored the timeline of learning HBB skills 
and knowledge, including what was perceived as, and 
what was in reality, the most difficult to learn and remem -
ber (Fig.  2). A concern throughout was how to translate 
skills from a training environment to real-life scenarios. 
Before HBB training, many concerns surrounded learn -
ing about the steps to help a baby breathe and the fear 
of not retaining skills. During HBB training, there was 
fear of not achieving the Golden Minute. Three months 
after training, participants were worried about forgetting 
their skills and not effectively debriefing to improve after 
a resuscitation.
Co‑designing solutions
Prior to being exposed to HBB Prompt v0, participants 
were asked to co-design solutions to help learn and main -
tain HBB skills. They identified promoting a safe learning 
environment as an important goal. To achieve this, sug -
gestions emphasized the use of audio and visual prompts 
and written and video guides to facilitate different ways 
of learning. To counteract the inertia to practise, meth -
ods of motivating users were discussed, including setting Page 5 of 15

reminders, promoting champions, having dedicated 
group practice sessions, and creating a friendly competi -
tive environment to increase accountability. Participants 
also expressed the importance of a community of sup -
port, for example, through a message board or group 
chat to review cases and to encourage each other. Sug -
gested mobile app features included information for each 
HBB skill (introduction, video demonstration, practice 
prompts, scenarios, and if possible, ability to provide 
feedback) and the ability to function offline as internet 
connectivity can often be unreliable.
Implications on app development
Themes that were not feasible to address using a mobile 
app included health system challenges such as lack of 
available equipment and transport for escalation of care 
for unstable babies. Additionally, due to limited funds to 
facilitate real-time internet connectivity of the app, the 
reminders, group chat and message board functions were 
not implemented. Otherwise, many themes identified in 
the FGDs were anticipated by the authors and already 
addressed by features in HBB Prompt v0.
Functions and features of the HBB Prompt v0 
and modifications based on Phase 1a
Figure  3 shows screen shots of HBB Prompt v1 and 
Table  3 describes the features of HBB Prompt. Train -
ing mode was designed to demonstrate each step of the 
HBB algorithm through videos, aimed as a resource for 
refreshing knowledge and skills. In response to concerns 
about lack of equipment, a video demonstrating how to 
reprocess and maintain equipment was added. Other 
feedback from Phase 1a helped inform the video content, 
such as breaking down skills into digestible steps and 
troubleshooting when effective ventilation is not being 
achieved.Simulation mode was designed to facilitate routine 
practice of HBB skills, running through various sce -
narios that emphasize different aspects of resuscita -
tion. Simulation mode was divided into alone mode (for 
individual practice) and rater mode (for group prac -
tice or peer-to-peer learning). This feature encourages 
and supports LDHF training. Consistent practice and 
increased familiarity and confidence in carrying out the 
steps of the Golden Minute enable HBB providers to 
perform all actions within one minute of a baby’s birth. 
To support this, timer prompts were built into simula -
tion mode to facilitate practice of the Golden Minute. 
Furthermore, checklists were added at the end of every 
simulation to help users debrief what went well and 
what could be improved.
The Quizzes and knowledge check section was 
designed to help refresh and consolidate knowledge 
about the HBB algorithm and rationale for steps in 
resuscitation, providing real-time feedback regarding 
information retention.
The Scoreboard/Dashboard was created to increase 
accountability and motivation, encourage all users to 
practise HBB consistently, and foster confidence by dis -
playing personal performance benchmarks.
Phase 1b
Table  4 summarizes the feedback that was received 
during Phase 1b and outlines modifications that were 
made, where possible, in response to the suggestions 
from the FGDs. Feedback about HBB Prompt was gen -
erally positive and navigation was felt to be overall intu -
itive. There were two iterations of Phase 1b (one with 
FGD1 and the other with FGD2). After suggestions 
were incorporated, the team was satisfied that the HBB 
Prompt app was ready for deployment in Phase 2 for 
pilot testing.BeforeHow to s tart a

Discussion
In Phase 1 of this study, we applied a UCD framework 
and engaged a group of HBB trainers and provid -
ers to develop a mobile app, HBB Prompt, to improve knowledge and skills retention after initial HBB train -
ing. Many facilitators and barriers identified were 
feasible to address with HBB Prompt and reflected 
anticipated features based on prior knowledge about 
contributors to skills decay. Participants expressed

positive perceptions of the app’s ability to help users 
practise and maintain HBB knowledge and skills.
Strengths
HBB Prompt is a novel mobile app that facilitates simu -
lation of newborn resuscitation to promote deliber -
ate practice of applying the HBB algorithm to real-life 
scenarios. We employed a cooperative design UCD 
framework, which prioritized participation from front -
line end-users, both trainers and learners of HBB, since 
failure of adoption of healthcare technology has been 
attributed to absence of end-user input [40]. There are 
different methods to involve end-users in the design 
and evaluation process, with prototyping and simula -
tion being commonly used in design, and focus groups 
and observations being common evaluative methods 
[41]. Understanding the usability of a mobile app and 
how it meets needs and addresses gaps to improve out -
comes have been key to the successful adoption of health 
technologies. UCD and understanding human factors is 
crucial since certain ideas may not translate well into a 
mobile app. Understanding the needs of primary users 
by exploring acquisition and maintenance of skills and 
knowledge helped map out areas where HBB Prompt 
can assist and remaining gaps that need to be addressed 
through other means [40]. Each function of HBB Prompt was vetted during Phase 1b and largely addressed the 
issues that were uncovered during Phase 1a.
By iterative testing through participatory design and 
evaluation, we hoped to overcome the common barrier 
of failed interventions due to lack of user input. Since 
the main goal of designing HBB Prompt is to improve 
knowledge and skills retention after initial HBB train -
ing, the UCD process specifically focused on HBB trainer 
and trainee experiences regarding the process of learn -
ing HBB skills and the daily challenges of implementing 
those skills. We used FGDs to better understand when 
different cognitive processes took place, influencing our 
strategies for knowledge and skills retention, a method 
supported by the applied cognitive task analysis [42]. This 
strategy has been successful in developing apps for vari -
ous purposes in healthcare [25, 43, 44], including those 
in the maternal newborn health domain [29, 32–34, 42].
Newborn health apps [28, 34] have been developed 
to support HBB training by provision of HBB reference 
material and clinical decision support. HBB Prompt 
builds on that foundation and adds new features includ -
ing Simulation mode and the Scoreboard/Dashboard, 
which aim to promote LDHF practice. NeoTree [29] is a 
mobile application developed in a single neonatal unit in 
Malawi using similar methodology as HBB Prompt, but 
was intended for data capture of neonatal admissions 
and clinical decision support. The authors used focus Table 3 HBB Prompt app features during Phase 1b
App function Description Rationale for inclusion
Training videos Series of training videos outlining the steps in HBB 
(Preparation for birth, Routine care, Golden Minute 
without ventilation, Golden Minute with ventilation, 
Golden Minute with normal or slow heart rate)Videos to serve as review materials, with ability to visualize 
skills that are being demonstrated
Simulation mode—alone mode Option of targeting practice to a specific scenario that 
an individual user chooses versus a random scenario 
that is chosen from the pool of standard scenarios 
(Preparation for birth, Routine care, Golden Minute 
without ventilation, Golden Minute with ventilation, 
Golden Minute with normal or slow heart rate)
Audio and visual cues that accompany the scenario that 
are timed to simulate an actual deliveryTo help prompt users through simulated delivery sce ‑
narios to facilitate in context practice of skills
Simulation mode—rater mode Same as alone mode except that the designated rater 
has a checklist available to reviewTo help prompt an observer to assess how well the user 
completes steps in the HBB algorithm in response to the 
prompts provided about the baby’s condition
To help facilitate team practice and peer ‑to‑peer learning 
of HBB skills and to assist the rater to systematically give 
targeted feedback
Quizzes/Knowledge Check Sets of quizzes with questions generated from the HBB 
curriculumTo help reinforce knowledge pertaining to the steps and 
reasoning for actions within the HBB algorithm
To address the fear of forgetting knowledge learned after 
initial training
Scoreboard/Dashboard Visual tracker providing trends regarding practice fre ‑
quency and knowledge assessment scoresInformation to serve as an external motivator to practise 
regularly and perform as well if not better than peers
To increase accountability for practising and increase con‑
fidence in resuscitation skills with increased practicePage 10 of 15 Chan et al. BMC Med Inform Decis Mak           (2021) 21:39

Feedback Modifications made Selected quotes
Likes
Content flows well and is consistent with the HBB curriculum
Can complement use of the HBB flip chart during HBB training
Can serve well as a refresher training programIncluded additional practical recommendations, such as, when to refer 
infants for advanced care, how to cut and trim the cord length, how to 
keep the baby warm“You can use it on a daily basis and at any time. 
You don’t have to wait for a workshop, or organ‑
ized day.”
“I am satisfied that this is a dream come true. The 
last time we met, we had ideas but did not 
know how that would be incorporated in an 
app, and I am hoping the developers carry it 
farther, and avail it as quickly as they could.”
Training videos comprehensive, realistic and highlighted relevant materi‑
als from HBBSupplemented training videos with text to facilitate review
Demonstration in video of preparation for birth and testing of equip ‑
ment in front of family—helps promote transparency and confidence 
in newborn resuscitation processKept this video as a part of the app to help encourage this process of 
transparency
Quizzes were useful for review, gave immediate feedback and can be 
useful tool for teaching
Random order of questions helped users not relying on memory aloneSome technical flaws noted that were fixed, for example unsaved 
answers and needing to redo the entire quiz when users tapped the 
screen in any incorrect place
Added a review feature where answers that are correct and answers that 
were marked are shown to provide feedback to users
Simulation mode was helpful for self‑practice and group practice
Audio and visual prompts were effectiveFixed flaws in orientation of images and timing of prompts “Yes, it will help us practice with our colleagues. 
For instance, if you are helping someone who 
does not know, the video guides you and helps 
you know what do to next, if you forget. It also 
helps to time you.”
“I think the videos helped us, because it directs 
you on what to do. Because if they kept saying 
the baby is not breathing, you would know what 
to do and keep doing it, ‘till the baby breathes.”
Dislikes
Lack of consistency throughout the app (e.g. how prompts are given, 
audio for crying, where the baby is being resuscitated in the videos)Modified videos and simulations to use the same prompts
In the HBB curriculum timing of cutting the cord, and location of where 
the baby should be during ventilation (near mother, or on a separate 
surface) is left up to the discretion of the facilitators teaching in their 
own setting. For simplicity, decision made to only show ventilation 
near the mother rather than specifying location depending on the 
status of the baby
Some aspects of the training videos were not as realistic, such as the 
timing with certain actions being too slowModified videos to be more realistic and modified timing of transitions 
in simulation mode
Font size and menu options at times not clear Modified text size and colour scheme to improve visibility
Navigation—suggestion for a restart button in simulation mode Added pause button (restart feature with back button)
General comments and suggestions
Using the same HBB curriculum colour scheme of Green, Yellow and Red 
may help reinforce learning by means of a visual promptAdded HBB colour scheme in different parts of HBB Prompt contentPage 11 of 15

For training videos different viewing angles to better capture the details 
of the actions (e.g. mask seal in bagging)Decision made not to re ‑film the videos due to time constraints in film‑
ing and editing
For the Dashboard, use of real names vs. aliases was debated Consensus was to use real names
Customizability
Consideration of creating animated videos rather than filming individu‑
als—may allow more flexibility if the app scales to different settingsNot feasible to create animations to address this need within the study 
time line available
Including locally relevant practices even if it is not a part of the standard 
HBB protocol—e.g. asking birth attendants to have bed sheets avail‑
able for baby in the preparation for birth section as this is common 
place throughout Uganda, but may not be in other settingsDecision made not to add customized recommendations and adhere to 
what is presented in the HBB curriculumPage 12 of 15 Chan et al. BMC Med Inform Decis Mak           (2021) 21:39 
groups to better understand acceptability and feasibil -
ity of mobile health (mHealth) solutions before and after 
implementation of NeoTree. The positive impact of the 
NeoTree app was attributed to UCD and coproduction. 
HBB Prompt, on the other hand, applies UCD to create 
and fine-tune the features deployed in the app. Finally, 
HBB Prompt builds on the success of the Safe Delivery 
App (SDA) [30]. The SDA [30] contains education mate -
rial and videos based on the United Nations Basic Emer -
gency Obstetric and Neonatal Care program (BEMONC) 
and was evaluated in a large cluster-randomized trial in 
Ethiopia, which found improved knowledge and skills 
retention and a statistically non-significant 24% reduc -
tion in perinatal mortality. HBB Prompt shares many fea -
tures with SDA, including video and text as educational 
materials. HBB Prompt goes beyond the reference tool 
function by supporting simulation-based skills practice, 
an interactive feature developed with UCD based on 
FGD themes of the importance of simulation and peer-
to-peer learning. Furthermore, HBB Prompt contains a 
knowledge assessment feature, which was not available in 
the early version of the SDA that was tested in the clus -
ter-randomized trial.
Facilitating simulation
Our app design was informed by the principles of delib -
erate practice, a well-established methodology for sim -
ulation-based medical education [17]. HBB Prompt 
differs from available apps because it facilitates hands-on 
practice and simulation, which is a core component of 
the HBB 2.0 curriculum. While simulated resuscitation 
will differ from real-life scenarios, consistent practice 
through simulation is an effective method to maintain 
competency in managing high-acuity low-occurrence 
events, such as apnea in a newborn [16, 38]. Much of 
HBB Prompt’s design focus was to facilitate users’ abil -
ity to practise HBB skills in short, directed ways, either 
alone or with peers. LDHF practice of specific skills such 
as bag-mask ventilation has been shown to be effective in 
enhancing skills retention after training [10, 38, 45, 46]. 
For individuals who are unable practise skills with oth -
ers, the Training mode videos serve as a guide, and the 
function of Simulation—alone mode provides a structure 
and framework whereby users can benchmark their skills 
and receive automated external prompts and feedback in 
order to retain their resuscitation skills.
Use of motivation/behaviour change strategies
The Scoreboard/Dashboard feature was designed to 
track trends in scores on quizzes, and participants felt 
it would foster confidence in knowledge retention and 
increase awareness of knowledge gaps. Being able to vis -
ualize frequency and practice patterns serves to increase ownership and accountability for practising as it is a vis -
ual audit, providing feedback to each user about habits 
of practice and where skills may be adequate or lacking 
[47, 48]. Besides having visual statistics that may benefit 
end-users, this feature was built to also track app func -
tion usage to provide insight in Phase 2 of the study to 
improve the app and assess which parts of the HBB 2.0 
curriculum require more reinforcement. Benchmarking 
to help healthcare providers inform behaviour change is 
supported by Social Comparison Theory and Reference 
Group Theory and has been shown to be a successful 
strategy to motivate behaviour change [48]. The display 
of longitudinal trends provides ongoing feedback and is 
supported by the Feedback Intervention Theory [48]. The 
Scoreboard/Dashboard feature is unique to HBB Prompt 
compared with other apps in the newborn mHealth space 
and evaluating its effectiveness during Phase 2 will fur -
ther enhance understanding of how audit and feedback 
can increase retention of knowledge and skills after 
training.
Limitations
Although we recruited a diverse group of participants, 
we may have missed some perspectives. One limita -
tion is the absence of larger scale beta-testing prior 
to deployment in Phase 2. For example, Bucher et  al. 
invited a large group of users to download and beta-test 
their app, and provide feedback through a UCD ques -
tionnaire [34]. However, the size of our FGDs allowed 
in-depth exploration and likely uncovered input to 
reach theme saturation. HBB Prompt’s user interface 
and functions may be less intuitive for potential users 
who are less familiar with use of technology as all but 
one participant (in the HBB provider group) owned a 
smart device and described themselves as comfort -
able with their use. Even though the target audience 
for HBB Prompt are those who were previously HBB 
trained, including input from first-time learners of the 
curriculum could have provided additional insight to 
the knowledge and skills acquisition and retention pro -
cess. There was an intention to recruit a third focus 
group with naïve HBB learners; however, due to logisti -
cal constraints, we were unable to run a separate series 
of focus groups with pre-service trainees (medical stu -
dents and nursing students). On the other hand, our 
in-depth FGDs solicited input from two groups of HBB 
users with various experiences that are representative 
of HBB providers in Uganda, where there is a national 
mandate for all frontline providers to be trained in both 
HBB and ECEB. Participant experiences, perceptions, 
and input through the UCD process were likely gener -
alizable to HBB providers in Uganda and translatable to 
similar resource settings. Recent clinical and simulation Page 13 of 15
 Chan et al. BMC Med Inform Decis Mak           (2021) 21:39 
 
experience were similarly variable across both HBB 
facilitators and HBB providers, which allowed us to 
capture opinions that would reflect those with differen -
tial exposure to deliveries requiring HBB skills.
While our goal of soliciting input from different types 
of end-users uncovered many themes that were feasible 
to address with a mobile app, there are additional limita -
tions to consider. App features addressed intrinsic factors 
such as motivation and confidence, but not health sys -
tem constraints, which were frequently cited as barriers. 
Another challenge of UCD is balancing implementation 
of suggestions and prolonging the timeline of app devel -
opment. For example, although Simulation—rater mode 
was felt to work well, having the ability to link two devices 
so that the user and the rater could engage in the simula -
tion on different screens would have further enhanced its 
function but this was technically not feasible given the 
time constraint of the study. Although customization was 
requested during feedback, it was important to consider 
how to be specific enough without reducing generaliza -
bility. Keeping the app content close to the HBB curricu -
lum would allow it to scale to other settings more easily.
Conclusion
With the ubiquity of mobile devices, apps that are care -
fully designed and evaluated have the potential to scale 
rapidly and reach a broad audience to effect large scale 
change. HBB Prompt was developed with UCD input 
from HBB trainers and providers to tailor its design to 
support knowledge and skills maintenance after HBB 
training. HBB Prompt features were built to address 
themes uncovered, which included motivation to practise, 
confidence in knowledge or skills, importance of feedback 
and peer-to-peer learning. The iterative process of incor -
porating feedback further improved the features and func -
tions of HBB Prompt as a practice tool to facilitate skills 
and knowledge retention. Pilot-testing of HBB Prompt in 
Phase 2 of this study will further evaluate the ability of this 
UCD process to build a mobile tool to address the impor -
tant issue of increasing sustainability of HBB training.
