Abstract  
The transformational processes of the global economy and the development of digital technologies necessitate a 
conceptual review of existing management strategies and their improvement, a change in the processes of 
obtaining knowledge and assessing their r elationships. In modern conditions, to ensure the effectiveness of 
activities, the necessary element of management is the use of innovative information and digital technologies in 
business, which allow optimizing costs and optimizing financial results.  
The expediency and relevance of the study, which is aimed at assessing the relationship of digital strategies and 
their impact on the Jordanian aviation sector, is substantiated. It has been taught that the availability of digital 
technologies contributes to  the improvement of management strategies and educational processes, which allows 
them to become training centers at the regional level. It was determined that the development of digital tools 
(content, web pages, social networks, advertising, video and ot her marketing components) and their application 
in organization management strategies contribute to streamlining the management process and gaining 
knowledge. It is argued that the process of education and training of managers depends on the approach used by 
the organization’s digital tools, as well as the type and industry of its economic activity. It is taught that the 
training used in the Jordanian aviation sector, as a managerial survey compiled by design specialists, explains the 
degree of accessibilit y of this sector of the economy and confirms the need to establish a training center at the 
regional level. It is proved that the establishment of a training center at the regional level will ensure the 
promotion of employees of the Jordanian aviation sect or, state support, a new image and loyalty, which will 
make managers at the local and regional levels aware. To justify the relevance and necessity, a statistical 
one-way analysis of variance was carried out for the influence of factors on training process es in the aviation 
sector of Jordan.  
The main results of statistical one -way analysis of variance interpret the importance of this study and the need to 
improve the digital strategy, and its application in marketing activities, which focus on 3digital. Un ique practical 
recommendations have been developed that are based on customer focus and focus on three digital strategies 
(clients; educational product; digital tools), which will achieve the organization's strategic goals and positive 
financial results.  
Keywords:  digital strategy, air aviation, training center, e -customers , marketing, efficiency  
1. Introduction  
Throughout the existence of mankind, society has developed. It is well known that in its development it went 
through three stages: agrarian with a predominance of agriculture and manual labor, industrial with a dominance 
of industry and post -industrial. All developed countries have already passed into the third state, which is 
characterized by dominance in the economy of the service sector and the em ergence of information technologies 
and computers, which entailed a significant simplification of the lives of people living in these countries. In other 
words, we began to live in a consumer society. However, the company does not stand still, its further 
development and the increasing dominance of the services sector over production have led to the fact that 
information technology and the IT sector have begun to play a key role in this movement, which greatly simplify 
the very mechanism by which a person r eceives any service. The advent of the Internet and the reduction in the 
cost of access to the global network have become a real information (digital) revolution that has changed our 
lives in general, and the economy in particular.  http:// ibr.ccsenet.org      International Busine ss Research                     V ol. 13, No. 6; 2020

 The development of market relations is due to the high level of competition, which forces the management of 
organizations to review the management strategies used in order to maintain their competitive position in the 
world market. The transformation of ma nagement strategies in connection with the global globalization of 
markets and the development of new technologies allows us to change the management process and diversify 
production and approaches to its organization, and digital reassessment opens up new  opportunities for the 
quality of services for their pricing, promotion and competitiveness. Modern business conditions lead to the 
fulfillment of mandatory conditions to ensure the effectiveness of activities and maximize results is the use of 
innovative technologies and management strategies. Particular attention should be paid to the development of 
digital organization management strategies, which dictate the conditions for ensuring specific positions and 
increasing the share of customer loyalty and thei r satisfaction with the organization's product / service. A digital 
strategy is a marketing plan whose goal is the general development and transformation of a business, the 
popularization of a product or brand. To achieve the objectives, research is conduc ted on the market, audience, 
competitors, their own competitive advantages are identified, suitable digital channels and specific tools are 
selected, and relevant technologies are used.  
In modern science, there is no single approach and methodology for ass essing the relationship of digital 
strategies, as well as their impact on the Jordanian aviation sector, which confirms the relevance and necessity of 
this study. The high level of competition in global markets, the transformation of existing mechanisms fo r 
managing organizations and the availability of digital technologies contribute to the continuous improvement of 
management strategies and necessitates the conceptual need for the establishment of training centers at the 
regional level, which should be ex amined in more detail and assessed by the level of significance of these factors 
based on the application statistical univariate analysis of variance tools.   
The process of organizing the aviation sector of the Jordanian economy, which we are beginning to adapt to the 
new marketing environment in stages to solve new problems, focusing on marketing research, determining the 
needs of the market and consumers, the  attitude of customers and their loyalty, analysis of strengths and 
weaknesses, as well as promotion, requires additional research. using digital tutorials.  The intensive development 
of Internet technologies and their applications in the economy leads to p ositive results and economic benefits, 
which in the conditions of transformation of the world market is important and necessary to ensure specific 
positions.  
2. Literature Review  
There are many studies in the scientific literature that are aimed at the dev elopment of digital technologies in the 
economy, which are a driver of change and are reflected in studies (Chunch Heman & Ken Burberry, 2013) that 
conceptualize the need to use innovative tools in the organization’s management system to retain customers a nd 
market position. However, this approach does not allow to determine specific directions for improving the 
strategy, which will ensure not only the retention of customers and competitive positions in the market, but will 
increase these indicators, both i n quantity and in qualitative measurement. It is worth noting a study (Dare 
Chaffey, 2017) that outlines the process of accelerating technologies and communications in business by creating 
a new approach and communication management strategy, which, unlike  the existing ones, is aimed at improving 
interaction with key consumers, but does not allow comprehensive management of all the processes of the 
organization.  
It should be noted that modern business conditions determine the need for the use in the activit ies of any 
organization of innovative information and digital technologies in the formation of strategic goals of 
organizations. In the scientific literature, there are several different views on the use of digital strategies of 
organizations. Digital stra tegy is a unique competitive advantage in electronic marketing all over the world . 
Digital marketing strategies are practically characterized by applications in the world of technologies for 
sustainable business activity (Sunil Gupta, 2018), using new digi tal opportunities. Current business conditions 
have led marketing managers to use many marketing communications forums as a digital strategy (Alexander 
Reason  & Damian Ryan , 2018). E -business firms are gaining sustainable competitive advantage through new 
digital strategies (Philip K оttler., 2017). The impact of training on the applied digital marketing strategy is 
mentioned in the study ( Linda D., 2019 ), however, this approach does not reveal the main essence and mentions 
the main tools of digital marketin g in building a strategy, which does not allow us to fully determine not only 
tool at assessment of their impact. It should be noted that not all the approaches presented consider the features 
of the influence of digital strategy on the learning process in  the aviation sector of Jordan, which requires more 
in-depth research.

 3. Research Problem and Research Methodology  
Тhe theoretical and methodological basis of the study are the objective fundamental principles of the modern 
theory of digital marketing. I n the research process, special methods of cognition were used: analysis and 
synthesis - to develop practical recommendations for improving the strategy of digital marketing in modern 
conditions; the graphical method and the method of constructing analytic al tables - for visualizing the results of 
the study, statistica l one -way analysis of variance - for assessing the impact of digital marketing factors on the 
learning process in the aviation sector of Jordan. The key data from the World Bank, the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, and the International Monetary Fund , International Finance Corporation, 
Jordan Central Bank and selected banking institutions, academic us of domestic and foreign scientists, 
economists, marketers, et c. 
The transformational processes of the global economy significantly affect the marketing system as a whole, 
including its containing elements, which each organization determines for itself based on strategic goals and 
initiatives. Since the intensive use  of innovative tools and information technologies in business quickly finds its 
application, it is necessary to consider the features of the impact of digital marketing strategies on training the 
aviation sector of the Jordanian economy to form it at the r egional level.  
4. Analysis of Data  
Features of training in the aviation sector of Jordan are related to perception, culture, propaganda around the 
learning process and the need to establish a training center at the regional level. The creation of the avia tion 
sector of the Jordanian economy was in 1966, in parallel from the development of educational institutions and 
academies. It should be noted that the transport sector of the Jordanian economy is 2.1 billion dollars. US GDP, 
while participation in the a viation sector is 500 million JD. As for educational institutions, there are 5 of them in 
Jordan, in which there are multidirectional training programs, this sector occupies an example of 5% of Jordan's 
gross domestic production and amounts to 42.2 million  dollars. USA.  
To create an overview of the state of knowledge and justify the need to assess the impact of training in the 
aviation sector on a digital marketing strategy to improve efficiency based on data ( Civil Aviation Administration 
Annual Report - Jordan, 2017). A critical analysis of the literature in the framework of digital marketing research 
was carried out , the period from 2013 -2018 was chosen as the start date of the analysis, this is due to the fact that 
the main digital marketing reviews fro m the analytical aspect and the interactive form of digital marketing 
communications are mainly activated during the specified time period.  
5. Discussion  
a) Features of the development of digital marketing in Jordan for the implementation of aviation trai ning: social 
networks; content; webpage.  
Transofmation of global markets requires continuous improvement of existing management methods of a 
modern organization.  The process of making managerial and managerial decisions should ensure the 
effectiveness of t he organization. A critical analysis of research in the field of digital marketing made it possible 
to substantiate that the development of digital technologies requires a conceptual review of existing management 
strategies and their improvement, changes i n the processes of knowledge acquisition and assessment of their 
relationship. In modern conditions, to ensure the effectiveness of activities, a necessary control element is the use 
of innovative information and digital technologies in business, which all ow optimizing costs and optimizing 
financial results. A methodology for assessing the relationship of digital strategies and their impact on the 
Jordanian aviation sector has been developed and proposed. It is taught that the availability of digital 
techno logies helps to improve management strategies and educational processes, which allows them to become 
training centers at the regional level. It has been established that the development of digital tools (content, web 
pages, social networks, advertising, vi deo and other marketing components) and their application in organization 
management strategies help optimize the management process and gain knowledge. The creation of a training 
center at the regional level will ensure the promotion of employees of the J ordanian aviation sector, state support, 
a new image and loyalty, which will inform leaders at the local and regional levels. Using the tools of statistical 
one-way analysis of variance, the influence of factors on educational processes in the aviation sec tor of Jordan 
was evaluated. The main results, of which   interpret the importance of this study and the need to improve digital 
strategy and its application in 3digital -oriented marketing activities. Developed approaches and unique practical 
recommendation s based on customer orientation and focused on three digital strategies (clients; educational 
product; digital tools) that will achieve the organization's strategic goals and positive financial results in modern 
business conditions.  http:// ibr.ccsenet.org      International Busine ss Research                     V ol. 13, No. 6; 2020

 b) The main aspects of the development of digital strategies in Jordan: innovative tools and their impact on 
business processes  
It should be noted that the development of the digital economy essentially connects the relationship between 
customers and organizations at the level o f using innovative technologies that are based on a complex of digital 
marketing. The relevance of the digital community and its usefulness for understanding training in the Jordanian 
aviation sector has been investigated, and the client’s role is to creat e a branding story that is dedicated to brand 
performance (Sonja Gensler,  2013).  Studies of digital training strategies for the Jordanian aviation sector are 
being explored such as: content strategy (CS), Internet (WS), social networks (SM).The training pr ocess in the 
aviation sector of Jordan reflects good image -based aerial training in many areas, such as: safety training, a 
suitable environment, simulation, electronic advancement, new technologies, a good training plan, skills, 
experience. The main resul ts of such training focus on many aspects, such as: cost, training hours, locations, 
technological equipment, promotion strategies to improve the aviation training sector to a regional training 
center ( Civil Aviation Administration Annual Report - Jordan, 2018). It is worth noting that studies in the field of 
training in the aviation sector of the Jordanian economy allow us to understand the motivation of clients to create 
and disseminate an advertising campaign in order to reflect a positive understanding of the values of training in 
Jordan, and positive trainee clients create stories with brand names that affect the new brand for effective, 
sustainable air  traffic education institutions . Digital marketing promotion in the aviation sector of the Jordanian 
economy depends on social interaction with the benefits of training courses, which reflect a positive image for 
customer satisfaction and increased loyalty. Consider the types of digital marketing strategies that have been 
recently used to create social net working sites and encourage customers to respond interactively (Daniel Rowels , 
2017).  
The results provide a way to build and stimulate a positive customer image about digital marketing strategies for 
training in aviation in Jordan, influence on the Interne t and spreading a brand image to build loyalty for learning 
success, there are many digital promotion care strategies to attract customers and increase loyalty, in general , 
Jordan's aviation education policy is based on a US model, such as the Michigan In stitute of Aviation and 
Technolo gy, Aviation School and Wyotech . In Jordan, in the aviation sector of the economy, training is trying to 
become the best in the Middle East, having received an international certificate of training, high technology, 
safety, experience. Training should maximize quality, values, image, satisfaction and create intellectual 
knowledge in the field of aviation training, integrate solutions with information, improve a training -based 
information solution to help industry, there are m any problems that specialists face because there are not enough 
funds, experience, specialized equipment, management, integrated training mana gement, training needs analysis.  
To improve the digital marketing strategy in the Jordanian aviation sector to become a regional training center, 
statistical tools of one -way analysis of variance should be used, which will assess the impact of the new strategy 
for each variable on the digital learning elements of the aviation sector.  Analysis of variance is a metho d in 
mathematical statistics aimed at searching for dependences in experimental data by examining the significance 
of differences in average values. Unlike the t -test, it allows you to compare the average values of three or more 
groups. Developed by R. Fis her to analyze the results of experimental studies. The designation ANOV A is also 
found in the literature.  To do this, we will carry out the following classification of strategies: content strategy, 
web page strategy, social media strategy. Cornbrash’s alp ha is 0.86, which is explained by a high degree of 
suitability, stability and validity, which is presented in table 1 .

The first standard deviation content strategy is 4.47, the second web page strategy is 4.27 deviation, and the third 
social media strategy is 3.99, which reflects the degree of information reliability.  To interpret the main results of 
analysis of variance and assessment, the impact of the new strategy for each variable on the digital learning 
elements of the Jordanian aviation sector and the reflection of the significance of each variable, it is necessary to 
consider their collinearity, which is presented i n Table 3.  
Reflecting the training of the Jordanian aviation sector and explaining the influence of each variable by collinear 
tolerance, it is worth noting that the obtained economic -mathematical model is suitable and reflects the presence 
of 3 strategies  for promoting training in Jordan, which provide an improvement in the new strategy, which is 
aimed at the benefits of training and communication support features digital technology.   
Depending on the coefficient, the beta result becomes 0.066, which means  a change in the needs, desires, 
preferences of customers, after which it will have a positive effect on increasing the number of customers and 
enhancing their satisfaction and loyalty.

 To conceptualize this approach and determine key results, it is necessary to analyze the following hypotheses:  
1) there  is no statistically significant relationship (∞≤ 0.05) between digital strategy (content, web pages and 
social networks) and marketing of Jordan as a regional center for aviation training ;  
2) there  is no statistically significant relationship in (∞≤0.05) between the digital strategy (content) and 
marketing of Jordan as a regional center for aviation training;  
3) there is no statistically significant relationship in (∞≤0.05) between the digital stra tegy (web pages) and the 
marketing of Jordan as a regional center for aviation training.  
There is no statistically significant relationship in (∞≤0.05) between digital strategy (social networks) and 
marketing of Jordan as a region al center for aviation tra ining , as shown in Fig ure 1. 
 
Figure 1 . Conceptual aspects of digital marketing in Jordan as a regional center for training the aviation sector  
 
The intensive development of the digital economy in the world and the introduction of innovative business tools 
determine their application and use in all sectors of the economy of developed countries. The development and 
use in practice of these tools and technologies provide all the necessary prerequisites for creating a new era of 
marketing - digital market ing. 
6. Conclusion  
In modern business conditions, to achieve all the strategically important goals of the organization, the necessary 
condition is the use of innovative management methods and tools. In order to achieve a competitive advantage, 
HR must adop t a new training strategy in the virtual world (digital) marketing strategy in Jordan, which depends 
on the following: 1) aspects of training diversification, understanding of market needs, applying a better strategy 
by focusing on the many shortcomings of  these strategies and their improvement; 2) differentiation of content 
types, development of new pages, expansion of media applications, focus on e -advertising strategies 24/7; 3) the 
use of innovative e -business tools aimed at training people in digital m arketing; 4) the use of various electronic 
marketing tools, such as: television, media, social networks, content, web pages, focus on 3 digital strategies. It 
was taught that the availability of digital technology improves management strategies and learnin g processes, 
which allows them to become training centers at the regional level. The developed tools for analyzing the 
influence of factors on educational processes in the aviation sector of Jordan using statistical one -way analysis of 
variance can be appl ied in the practical activities of organizations. The results of the study are unique practical 
recommendations based on the methodological aspects of customer orientation and focused on three digital 
strategies (clients; educational product; digital tools ) that will achieve the organization's strategic goals and 
positive financial results, taking into account all critical factors. It should be noted that achievement of all 
strategic goals and positive financial results, taking into account all critical fac tors that directly affect yanked on 
digital marketing strategies and the development of learning processes in Jordan atsiatsionnom sector. 
Significant in the process of organizing effective marketing and developing its digital tools are the central 
governm ent bodies of Jordan, whose policies can intensively implement these technologies and their applications 
in the real business segment of the country.
