Nowadays, due to easiness and expansion in property of smart mobile devices, it is becoming inevitable for mobile ap-
plicationstohaveanimportantroleinhighereducationsystems.x#_heEgyptianpublicuniversitiesarefacingtheproblemof
students’largenumberenrolledineachyear.x#_hus,welackpropercommunicationbetweeneducatorsandlearners.Mobile
learning can solve that problem, and it enables adjustment of the curriculum to meet students’ learning time and life
situations. It provides diﬀerent solutions better than traditional educational methods. Students and professors could
exchange educational material or information even if they are not in the same class. Furthermore, the cost of universities’
materials reduced, as all course materials can be found online through mobile applications. x#_his paper proposes a mobile
learning system named “Easy-Edu.” x#_he proposed system intended to make the learning process easier, focus on students’
needs, and encourage communication and collaboration between students and professors and supports collaborative
scenario-based learningforuniversity students. Unlikeother traditionalsystems,the proposed“Easy-Edu” wasbuiltusing
an Agile-based approach that delivers sustainable and high-quality mobile learning system. In addition, it eliminates the
chances of absolute system failure and detects and ﬁxes issues faster. Summarily, everything related to the design and
implementation of “Easy-Edu” is discussed.
1.Introduction
Highereducation plays a major role in the economic devel-
opment of society. Egypt’s public universities and educational
institutes received around 2230314 million enrolled students,
in the academic year of 2017-2018 according to the EgyptianCentralAgencyforPublicMobilizationandStatistics[1].Suchproblem caused a lack of communication, interaction, anddirect engagement between educators and learners. It is hardfor educators to pay attention to hundreds of students andstudents who cannot ask questions or give feedback in thelecturetime.x#_herefore,mobilelearningisnowanewtrendinsuch education. Because of its expansion and ease of useeverywhere, the network provides quick access to diﬀerentﬁelds of interest. Because of the resilience of mobile learning
applications,universitiesandinstitutionsaretryingtodevelop
diﬀerent mobile learning solutions to support their diﬀerentcourses[2,3].Mobilelearningimprovesstudents’interestandmotivation in learning new courses. In addition, it is able tomake a pedagogical shift from classroom-based learning tocollaborative and constructivist learning [4]. Besides, mobile
devices and wireless networks technologies are improving
continuously with time. x#_he evolution of these technologieshelped e-learning to extend to mobile learning [5].
x#_heAgilemodelwasusedtobuildanewmobilelearning
system “Easy-Edu” that will be used in Egyptian highereducation. Using the Agile model in building the mobilelearning system can ensure that the system is reliable,sustainable, and of high-quality. It can enhance the userinterface(UI)designandtheuserexperience(UX),increasethe sustainability of system usage, create an opportunity tocontinuallyreprioritize,andreﬁnethesystemfeaturestosuit

https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/7531980x#_hemajorchallengethatmotivatedustodevelop“Easy-
Edu” system is a lack of communication between educators
and learners because of the large number of students in theclasses. x#_he huge number of students has caused diﬀerentproblems such as weaker contacts between students andeducators,insuﬃcientmanagementoflearningcurriculums,
lack of motivation to learn new subjects, and restricted
opportunities for students’ feedback.
Our research has contributed to the mobile learning in
higher education; the system helps students to study courses’materials and solve problems that are aligned with the courseobjectives. x#_his enhances their problem-solving skills, col-laborative and communicative skills, and analytic thinkingprocess.Inaddition,thesystemtakesintoaccountthelearners’intelligencebymovingthelearnersfromlowerleveltoahigherlevel while solving the questions to adapt to their knowledge.x#_helearnerscansharediﬀerentideasandquestionswitheach
other using group discussion module, suggest the problem
solutions, and collaborate with each other. Also, they canparticipate in the educational process by sending theirquestions to the professor to be added to the questions bank,and then the professor adds four diﬀerent answers to thequestion to be used in the exams. x#_he professor’s role is tomentor the learning, enable the self-questioning practices,manage the learning process, monitor the engagement, andprovide instructions and important announcements.
x#_he Easy-Edu application is intended to support edu-
cators and students in large populated classes, to ease usingmobile devices in the learning of university courses.
x#_he purpose of this paper is to discuss the design and
implementationofEasy-Edumobilelearningsystem.Wearegoing to pursue this goal by answering the following re-search questions:
(1) How to make the students participate in the edu-
cational process and exam development?
(2) How to make the educators communicate with the
students and vice versa?
(3) How to change questions’ level in the test and adapt
according to the learners’ intelligence?
(4) How to make students ask questions easily and
collaborate with each other?
x#_he rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
presents the current state of mobile learning, mobile learning,collaborative learning, scenario-based learning, and mobilelearning solutions for higher education from the literature re-view. x#_hen, Section 3 explains the proposed system, design anddevelopment, Agile information system, and using the Agileapproach in developing Easy-Edu as well as in the imple-
mentation of the system. Section 4 presents Easy-Edu capa-
bilitiesagainstothersystems,whileSection5showsthepotentialimpact and the preliminary results of Easy-Edu system. Lastly,the ﬁnal conclusion and future work are presented in Section 6.
2.The Current State of Mobile Learning
2.1. Mobile Learning. Mobile learning, or M-learning, can
be any educational interaction delivered through mobiletechnology. Early deﬁnitions saw that mobile learning issimply using hand-held devices to support learning [6].Other mobile learning deﬁnitions have been reported byformer researchers [7]. M-learning can be deﬁned as theapplicationinstalledonthemobiledevicestocheckdiﬀerenttypes of learning resources, communicate, share learning
experiences with other students, and collaborate together in
solvingproblems.Mobilelearningisnotaboutusingmobiledevices to support learning only, but it also includes all theactions that could happen between educators, students,environments, theories of learning, anyone, anywhere, andanytime learning [8]. x#_he core beneﬁts of learning usingmobile devices are that it allows students to be in a suitableplace at a suitable time, so they can gain experience in anauthentic learning environment, wherever that is.M-learning is identiﬁed by three elements that are all im-portant to the educators and students: (1) Convenience and
usability. (2) Expediency and eﬃcacy. (3) Immediacy. More
details can be found in [9].
2.2.CollaborativeLearning. Collaborative learning is a type
of learning where two or more students learn something
together [10, 11]; unlike individual learning, students worktogether in collaborative learning depending on one an-other’s skills and resources (asking one another for in-
formation, monitoring one another’s work, evaluating each
other’s ideas, etc.) [12, 13]. Speciﬁcally, collaborativelearning is based on the idea that knowledge can be createdwithin a large number of individuals where members in-teract actively by sharing experiences and ideas [14]. Col-laborative learning refers to environments andmethodologies in which students engage together in acommon task. Discussion boards can be an example ofcollaborative learning because students are forced to readother answers and opinionsand respond carefully.x#_hroughthe back-and-forth engagement and interaction with each
other, they can expand their personal knowledge and share
points-of-view, insights, and perspectives.
2.3. Scenario-Based Learning. Scenario-based learning
blends e-learning and problem-based learning together.
Knowledgecannotbedevelopedandunderstoodcompletelyespecially in courses that need practical applications [15]. Itallows students to imagine themselves in realistic situationsrequiring them to apply and develop their knowledge andproblem-solving skills. Good scenarios can help studentsimagine the practical applications of knowledge and con-ceptstheyhavestudied.x#_hefocusisonthestudentexploringmanywaystoﬁndasolutionandtrytolearnfromtheirown
mistakes. Scenario-based learning places students at the
center of the learning environment. Students can get inmany diﬀerent activities in the scenario [16]. x#_his allowsthem to understand the problems that they may face in theindustryandreallife.Itgivesstudentsoptionstoexploreandimagine a realistic situation. Students can control their ownlearning process as they see the consequences of their de-cisions and choices when exploring the scenario.2 EducationResearchInternational2.4. Mobile Learning Solutions in Higher Education.
Mobile learning solutions for higher education shouldsupport meaningful learning and provide motivation tostudentstostudy[17].Leinonenetal.[18]foundthatmobileapps that are designed for learning are in short supply. Asurvey of M-learning trends in computer science education
showed that M-learning can increase students’ aﬀective
traits [19]. x#_here are already diﬀerent kinds of M-learningsolutions including the commercial ones in higher educa-tion. Some examples from the literature were chosen tomention here as they are designed and developed by theresearcher,forfree,appliedinhighereducation,andusedincomputer science, information technology, and engineeringclasses. x#_hese literature examples have inspired the work of“Easy-Edu” system. Mbogo et al. [20] proposed an androidmobile learning application developed according to ﬁve-level scaﬀolding framework to support the learning of Java
programming. x#_his work was developed in the African
context. x#_hey found that mobile learning as a new methodcould oﬀer opportunities to minimize the diﬃculty faced inlearningprogramming.However,thedrawbacksarethatitisan application for a speciﬁc programming language and donot support other programming languages. It does notsupport collaboration between learners, and it is consideredas self-learning application. It lacks the communicationbetween professors and students.
Boticki et al. [21] have developed an Android app to
support sorting algorithms learning. x#_hey found that stu-dents are encouraged using mobile devices for learning. As
another example, Wen and Zhang [22] implemented a
microlecture system on mobile. x#_he mobile system helpsstudentstoseevideosandothermicrolectureresources.x#_heideawassoencouragedandhasmanyadvantages.However,itlacksthecollaborationactivitiesbetweenlearners.Besides,there are no quizzes for students to test their skills afterstudying through the microlectures.
Moreira and Ferreira [23] developed an application to
assist the teaching of requirement engineering using theLucidchart application on mobile devices for UML systemsmodeling.ShanmugapriyaandTamilarasi[24]designedand
developed mobile courseware for information and com-
munications technology students using a problem-basedlearning approach. x#_he course is designed to check theproblem-based learning in a mobile learning environment.“RoboRun” mobile learning game was developed by Vinayet al. [25]. x#_he platform allows touch input devices forcoding and learning conditional programming and algo-rithm sequence ordering.
Prenner et al. [26] designed a mobile medium for the
teaching of algorithms and data structure courses to stu-dents. x#_his work created NetLuke, a visualization tool for
interactive algorithms and data structures. x#_he NetLuke
assists in direct data input by the user, the loading of vi-sualization samples, and dynamic animations. Potts et al.[27] proposed an M-learning application for iOS and An-droid operating systems. It is used in two electrical engi-neering courses at the University of Tennessee at Martin,ENG 231 Digital Logic and ENGR 361 Digital Signal Pro-cessing. x#_his application is quiz-style and oﬀers the user amultitouchinterfacetoanswertherelevantquestionsrelatedto electric engineering courses.
x#_he quizzes have a large range of covered topics, in-
cluding digital logic gate analysis, discrete signal evolution,and digital ﬁlter design. After concluding each work, thescore results are sent to the instructors via e-mail. Two
evaluations using 18 students from both courses were
conducted to measure its eﬀect on them. x#_he applicationshould have integrated a discussion and collaborationmodule to make the learning process more attractive to thelearners. Tamhane et al. [28] presented the design and de-velopment of mobile learning application on the AndroidplatformusingJavaprogramminglanguagetohelpstudentsin computer courses at the Computer Engineering De-partment. x#_he approach was to merge between multimediaconcept and command language to create a new learningenvironmentusingthemobilelearningapplication.x#_heaim
of the mobile learning application was to complement the
traditional learning and e-learning systems.
Lim [29] presented the design and implementation of a
mobile-based interactive teaching model with in-class andoﬀ-class components aided by Socrative online responsesystem to improve the engagement of the students in aMalaysian university. Table 1 summarizes the research-based mobile learning systems from the literature andtheir limitations.
x#_hiscouldbeasteptosupportlearningbutmightnotbe
completely continual and eﬃcient considering a largenumber of students in Egyptian universities. However, the
previous implementation and application of M-learning to
various computer science courses have been successful; oursolution would work on the issue of teaching large studentsin the classes, using collaborative scenario-based learningapproach. It is important to design a new all-inclusiveM-learning system built using a scientiﬁcally provenmethodology like Agile.
3.The Proposed System
x#_hemainpracticalrequirementfor“Easy-Edu”systemistheability to support learning and engagement of a largenumber of learners at any time. One way to boost learners’engagement in mobile learning is to use mobile commu-nication functions, such as discussion forums, announce-ments, notiﬁcations, and self-practice materials. All thesefunctions are available on Easy-Edu, creating on-demandaccess to information. Easy-Edu system supports theuploading of lecture materials. x#_hus, Easy-Edu helpslearners to access learning materials in diﬀerent formats
such as PDFs, e-books, and videos. View announcements,
enter discussions forums, solve adaptive scenario-basedquizzes, and receive notiﬁcations. Figure 1 shows the pro-posed framework which uses diﬀerent web services. x#_heframework focuses on providing collaborative scenario-based learning to the students. It is built upon educa-tional, technological, and social aspects.

Mobile Middleware. x#_he middleware is built with http://
ASP.net and model view controller (MVC) web API for
providing web services using JavaScript object notation(JSON). It accepts the request from the mobile client andtranslates this request as a web service to get the contentfrom the back-end servers through Internet connections.
x#_he raw data that are collected from the back-end servers
are formatted according to mobile device proﬁle whichrequested it and then the formatted content issent back tothe mobile devices in a presentable manner to the mobileapplications which invoked it, as shown in Figure 2.

3.1. Design and Development. Easy-Edu utilizes a web and
databaseservertosharedataandresourcesamongallmobile
devices as well as an administration subsystem where all
activities for collaborative learning and scenario-basedquestions are carried out.
x#_he physical structure of “Easy-Edu” consists of the
learning center “mobile app,” web application “dashboard,”desktop application, and the server. x#_he learning center iscounted as the core of the proposed system as it representsthe central unit that connects all system components. It isconsisted of 4 main modules to achieve diﬀerent func-tionalities as shown in Figure 3. Contentsupports variouscourses and all the materials such as PDFs, videos, ande-books.

3.1.1. Agile Information Systems and Software Development.
Agile information systems and software development (ISD)attracted the researchers because it is an approach that dealswith changingandhardlycontrollableelementsofISD.Agileis based on an iterative and incremental approach. Instead ofplanning deeply at the beginning of the project, Agilemethodologies are open to requirements changing and getsfeedback from the end user and the stakeholders [30]. Each
iteration’sgoalistoproduceaprototypethatworkscorrectly.
Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts
of the Agile Manifesto.17 software developers met together
todiscussmethodsoflightweightdevelopment,in2001[31].x#_hen, the Manifesto for Agile Software Development waspublished, which covered “better ways of software devel-opment by doing it and helping others do it.”
Illustrated in Figure 4, the phases of the Agile devel-
opment cycle which followed our proposed system are asfollows [32]: (1) planning, (2) requirements analysis, (3)design, (4) implementation, coding, or development, (5)
testing, and (6) deployment.
3.1.2. Using the Agile Approach in Developing Easy-Edu
System.x#_he Agile model was chosen as the appropriate ap-
proachformanagingandbuildingEasy-Edusystem.UsingtheAgilemodelinbuildingthemobilelearningsystemguaranteesdelivering high-quality, reliable, and sustainable mobilelearning system. Agile helps in improving the performanceand features of the system. It also helps in eliminating thesystem failure, by the continuous testing and issues ﬁxing.

each iteration, a prototype is built and tested [33]. It is provedin many studies that ﬁxing a defect/issue found in ﬁnal pro-duction stages is more expensive than ﬁxing it when found in
earlierstagesoftheproject[34].x#_hus,Agileapproachesaimat
ﬁxing issues as early as possible when detected [35].

iterations. x#_he fast feedback is very important to help the
team to think about the outcomes and provide solutions.Testing allows continuous improvements in the releases ofthe deployable prototype.
3.2. Implementation of the Proposed System. Our iOS-based
mobile learning system, as described in the framework sec-
tion, consists of the clients, web application, desktop appli-cation,database,andtheserver.Toensuresystemportability,eﬃciency,andmaintainability,eachsubsystemusingdiﬀerentsoftware technology is constructed. x#_hese subsystems werelaterconnectedusingadynamiclinklibrary.Afterdeveloping
the application, we ran it several times on the simulator and
actual devices to conﬁrm the functionality of the diﬀerentunits. x#_hen, we installed the application on a real mobiledevice for debugging. x#_he testing was done on iPhone 6mobile phone. x#_he system was implemented according tostakeholder’s requirement speciﬁcations. Rigorous ﬁne-tuning and iterative features of Agile were used. x#_he ﬁrstversion of the app was developed for iOS operating systemusers. Easy-Edu app is released on Apple App Store.ObtainingEasy-Eduisfreeandrequiresregistrationbyusers.

so the student feels him/herself inside the scenario andanswer the questions. As shown in Figure 9, the questionsscreen, the student answers the scenario questions for the
level that was chosen. Each level consists of 10 multiple
choice questions type which comes randomly from thequestions pool.
x#_he proposed system is adaptive enough to sense the
students’ skills. It could automatically transient students tohigher levels once the student answers most questionscorrectly. In fact, adding this feature would be attractive tomanymotivatedlearnerswhomayfeelboredwithlowlevels.x#_herefore, in our system, if the student correctly answeredthe ﬁrst ﬁve questions and in that case, a pop-up messageappears to the student and asks if he/she wants to go to the
higher level or stay at the same level. Finally, results with
percentage are shown to students with a human face thatfeels happy/sad according to their answers as shown inFigure 10. Also, he/she can check back the answers to learnfrom his/her mistakes in the future. x#_hus, this answers ourthird research question which is: how to change questions’
level in the test and adapt according to the learners’intelligence?

4.Easy-Edu Capabilities against Other Systems
Mobile learning apps can be criticized by their availability,sciencecontent,andtype.x#_heavailabilityofthemobileappsis explored through several factors, including the app de-veloper, whether it was publicly accessible, and whether the
platform recent or not. Mobile apps developed for older
platforms, such as PDAs or hand-held/pocket PCs, are nolonger being used by the general public. However, morerecentplatformssuchassmartphones,tablets,andiPodsaredeveloped.Mostappsareeitherdirectlyincludedcontentforsciencelearningorprovidedinacustomizabletemplatethatwas enriched with science content. Fourbroad categoriesofapps,includingplace-baseddatacollectiontools,gamesand/or simulations, learning management systems (LMS), andproductivity tools are listed in Table 2. Table 2 presents thegeneral characteristics and application features of a numberof surveyed mobile apps compared with our proposedsystem.

for mobile apps, either addressed a common issue with
mobile learning, such as reducing potential cognitiveoverload, or took advantage of the aﬀordability of mobiletechnology.
5.Potential Impact and Preliminary Results of
the Proposed System
x#_he proposed system is expected to help students com-municate with each other and with their educators, make iteasy to access the learning materials, help the students toparticipate in the exam development and the educationalprocess, adapt to the learners’ intelligence by changing thediﬃculty of questions in the quizzes, and collaborate insolving questions and problems through the discussionmodule.
To evaluate the impact of using the Easy-Edu, we con-
ducted an experiment on students participating in the C#programming course at the Information Technology In-stitute (ITI), Mansoura University, Egypt. “Easy-Edu” wasused as a technology tool for administering the course,supporting students’ learning experience and engagement.
x#_he participants of this study were 100 students taught
bythesameprofessor.Afterstudyingthebasicknowledgeofprogramming in a C# programming course, these partici-pantswererandomlyassignedintotwogroupstoparticipateseparately in two diﬀerent teaching methods. x#_he partici-
pants of the experimental group used Easy-Edu mobile
learning system and the control group depending on thetraditional face-to-face learning. To check if there is animprovement in students’ learning achievement after usingEasy-Edu, ﬁrst, the pre- and posttest data were analyzed.Pretest examined the level of basic knowledge about C#programming in each group by independent t-test; some
preliminary results showed that the two groups are equiv-alent. x#_he pretest mean and standard deviation for theexperimental group were (M �18.5600, SD �1.76311) andthe control group were (M �18.6000, SD �1.60357). x#_here
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the reported pretest resultsfor students who are in the control group and the experi-mental group (T (98) �0.119, P�0.906, P>0.05). x#_his
meansthatthetwogroupshavethesamelevelofknowledgeat the beginning of the course, as shown in Figure 14.
Fromtheposttestscores,wefoundthattheexperimental
group’s average learning performance and achievement aresigniﬁcantly better than students in the control group (theexperimentalgroup(M �48.1200,SD �1.66157);thecontrol
group(M �43.5600,SD �3.08492)). x#_hisshowsthattheuse
of Easy-Edu has helped to improve students’ learningachievement (Figure 15).
x#_hedetailed study will be continued in the next research
paper to describe the learning achievement, perceptions, andpedagogical experiences of learners using “Easy-Edu” system.Experimental data will be collected and analyzed from in-terviewsandaquestionnairewhichwillbegiventothestudents.
6.Conclusion and Future Work
Developing multiobjective mobile learning applications is
a big challenge. In this paper, a mobile learning appli-cation named “Easy-Edu” that would serve in Egyptianhigher education has been presented. x#_he developmentprocess of Easy-Edu system, an iOS version of theM-learning application, has been reported. It would be asolution to a large number of students in Egyptian uni-versities. BasedonAgilemethodology,theﬁrstversionof
Easy-Edu app has been designed and implemented. Easy-
Edu supports blended and collaborative learning withdiﬀerent functions that help learners to interact withcourse materials easily, eﬀectively, and eﬃciently. x#_hisproposed system is evaluated by computer science stu-dents at the Information Technology Institute, MansouraUniversity.
Toanswer the ﬁrst research question “How to make
the students participate in the educational process andexam development?” students can ask questions in the

ideas with their educators.
Toanswer the second research question “How to make
the educators communicate with the students and vice
versa?” students can ask diﬀerent questions in the dis-cussionmodulewhileotherscananswer;professor’sruleisto check the answers of the students and mark the correctanswer with a right sign, so students can see which is theright answer. Also, students can send the professors amessage with their feedback about the subject they arestudying.
To answer the third research question “How to change
questions’ level in the test and adapt according to thelearners’intelligence?”Easy-Eduisadaptiveaccordingtothestudents’ skills. It could automatically move students fromlower level to a higher level once the student answers mostquestions correctly. It is attractive to many motivatedlearners who may feel bored with low levels.
Toanswer the fourth research question “How to make
students ask questions easily and collaborate with eachother?” discussion module was made to support students’teamwork and collaboration, where each student can askthe question easily, other students can answer, and the
professor can help them mark the correct answer, so the
rest of students know the right answer.
Since the Agile process is based on iterations, the future
work will include the improvement and reﬁnement of thesystem. x#_he future work will include improving the contentof the system by adding more modules and other questiontypes like ﬁll in the blank or true/false questions. Addi-tionally, the system will be cross-platform so it can workacross multiple types of platforms/operating system envi-ronments such as Android and Windows phone.Data Availability
x#_he data supporting this research and thatused to build thesystem are from previously reported studies and datasets,which have been cited.
