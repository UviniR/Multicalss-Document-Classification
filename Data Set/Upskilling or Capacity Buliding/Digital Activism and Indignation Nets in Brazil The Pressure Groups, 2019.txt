Abstract
To understand the relevance of the new media in the formation of the indignation nets,
this text, of exploratory stamp, debates the digital activism in contemporary Brazil .
Methodologically, we will make a discussion on cyberactivism, digital media, and national
pressure groups starting from two examples, Movimento Brasil Livre (The Free Brazil
Movement) and Vem pra Rua (Come to The Street movement) – these are key
movements in the organisation of the big anti-government mobilisation that took place in
2015–2016 in Brazil. The theme is important because it embraces current and future
challenges of the digital activism, once that this field faced significant changes in the last
decades, with the development of interactive media and the technological convergence.

Introduction
The digital media1are part of people’s everyday life, giving them the chance to com-
municate with each other for a lower cost, more speed of information, sharing of news,
and reduction of physical distance. They definitely changed the shape of relationships
and, more importantly in this discussion, the way people articulate with each other.
In this digital time, the search for social transformation occurs online and offline.
Often, simultaneously, this activism is organised now by traditional ideological groups
(social movements, NGOs (Non-governmental organizations), unions, and political
parties) and by activists from the virtual space. These actors of the political games cannot
be understood separately, because usually they are related, and it complete each other.
Examples of those cyber activists groups that shape the indignation nets are all over
the globe in mobilisations as the “Arab Spring” (occurred in Middle East and Africa),
“The Angry Ones” (Los indignados – Spain), and the “Occupy Wall Street” (OWS). All
these movements as they were happening on the streets were also happening online. By
that time, the virtual nets were greatly used by individuals to share information about the
mobilisations, especially aiming to protect themselves against police repression.
On the protests mentioned earlier, each social network had a specific function. Twitter
was thoroughly used to spread real-time information; Facebook was used to promote
debates related to the themes, future summons and also shared videos and images;
YouTube and other streaming services were used for the popularisation of shocking
videos like police abuse and even small documentaries about each protest; and What-
sApp was used in the instantaneous exchange of messages.
However, to study the political activism and the pressure groups just like they work
today put us in front of some theoretical and methodological dilemmas that goes since
classic “problems” from the collective action (costs with mobilisations, groups
resources, etc.), passing through the most recent perspectives and “new facts,” to the
example of the function carried out by the new media in the mobilisation and its own
transnationalisation of the movements, due to a world more and more connected thru the
nets (Castells, 2013).
With the means of the digital technology, the current manifestations dialogues more
and share strategies as in the case of the tactics of occupation of the space used in the
movements called “Occupy” throughout the whole globe, or it is in the internal operation
and forms delegations like in the movement Indignados and OWS. These two last ones,
considering them-self without leadership, have adopted the model of Spokes Council
(nominated and alternated individuals to represent the positions in the work groups), in
the search for promoting a more democratic communication between participants and
committees, exempting this way the illustration of a single leader.
In this text, it is worth to stress, which we will focus, above all, in the relevance of the
digital media in the articulation of pressure groups, approaching the cases of the
Movimento Brasil Livre (MBL – Free Brazil movement) and Vem pra Rua (VPR –
Come to the Street Movement). The option for studying them happened due to the reach
and importance that these groups possess in the Brazilian national political scenery and
cyberspace, holding millions of followers (Table 1).110 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)Nowadays, the digital media can be seen under two antagonistic perspectives. In the
first one, optimist, it has emphasised characteristics mentioned already, as the decrease
of the cost to communicate, the speed that information goes, the elimination of the
physical distance, and the culture convergence. In the second one, pessimistic, standing
out the impoverishment of the political debate with emptier (prevailing the simplifica-
tion) discussions, the use of fake news as strategy to restating ideologies, and the loss ofTable 1. Comparison between “Free Brazil Movement” and “Come to Street.”

activism is how to overcome such different visions.
After all, although, the new media possess new ingredients, as the virtual nets online
(Online Virtual Networks2), consultation platforms to the citizen, petitions online,
among others, also maintain the same characters of the world offline and they share net
characteristics with individuals/organisations that control the information flow (Bar-
aba´si, 2009; Christakis, 2009).
Looking to explore the way that they hold the indignation nets nowadays, this text is
organised in the following way: the second section deals with methodological questions,
the third section with literature review, the fourth section on discoveries and final
considerations, and the fifth section provides bibliographical references.
Methodological Questions
King, Keohane and Verba (KKV) (King et al., 1994) defended that the largest science’s
discovery is the method and because of this the logic of a good quantitative research
doesn’t differ from the logic of a good quantitative research. Although KKV highlight
that qualitative research is better for studies of one or few cases, while quantitative
research is better fit for studies with larger number of cases, in any of the modalities it is
important to respect some points: (a) to have as objective to accomplish an interference
starting from the data; (b) to use public procedures, the worth, and corrects ones; (c) to
consider the initial uncertainty of the results; and (d) to have in mind that the body of the
research is the method.
An appropriate research will look to describe in detail a phenomenon entering in a
relevant discussion: Does the researcher interpret or does he/she infers? In agreement
with KKV, the interference has methodological rigidity as the basic element, which
cannot happen in the studies that accomplish the interpretation.
In fact, the methodological rigidity can be the most difficult part of a research, once it
is what grants credibility to the obtained results. This way, the choice on the used tools
and the configuration of the measures that will be used in the work are all parts of the
methodological rigidity.
Brady and Collier (2004) did not disagree with the idea spread by KKV that quan-
titative methods have much importance than the qualitative ones. However, Brady and
Collier are not convinced with the fact how KKV look into the quantitative methods for
qualitative research, that is, according to them, instead of recognising the relevance of
the quantitative tools, KKV were just transposing qualitative data to the other study type.
Brady and Collier criticised KKV that these would spread a supposedly “statistical
monoculture,” which would in turn base the idea of quantitative superiority, and for that,
they would stop the progress of the debates on methodology in political science.
Similarly, the methodological pluralism would be left aside, despite being said
present. In another words, one advocates for a plurality of methods, but everything is
made based on a quantitative pattern. Besides, Brady and Collier argue that the quan-
titative methods can present flaws not perceptible, especially to researchers with little
training. It is the mistakes on measurement and viability on the use of casual inferences112 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)that costs. These authors defend that the research is the one who should say which is the
best technique to be used.
For that reason, there is space for typology creation as well as for the descriptions
based on statistics and inferences originating from regression techniques. The biggest
problem for the researchers is to define the target and identify the subject from the
beginning of the project. Only by starting with a good mapping, a study can choose the
use of one or another technique and reach a relevant result.
Approaching to academic studies, KKV defend the necessity for asking an important
question to the real world and to add to that writings on the subjects that have already
been out there and specific academic field, increasing the capacity to give scientific
explanations to aspects of the world. Considering these two points, this work seeks to
reconcile a revision of the cyberactivism literature with data collected in ways that we
can study the formation of the indignation nets nowadays.
Method Applied in the Research: Description
For many years, political science has produced research studies that originated from
questions pointing out causalities between phenomena. This way, “merely descriptive”
research became “obsolete” (apologies for using this word). Although causalities and
descriptions are interlinked, one cannot be understood without the other (Gerring, 2012:
722). For an exploratory study like this one, description details better the object to be
studied and to formulate deeper questions.
The difference begins in the questions of research of descriptive works. According to
Gerring:
A descriptive argument describes some aspect of the world. In doing so, it aims to answer
what questions (e.g., when, whom, out of what, in what manner) about a phenomenon or a
set of phenomena. Descriptive arguments are about what is/was. For example: “Over the
course of the past two centuries there have been three major waves of democratization.”
(2012: 722)
The main question of this paper is “which way ...,” like this characterising a descrip-
tive research. Nevertheless, the descriptive questions are subdivided into five archetypal
forms, in line with Gerring (2012: 725):
Descriptive arguments [ ...] assume five archetypal forms: accounts, indicators, associa-
tions, syntheses and typologies [ ...]. This is how social science carves up nature at the
descriptive level. These are the patterns that we look for when attempting to describe events
in the social world.
In the first one, accounts, there is no worries about generalisations. This one is part of
an event or a collection of events that aims to exploit and describe it and not to create
general rules. This work has the same intent, to this read, to describe the event series that
gave birth to digital activism and the formation of pressure groups.Cavalcanti et al. 113Literature Review
Cyberactivism and Digital Media
The intensity and the reach of the digital activism took the contemporary world by
surprise, where the nations are suffering serious internal problems, just like political
parties and their vulnerability, procedures that reshape the possibilities of action by the
State around the world, social inequality and distrust in relation to the politicians (Sorj,
2016). These obstacles are decisive points for helping the traditional politics to lose
support and popular participation, following the example of the fidelity one have to their
political party, decreasing especially among the young (Donk et al., 2004).
The importance to study cyberactivism happens before a phenomenon that goes
beyond the territorial limits of several nations. In Europe and the Middle East, there is
extensive literature about how the movements “Paneladas” (Iceland), Arab Spring
(Middle East and Africa) and “Indignados” (The Angry Ones – Espanha) originated and
their growth (Harvey et al., 2012; Castells, 2013). In North America, the cases of OWS
and Slut Walk are all over the planet and became transnational movements (Gomes and
Sorj, 2014).
The paper of the digital media now interferes so much in the political and social world
that authoritarian governments intervene directly in the virtual world (Sorj and Sergio,
2016). A well-known case happened in Egypt, when during the Arab Spring manifes-
tation, the government of Mubarak cut the Internet access in an attempt to cure the crisis,
leaving Facebook and Twitter inaccessible to the whole country.
Nevertheless, it is not only in authoritarian government that the State acts up in the
virtual world. Democratic governments also try to make their own way inside the
cyberactivism, by giving money to traditional vehicles like newspaper and “friendly”
bloggers. All done in order to discredit virtual articulations or even to sell unpopular
actions of the government.
Another way to interfere is to use bots to increase the number of followers on Twitter
and fanpages (on Facebook), giving them more credit than they actually have. In another
words, this creates pages that are relevant thru a communicative point of view because of
the high numbers of followers and likes.
This way, the digital media make possible the interaction among people, the sharing
of news and more speed, and put the information at a better reach. However, it is also
important to have in mind that those media also help political groups reach private
benefits, before collective goals (Banda et al., 2009).
Pressure Groups, the Internet Growth, and Political Crisis
We chose the MBL and VPR as subject of our study because they are the main articu-
lators in the virtual world from the anti-government manifestations in 2015 and 2016 in
Brazil. Because of both, millions of people went to the streets, a historical record
according to research.3These protests, inflamed by the low rates of the government,
created an air of general dissatisfaction against the, by then, weak administration of114 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)President Dilma Rousseff, playing an important part from beginning to end of the
impeachment process.
To understand how pressure groups like MBL and VPR appeared, it is very meaningful
to keep in mind the following: (1) the increase the access of Internet and digital media in
Brazil and (2) the recent Brazilian political conjecture, whose executive power was, from
January of 2003 to August of 2016, under the “Partido dos Trabalhadores” (Worker’s
Party, PT). Castells (2013), for example, embraced those same categories when thought
that Turkey and Iceland gave the initial kick in the group protests after 20084in Europe and
Africa. The analyses to proceed will be first theoretical and later we will reveal the
evolution of interest for the MBL and VPR as time went by (see “Cyberactivism and
Digital Media” section), looking at them into context with their respective origins.
Now in Brazil, year after year, the number of people with Internet access increases,
together with the importance of the virtual nets in the mobilisation of people and from a
digital culture that settles down. Different searches point that since 2015 more than half
of the Brazilian population have access to the Internet: 55 per cent of the population (in
2016, according to TIC (Tecnologia da Informac ¸a˜o e Comunicac ¸a˜o (Communication and
Information Technology Research)) homes5), 57.8 per cent (in 2015, according to the
IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatı ´stica (Brazilian Institute of Statistic and
Geography))6), and 65 per cent (Datafolha,72015).
Before the huge mobilisation of 2015, the “Datafolha” research (2015) also put into
consideration the collective action theme, showing that 45 million Brazilians had already
participated in social movements, and about 13.7 million participated only thru the
Internet, 18.2 million only personally, and 13.1 million both ways. The study also iden-
tified the virtual social nets as being meaningful sources of information and knowledge:
seven in each ten Internet users found out thru the nets about social movements.
In Brazil, the articulation for mobilisation in the virtual networks, following other
nations step, grew around two main tools, Facebook and Twitter. Here, we will discuss
the first one, by considering it more important than the other one when the matter is
about articulation and collective action.
Founded in 2004, Facebook is an important tool to inform and build social rela-
tionships. At this time, Brazil is the second largest nation in user numbers with 111
million active users monthly (they visit the network at least once a month) and 82 million
users are active daily8(with at least one visit a day).
Research with Facebook groups in Chile (Ortiz et al., 2011) concluded that the tool
(i.e. important to say that the site it is not a social network on its own, but yes, a support
for the integration to exist) is mainly the enlargement of our closer social circle,
strengthening existent social bows, more than creating new ones.
Another research (Nansu Park et al., 2009) with 1,715 university students looked into
identifying the reasons that move people to signing to Facebook groups, pointing four
main needs: sociability, entertainment, search of social status, and looking for infor-
mation. The other studies (Recuero, 2014) suggest that Facebook is good at keeping
relationships that otherwise would deteriorate with time.
As the years go by, the ways people use Facebook have changed and, which was
earlier used mainly to keep in touch with “friends,” it is now seen by its own users as aCavalcanti et al. 115tool for accusations, political accusation, and information. This big virtual public
playground of discussions and convocations became essential for any type of mobili-
sation in Brazil that aims to bring millions of people to the streets.
However, in addition to the greater access to virtual networks and the Internet, what has
caused the emergence of pressure groups in Brazil in recent years? The following are two
possible ways of understanding this issue: the Brazilian political–economic crisis and the
loss of support from the PT, which historically stopped the votes of the middle class.
According to Singer (2012), during the Lula administration, there is a turnaround in
the profile of the electorate of the former pr esident, whose significant milestone was
the removal of the traditional middle class after the “Mensala ˜o” scandal (Pereira,
2011). With weak reformism (going against what economic elites wanted) and Dilma’s
failure to emerge from the crisis (Singer, 201 2 ) ,i na d d i t i o nt os u c cessive attacks on the
PT in traditional media, the lower class es also abandoned Dilma of losing recent
achievements.
As the traditional middle class had already jumped out of the boat, Dilma lost what
she had left, with strong rejection in all social strata. Thus, MBL and VPR had a fertile
ground at a time when the national left political forces were disunited and the PT suffered
the greatest political crisis in its history.
The June 2013 Days (Sousa and Ara ˜o, 2013) were possibly the starting point for the
articulation of those citizens who felt excluded from the political decisions of the period
in which the PT was at the head of the national executive. After the fierce election race
between Dilma Rousseff (PT) and Ae ´cio Neves (PSDB), in 2014, MBL and VPR gained
strength and began to promote demonstrations in Brazil.
There is controversy, however, about what caused the sudden growth of MBL, which
went on to lead other street movements even more strongly than VPR. Amaral et al.
(2016) states that international groups have sponsored MBL since its formation through a
network of right-wing foundations based in the United States, the Atlas Network, which
encompasses eleven other organisations linked to the Koch brothers9(possibly interested
in destabilising the PT government). In addition to this theory, audience10in which MBL
leaders affirmed that parties such as MDB (Movimento Democra ´tico Brasileiro), PSDB
(Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira), DEM (Democratas), and Solidariedade had
financed pamphlets, caravans, and snacks in demonstrations requested by the group.
It is important to emphasise, however, that regardless of how these groups were
maintained from an economic standpoint, they arose because of a need to unite a portion
of the society that was no longer represented by the PT government.
Among other actions, MBL and VPR began to act by pressing public and political
institutions, holding meetings for their occupations and organising live virtual chats in a
quest for a direct channel with the population. The strategy followed with videos and
photos of their self-proclaimed leaders (encouraging a sense of identity), requests for
donations from the sale of their own products – mugs, shorts, t-shirts, and so on – and the
search for new members in the virtual environment and physical, with the creation of
specific nuclei in strategic cities.
In terms of building leadership, MBL was more effective than VPR by launching two
leaders of the movement: (1) Kim Kataguiri, a nineteen-year-old economics student (at116 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)the time), who represented the youth leaving the virtual world and going to the streets,
and (2) Fernando Holiday, a black representative, but against quotas for blacks in the
colleges (an initiative from the PT government to increase the participation of the black
people on the public Federal University), also raising the liberal flag. As such, the MBL
team took on a leading role by overcoming the VPR, whose leader, Roge ´rio Checker, had
difficulties in unlinking a possible party image linked to the PSDB (Amaral et al., 2016).
Due to the growth, MBL and VPR became more studied. Moura and Yamamoto
(2016) analysed MBL’s discourse on YouTube taking into account the ideals of freedom
and country expressed by the group. The conclusion was that there is a production of
meaning whose effect is an imagined yellow–green community, from the constitution/
articulation of three semantic fields: one that deals with the (a) ideals of change; another
of the movement having the figure of a saviour, (b) field of the messiah, and finally, (c)
field of freedom, which encompasses the ideals of the group.
Firmino (2016), in turn, explored the points of contact that the MBL and VPR
establish with the “middle middle class” and the “middle middle class,” concluding that
the widespread criticism of petism,11corruption, and governments serves as the driving
force for these movements. Omena and Rosa (2015) and Cavalcanti (2017) also reached
similar conclusions.
Cavalcanti (2017), in an analysis of thousands of MBL and VPR fanpages postings in
two distinct time cuts, one in 2017 and another in April 2016 (a crucial time for Dilma
Rousseff’s impeachment), found that postings with greater engagement12criticise the PT
and the corruption of PT governments, indicating that the members of these groups,
among them the leaders, feel a greater interest/identification by guidelines in this sense.
Descriptive Analysis of Interest in MBL and VPR Over Time
To better understand the trajectory of MBL and VPR, we decided to use a widely used
tool in digital marketing, Google Trends, which provides information on the popularity
of keywords on the Internet and therefore accompanies the interest in a subject
throughout the time. We do not use other methods for analysis, such as the follow-up of
fanpages, since we already address research that does this. In summary, we explore the
terms “Movimento Brasil Livre” and “Movimento Vem pra Rua” in Google Trends, with
a five-year time cut from 6 January 2013 to 31 December 2017. In relation to VPR, we
analysed it with the term “Movement Comes to the Street” rather than just “Come to the
Street.” This is because the expression “Come to the Street” was used by several recent
mobilisations in Brazil, including those that had no relation with the group treated here.
The horizontal axis of Chart 1 represents the time line, with the total time of analysis
being 260 weeks. The vertical axis, ranging from 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100, shows the
frequency with which “Movimento Brasil Livre” was searched on Google, with 100
representing the maximum popularity of the term between the analysed period and zero
the minimum.
For our discussion, it is interesting to highlight the three main peaks of search for the
term. The first peak, from 16 June 2013 to 22 June 2013, was 32; the second, of 58,
occurred between 15 March 2015 and 21 March 2015; and the third of 100, was betweenCavalcanti et al. 11713 March 2016 and 19 March 2016. These numbers (32, 58, and 100) represent the
research interest related to the theme (metrics created by Google).
But what does this information about MBL tell us? Two main observations can be
made. The first is that the name “Movimento Brasil Livre” seems to have appeared
before the birth of the group on Facebook, even during the Days of June 2013 – it is not
known whether already with the current leaders or with other people. This doubt exists
because the birth date of the MBL fanpage is November 2014.
The second observation is related to the interest in MBL over time by Internet users,
which increased mainly during the main an ti-government demonstrations of 2015 and
2016 (the peak of 100 was reached exactly th e largest pro-impeachment mobilisation
of Dilma Rousseff, in the week of 13 March 2016). After that, the search by MBL fell
on Google. This information serves to identify a possible drop in the strength of the
group in recent times. In addition, other ev idence indicates that MBL actually lost
influence after impeachment, considering t hat the last calls made did not attract large
numbers of people.
Google Trends also shows queries related to the term being browsed. For “Free
Brazilian Movement,” the main consultations were “come to the street,” “movement
comes to the street,” “movement Brazil free Facebook,” “revoltados online,” and “MBL
movement free Brazil.” This indicates that people who enjoy MBL are also interested in
other more liberal movements and right on the political spectrum, such as VPR itself and
Revoltados Online.
The peak moments of VPR (Chart 2) are similar to those of MBL. The three largest
were in the same period, only varying the degree of interest related to the theme. The
week of 16 June 2013 to 22 June 2013 scored 46; the second peak, 49, occurred between
15 March 2015 and 21 March 2015; and the third, 100, was between 13 March 2016 and
19 March 2016.
Chart 1. Searches on Google for the term “Movimento Brasil Livre.”118 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)In relation to these moments of higher search spikes, the same comment made about
the term “Free Brazil Movement” can be made here: that the keyword “Movement
Comes to the Street” gained notoriety in the June Days and, later, in the main demon-
strations against the Dilma government – indicating that the flag of the group that most
unites people, as well as that of the MBL, is the anti-PT agenda.
In relation to the five queries related to the term “Movement Comes to Street” in
Google, they were “Movement Comes to Brazi l Street,” “Brazil free,” “Brazil free
movement,” “revolted online,” and “movem ent revolted online.” Finally, Chart 3
brings a comparison between the terms “Brazil Free Movement” and “Movement
Comes to the Street.”
Guidelines and Speeches in Different Temporal Cutouts
As mentioned, the analysed posts of the groups were two distinct time cuts, one of this
year, to capture the current moment of MBL and VPR, especially with the aggravation of
the political crisis involving President Michel Temer, and another of April of 2016, when
the Federal Chamber authorised the opening of the impeachment process of Dilma
Rousseff. Therefore, the choice of these cuts was intentional, trying to contemplate how
these groups behaved in disparate political moments: the first in a centre-left government
(Dilma) and the second in a liberal reformist (Temer). The software used to collect the
material was Netvizz v1.6., a tool that extracts data from different sections of Facebook
(groups, pages, surveys) for research purposes.
In the first time cut, the last 999 MBL and VPR posts (Table 2) were collected as of
June 23, The MBL had 999 posts in 25 days, averaging 40 posts/day, while VPR took 62
days to reach that number, an average of 16 posts/day. Comparing the 999 posts, MBL
Chart 2. Searchs on Google for the term “Movimento Vem Pra Rua.”Cavalcanti et al. 119had more comments and VPR more likes, reactions, and shares – which is surprising,
since MBL had more followers in the accompanying period.
The next step of the survey was to check posts with greater engagement, metrics that
measure audience interaction with posts on the page, through clicks, likes, comments and
shares, each with different weight. Table 3 also displays the first few lines of the
description of the posts exactly as they were in the fanpage.
Among the five posts with greater engagement of MBL, we analysed one by
one with an emphasis on how they related t o the group’s flags. The most engaging
post was a video of an elderly man reading the minutes of a Chamber session in
an incomprehensible way, “inventing” a language of his own. This video was
widely shared in Brazilian virtual networks and the MBL posted it to criticise the
council member who would be mocking the people by not taking public office
seriously.
The second post, in turn, dealt with public funding cuts for the Carnival of Rio de
Janeiro, which generated a discussion in the group about whether the state has to finance

the flag of the group of contesting the size of the Brazilian State, which should be less
interventionist according to videos that are usually shared in the fanpages of MBL and
VPR. The third post with more engagement was about a discussion between a right-wing
TV presenter on the political spectrum and a leftist federal deputy (PT), noting that the
former gave a “citizenship lesson” to the MP.
The fourth post shared a dubious news14that for the first time since redemocratisation
there would have been a right-wing politician leading the polls for the presidency: Jair
Bolsonaro. A federal deputy, Bolsonaro, is a reserve military man known for defending
the military dictatorship and for having considered torture a legitimate practice, with
political positions aligned with far-right discourses.Table 3. The Posts with Greater Engagement of the MBL.

VPR ¼Vem pra Rua.Cavalcanti et al. 121Finally, the fifth post condemned the legacy of the PT’s economic policy, suggesting
that it would have been “even worse than the party’s legacy of corruption.” At this point,
it is valid to think about reflections already made in this article, for instance, that the
MBL seems to be a liberal group whose one of its main flags is the criticism of PT
governments.
Come to Street (VPR) Posts Analysis. From the VPR, the first post (Table 4) was a
corruption investigation against the former President Lula, mentioning that he lied when
he stated that he would not own an apartment in Guaruja ´, off the coast of Sa ˜o Paulo.
Therefore, the PT appeared already in the post with more engagement of the group. The
second post praised a minister (Herman Benjamin) who judged the accounts of Dilma
and Temer, saying that he did an excellent job in calling for the coalition to be phased out
for allegedly using illicit resources from companies such as the Odebrecht contractor.15
The third post brought the PT back to the discussion, with a joke about the party
having elected three corrupt presidents: Lula, Dilma, and Temer. The fourth post has
spanned a banner that the VPR has been trying to diffuse, albeit sometimes without so
much success, that it requires the arrest of all corrupt, not just party politicians on the left.
Finally, the fifth post covered that part of the Brazilian population “admires corrupt,”
since politicians like Lula still have high popular approval.
As general comments about the posts with greater engagement of MBL and VPR, it
can be seen that they confirm that the movements hold strong criticism of the PT and the
anti-corruption flags, which will be discussed at the end of the next section.
Period of the Impeachment. The other time cut analysed (Table 5) was the impeachment
approval period in the Chamber of Deputies, the most determining factor for Dilma
Rousseff’s downfall. This time was chosen to verify the similarities and differences
between MBL and VPR of that period and the current one. Group postings were followed
ten days before the day of trial in the House (17 April 2017) and ten days later. Com-
paring them, MBL was much more active in number of posts, resulting in much more
likes, reactions, comments, and shares.
Then, we analysed the posts with greater engagement in the period. Of the five posts
with the highest MBL engagement (Table 6), three referred to impeachment as a “win”Table 5. Follow-up on MBL and VPR during Impeachment.

MBL ¼Movimento Brasil Livre; VPR ¼Vem pra Rua.122 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)(posts 1, 3, and 5). The second post, in turn, touched on anti-pro-Dilma actors, stressing
that critics of the former president would be more focused, and conscious people. The
fourth post referred to Se ´rgio Moro, a judge idolised by the MBL/VPR and criticised by
the left for allegedly pursuing the left-wing politics.
The VPR posts (Table 7) also dealt with impeachment, but most were made before the
process was approved in the Chamber of Deputies, with links on the call to the streets on
April 17 (posting with greater engagement), the impediment being a “victory” (second
and fourth) and step by step to impeachment (fifth), showing how the population should
press federal deputies through links and emails, for example. The third post, concerning
invitations to an event, criticised a possible censorship of Facebook to the group.
Comparing the two temporal cutouts, some observations can be made in relation to (I)
the posts and (II) the groups’ guidelines. As for the first point, the average posting in the
two periods followed was similar. In impeachment, the MBL averaged forty-three posts/
day, when it currently has an average of forty; the VPR, in turn, was thirteen and today
makes sixteen. It was also verified that most of the twenty posts with greater engagement
were photos (fifteen), followed by video (three), link (one), and status (one).Table 6. The Posts with Higher MBL Engagement.

VPR ¼Vem pra Rua.Cavalcanti et al. 123In terms of performance, MBL was much more active in the impeachment period than
VPR, performing about four times more postings (908 vs. 274) and therefore having
more likes, reactions, comments, and shares. Currently, although MBL post more than
VPR (reaching 999 posts in 25 days while VPR took 62 days), the latter had more likes,
reactions, and sharing in the period, and lost only in number of comments.
Regarding the guidelines, what this work was more concerned to address, always in
an exploratory way, it is worth remembering, it was seen that they are similar and that the
fight against the PT and corruption dominated. In the five posts of the MBL with greater
engagement among the 999 analysed this year, three directly addressed the PT already in
the statement; in the VPR were four.
In the time cut of impeachment (April 2016), in turn, three posts of the five with
greater engagement of the MBL mentioned t he “victory” of impeachment and another
criticised Dilma. In VPR, all five dealt wi th impeachment. Thus, this information
leads us to some reflections. The first is t hat the criticisms of the PT and corruption
that are present in the two an alysed periods indicate that the posts with greater
interaction and reach of these groups are th ose that approach/ap proached perhaps the
greatest enemy of these movements: the PT. Second, it is worth questioning why this
year, after several denunciations of corr uption against Temer and allies, like the
former presidential candidate Ae ´cio Neves, these issues were not observed among the
posts with greater engagement.
Analysis of Pages on Facebook Throughout the Existence of Groups
Data were also extracted concerning the postings of both social movements throughout
their existence, which was done to follow minimally the development of each one. First,
information was collected from the date of creation of the movements until 17 June 2017,
for the MBL and 18 August 2017, for the VPR.
MBL has an average of 4,177 likes per post on your page. Of the ten MBL posts with
the most tanned throughout its existence, seven occurred within the two-month decision-
making process of the Clearinghouse on the admissibility of the impeachment process.
The historical analysis of MBL and VPR, corroborated by Graph 1, allows the history
of these groups to be divided into three distinct moments: (1) their period of con-
solidation, from page creation to the beginning of the impeachment process of former
president Dilma Rousseff 2 December 2015); (2) impeachment period, from the opening
of the proceedings to the cassation (from 2 December 2015 to 31 August 2016); and (3)
the post-impeachment period, from Dilma’s departure to the present moment.
With the prospect of briefly reviewing how fanpage posts behaved, clouds of words
from these three different moments were created. Regarding the clouds of the MBL, two
facts caught the attention. The first (I) is that the words “movement,” “Brazil,” and
“free” were widely used in the period of consolidation of the group; then, with the
expression “MBL” possibly becoming known among the members and the press, it
became more used. The second fact concerns the events subsequent to the impeachment
of Dilma Rousseff, when the movement directed most of the criticisms to Lula, politician
who assumed the position of enemy number 1 of the MBL (Figure 1).124 Journal of Politics in Latin America 11(1)Analysing the data of the VPR movement in a similar way, it is observed that in the
periods of consolidation and impeachment there was an increasing increase in the
amount of tanned, especially in the moments of admissibility of the impediment process.
Graph 2 illustrates this.

in tanned numbers substantially over the months. In relation to the clouds of words, one
perceives an exacerbated use of “square” (Figure 2).

movement to the inability of Dilma to summon pro-impeachment movements. After the
appointment of Michel Temer as president, there was no greater use of the term “square.”
It is also worth mentioning that, after the presidential exchange, the VPR movement
reduced the posts focused on Dilma and redoubled criticism of Lula –- the same as
happened with MBL.
Findings and Final Considerations
This research sought to understand the role of new media in the formation of networks of
indignation. For this, we discussed cyberactivism, digital media, and national pressure
groups, such as MBL and VPR. Seeking to explore how networks of indignation behave
in contemporary times, we highlight that pressure groups and cases of cyber attachment
can be better understood through a contextualisation of the local reality, thinking about
access to digital media in the region and the sociopolitical conjuncture, as they have also
suggested Castells (2013) and Sorj and Sergio (2016).
In relation to the studied movements, MBL and VPR, we saw that their formation and
growth have much to do with the growth of the use of virtual networks in Brazil (mainly
Facebook), which occurred in parallel with the economic and political crisis of the
country, thus generating an agenda of common interest: criticism of the PT.
The relationship between both groups is also significant. Both MBL and VPR were
used as unifying tools for ideas that already existed in society, but they could not be
effectively united. In other words, they not only gave a voice to those who did not but
also gave a face to a group/thought that lacked leadership.
It is noteworthy, also, that the groups lost political strength after the goal achieved
(the impeachment of Dilma). However, they are still mobilised following the confron-
tation (mainly in the virtual environment) with the lefts. It is worth mentioning that we
have chosen national liberal groups for two reasons. The first is that MBL and VPR are
relatively recent and large, requiring studies to understand them, and the second is that
movements to the left are already widely researched in Brazil.
Leaving aside the ideological profile of MBL and VPR, we believe that what is
important for this and future research is to think about the use these political activists
make of the new media, directly modifying the modus operandi of doing politics,
mobilising militants and of the political confrontation (Mcadam et al., 2009).
Finally, we emphasise that the current moment is promising for research in the virtual
universe, still little studied. This text is therefore not conclusive. After all, given the age
of rapid information and numerous tools for data collection and analysis, there are
several possible ways to understand the so-called pressure groups.
To the researcher of the digital age, there is the advantage of having several tools for
collecting data in digital media available, such as R and Netvizz for Facebook, Remid
for Twitter, and NodeXL for Flickr, YouTu be, and Twitter (Recuer o, 2014). Once the
data are in hand, we have to choose a means to analyse them and seek methodological
rigour.Cavalcanti et al. 127Declaration of Conflicting Interests
