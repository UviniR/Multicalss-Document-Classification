Abstract
The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that can impact the adoption ofmobile apps for teaching-learning process focusing on the girls ’school in rural India.
The hypotheses were proposed and a conceptual model has been developed. There is asurvey work conducted to collect the data from different respondents using a conve-nience sampling method. The model has been validated statistically through PLS-SEManalysis covering feedbacks of 271 effective respondents. The study highlights theimpact of different antecedents of the behavioural intention of the students of using
mobile applications for teaching-learning process. The results also show that among
other issues, price value has insignificant influence on the intention of the girl studentsof the rural India. During survey feedbacks have been obtained from the 271 respon-dents, which is meagre compared to vastness of the population and school of ruralIndia. Only few predictors have been considered leaving possibilities of inclusion ofother boundary conditions to enhance the explanative power more than that has beenachieved in the proposed model with the explanative power of 81%. The model hasprovided laudable inputs to the educational policy makers and technology enablers and
administrators to understand the impact of the mobile applications on the rural girls ’
school of India and facilitate the development of m-learning. Very few studies beenconducted to explore the impact of mobile applications on the school education of ruralIndia especially focusing on the girls ’schools.

During last two decades there has been a considerable spurt in the educational field in
India (Donnelly and Evans 2019 ). Some experts opine that this is due to the interven-
tion of private sectors in the school education management. They only, for theirfinancial gain, have presented a show-off as opined by others (Kremer et al. 2013 ).
Hence, for ensuring development in teaching learning process in the ambience of
school education, it needs a paradigm shift (Menon et al. 2014 ). There is a clear need
to introduce a new system replacing the older systems of teaching learning process(Hines et al. 2013 ). To impart good quality of education, a special attention is to be
given on some basic issues. It is observed that there is dearth of linkage betweentheoretical learning and practical app lications in the school education level
(Tankeleviciene and Dama ševičius2009a ). To address the situation, the technology
embedded education is required as an alternative solution (Mclaren et al. 2014 ). In this
context, there is possibility of the development of school education standard if the help
of smartphones is taken, because this digital technology has become familiar to all(Papadakis et al. 2017 ). As the mobile devices are portable and usable for the day-to-
day activities of the students, they can be exploited in the education industry as well(Mulatu et al. 2018 ). Students can be offered personalized learning objects accustomed
to their previous learning level and learning style (Burbaite et al. 2014 ). Especially,
young children feel easy to interact with touch screen as like as they feel comfortable toplay with the toys (Sharkins et al. 2015 ).
Mobile application can provide easy handling by the children because a separate
keyboard and mouse will not be required here. Studies highlight that todays childrenfeel more comfortable to use touch devices like mobiles (Oliemat et al. 2018 ). Children
are found to spend considerable time in front of screen (Papadakis et al. 2017 ). In such
context, it is crucial to arrange to adopt mobile application in the school educationparticularly in rural India since in India, a massive number of children are going toschools for acquiring facilities of free and compulsory education.
Currently, digital devices are considered as a part of our culture. The digital devices
permeate the school life of children (Zaranis et al. 2013 ). As such, society demands for
digital literacy (Noh 2016 ). In this background, it appears that the tablets have occupied
a commonplace in schools today. These are being used regularly for teaching. WorldBank and other funding institutions are taking initiatives to authorise educational policymakers to purchase tablets for school education, this would yield better results(Hamhuis et al. 2020 ;N i k o l o p o u l o u 2020 ).
It is noted that children would not learn if they do not use befitting technology
(Torkar et al. 2018 ). Smart mobile devices have become a very popular medium for
primary education (Zaranis 2016 ) as well as university education (Ojino and Mich
2018 ). The students can learn by sharing knowledge through mobile apps with their
teachers and among themselves. This, of course, requires sincerity of the child users(Madden et al. 2013 ). This sincerity is dominant in the girls compared to boys (Hunter
et al. 2010 ). In this scenario, it is noted that in UK during 2014, in 70% of primary and
secondary schools, tablets have been used by school students (Al-Huneini et al. 2020 ;
Chou and Feng 2019 ; Lumagbas et al. 2019 ). Thus, mobile application is expected to
develop school education and adoption of mobile application is expected to yield better
results in the girls ’school than in the boys ’school. Hence, it will be cogent to arrange4058 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076adoption of mobile application more and more in the girls ’school of rural areas of India
(Goodwin 2012 ) at first. Mobile application in education particularly for girls, as such,
is expected to enrich the school education system leading to the establishment of smartclassroom infrastructure (Wogu et al. 2019 ) and support smart education in general
(Singh and Miah 2020 ). This would eventually enrich the community and contribute to
the sustainable development of society.
In this study we consider the adoption of mobile applications for improving
teaching-learning process in the girls ’school in the rural areas. In schools, gender
identities are reproduced and performed (Sharkins et al. 2015 ). In the same situation of
advantages or disadvantages, girls appear to be more accommodative compared to boys(Hunter et al. 2010 ), whereas when discharging obedience, girls are more amiable than
boys (Major and Santoro 2013 ). It is generally seen that boys exhibit, in general, more
unruly behaviour than girls (Lemmers-Jansen et al. 2019 ). In the rural areas, there exists
a huge achievement gap between boys and girls. The improvement of the girls ’
education through technological support is expected to provide the benefits of all-
inclusive development to the rural India.
Modern technological applications are expected to improve the education system.
This education system should be digital, and the students would learn more with ease.Throughout the world, children are using tablets for their studies (Bayles and Knoke-Staggs 2013 ) or informal technology-supported learning (Raziunaite et al. 2018 ).
Cognitive development of students is expected to be improved through mobile tech-nologies. At the same time, the governments are trying to expand education in all levels
by the application of technology (Cifuentes 2015 ). This would help for adoption of
mobile applications in education (Arnott et al. 2016 ). Different studies reveal that
learning in school level through technological help like mobile application yields betterresult than that obtained through traditional process (Hunter et al. 2010 ). Thus, the
adoption of mobile application would derive immense benefit to school education(Remmik and Karm 2012 ).
However, the adoption and equality of use of novel ICT technologies such as mobile
smartphone and applications remains a problem in rural communities even in the
advanced countries (Salemink et al. 2017 ). Now, the principal question is how students ’
acceptance intention can be aligned towards adoption of mobile application in theirschool studies?
2 Overview of related work
Studies of adoption behaviour circumscribing technology are considered a vital re-
search area in the IT domain (Cheung et al. 2019 ). Understanding the vital human
factors influencing the use of ICT could lead to transformation of education systems indeveloping countries (Barakabitze et al. 2019 ). These adoption theories and models
depend on sense of Information Science (IS), on psychology as well as on sociology.The researchers usually analyse the factors influencing human behaviour such as thefactors influencing student usage of an online learning community (Chinyamurindiet al. 2017 ). By this way, the researchers ignore contributions of other adoption models
or theories. Researchers after choosing a model that fits with the context, usually
modify that model through inclusion of some new factors and through exclusion of4059 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076some factors to achieve better results (Dwivedi et al. 2017 ). The UTAUT model
(Venkatesh et al. 2003 ) is known to have explained 70% of variability concerning to
Behavioural Intention of technology adoption. Other theories or models, on the con-trary, can interpret from 17% to 53%. Besides, we know that most widely usedtechnology adoption model is Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis 1989 ).
For example, recently the TAM model has been used to examine the factors
influencing the student usage of an online learning community in a rural South African
university (Chinyamurindi et al. 2017 ), to analyse the teachers ’perceptions of adopting
ICT for teaching at rural secondary schools in South Africa (Chisango et al. 2019 ), and
to examine the feterminants for adopting the mobile apps as learning tools for highereducation students in South Africa (Chuchu and Ndoro 2019 ). TAM and Theory
Reason Action was used to analyse the adoption of ICT into teaching based on genderdifferences in Malaysia (Lim et al. 2019 ). UTAUT and TAM was used to identify the
determinants of the adoption of mobile learning systems among university students in
Indonesia (Pramana 2018 ) as well as to analyse the factors that have an impact on the
students ’intentions and adoption of m-learning in the higher education institutions of
Jordan (Al-Adwan et al. 2018 ).nThe treatment effects (TE) model was employed to
assess the impact of ICT adoption on income diversification of rural households inChina (Leng et al. 2020 ). The adoption of cloud computing based learning resources in
underfunded, rural high schools of mainland China was analysed in (Wang and Wong2019 ).
3 Development of hypotheses
3.1 Research questions
We have adopted a holistic attempt to identify the determinants that can impact on the
children to intend to behave for acquiring basic school education with the help ofmobile applications in rural India so far as girl students are concerned. We have
included in our proposed conceptual model, the factors of TAM, factor of UTAUT
and other factors like Perceived Risk and Price Value. In this context, the followingresearch questions are to be addressed.
&How applications of mobile would influence the teaching-learning process of the
rural girls ’school education in India?
&What are the factors that would impact the intention of rural girls ’students of India
towards adoption of mobile application?
&To what extent, the Behavioural Intention of girls ’students of rural India in school
level may impact on the adoption of mobile application?
3.2 Perceived usefulness (PU)
It is a fact that even in rural India, mobile devices are being used by many people
regardless of their age, educational status, financial condition and so on. However,
mobile applications in school level education in rural India have yet not been spread to4060 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076the desired extent yet. This is presumably because the users are not aware of its
benefits. It is known from research study that adoption rate of an innovative technologywould be enhanced if consumers realize its benefit (Cheung et al. 2019 ). In terms of
TAM (Davis 1989 ), the reason of this is the conception of ‘Perceived Usefulness ’(PU).
It is defined as the conception of the user, that by use of the system, it would derivesome benefits. PU is expected to influence Behavioural Intention (BI) of the users to
adopt mobile applications (Phua et al. 2012 ). With these inputs, the following hypoth-
esis is formulated.
H1: Perceived usefulness (PU) significantly and positively impacts the Behavioural
Intention (BI) of the users (girls) to use mobile applications in teaching-learningprocess.
3.3 Perceived ease of use (PEU)
The users who would be using mobile applicat ion must feel easy to use the technology and
then the users would express his/her intention to behave for using this technology. This iscalled Perceived Ease of Use (PEU). PEU has dire ct impact on the Behavioural Intention of
users (Sathye et al. 2018). Any perceived complexity to use an innovative technology would
create impediment to the users. The users then would not exhibit his/her intention to behavefor adopting the technology. Studies of TAM and UTAUT highlight that PEU has aneffective influence over the intention of the users who would then align to use and adoptthe technology (Davis 1989; Venkatesh et al. 2003; Venkatesh et al. 2012). In terms of the
above discussions, the following hypothesis is prescribed.
H2: Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) significantly and positively impacts the Behav-
ioural Intention (BI) of the girl students to adopt mobile applications in their teaching-learning process.
3.4 Perceive risk (PR)It is explained as an idea of conviction and of risk. The users apprehend that whenever
he/she would use the system or the technology, he/she would face problems and would
sustain loss at the stage of outcome (Metag and Marcinkowski 2013 ). The students
would be using mobile apps. This mobile technology is always associated withuncertainty due to its capricious nature. The behavioural insecurity and environmentalinsecurity would negatively affect the intention of the users to use mobile apps in theirstudies (Zhang and Maruping 2008 ). If the Perceived Risks (PR) are decreased, the
users of the technology would align to use that technology and his/her adoptionbehaviour would be enhanced (Hung et al. 2006 ). The perception of risk has negative
effect on the intention. With these perceptions, the following hypothesis is formulated.
H3: Perceived Risk (PR) has a negative impact on the Behavioural Intention (BI) of
the girl students towards adopting mobile applications in their teaching-learningprocess.
3.5 Effort expectancy (EE)This belief is interpreted as an assessment of simplicity in the context of use of a new
system (Davis 1989 ). In the adoption model, it is interpreted that PEU and complexity4061 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076carry the opposite sense. In the field of study concerning technology adoption, EE is
considered as a vital and important predictor of Behavioural Intention (BI). Thisperception has been supported by other studies (Pynoo et al. 2011). These discussions
lead to help to develop the following hypothesis.
H4: Effort Expectancy (EE) has a significant and positive impact on the Behavioural
Intention (BI) of the girl students of mobile applications in the school level teaching-
learning process.
3.6 Price valuePrice value is interpreted as the money value of the product or the service provided. It is
a common experience that whenever the money value of the services or of the productsconcerned is to be shouldered by the users (here the school students or their guardians),the users ’decision towards the adoption is affected (Chong and Chan 2012 ). The price
value appreciably affects the decisions of the consumer in the decision-making mech-
anisms. The consumers ’BI is adversely affected if the user would adopt the technology
or not (Kim and Shin 2015 ). Price value is considered to have negative effect on the
BIof the users to use a new technology, that is, in this context, adoption of mobileapplications in school study by the girls (Molina-Castillo et al. 2020 ). It is also noted
that so far as an organization is concerned where the users are not scheduled to bear theprice value of the new products or the technological costs, it does not affect the BI ofthe users (Bayles and Knoke-Staggs 2013 ). In the present context, the organization is
the school. The schools are not expected to provide the students with mobiles and to
bear the costs of internet service. Naturally, in the present context, Price Value (PR) hasnegative effect on the consumer BI. With these considerations, the following hypothesisis formulated.
H5: Price Value (PR) has a significant and negative impact on the Behavioural
Intention (BI) of the girl students to adopt mobile applications in teaching-learningprocess.
3.7 Behavioural intention (BI) and adoption of Mobile application (AMA)
It is believed that best predictor of individual ’s behaviour is its intention. BI is
considered as a proximal antecedent to action. When an assessment results aneffective evaluation, it is seen that th e decision is taken for action (Ajzen and
Fishbein 2005 ). Intention is usually interpreted as expression of willingness for
attaining the target. Intention predicts behaviour (Conner and Sparks 2015 ). BI
is concerned with the conception of assessing strength of intention of an
individual which is instrumental to perform the behaviour (Ajzen and
Fishbein 2005 ). BI may be visualised as a meaningful predictor towards
performance of an activity responsive of that intention (Zhang and Guterrez2007 ). BI acts as a mediating variable. It impacts to perform a behaviour
supporting that activity to which such intention is expressed (Chen and Lu2011 ). This intention of students responding favourably to act towards using
mobile apps in their studies would help them to behave in favour of AdoptingMobile Application (AMA) in their studies. These discussions have provoked to
formulate the following hypothesis.4062 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076H6: Behavioural Intention (BI) of the users will significantly and positively affect the
Adoption of Mobile Application (AMA) in rural girls ’school of India.
With formulation of these hypotheses, the following conceptual model was devel-
oped (Fig. 1).

4.1 Preparation of questionnaire
Since the independent variables are greater in number than dependent variables, for
validation, PLS-SEM analysis has been adopted (Abdi 2010 ). The process involves
survey works. A set of questions is to be prepared. These questions (Items) in the formof statements are supplied to some usable respondents. For preparation of question-
naire, we took help of literature studies and have adopted a questionnaire that was
previously used for evaluating consumers ’adoption of mobile technology (Shukla and
Sharma 2018 ). Other concepts and questions were adopted from other studies as
follows: Effort Expectancy and Price Value –from the study on the adoption of e-
book technology for reading (Martins et al. 2018 ), Perceived Risk –from the study on
adoption of virtual learning community (Xie 2017 ). The remaining questions were
adopted from the study on mobile wireless technology adoption (Kim and Garrison2008 ), from the study on the use a tablet pc for mobile learning (Asunka 2018 ), and
from the study on the factors influencing students ’acceptance of m-learning (Abu-Al-
Aish and Love 2013 ). Eventually, 28 items have been prepared.
The questionnaire was separated into two parts. The first part of the questionnaire
contained demographic questions regarding respondent, namely age, gender, location,occupation, and marital status. This part also asked respondents to inform whether theypossess a smartphone, use Internet on their mobile, use mobile apps for learning orteaching. One item was used to measure usage of mobile for educational purposes on a
Fig. 1 Conceptual Model4063 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076binary scale of yes or no. Similarly, one item was used to directly measure usage of
mobile apps for teaching and learning in yes or no. The second section contained itemsadapted to measure the constructs of the study (Table 1).
4.2 Collection of data
We collected the data from different respondents using the convenience sampling
method. For selection of participants, we selected students and teachers of three girls ’

informed consents from the guardians of those students (students are all minors). Wealso took informed consents of the other respondents. All those 301 prospectiverespondents were given the 28 questions. They all were requested to provide theirfeedbacks within one month (September 2018). Within the stipulated period, wereceived 287 responses. The respondents were given 5 options [ Strongly Disagree
(SD) to Strongly Agree (SA) ] and the respondents were to put tick mark in one option.
The options were quantified in 5-point Likert Scale marking SD as 1 to SA as 5. Out of
287 responses, 16 responses were vague and biased as opined by the experts. We did
not consider those. We began our work of analysis with 271 usable responses against28 questions. Our survey works are within the acceptable range as items: respondentslie between 1:4 to 1:10 (Deb and David 2014 ).
The demographic information of the usable responses is shown in Table 2.

For verifying consistency of constr ucts and for their validity, Cronbach ’s alpha ( α)a n d
Maximum Shared Variance (MSV) are to be estimated. To test if the constructs ’meaning is
not very close, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of each construct is to be estimated. Thisdefect is known as multicollinearity defect (James et al. 2017). The lowest acceptable values
of LF is 0.7.7 (Barroso et al. 2010), of CR is 0.5 (Hair et al. 2018), of AVE is 0.7 (Urbach
and Ahlemann 2011), of Cronbach ’s alpha is 0.6 (Hair et al. 2018). The acceptable range of
values of VIF is 3.3 to 5 (Kock and Lynn 2012). Each value of MSV should be less than the
corresponding value of AVE. That confirms validity of each construct. All the values have
been estimated and are shown in Table 3.
All the estimates are found to be within acceptable range. It confirms the reliability,
consistency and validity of the items and of the constructs of the questionnaire.
5.2 Discriminant validity testIt is desirable that each item would fully explain its own construct and would weakly
explain other constructs. If it is confirmed, the discriminant validity is said to have been
established. For this, Average Variance (A V) should be greater than the correspondingcorrelation coefficients of that construct with other constructs. The values of theparameters are shown in Table 4. A V of each construct shown in diagonal position is
greater than the corresponding correlation coefficients shown in off-diagonal positions.It confirms discriminant validity.
5.3 Structural equation Modelling (SEM)
With the help of SEM, we can find out the relation among the latent variables. The
computation is done using IBM® SPSS® AMOS22. This modelling helps to test if themodel so provided is in order or not. It also helps to test whether the structure couldrepresent the date accurately. To achieve this, we have estimated ratio of chi square anddegree of freedom. It is 2.021 which is within the acceptable range 0 to <3 (Kline2015 ). The value of Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) is estimated as 0.909 which is greater
than its acceptable lowest value 0.900 (Hoyle 1995 ). The value of Adjusted Goodness
of Fit Index (AGFI) is found to be 0.846 which is greater than its ’allowable lowestTable 2 Demographic Information of Respondents

6 Results and findings
6.1 Results of the study
Full results with respect to the coefficient of the determination are shown in Table 5.
With all these inputs, after hypotheses testing and validation through the PLS
analysis, the model is shown in Fig. 2.
nsp>0 . 0 5 ;* p<0 . 0 5 ;* * p< 0.01; *** p<0 . 0 0 1 .
After validation of the conceptual model, the hypothesis H5 has not been supported as the
path coefficient is −0.031 with level of significance p> 0.05 (ns). Other hypotheses have
been supported. Behavioural Intention (BI) acting as a mediating variable provides mean-
ingful contribution in explaining the goal (AMA ). Power of interpretation can be assessed by
the coefficient of determinants (R2). All the exogenous variable like PU, PEU, PR, EE and
PV can explain the mediating variable BI to the tune of 52% (R2= 0.52). BI can explain the
goal of this study to the tune of 81%. The explanative power of the model is quite high. OutTable 4 Discriminant Validity Test

6.2 Findings of the study
After validation through PLS-SEM analysis, the findings of the study are as follows.&Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Effort Expectancy have signifi-
cant and positive impact on the Behavioural Intention.
&Perceived Risk has significant but negative impact on the Behavioural Intention.
&The Price Value has insignificant impact on the Behavioural Intention.
&Behavioural Intention has effective and significant influence on the goal of the study.
&The model is simple but appears to be effective since its explanative power is as
high as 81%.
7 Implication of the study
7.1 Theoretical implication
In this study, we have adopted the elements of UTAUT (Venkatesh et al. 2003 )a n d
TAM (Davis 1989 ). Since, four constructs of UTAUT model do not cover the
Fig. 2 Structural model with path weights and with level of significance4069 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076individualistic concept, we also have taken TAM into our consideration. This has been
thought to be essential since in this study with others, main stakeholders are the girlstudents for consideration of adoption of mobile application. That is why PE, PEU andespecially BI were considered as essential determinants.
Massification is dominant in rural India as India covers much more rural areas than
urban areas (Menon et al. 2014 ). The inclusion of BI as mediating variable has been
essential to analyse the individual behaviour in this context. This idea has also been
subscribed by earlier studies (Alshare and Lane 2011 ). Our proposed model has
achieved better result since the explanative power is as high as 81%. We could achievethis probably due to inclusion of better-suited beliefs. It is to note that we have selectedsome constructs from UTAUT and TAM models and included some other befittingbeliefs like PR, PV , BI. This may be considered as a special theoretical contribution ofour study. No explicit studies have been so far conducted in this issue. As such, thismodel will be helpful in this context. Trust is considered as an important factor for
analysis of adoption behaviour. In this perspective, we ought to have considered the
construct of trust. We have considered Perceived Risk (PR) as an exogenous constructinstead. Risk taking may be construed to be identical with trust (Ross Ross and LaCroix1996 ). Hence, consideration of PR as one of the variables can be considered as a special
theoretical contribution in this study.
We have not deemed it essential to consider the four moderators of the UTAUT
model. These moderators would not produce any laudable effects in the field of ourstudy. Without considering these moderators, we could achieve 81% explanative power
which is appreciably high.
7.2 Practical implicationIn this article, we have strived to investig ate how mobile applications in the girls ’school in
rural India helps to improve the school education system. We have developed a model with ahigh explanative power (81%). Study of the mode l highlights that Perceived Ease of Use has
maximum impact on the Behavioural Intention o f the users for adopting mobile application.
The designers and developers of mobile apps congenial for studies in school level should
design the apps in such a fashion that the users may feel easy to use those. Impact ofPerceived Usefulness on Behavioural Intentio n is also considerable as it comes out from the
study. The users of the mobile apps should be made aware about the usefulness of the apps intheir studies. For this, the girl students ’awareness in this context is to be enhanced. This can
be achieved by keeping the users apprised regard ing the success stories of the contribution of
mobile apps in school studies.
The model also shows that Perceived Risk has negative contribution on the Behav-
ioural Intention. This implies that the authority should keep the girl students aware
regarding the risks involved in using the mobile apps in their studies. The result alsoshows that Perceived Value has insignificant effect on Behavioural Intention. This ispresumably because the result has been arrived at by mostly having feedbacks of minorgirl students. They are naturally not aware regarding the problems of cost. However, theauthority should make the girl students aware for not using the apps unnecessarily. Thisstep might give some financial relief to the concerned guardians. This model is simpleand would help the girl students of rural India motivated to adopt mobile apps in their
school studies.4070 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–40767.3 Implication for policymakers and stakeholders
The results of the study also can be used by the policymakers in the area of education
management. The mobile apps can be effectively used to provide the opportunities forimplementing the e-learning based schooling in remote rural areas, which would enableto deliver high quality educational courses and learning objects in the STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas such as computer science and engi-
neering (Tankelevi čiene and Dama ševičius2009b ;Štuikys et al. 2017 ;C o s t e ae ta l .
2019 ) at a relatively low cost so that the digital divide between rural and urban schools,
as well as between the provinces with a differing level of economical developmentcould be effectively bridged. Based on the results of this study we recommend that theresponsible policymakers should ensure that infrastructures necessary for the use ofmobile applications are adequate in schools to encourage distance learning and m-learning. Schools and other stakeholders should make their best effort to ensure that
electricity supply and wireless internet connections are permanently available. The
training of teachers for increasing their proficiency in using educational mobile appsshould be implemented.
7.4 Limitation of study and direction for future researchThe limitations of the study are as follows.
&We have conducted our survey works with the feedbacks from the stakeholders,
especially, including the rural girl students of India, who are not adopters of mobileapplications, yet. Hence, we have taken feedbacks from the non-adopters. Hence,due attention to be given when this result would be applied to the adopters inappropriate time.
&We have included some factors in this model. We might have included other
boundary conditions like image, output expectancy and so on. Future researchersmay think of such inclusion and to check, if the explanative power can be increased.
&In the survey works, we considered 271 usable respondents. In comparison to the
vastness of rural India, this number is meagre. It should not be considered torepresent a general picture. For rendering a generic result, more responses oughtto have been considered.
8 Concluding remarks
The mobile applications have explored a new possibility to upgrade the rural schooleducation of India. It is expected that when it will be acted upon, the development ofschool education in rural India will achieve success. When girl students of school levelin rural India would use mobile technology, it will also improve the standard ofeducation in their house.
In this study we have provided a comprehensive model for technology acceptance of
mobile applications for learning/teaching. It is expected that appropriate use of this modelwould bring in the overall improvement in the standard of school education in rural India.
However, education is principally considered as a human-based endeavour. Full4071 Education and Information Technologies (2020) 25:4057–4076dependence on the technological development would never bring in the expected output.
The technological advancement can hardly identify the problems. However, to identifythese, humans might need the use and applica tion of technology. In th is juncture, the help
of mobile application might harness meaning ful results. Thus, human efforts and techno-
logical solution should stand intimately side wise for nurturing rural school education in
India. If rural school education through the girls is improved, this will not only improve the
overall health of the rural community but also would spread to the urban areas. This would
fetch societal development from all aspects. Both human efforts and use of technology arenecessary to stand side by side to ensure the long term and sustainable development in theeducation sector in India. In brief, it is concluded that:
&This technological use in school-level education, especially to girls in rural India,
would fetch appreciable development in the school education.
&Usefulness, ease of use, less complexity of the system and protection of security
and privacy would impact significantly on the intention of the stakeholders to use
this innovative technology.
&Behavioural Intention of the girl students of rural India would impact a lot on the
adoption of mobile application in their studies.
