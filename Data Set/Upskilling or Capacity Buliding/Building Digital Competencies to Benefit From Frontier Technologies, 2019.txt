The implications of current technological advances 
for labour markets and jobs have been the subject of much debate, which has largely focused on the impact of digital platforms and automation. While digital platforms are creating new types of occupations and generating entrepreneurial opportunities ‚Äì especially for women ‚Äì they can also create greater pressure on pay and working conditions, owing to work fragmentation and

2. DIGITAL SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES FOR THE 
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
In general, digital competence encompasses the 
knowledge and skills required for an individual to be able to use ICT to accomplish goals in his or her personal or professional life. Digital competencies should be perceived as not only concerned with technical skills, but more focused on cognitive and social and emotional aspects of working and living in a digital environment.
14 The notion is a complex one, and 
beyond digital literacy, implies the ability to understand media, to search for information and be critical about what is retrieved, and to be able to communicate with others using a variety of digital tools and applications. Digital competence is a multifaceted moving target, which is constantly evolving as new technologies appear.

Different types of digital competencies are needed to adapt to the changing technological landscape. Six major drivers are among those relevant for

the process of adoption, use and domestication of technologies: those required to adopt technologies, those needed in the basic use of technologies, those necessary for the creative use and adaptation of technologies, and those essential for the creation of new technologies (see box 1). These categories can be further grouped into two categories: skill sets for all and skill sets for ICT professionals (see table 2).
The most fundamental skill sets in the digital era 
are capabilities to adopt new technologies. In this context, ‚Äúdigital literacy for all‚Äù is a basic requirement to enable every citizen to participate fully in the digital society.
18 This involves basic education and literacy, 
as well as familiarity with technological devices.19

teenagers might be better able to navigate the Internet than adults, it does not imply that they are digitally savvy and aware of the risks involved.

 29,30 
Research shows that occupations such as engineering and science are less susceptible to digitalization and computerization because these professions involve a higher degree of creativity and innovation compared with others.
31 Occupations that involve sophisticated 
communication skills are also less likely to become redundant in the digital era: natural language processing algorithms can detect emotions underlying text but are often inaccurate in grasping sarcasm, humour or irony. When equipping a future workforce with complementary soft skills, it is also important to develop critical and logical thinking abilities, which are vital when preparing young people with abilities in problem-solving and decision-making. Table 3 presents a non-exhaustive list of complementary skills.

B. DIGITAL COMPETENCIES FOR DIFFERENT 
ECONOMIC SECTORS 
Education and training programmes that focus on 
digital skills for all, including training on the adoption and use of technology, need to be inclusive and accessible to everyone. However, the needs for digital competencies vary according to the sectors of the economy and the level of development of countries. Nevertheless, digital competencies are becoming important in all sectors of the economy from agriculture to industry and services due to the 
increasing ubiquity of ICTs and growing capabilities 
of new technologies. Box 4 shows the potential contribution of recent technological advances to the agriculture sector.

Needs for digital competencies also vary according 
to different countries‚Äô economic structures. Where relatively small-scale agriculture is dominant, basic digital literacy of new technologies such as mobile phones is essential to improve access to information RQ IRU LQVWDQFH ZHDWKHU PDUNHWV DQG ∆ÑQDQFLDOservices. Empirical research in rural India shows that mobile phones can be useful information tools to connect remote farmers with agricultural experts via video messages. The ability to use these mobile agricultural services can improve farmers‚Äô agricultural knowledge, which in turn could translate to better output and thus income.

While education on basic ICT use facilitates rural 
development, ICT professionals who can modify WHFKQRORJLHVDUHHTXDOO\LPSRUWDQWLQWKLVFRQWH[W)RUexample, the mobile technology used in rural India is created around local issues and knowledge.

 
In countries where technology development remains 
in its early stages, it is important to strengthen basic technical skills and generic skills. Once users and companies in the country have adopted and domesticated the technology, more sophisticated professional skills and ICT complementary ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù become important for the innovation of domesticated technologies in the country. Throughout the adoption and integration process of technology, policy interventions should be both selective and geared towards maximizing the outcomes of economic development.

Countries in which the manufacturing sector dominates 
the economic growth will require a workforce with specialized skills in industrial robotics, automation and the Internet of Things. As automation becomes more sophisticated, there is an increasing need for workers to minimize the risk of being displaced by machines. On-the-job training activities can help to reduce this risk. To date, this displacement remains, however, a phenomenon limited to a few countries with skill-intensive manufacturing, particularly in electronics and automobiles.
47,48 Nevertheless, a workforce able 
to use new technologies is important to incorporate digital technologies into manufacturing and avoid bottlenecks.

Particularly, researchers, universities and Governments in low- and middle-income countries are often excluded from the newest research because their institutions cannot afford the high cost of journal subscriptions. There are different initiatives which aim to remedy this lack of access. Open access publishers, such as the Public Library of Science, distribute digital copies of research articles online and provide open access for users.

Building the appropriate digital competencies, including soft skills, can only be achieved when training is incorporated at all levels of education (primary, secondary and tertiary, including vocational training) and as part of lifelong updating of skills for the workforce.
Building digital competencies at school
Education policies need to emphasise the importance of digital training for primary, secondary and tertiary education students. However, digital skills training cannot be a static curriculum. Programmes need to be revised regularly to adapt to the changing technological landscape. It is important to consider teaching a broad range of skills, from simple operations of desktop computers and text processing tools to more rigorous courses so that students learn to understand fundamental computing languages, and to establish their algorithmic thinking skills. %R[}GHVFULEHVVHYHUDO,&7WHDFKLQJLQLWLDWLYHVIRUprimary schools in implementation in countries that

Some examples of country initiatives are as follows:

However, there is a lack of teachers‚Äô use of digital media to present teaching materials, to assist in students‚Äô assessment and to deliver digital competencies‚Äô training. Noticing the gap in teachers‚Äô ICT knowledge, many projects that aim to improve education in developing countries emphasize teacher training in digital competencies.
99 The initiatives presented in 
box 8 illustrate how teacher training in ICT and digital technologies as a pedagogical strategy is slowly becoming an integral part of teacher training.

Digital competencies as part of vocational 
training 
Introducing professional digital skills training, such 
as coding, data analysis and e-business skills, can help young people seize new opportunities offered in the future job market. Vocational training can help to provide these competencies because of its applied nature and the fact that it directly prepares students for employment. To ensure meaningful digital skills training, vocational education schools need to cooperate closely with industries to keep their curricula in line with industries‚Äô technological development and thus their arising labour force needs. 
Creating interfaces between schools and industries 
can help facilitate this collaboration. This type of joint curriculum development is already in place in traditionally strong vocational education systems, such as Switzerland. Swiss State partners and sectoral professional organizations are jointly responsible for vocational education content. This cooperation ensures updated curricula which are relevant for industries‚Äô needs.
106 Consequently, 
in these systems with institutionalized curricula updates, industry leaders at the technology frontier contribute their experience with new technologies and are the ones to demand up-to-date teaching for new technology adoption. Through this integration in country-wide curricula, innovative skills diffuse

Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to think more in terms of skills ‚Äì and less in terms of jobs ‚Äì and match those skills with labour market needs. In a context of rapid technological advances digital skills training needs to stay up to date to provide relevant professional skills for adult students. Therefore, it is essential to develop the skill to learn continuously. Along these lines, the term ‚Äúlearnability‚Äù ‚Äì the desire and capability to develop in-demand skills to be employable for the long term ‚Äì has recently emerged to describe the key attribute that employers seek in an environment of rapid technological change.

Box 9 describes country examples of programmes aimed at providing on-the-job training.

B. ENABLING ENVIRONMENT TO SUPPORT 
SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
The creation of an environment facilitates building 
digital competencies and contributes to leverage their potential. An enabling environment is promoted through investment in infrastructure, institution development and collaboration among stakeholders, among others.
Investment in digital infrastructure
A fundamental element of the digital capacity of countries is their digital infrastructure. Only those that are connected and have the required capabilities will be able to take advantage of the development opportunities offered by technological changes. Therefore, in addition to investing in capacity-building, it is essential to reduce the digital divide. This can be achieved, for example, by investing in digital LQIUDVWUXFWXUH(VWLPDWHVVKRZWKDWDOPRVW}ELOOLRQpeople ‚Äì more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì do not have Internet access.

 121
Broadband connectivity in developing countries, when available, tends to be relatively slow and expensive, limiting the ability of businesses and people to use it productively. In LDCs, landlocked countries and small island developing States, geographical and resources constraints, and low population densities make rapid returns on capital for building extensive Internet LQIUDVWUXFWXUH WR UHPRWH UHJLRQV PRUH GLI∆ÑFXOW IRUprivate investors.

In this regard, LQWHUQDWLRQDO ∆ÑQDQFLDO LQVWLWXWLRQV DQG GHYHORSPHQWpartners have an important role to play, alongside private sector businesses and governments.
Investment in digital infrastructure also includes 
investing in data resources and the facilities and capabilities for collecting, analysing and using big data.

123 This gap between school and home use 
of ICT is wider in developing countries where villages and local communities have shortages of public ICT facilities. As a way to reduce the digital access gap, ConnectHome, a public‚Äìprivate collaboration in the United States of America, provides free or low-cost broadband access, devices and digital literacy training to low-income families, aiming to narrow the digital divide at home.
124 Similarly, in 
Canada, the Affordable Access programme supports Internet service providers to offer affordable Internet packages and refurbished computers to low-income families.

Policy and institutional development
To build digital competencies, it is essential to have appropriate institutions that set rules creating LQFHQWLYHVWKDWPRWLYDWHZRUNHUVPDQDJHPHQW∆ÑUPVuniversities and other entities to adopt and develop the necessary skills. These institutions include laws and regulations, organizations such as vocational and community schools to support professional training and lifelong learning, universities and research centres that develop digital technologies and their applications, and non-governmental and social organizations that provide support to the wider society for digitalization, adoption and use.

 4. Initiatives to help build competencies22Building Digital Competencies to BeneÔ¨Åt from Frontier Technologies
5. KEY FINDINGS AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
Digital technologies are already producing an impact 
on many areas of social and economic life, including employment opportunities. The deployment of existing and emerging technologies offers potential to support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly in areas such as health, education, agriculture, new enterprise development, gender equality and environmental sustainability. However, rapid technological change also creates concerns and challenges, since new technologies can also increase inequalities. Building digital competencies can help countries maximize WKHEHQH∆ÑWVDQGUHGXFHWKHQHJDWLYHHIIHFWVRIQHZtechnologies in societies. 
7KLV∆ÑQDOVHFWLRQVXPPDUL]HVWKHLVVXHVDGGUHVVHG
in this study and discusses the implications for national government policies and for the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development. 
A. BUILDING DIGITAL COMPETENCIES 
THROUGH EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORKS
Education policy needs to accommodate new 
requirements for digital skills‚Äô training schemes, making digital competencies part of the education goals. Depending on the type of skills that needs improving, policymakers can shape training of digital competencies at three points in time of an individual‚Äôs learning career: incorporating digital skills training at school, providing on-the-job training and embedding digital skills training in lifelong learning.  
Policies should incorporate the provision of digital 
competencies and complementary soft skills, including entrepreneurship. This should take into consideration best practices and local contexts and needs, and ensure that education is technology neutral.
140 Also, efforts need to be devoted to 
promoting the study of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, particularly among female students, while also recognizing the importance of studies that incorporate the arts within traditional technical subjects. Training also should be provided to teachers, particularly in areas such as digital skills and computational thinking. 
140 ,QRWKHUZRUGVHGXFDWLRQWKDWGRHVQRWSURPRWHVSHFL∆ÑF
technologies.Capacity-building in these areas can be provided 
in combination with training in other general skills, 
such as entrepreneurship and soft skills, and should 
consider mandatory training in gender bias awareness.

stakeholders in the provision of training of broad digital competencies for the workplace and in wider social life, lifelong learning capabilities and entrepreneurship 
skills.
B. CREATING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT: 
INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
While direct interventions through education and 
training are critical for digital competencies, the creation of an enabling environment that makes actual 
access possible through investment in infrastructure 
and institutional development is also crucial. Policies aimed at establishing adequate ICT infrastructure include promoting investment in infrastructure and data resource capabilities, including facilities for data 
collection, storage and transmission; capabilities 
for big data analysis and decision-making; and DSSURSULDWHWRROVWRSURYLGHDQGEHQH∆ÑWIURPRSHQgovernment data. Initiatives that encourage and 
facilitate investment and labour participation in the digital economy include the promotion of online 
SODWIRUPVFRPPXQLW\DFWLYLWLHVDQG∆ÑQDQFLDOLQFHQWLYHV(for example, tax breaks and low-interest bank ORDQV∆ÑQDQFLDOVXSSRUWIRUVPDOODQGPHGLXPVL]HG
enterprises engaged in digital technology, promotion 
of e-business and entrepreneurship, and automation or digitalization of existing businesses.
The development of digital competencies also 
requires the appropriate institutions to set rules WKDWFUHDWHLQFHQWLYHVWKDWPRWLYDWHZRUNHUV∆ÑUPV
universities and other organisations to adopt and 
develop the skills needed. These institutions include laws and regulations, training institutions, research centres, non-governmental organizations and social organizations that provide support to society for the 
creation, adoption, adaption and use of technologies. 
)XUWKHUPRUHHIIRUWVWRLGHQWLI\WHFKQRORJLFDOWUHQGV
can improve the capacity of people, organizations and Governments to adapt to change. In this context, implementing support mechanisms to identify trends 23
in ICT development and skills needs, such as foresight, 
can help the design and adaptation of capacity-development policies and can help workers and organizations meet current and emerging demands for competencies.
C. ESTABLISHING INITIATIVES THAT 
PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
Digital technologies offer new scope for 
entrepreneurship because digitalization brings about fundamental changes to the organization of production, how businesses are set up and who can become an entrepreneur, even without a lot of capital. Special attention should be devoted to policies and partnerships that target the creation and strengthening of digital competencies and skills in youth and women.
D. SUPPORT COLLABORATION AMONG ALL 
STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
Collaboration among stakeholders, including public‚Äì
private partnerships, should be promoted to support infrastructure development and the building of data facilities.
