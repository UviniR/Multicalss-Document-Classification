Key Messages
nWe piloted peer mentoring with WhatsApp for
immunization capacity building of maternal andchild health (MCH) nurses in the Lari and
Machakos subcounties of Kenya.
nEach mentor was assigned 4 mentees and
provided on-site mentoring and hands-on trainingfor 1 year. WhatsApp networking groups supportedpeer-mentoring efforts.
nIn both subcounties, we observed positive changesin mentees ’immunization knowledge, skills, and
practices.
nThe WhatsApp platform improved mentees ’
engagement with peers and promoted discussionand learning.ABSTRACT
Evidence from available studies suggests that peer mentoring is a
useful tool to build health workers ’knowledge, skills, and prac-
tices. However, there is a dearth of research on use of this meth-
od of learning in immunization programs. Although WhatsApphas been used as a networking platform among health care pro-fessionals, there is limited research on its potential contribution toimproving the immunization competencies of health workers. This
study showed that peer mentoring and WhatsApp networking are
useful blended learning methods for need-based and individual-ized capacity building of health workers providing immunizationservices. Future research to assess the comparative cost-benefit be-tween classroom-based training and peer mentoring (along with
WhatsApp networking) will be useful.
INTRODUCTION
Askilled workforce is an important determinant for a
successful public health program to achieve uni-
versal health coverage.1However, the health workforce
is not always empowered to address current and future
population health issues.2Health systems in many coun-
tries often lack adequate and equitable support systemsfor health workers.
3,4
Training for health care providers has traditionally
been provided within the health system in the form of
classroom-based methods, usually conducted at the capi-tal or district levels.
1,5Immunization training has until re-
cently been predominately via classroom-based lecturesusing guidance such as the World Health Organization(WHO) immunization modules.
6Increasingly, however,
learner-centered education methods are being utilized toencourage active participation and learning, with the tra-ditional lecture method complemented by coaching anddiscussion.
7,8Nursing education has used peer learning
to help develop skills, critical thinking, and self-confi-dence.
9,10In the conventional mentoring approach, a
trainee is assisted by senior staff for their professional de-velopment.
11,12However, relationships with peers offer
important alternative benefits compared to conventional-ly defined mentors.

Mentoring has been used widely in health pro-
grams to build health worker capacity. It has been
used for quality improvement of clinical care,14–16
laboratory services,17sexual and reproductive health
and HIV/AIDS care,18–20clinical nutrition,21and
health research.22Evidence on use of mentoring for
immunization capacity building of health workers is
limited, as immunization training is traditionally
classroom based. Standardized immunization compe-tencies for health workers have more recently been
established for workforce development.
23Despite
the common practice of classroom-based training,
peer training for routine immunization was found to
improve skills and practices.24
With the availability of smartphones, social me-
dia applications are increasingly used for networkingand learning among health care professionals.
25,26
WhatsApp is a popular platform among health care
professionals to network, communicate, and learnfrom each other.
27,28WhatsApp is easy to use,
a l l o w su s e r st os e n dt e x tm e s s a g e st oam a x i m u m
of 256 people at once, and provides free video
and image sharing.29,30Evidence on the use of
WhatsApp in the field of immunization is limited.However, WhatsApp use was documented during
measles supplemental immunization activities for
communication and coordination among healthworkers
31as well as for social networking with par-
ents to promote seasonal influenza vaccination
among young children.32
In this case study, we piloted peer mentoring
with WhatsApp for immunization capacity build-
ing of maternal and child health (MCH) nurses in
the Lari and Machakos subcounties of Kenya. Weaimed to document the processes and outcomes of
using these training tools for immunization capaci-
ty building of MCH nurses. We included WhatsApp
as the learning platform to be used in conjunctionwith face-to-face peer mentoring because all MCHnurses reported already having a personal smart-phone and using WhatsApp. Additionally, WhatsApphas been used by the subcounty health managers foradministrative communication with health workers.
This study was implemented from November 2017 to
June 2019.
PEER MENTORING PROGRAM
DESCRIPTION
The peer mentoring and WhatsApp study for immu-
nization capacity building of MCH nurses consistedof the following steps: site selection, participant(mentee and mentor) selection, formative research,training of mentors, on-site mentoring, and net-working using the WhatsApp platform ( Figure 1 ).
1. Study Site Selection
In December 2017, using 2016 pentavalent-3 im-
munization coverage data extracted from the healthmanagement information system (with 60% vac-cine coverage rate as the cutoff), Lari subcounty(58% coverage) in Kiambu County and Machakossubcounty (53% coverage) in Machakos County
were selected. Lari and Machakos represent typical
Kenyan rural and urban subcounties, respectively.In Lari, some health facilities lacked electricity andw a t e rs u p p l y ,w h e r e a si nM a c h a k o sa l lh e a l t h

Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 202facilities had urban amenities (paved road, electrici-
ty, and water supply).
A total of 40 health facilities (20 in each sub-
county) were selected to study the peer mentoring
and WhatsApp capacity-building program. The
criteria used for selecting health facilities werepentavalent-3 immunization coverage (60% vac-cine coverage rate as the cutoff) and dropout rateof pentavalent vaccine from first dose to third dose(>10% as cutoff). The selected sites in Lari were
12 (60%) public health facilities, 4 (20%) faith-based organizations (FBOs), and 4 (20%) private
health facilities; and in Machakos, 15 (75%) were
public health facilities, 2 (10%) FBOs, and 3 (15%)private health facilities ( Table 1 ).
2. Study Participant Selection (December
2017)
Study participants were selected in December
2017. In each subcounty, with the support of sub-county health officials, the MCH nurse who wasresponsible for providing the immunization ser-vices at each target health facility was identifiedand selected as a mentee. A total of 40 MCH nurses(20 in each subcounty) were selected to participate
as mentees in the intervention. In Lari, 17 of the
selected mentees were female (85%) and 3 (15%)were male, and in Machakos, 15 (75%) menteeswere female and 5 (25%) were male ( Table 1 ).
A total of 10 MCH nurses (5 in each subcounty)
were selected to be peer mentors. Criteria formentor selection were: (1) belonged to a healthfacility that was high performing in immunization,
(2) willing to work as a peer mentor, and (3) had
prior experience as a mentor in other health pro-
grams. All 5 mentors in Lari were female, and allbut 1 mentor in Machakos were female.
3. Formative Research Using a Human-
Centered Design Approach
In January 2018, formative research was conducted
using a human-centered design (HCD) approach in19 low- and high-performing health facilities select-ed conveniently (10 in Lari and 9 in Machakos). The
HCD methodology was used to understand how
existing capacity among MCH nurses and availablecommunication resources could be utilized to buildpeer-to-peer immunization competencies and toco-design the peer mentoring and WhatsApp net-working approach with the primary users. In-depthinterviews were conducted with 16 MCH nurses(mentors and mentees) and supervisors in Lari and
15 MCH nurses (mentors and mentees) and super-
visors in Machakos to gain insights on contextualand systemic factors, health care context, and super-vision and training, structure and knowledge, andculture and communication. We asked the follow-ing key questions: how can immunization knowl-edge of MCH nurses be increased and barriers
to performance be decreased; how can technical
awareness be increased; how can dialogue be initiat-ed among MCH nurses; and how can the culturalnorms be shifted to improve adherence to immuni-zation policy. Models of archetype MCH nurses

Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 203were created to represent their needs, values, and
behaviors. Based on the findings, prototyped inter-vention concepts of peer mentoring and use ofWhatsApp were created and tested. Important take-aways from the formative research were:
1. Peer mentorship must be built on a founda-
tion of trust. This allows nurses to feel com-fortable having conversations with peers,leading to open exchanges of knowledge andskills.
2. Moderators of the WhatsApp networking
groups must demonstrate an open-forum dia-
logue to make members feel comfortable to
participate and create an environment that isconducive to free discussion while also en-hancing the mentees ’knowledge.
4. Mentor Training
A 2-day orientation training in March 2018 was
conducted for the mentors in each subcounty to
introduce the processes, steps, and challenges ofpeer mentoring and the use of WhatsApp net-working to enhance learning beyond face-to-facementoring. Mentor training did not include tech-nical aspects of immunization with the assump-tion that they had the required immunizationknowledge.
5. On-site Peer Mentoring
From April 2018 to March 2019, mentors metwith mentees in their health facilities at leastmonthly. Each mentor was assigned 4 mentees.During the first mentoring visit, the mentorreviewed the baseline assessment findings withthe mentee. The pair then discussed and priori-
tized the learning agenda and mentoring goals for
the peer-mentoring sessions. The learning agendafor the mentoring sessions in both subcountieswere: monitoring and data use, record keepingand reporting, problem solving, supply chain, in-creasing immunization coverage, cold chain man-agement, administering vaccines, and interpersonalcommunication with caregivers. During subsequentmentoring visits, mentors provided hands-on train-
ing to mentees in the designated immunization
technical areas. On-site peer mentoring occurredfor 1 year (April 2018 –March 2019).
6. Networking Using WhatsApp
To support peer-mentoring efforts, WhatsApp
groups were formed in both subcounties. The
mentors ’group was formed in April 2018 and
was cofacilitated by the research coordinator withsupport from the subcounty Expanded Program
on Immunization (EPI) focal person. The mentees ’
group was formed in July 2018, with both men-
tees and mentors participating, and was facilitatedby the mentors on a rotating basis (with initialsupport from the research coordinator).
Each mentor was provided 1,000 Kenyan
Shilling (US$10) for transport costs and 500 KenyanShilling (US$5) per mentoring visit for lunch. Inaddition, each mentor was given 500 KenyanShilling (US$5) monthly for mobile phone airtime.Mentees were given 300 Kenyan Shilling (US$3)
monthly for mobile phone airtime for participation
in the WhatsApp group.
DATA COLLECTION METHODS
Baseline Assessment
In February 2018, baseline data collection wasconducted to assess current immunization knowl-edge, skills, and practices of the 20 selected MCHnurses (mentees) at the 20 selected health facili-ties in each subcounty (total 40 in both subcoun-
ties). Data collection was done by 2 research
coordinators (consultants) using an electronicdata collection tool (Survey CTO) consisting of aone-on-one interview with the MCH nurse andan observation portion where the research teamassessed the nurse ’s immunization skills and prac-
tices during a facility immunization session. The
research coordinators were oriented on the survey
tool by the principal investigator. The baseline as-sessment included: health facility type and owner-ship; demographic information; human resources;immunization strategy and plan; cold chain man-agement; availability of vaccines; availability ofvaccination logistics; and availability of financial
resource, supervision, and immunization program
monitoring.
Concurrent Monitoring
Starting in April 2018, during each mentoring vis-it, mentors recorded each mentee ’s learning prog-
ress using a CommCare digital checklist (a mobileapplication). This app was used for real-time track-i n go fm e n t e e s ’progress on the learning agenda.
Additionally, postings in the WhatsApp groups of
mentors and mentees were transcribed for reviewof the key themes of discussions within the network.Mentors shared mentoring experiences and chal-lenges in their WhatsApp group. Mentees sharedimmunization technical questions, challenges, andsystemic issues in their WhatsApp group.Peer Mentoring and WhatsApp for Immunization Capacity Building of Health Workers www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 204Endline Assessment
The endline assessment was conducted in March
2019 by the same consultants who conducted the
baseline assessment. It was conducted in 34 of the40 initially selected health facilities (19 in Lari and
15 mentees in Machakos). Six private and faith-
based health facilities (1 in Lari and 5 in Machakos)dropped out of the mentoring program. A total of
6 mentees in these facilities were furloughed by the
facility management due to economic conditions.All 34 remaining mentees (19 in Lari and 15 in
Machakos) were assessed for immunization knowl-
edge in the endline assessment. However, immuni-zation skills and practices were assessed in only 30 of
the mentees (17 in Lari and 13 in Machakos). The
skills of 2 mentees in each sub-county could not beassessed because the facilities did not have immuni-
zation sessions on the day that the data collectors
visited. The survey tool (Survey CTO) that wasused in the baseline was also used in the endline as-
sessment. In addition to the interviews for knowl-
edge assessment and skill observations, the endlineassessment also included a qualitative component
in the form of focus group discussions (FGDs). Four
FGDs (1 with mentors in each subcounty and 1 with10 randomly selected mentees in each sub-county)
were conducted to gather the perceptions of
mentees and mentors on peer mentoring andWhatsApp as methods of learning. The key FGDquestions focused upon effectiveness of peer men-
toring and WhatsApp in improving the knowledge,
skills, and practices of mentees for immunizationservices; how different peer mentoring was from
other methods of capacity building; what the chal-
lenges in the process of peer mentoring were, andhow useful WhatsApp was as a complement to peer
mentoring for building immunization capacity.
Ethical Review
The research protocol was reviewed by JSI Research
and Training Institute institutional review board,exempted from human subject oversight, and ap-proved by the Ministry of Health in Kenya. Writtenconsent was obtained from all study participantsbefore administering the study questionnaires. In
addition, written consent was received from both
mentors and mentees before forming WhatsAppgroups for networking. Participants ’names were
not collected in the data collection forms, and the in-formation they provided was kept confidential dur-ing data collection, storage, and analysis.
Data Analysis
The CommCare checklist data were analyzed inMicrosoft Excel using a scoring system. Pointswere given by researchers based on the observed
competency of the mentees in each immunization
technical area during the mentor ’s visit: 0 points, if
the mentee was not observed to be performing inthe technical area; 1 point, if the mentee neededsubstantial support and on-site training in thetechnical area; 2 points, if the mentee showedprogress but still needed on-site support in thetechnical area; 3 points, if the mentee could per-
form without support in the technical area but still
needed to be observed to confirm the proficiency;and 4 points, if the mentee demonstrated profi-ciency and could be fully independent. The scoreswere averaged for all technical areas and for allmentees quarterly for each subcounty.
Baseline and endline quantitative data on
knowledge, skills, and practices of mentees wereentered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel, andfrequency tables were generated. McNemar ’s test
was used with paired proportions of baseline and
endline data to examine the improvement inmentees ’immunization knowledge and skills,
and practices. Risk ratio (RR) was computed withprobabilities of gaps in mentees ’knowledge, skills,
and practices at endline and baseline assessment.
The postings in WhatsApp groups were tran-
scribed quarterly into an electronic database to as-sess the participation of mentors and mentees in
the groups and to identify immunization technical
areas of discussion. The endline qualitative datawere transcribed into an electronic database andanalyzed based on emergent themes on percep-tion of mentees and mentors regarding peer men-toring and WhatsApp networking as methods ofimmunization learning.
RESULTS
On-site Mentoring Visits
Concurrent monitoring (CommCare) data indicatedthat the mentoring visits varied between the 2 sub-counties. In Lari, most mentees (95%) had between
9 and 12 mentoring visits and 1 received more than
12 visits over the course of the study. In Machakos,slightly more than half (53%) of mentees had be-tween 9 and 12 visits, 40% received 5 –8 visits, and
1m e n t e eh a dl e s st h a n4v i s i t so v e rt h ec o u r s eo fthe study ( Table 1 ). Turnover of the mentees in
some health facilities affected the number of men-
toring visits received by mentees.
Mentoring Visit Technical Content
CommCare data indicated that immunization
technical content covered during mentoring visitsPeer Mentoring and WhatsApp for Immunization Capacity Building of Health Workers www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 205was similar in both Lari and Machakos; however,
prioritization of the content areas by the menteesdiffered. In Lari, prioritized content areas (rankedfrom highest to lowest) were: record keeping andreporting, reaching every district strategy, moni-toring and use of data, vaccine supply manage-ment, increasing immunization coverage, coldchain management, interpersonal communica-
tion with caregivers, and administering vaccines.
In Machakos, ranking of content areas (highest tolowest) were: recording and reporting, vaccinesupply management, cold chain management,monitoring and use of data, administering vac-cines, interpersonal communication with care-givers, increasing immunization coverage, andreaching every district strategy.
Mentees ’Capacity-Building Progress
Analysis of CommCare data showed a steady in-
crease of mentees ’average scores in capacity
building across all technical areas in both sub-counties between the launch in April 2018 and
the end of the peer mentoring program in March
2019 ( Figure 2 ). However, the average score in
Lari dipped in October 2018, since mentors were
not able to complete the assessment of all men-
tees’progress in all technical areas by the October
2018 cutoff point.
Networking Using WhatsApp
Analysis of transcribed WhatsApp data showed
that both mentors and mentees activelyparticipated in the WhatsApp groups and posted
knowledge questions, opinions, and experiences
in their respective groups. The total number of
postings in the mentors ’group (April 2018-
March 2019) in Lari was 239 (average 20 post-ings/month) and in Machakos was 220 (average18 postings/month). Posting in the mentors ’
groups in both subcounties dropped steadily fromapproximately August 2018 onward as mentors
shifted to sharing their postings in the mentees ’
groups after their formation in July 2018 ( Figure
3).
The total number of postings in the mentees ’
group (July 2018 –March 2019) in Lari was 292 (av-
erage 32 postings/month) and in Machakos was345 (average 38 postings/month). There was a de-cline in postings in the mentees ’groups in November
2018–January 2019 quarter in both subcounties due
to the holidays; however, postings in both the sub-
counties increased in the following quarter ( Figure
3). The discussion topics ranged from technical areas
of administering vaccines and cold chain manage-ment to interpersonal communication with care-givers and increasing immunization coverage ( Box).
Mentee Knowledge Acquisition
In Lari, comparing baseline with endline assess-
ment data, positive changes in mentees ’knowl-
edge were found in 11 of 12 immunizationtechnical areas ( Table 2 ). Highly statistically

washing practices were not observed in Lari, mostlikely due to lack of running water or hand saniti-zer in the health facilities. No changes wereexpected at endline on correct diluent use forBCG and measles and rubella vaccines, as thispractice was found to be 100% at baseline.Negative changes for vaccine vial monitor check-ing before vaccination and completing the motherand child card accurately were due to new orreplaced mentees who did not have adequatementoring visits. Negative changes on availabilityof vaccines and vaccination materials (e.g., syringeand needles) were due to inadequate supply from
sub-county offices.
In Machakos, positive gains in skills and prac-
tices were found in 11 of 17 observed activities
(Table 5 ). Highly significant changes were found
for: handwashing before vaccination ( P=.0053,
RR=0.44); maintaining the temperature chart ofthe vaccine fridge ( P=.0005, RR=0.33); daily BCGvaccination ( P=.0053, RR=0.30); and providing
daily measles and rubella vaccination ( P=
.0148, RR=0.32). No change was expected forcompleting the mother and child card accurately,
as this was found to be 100% in the baseline as-
sessment. Negative changes for checking vaccinevial monitor before vaccination and marking thetally sheet after each vaccination were due tonew or replaced mentees who did not receive ade-
quate mentoring visits. Significant negative
changes on availability of vaccines and motherand child health card were due to inadequate sup-ply from subcounty health offices.
Perception on Using Peer Mentoring
Most mentees indicated that peer mentorship was
useful in building their individualized capacity in
providing routine immunizations services. Mentees
reported that constant support, tracking progress,and positive feedback from mentors during peermentoring sessions were instrumental in buildingknowledge and skills.

Mentees added that peer mentoring was dif-
ferent from classroom-based training. Mentorsaddressed the individual training needs of men-tees and helped them with skills development.They also noted the benefit of not needing to close
the clinic for training because mentoring was done
at the mentees ’facilities and mentoring did not
disrupt working hours.

close the services for attending peer-mentoringsession. —Mentee from Lari
Upon request from the hospital management,
mentees in larger health facilities also mentioned
that they informally began mentoring other MCHnurses in the same facility. Mentors indicated thatduring mentoring visits, they were able to identifygaps in knowledge, skills, and practices that the
mentees themselves were unaware of but that
were necessary for providing quality routine im-munization services.
On-site mentoring allowed me to identify skill gaps
in mentees and to practically demonstrate theprocedures to mentees to build capacity .—Mentor
in Machakos
Mentors also indicated that initiating mentor-
ing for peers was a challenge; however, they wereable to do it through building relationships withthe mentees. Challenges to mentoring included
turnover of mentees and supply issues with vac-
cines and vaccinating materials, which prevented
the mentees from putting the new knowledgeand skills into practice for improving routine im-munization services.
Mentees older than me were initially ambivalent to ac-
cept me as a mentor; however, I was able to overcomethis issue through building relationship with mymentees. —Mentor in Lari
Mentees ’and Mentors ’Perception of Using
WhatsApp
Both mentees and mentors indicated that WhatsApp
provided a platform for sharing technical questions,systemic challenges, and opinions among MCHnurses. The platform allowed increased interactionamong mentees themselves and with their mentorson addressing routine immunization-related questionsTABLE 3.

WhatsApp platform provided me opportunity to
ask questions or share a scenario that I encoun-tered in between the face-to-face mentoring visit of
my mentor. —Mentee in Lari
Mentees added that discussion in the WhatsApp
group acted as a reminder of what they learned
and as method to get further clarification ofany questions and issues related to routineimmunization.
My mentor shared a lot of information during the
mentoring visit, and at times, I forgot some of those.
However, discussions in the WhatsApp group
worked as a reminder of information my mentor pro-vided. —Mentee in Machakos
Interaction in the WhatsApp platform was
helpful in building confidence among MCH nursesin sharing issues related to routine immunization
services.
Discussion in WhatsApp built my morale and self-
confidence. It realized that I was not the only one havingissues in delivering immunization services. —Mentee
in Lari
The WhatsApp platform was useful for sharing
national immunization policy guidelines or other
relevant reference documents to mentees on cer-tain immunization standards.

DISCUSSION
Peer Mentoring: A Nonconventional Effective
Learning Approach
The peer-mentoring program was designed to
build individual immunization capacity of MCHnurses while also fostering cross learning in a lesshierarchical manner.
Mentors worked with mentees to identify their
individual training needs at the outset of peer
mentoring, considering gaps identified during
baseline assessment and challenges shared by thementees. They worked to address gaps in mentees ’
knowledge and provided practical support in de-veloping skills, and improving practices. Mentorsalso kept track of individual mentee ’s learning
progress during each mentoring visit, reinforcingknowledge, skills and practices during subsequent
visits and with WhatsApp discussions until the re-quired competencies were achieved.
Mentees ’positive perceptions of peer mentor-
ing was attributed to its individualized method oflearning at the facility, rather than the previous di-dactic lecture methods (which were conducted inclassrooms rather than at the health facility).Mentees also noted that on-site peer mentoringdid not disrupt their routine activities, and healthfacilities did not have to close facility activities forthe MCH nurse to participate in the training ses-
sions. Ndwiga et al. also reported that mentors
and mentees perceived peer mentoring as an ac-ceptable method of training.
19Luck et al. found
that peer mentoring is a relatively cost-effectivestrategy requiring minimal resources and negligi-ble disruption to clinical services.

Peer training was found to be a cost-effective
method for increasing immunization coverage in
health centers.25However, the main objectives ofTABLE 5. Mentees ’Immunization Skill and Practice Improvement From Baseline to Endline in Peer Mentoring

Mentees noted
that on-site peer
mentoring did not
disrupt theirroutine activities.Peer Mentoring and WhatsApp for Immunization Capacity Building of Health Workers www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 211our study were to document the processes and
outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills/practices
improvement with peer mentoring and WhatsApp.
The increases in immunization coverage that arosefrom improved knowledge, skills, and practices couldnot be documented credibly in this study as stock-outof vaccines and shortage of vaccination materials af-fected coverage during the implementation period.During formative research, we found that MCH
nurses were less likely to reach out to their supervi-
sors either face-to-face or electronically for supportrelated to immunization services. This may be due tothe perception of the supervisor as having a positionof power that is intimidating to MCH nurses. TheMCH nurse mentees were found more likely to seekhelp from an experienced peer in gaining newknowledge, addressing a challenge, or learning an
immunization skill. Mentors were nonjudgmental
with mentees, creating a nonthreatening environ-ment for mentees ’learning. Mentees noted their
comfort in sharing their needs and challenges. Thepeer-mentoring approach is an alternative to conven-tional mentoring in which peers are actively involvedand take responsibility for their own learning.
13,34
Preparing Mentors for Mentoring Visits
Mentoring is not natural for everyone and is con-
sidered a reciprocal relationship process.35As
such, our training for mentors helped to preparethem for peer mentoring as an important first
step. We oriented them on the processes, steps,
and phases of peer mentoring; listening and feed-back skills; and how to do on-the-job training andprovide support for performance improvement.The 5 phases of peer mentoring are
9: (1) seeding,
time of relationship building potential; (2) opening,
initiation and progression of mentoring relation-ship; (3) laddering, period of reciprocal interaction;(4) equalizing, mentee and mentor become equal;
and (5) reframing, reflection and recognition. We
trained and equipped the mentors on each phaseand ways to overcome potential challenges withpeer mentoring. At the seeding phase, youngermentors in our program had challenges with older
mentees; however, they were able to build men-
tees’trust by establishing a relationship. Mentees
in larger health facilities even felt empoweredenough to informally start mentoring other MCHnurses.
Factors Influencing the Success of Peer
Mentoring
A key to success of peer mentoring was relation-
ship building between mentors and mentees. Tobuild a relationship, mentors in our programpresented themselves to the mentees as a helper,
not as a supervisor or monitor. They created trustand a nonthreatening environment in which
mentees felt comfortable sharing their challenges,
with mentors listening with empathy. They pro-vided mentees with positive feedback and avoidedcritiquing mentees ’faults in the immunization
session in front of the caregivers. In busy clinics,mentors even provided on-site support to menteesto help the mentees finish their routine work inorder to free up time for mentoring sessions. Onementee stated during an FGD:
Peer mentoring created a conducive environment in
which we were comfortable to learn and share our ca-pacity gaps and challenges.
A mentorship based on mutual trust and re-
spect empowers a partnership between 2 peoplewho have a shared set of learning objectives.
9,36
The use of the CommCare tool was useful for
real-time tracking of mentees ’progress.
On-site mentoring in a real-life situation (i.e.,
at the mentees ’place of work) resulted in mentees
feeling comfortable, and mentors were able to seeand understand mentees ’work challenges. However,
support from supervisors and facility managers are
critical to plan and implement on-site peer mentor-
ing. In our program, the subcounty managers sup-
ported the selection of mentors and mentees and
communicated with the facility managers regarding
the peer mentoring. Support from facility man agers
enabled mentors to be released once a week from
their regular work to participate in the mentoring ac-tivity. To avoid any interruption of immunization
work in their own facilities, mentors diligently
planned the mentoring visits to be on the days when
there was no immunization session in the facilities. In
addition, in the larger health facilities (hospitals)
where immunization sessions were usually more fre-
quent, the facility manager deputed another MCHnurse to manage the immunization sessions to allow
the mentor to go for mentoring visits. Managers
at the target health facilities allowed mentees to at-
tend the mentoring sessions. County managers ’sup-
port was needed to ensure that mentors and mentees
were not transferred during the peer-mentoring peri-
od. In addition, support from county and subcounty
managers was required to ensure that routine immu-
nization supplies were available; however, therewere instances during our study in which staff trans-
fers and lack of vaccines and vaccination supplies
negatively affected the peer-mentoring application
of knowledge and skills into practices. Similar to our
findings, Ndwiga et al. found successful mentorship
conditional upon facility management support,Peer Mentoring and WhatsApp for Immunization Capacity Building of Health Workers www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 212sufficient supplies, a positive work environment, and
mentor selection.19
WhatsApp as a Networking and Learning
Platform
The use of the WhatsApp platform improved MCH
nurses ’engagement with peers and promoted dis-
cussion and learning through sharing challengesand experiences in providing immunization ser-vices. This was consistent with other studies on
WhatsApp networking among health care profes-
sionals.
37,38Henson et al. found difficulty in the
use of social media among older age health work-ers and reported it to be a limiting factor for its usein other health programs.
38However, we found
both mentors and mentees were able to participate
in the WhatsApp group discussion regardless oftheir age in both subcounties. The research coordi-nators supported participants initially for logging
in, and after a while, they were comfortable using
it. Consistent with Amry et al.
39we found that the
presence of a moderator in the WhatsApp groupfacilitated the learning process. Johnston et al.
reported that WhatsApp networking helps “flatten
hierarchy ”among students, residents, and experi-
enced consultants in a clinical setting by enablingall to actively contribute to discussion without in-
hibition.
40However, we found that although the
role of a group moderator was important, the in-clusion of a supervisor as moderator in the men-tees’group could introduce power imbalances
that might hinder participation of mentor and
mentees. Moderation of the mentees ’groups by
the mentors (who were not direct supervisors) inour study created an open and nonjudgmental en-vironment for mentees that encouraged their ac-
tive participation and comfort in posting questions
in the group.
Preserving patient privacy in the WhatsApp
group is important for health care professionals.
41
Both mentors and mentees in our study complied
with patient privacy during WhatsApp group discus-
sions, neither identifying by name nor adding pic-t u r e so ft h ec l i e n t so rc a r e g i v e r si nt h eW h a t s A p pgroup.
Institutionalization, Sustainability, and
Scalability of Peer Mentoring and WhatsApp
Mentoring was considered as an integral part of
the continuing education process.20Consistent
with the findings of Ndwiga et al.19the mentees
and mentors in our study perceived peer-mentoring as an effective and sustainable method
of capacity building to improve immunizationservices. We found that some mentees informally
started mentoring the peers in their own health fa-
cilities. Hale indicated that in the reframing phase
of peer mentoring, the mentees gain recognitionof their improved knowledge and skills from themanagement and peers in their work place andmay serve as a mentor for their peers.
9The capac-
ity of the existing and newly positioned nurses canbe built and updated periodically with peer men-
toring backed by WhatsApp group discussions as
new vaccines and technologies are added to theimmunization system.
During progress update meetings with the
county/subcounty health officials, we discussed thecontinuation of the peer mentoring and WhatsAppgroups beyond the life of the project. We shared thegain in competencies of mentees and improvementin the quality of immunization services throughpeer-mentoring and WhatsApp. Both counties de-cided to continue the peer-mentoring process andWhatsApp groups. Machakos decided to scale upthe initiatives to other subcounties and also decidedto use peer mentoring for capacity building ofhealth workers for other health program (e.g., fam-ily planning) using their own funds. Both subcoun-ties decided to increase the number of mentorsgraduating some of the existing mentees into men-tors to expand peer mentoring in all the health fa-cilities providing immunization services. To addressthe performance gaps in other health facilities,supervisors in Lari were utilizing the trained mentorsto improve the immunization capacity of nurses.Manzi et al. reported that integrating trained nursementors into the district supervision system was in-strumental for quality of care improvement throughproviding ongoing, on-site individual mentorshipto health workers in the health facilities.
14The
WhatsApp groups in both subcounties continued afterthe project phased out, and group members remainedactive and continued to participate in the discussions.
Limitations
1. The small sample size of the study limited pre-
cise measurement of improvement in men-
tees’knowledge, skills, and practices in some
immunization areas with peer mentoring andWhatsApp.
2. The turnover of mentees was a limiting factor
in the study. The new and replaced menteesdid not receive enough peer mentoring op-portunities in all immunization technicalareas identified in the learning agenda.
3. The short supply and stock-out of vaccines
and vaccination materials negatively affectedPeer Mentoring and WhatsApp for Immunization Capacity Building of Health Workers www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2021 | Volume 9 | Number 1 213the practices of MCH nurses (mentees) in
both subcounties.
4. The increases in immunization coverage as
outcome of improved knowledge, skills, andpractices of mentees was not documented in
this study due to performance issues related
to short supply of vaccines and vaccinationmaterials.
CONCLUSION
The Global Vaccine Action Plan underscored theimportance of building health worker capacity tosupport immunization programs.
42Innovative
learning strategies outside of formal classroom
trainings are needed to improve frontline health
workers ’competencies for achieving immuniza-
tion coverage goals that have become more impor-tant now during the COVID-19 pandemic as large
gatherings for face-to-face trainings are restricted.
Using peer mentoring and WhatsApp for adultlearning is new in immunization programs.Evidence from this study suggests that peer men-
toring and WhatsApp networking could be effec-
tive methods for improving frontline healthworkers ’on-the-job performance in immuniza-
tion at minimal cost. However, to generate further
evidence, a cost-benefit study would be useful to
compare peer mentoring (along with WhatsAppnetworking) with classroom-based training forhealth workers.
