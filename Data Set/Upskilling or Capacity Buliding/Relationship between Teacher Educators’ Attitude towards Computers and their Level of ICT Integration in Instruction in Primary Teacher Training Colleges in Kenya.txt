This  study examines the relationship between teacher educators’  attitudes towards computers and their leve l of 
ICT integration in instruction in  public prim ary teacher training  colleges in Kenya. Rogers’s Theory on the Diffusion 
of Innovations (2003) is used to understand the k ey factors affe cting  ICT integration as well as the te acher 
educators’  attit udes towards ICT inte gration in the classroom. In terms of methodology, the simple random 
sampling technique was used to select six teacher training colleges in Kenya and 169 respondents to participate 
in the study. Data was collected using a questionnaire, interview schedule a nd observation.  Descriptive  statistics 
were used to analyse the data collected for means, freque ncies, mea ns, percentages and standard deviation. The 
Pearson Moment Correlation was used to determine the r elationship between teacher educators’ attitude and 
their level of ICT integration . The study resul ts indicated a low level of ICT integration in teaching in all te acher-
training  colleges. It was also noted that teacher educators had positive attitudes towards ICT i n t e g r a t i o n . However, 
they did not seem to  integrate the available ICTs in their classroom instruction. It was further establ ished that  
there was a positive relationship between their attitude and their leve l of ICT integration in instruction.   The Ministry 
of Education should organise i n-service t raining for  teacher educators in teacher education institutions on ICT 
integration in instruction. At the same time, there is a need to applaud and encourage by means of incentives 
teacher educators who exhibit positive attitudes so as improve their ICT in tegration in their teaching. 
Consideration should be given to older teacher educators’ who may be holding poor attitudes towards 
computers.

Introduction  
Recent research shows that there has been considerable 
progress in the integration of Information Communication 
Technolog ies (ICTs) in teacher education institutions in 
developed countries. However, very little is known about 
ICT integration in developing countries. The use of ICTs for 
supporting classroom teaching has interested educators 
in many fields of study. This is be cause ICT has impacted 
the quality and quantity of teaching, learnin g, and 
research. It offers man y ways of improving teaching and 
learning in the classro om and administra tion and provides 
opportunities for students whose choices may be limited 
due to lifestyle and life commitme nts and are subsequently 
unable to attend classes and to discuss class work with 
lecturers and colleagues (Ololube, 2006).  
 
According to Farrell and Isaacs (2007), there has been a 
keen in terest  by African policymakers in the use of ICT to 
meet Education for All (EFA)  objectives and the need s 
of the rural  and under-served areas. However,  there has 
been no consolidated documentation of what is 
happening in  this area, nor is there a comprehensive 
baseline data on the state of ICT use in education in Africa, 
against which future developments can be compared. 
Kenya is not an exception. The use of ICT in t e a c h e r  
education poses a challenge des pite the efforts of 
these institutions in ICT  investments. 
 
There is incre ased interest in ICT in te acher education in 
Kenya over the past decade a nd, as a result, these 
institutions are s pending much of their bud gets on ICT 
infrastruc ture (Chemwei, 2013) . This notwithstanding, the 
expected benefits have not been attained, and ICT 
integration for teaching and learning still re mains low. 
Chemwei, Kiboss and Njagi (2016) have po inted out that 
most teacher training colleges in Kenya  have compu ters, 
but not many tutors a re using t hem in instruction.   
 Despite all this support and the availability of technological 
tools, tutors are still reluctant to integrate  ICT into their 
teaching activities.  Based on the discussi on above,  it is 
evident that a key aspect has been excluded from both 
the t echnology plans and their subsequent 
implementation processes: the attitudes of the end-users 
and the real agents of change within the classro om arena, 
the tutors.   If tutors do no t have  the attitudes , knowledge  
and  skills  necessary  to change their classro om practices, 
there is no need to act. 
 
 
It is widely acknowledged  that unless tutors  develop 
positive attitudes toward IC T, they will not use ICT in their 
teaching practice. The strong relationship between 
computer-related attitudes and computer use in  education 
has been documented in man y st udies (Albirini, 2006; 
Usu n, 2009). For instance, Usun  (2009) argues that 
teacher ’s attitudes toward ICT may be a significant factor 
in the implementation of ICT in the classro om. While a 
number of st udies on teachers’  attitudes and ICT 
integration have been conducted in developed countries, 
there are no reported st udies investigating this topic in 
primary teacher training colleges.  
 
Teacher educators’  Attitudes and ICT Integration in 
Instruction  
Attitude is a predisposition to respond favourably or 
unfavourably to an object, person, or ev ent (Ajzen, 2005). 
Attitude is defined as a positive or negative feeling 
associated with performing a specific behaviour (Samak, 
2006). The characteristic attribute of attitude is evaluative 
in nature. This can include evaluations of issues, people, 
events  or objects. Such evaluations can either be negative 
or positive or negative, but they can also be uncertain at 
times or unresponsive. An individual will have a favourable 
attitude if they believe that the performance of the 
behaviour will lead to mostly p ositive results and vice 
versa. But whether or not a person participates or intends

to participate in any behaviour is influenced by the people 
around them. Attitudes are formed directly from 
experience. They may arise from direct personal 
experience, or t hey may result from observation. Rogers 
(2003) asserts that attitudes determine whether a person is 
willing to try a new innovation or not.  
 
The strong relationship between computer -related 
attitudes and computer use in education has been 
demonstrated in many studies (Sang et al., 2010; van Braak, 
Tondeur, & Valcke, 2004). Attitudes toward computers 
influence teachers' acceptance of the usefulness of 
technology, and whether teachers integrate ICT in their 
classroom as well (Liaw, 2002). According to Mumtaz  
(2000), schools can go only so far to encourage 
educational technology use without taking consideration 
of teacher attitudes. A tutor’s attitude towards computer 
technology may be a significant factor in his 
implementation of computers in education. This is because 
an educators’ positive attitude towards technology is a 
necessary condition for the effective use of computers in 
the classroom. For the most part, the responsibility for 
preparing highly qualified workers who are up to the 
challenges of a globa l economy rests on teachers. Thus, for 
tutors to be able to integrate technology successfully in 
their classrooms, it is crucial that they cultivate and 
maintain positive attitudes towards technology and attain 
adequate computer skills (Samak, 2006).  
 
An earlier study by Lloyd and Gressard (1986) found that 
positive attitudes by teachers towards computers 
correlated positively with their experience in using 
computers. Many researchers have observed that the 
successful integration of technology in the class room 
depends primarily on addressing teachers' attitudes 
towards computers. It, therefore, follows that teachers' 
attitudes towards computers are a significant factor in 
enhancing the quality of learning and teaching using computers. Thus, tutors in teache r education institutions 
must, at least, have a basic knowledge of both hardware 
and software applications in order to be qualified enough 
to integrate technology in their instructional practices 
(Siegel, 1995).  
 
Sooknanan (2002) conducted a study to inve stigate the 
adoption of technology in the education system in Trinidad 
and Tobago utilising Rogers' (2003) attributes, namely 
relative advantage, compatibility, complexity and 
observability. He found that the above attributes were 
significantly correlated to the integration, with the 
exception of complexity. In effect, relative advantage, and 
compatibility were found to be most closely related to 
teachers' attitudes. This means that teachers who 
perceived computers to be reliable, accurate and met their 
information needs to be demonstrated positive attitudes. 
But complexity affects the rate of adoption because the 
more complex innovation is perceived, the slower its 
adoption rate will be. Additionally, observability impacts a 
teacher's attitudes toward ICT. Teachers who had never 
encountered computers as an educational tool 
demonstrated negative attitudes. Sooknanan's (2002) 
study accentuated the importance of computer attributes 
in the process of computer integration in teaching. A 
critical factor that all s taff need to recognise and 
understand is that integrating computers in classroom 
practice is a complex innovation which requires a radical 
change in the school's practices and culture. This also 
extends to the curriculum, the teacher's attitudes and 
classr oom practice. Such change is achieved incrementally 
over a long period. Overall, the literature reveals that 
attitudes towards technology remain a significant factor in 
influencing the integration of technology in teaching. In 
effect, when teachers perceiv e ICT as easy to use, 
beneficial, compatible with their current activities; easy and 
have observable outcomes, they will demonstrate positive 
attitudes towards ICT.

Statement of the Problem  
ICTs play a critical role in enhancing teaching and learning. 
It is for this reason that there is an increasing pressure from 
policymakers for tutors in teacher training colleges to 
graduate teachers who are skilled, confident and 
competent in using technologies in their instruction 
(Chemwei, Kiboss and Njagi, 2016);  MOE, 2005). Tutors in 
PTTCs are expected to model appropriate uses of ICTs in 
instruction in order to equip future primary teachers with 
the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes to effectively 
use these skills in their working lives. In order to achi eve 
the Vision 2030’s goal of establishing a computer supply 
programme that will equip students with modern ICT skills, 
the education and training sector continued with a 
programme targeting 20,229 public primary schools and 
PTTCS, a coordination office to  help coordinate and 
harmonise ICT in education, especially the integration of 
ICT in teaching and learning, was undertaken.  
 
Although some researchers have reported the 
effectiveness of integrating ICTs as instructional tools in 
teacher education, it is not clear whether tutors are 
integrating them in the curriculum. The integration of ICT in 
primary teacher education has been slow, leading to the 
conclusion that there are crucial factors influencing the 
integration levels of ICT in teacher training colle ges. 
According to He nnessy, Harrison  and Wamakote (2010), 
there is a range of physical  and educational factors that 
affect ICT integration and adoption in the classro om. These 
include, among others, unreliable access to electricity, 
limited technology infrastruct ure and teacher attitudes 
towards ICT use. Among these factors, teacher-related 
variables such as teachers’ attitudes towards ICT are found 
to be the most powerful predictors of techno logy 
integration (Chemwei, 2013; van Braak, Tondeur, & Zhu, 
2011). Therefore, the teacher educator's  attitudes could positively impa ct ICT in tegration in primary teacher training 
colleges.  
 
Methodology  
This study employed a descriptive survey. The study 
involved six public primary teacher -training colleges in 
Kenya.  PT TCs were preferred since they are a 
representative of the basic teacher education institutions 
in the country. These colleges which offer certificate in 
primary teacher education are Eregi, Mosoriot, 
Kilimambogo, Murang'a Machakos, and Baringo TTCs. 
Primar y TTCs were chosen because there have been 
initiatives by the government to integrate ICTs in teaching 
in teacher education. The target population for the study 
consisted of the entire teacher -educators in Kenya. During 
this study, there were 21 teachers' colleges in the country. 
However, three have been elevated to university colleges. 
Thus, the author chose to omit them and utilised the 18 
fully operational primary school teacher training colleges as 
the population of the study. All these colleges have 
computer laboratories and are making efforts to improve 
their ICT capacity. On average, teachers' colleges admit 
600 students annually for a two -year certificate in primary 
teacher education. Tutors in these colleges range from 29 
to 90 and 1,299 teacher -educators in public TTCs (ROK, 
2005). 
 
 
 
The author decided to use the simple random sampling 
technique since the population was within reach of 
statistical evaluation. First, a sample of six teachers' 
colleges was picked from the 18 colleges forming the 
research population. This was 30percent of the total 
number of primary teachers colleges in the country. The six 
colleges were picked at random using the balloting 
method. In these colleges, the total number of teacher -
educators was 418. From this total popul ation, the study 
used Sloven's formula to determine the sample size. It was

found that a sample of 204 teacher -educators would be 
needed to represent the population in question accurately. 
The proportionate sampling technique was then used to 
select two hu ndred and four participants who served as 
respondents chosen from the teacher -educators across the 
colleges to constitute the sample. Majority research has a 
preference for methods that provide high accuracy, 
generalisability and explanatory power, with lo w cost, 
rapid speed and maximum management and administrative 
convenience. Therefore, a combination of the following 
research instruments was used in this study for 
complementary purposes: a questionnaire, two interview 
schedules and an observation schedul e. The data were 
analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, 
SPSS version 17. Descriptive statistics using frequencies, 
means, standard deviations, tables and percentages were 
used for the data on the level of ICT integration into 
teaching by teacher -educators in TTCs. 
 
 
Percentag es were also  used to an swer questions  that 
asked the levels of teacher-educ ators' attitudes  in using 
ICTs in TTCs. The cor relation was used to determine if a 
significa nt relationship existed between the level of ICT 
integ ration and teacher educator attitudes towards 
the integ ration of ICTs. In addition, the teacher-
educators' attitude was designated as an independent 
variable, while their  perceived level of ICT integration 
into teaching is the dependent variable in  the analysis. 
The significance level was set at 0.05. Information from 
intervie ws was recorded and transcribed verbatim. A 
qualitative assessment procedure was applied to the 
respondents' answers. The  text was read, and an 
interpretive statement that  captures the es sence of 
the respondent's quote was written. 
 
Results and Discussion  
Teacher educators’  Attitudes towards ICTs  Attitude refers to a positive or negative feeling associated 
with performing a specific behaviour. An individual will 
have a favourabl e attitude if he or she believes that the 
performance of the behaviour will lead mostly to a positive 
result or vice -versa (Samak, 2006). Educators are likely to 
resist the introduction of ICTs into the classroom for a 
variety of reasons. Their unfamiliari ty with the 
technologies, the additional time and effort necessary for 
effective use and the feeling that ICTs pose a threat to their 
professional role and image are some of the reasons for 
this resistance (Omwenga, 2004).  
 
Acceptance of innovations is de pendent largely on attitude 
formation (Menjo, 2007). In the study, the attitudes of 
teacher -educators towards ICT for instruction were 
investigated, and the outcomes were as shown in Table 1.

Teacher -educators' attitudes towards ICT integration were 
generally positive. In effect, 83.6 per cent of the 
respondents strongly agreed and agreed that they f elt 
comfortable using computers in instruction. But 34.1 per 
cent teacher -educators were fearful of integrating 
computers in instruction. 18 per cent disliked using 
computers in instruction. On the other hand, 69.5 per cent 
agreed and strongly agreed that they enjoyed using 
computers in teaching. The responses, furthermore, 
indicate that an overwhelming majority of them (95.6 per 
cent, SA and A) would like to learn more about computers. 
Another 83.1 per cent (SA and A) felt that using computers 
makes the ac ademic climate in school more intellectually 
stimulating. 
 
 
73.8 per cent agreed and strongly agreed that computers 
save time and effort. Yet a few of them (15.9 per cent) felt 
that computers increase teachers' workload. However, 
despite the overwhelming interest among respondents to integrate ICT into teaching, there were some who were not 
interested in ICT as a medium of instruction. Reluctance to 
engage and actively participate in ICT initiatives was likely 
to be caused by a number of reasons. These inc lude 
insufficient technology resources, lack of time and lack of 
training to integrate ICT. 
 
 
Correlation Analysis Resul ts 
The survey had 12 it ems concerning teacher-educ ators' 
attitude towards computers. The Pea rson Moment 
Correlation Coefficient was used to determine whether  
there was a relationship b etween the te acher-educators' 
level of ICT integ ration and  their  attitudes towards 
computers. The calculated correlation coefficient between 
the level of ICT integration in  teaching by teacher-
educators' and  their attitudes towards ICTs as tools for 
instruction was 0.451**, implying that  there  is a moderate  
positive relationship between the sets of variables. 
 
Interviews with principals and heads of departments in the 
sampled colleges gave varied viewpoints a bout teacher -
educators' attitude towards ICT integration. Some teacher -
educators prefer using ICTs, while others do not. Those 
who do not like it claim that their computer skills are too 
low and have not had time to train since ICT is time -
consuming. Never theless, every teacher -educator uses 
computer simulations during micro -teaching lessons to 
prepare students for their teaching practice. From the 
interviews conducted with principals and HODs, there was 
an indication that unwillingness by older teacher -
educators, lack of cooperation from the college 
administration as well as lack of facilities have contributed 
to poor attitudes among the teacher -educators. Unless 
teacher -educators see a relative advantage in computer -
integration, their attitudes tend to bec ome positive 
towards computers. Those attitudes would also be 
compatible with their existing values, and so the

integration of the computer into teaching may occur more 
readily (Rogers, 2003). 
 
 
Observations made by the author in the respective colleges 
confirmed that at the time of the study, very few teacher -
educators used ICTs as tools for teaching. But notable 
integration was seen in the ICT, Mathematics and Science 
departments. This is where some teacher -educators appear 
to have a positive attitude bec ause some of them own 
laptops and do not rely on what the colleges’ 
administrations provide. They reported that they were only 
limited by time and resources. For instance, one of the 
college principals was quite explicit about the attitude of 
teacher educa tors when he stated:  
It is only a small percentage of tutors who 
have a positive attitude toward ICT 
integration. I would put it at 55 per cent of 
them. One of the reasons is inadequate 
computers in the college which are 
worsened by the MOE's reluctance t o 
supply them with computers. The Ministry 
of Education has always promised to 
support ICT use in TTCs, but their promise 
has not been forthcoming. If anything, 
teacher' training colleges have been 
forgotten by the government .  
The sentiments point to a la pse in the MOEs effort to 
support the integration of ICTs in TTCs. It is recommended 
that the government give attention to TTCs in order to 
makef ICT integration a success in Kenyan schools. 
 
 
In summ ary, the fin dings of this study pro ve that the 
teacher-educators had a relatively positive at titude 
towards ICT integration. As discussed earlier, the majority 
felt comfortable using computers while  a handful was 
reluctant in int egrating computers  in instruction. Most of them enj oyed using computers. It was also noted  that an 
overwhelming majority wou ld like to le arn more abou t 
computers. At the same time, the majority of the te acher- 
educators agreed that using compu ters made the academic 
climate intell ectually stimulating. In effect, ICTs save time 
and effort and motivates. Very  few respondents felt that 
computers i ncreased teachers’ workload yet,  despite the 
overwhelming interest amo ng respondents to integrate ICT 
in teaching, there were some who were not inter ested in 
ICT as  a medium  of instruction. 
 
Conclusi on and Recommendations  
Evidential ly, teacher-educ ators generally have a p ositive 
attitude regarding ICT integration to in struction. While a 
positive attit ude towards an i nnovation leads to ICT 
adoption, integration  was not the pr actice in classroom 
instruc tion in teacher training colleges in Kenya.   
Nevertheless, further study would be necessary to 
establish the exact status of teacher -educators' attitudes. 
It was the feeling of most teacher-educators that the 
college administration was the greatest impe diment to ICT 
integ ration. Thus,  it is recomm ended that principals  of all 
TTCs should be knowledgeable in it. Mor e 
impor tan tly , th e find in gs  s ug g es t  a need to 
applaud and encourage (by means of incentives) teacher 
educators who exhibit positive attitudes so a s improve 
their ICT integration in their teaching.  Consideration 
should be given to older teacher educators’ who may be 
holding poor attitudes towards computers.
