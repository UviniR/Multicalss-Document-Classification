Introduction
Technology is considered an important driver of quality 
and efficiency in library operations. Most library services and operations are facilitated by technological applications such as web-based catalogs, Integrated Library Software (ILS), mobile application of social media, multimedia, cloud computing applications, and so on. These advance-ments have led to library automation and creating digital and virtual libraries and therefore flexibly redefining library operations and services (Kowalczyk, 2018). Digital technology provides new opportunities for libraries. For instance, it provides easy access to information and ser -
vices without time or location limitations. It also allows different users to engage with library services and resources using different electronic equipment, devices, systems, and materials that produce, store, or disseminate informa-tion (Tiemo, 2019).
Digital technologies have pervaded every aspect of 
libraries operations, for example, it has affected the way libraries handle knowledge, and it also defined new kinds of communication and interaction with library materials and the way users seek and gain access to these materials (Kowalczyk, 2018). Following recent technological devel-opments, libraries have started to become aware of the functionalities provided by technology and accordingly are moving to enhance their processes and services. The chang-ing landscape of information and information technology and services requires a certain level of digital skills (DSs) from librarians to handle users’ demands. Accordingly, librarians need to improve their DSs in order to provide valuable support to library users. Digital technologies are necessary to keep up with the pace of change in libraries, transforming librarians’ skills from traditional to DSs.
Gui and Argentin (2011) suggested DSs individuals 
need to possess in order to be digital competent. These skills include knowledge of the basic principles of com-puting devices; skills in using computer networks; the ability to engage in online communities (virtual commu-nities) and social networks; the ability to find, capture, and evaluate information; and also possessing critical thinking skills. DSs are necessary for resources manage-ment and make them available for use all the time.

Abstract
Digital skills are necessary to work and manage electronic library infrastructures and services. Accordingly, there is an urgent need 
for assessing the level of digital skills among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan. It is also important to investigate the influence of digital skills on technology acceptance among librarians in Jordan. A questionnaire was developed and used to collect the required 
data from university libraries in Jordan. The results indicate a high level of digital skills among the librarians. The result also shows 
that financial issues are the main challenges that librarians face to obtain the required skills. Most importantly, the level of digital skills positively influences the librarians’ acceptance and use of technology in academic libraries in Jordan. It was noted that factors such as 
sex, age, experience, specialization, and library type had no effect on the results. Findings of this research will help to explore the skills 
and competencies needed by information professionals and act as a guideline for competency development and curriculum updates in Librarianship and Information Science schools at an international level.

order to improve individual participation in digital econ-
omy (iNeSI, 2016).
In a library context, DSs are creating metadata/tag, pho-
toshop, installation and managing library software, creation of institutional repositories, managing library consortium, library networking, barcode and radio-frequency identifi-cation (RFID) technology, and website design (Seena and Pillai, 2014). Librarians need to master these skills, as it will enable them to manage library technology infrastruc-tures and online resources. They also need to make informed decisions relative to technology adoption (Izuagbe et al., 2019). Accordingly, there is need for librarians to have DSs. For instance, they need skills for resource sharing, digital preservation and repositories, social networking, searching the Internet, instant messaging, blogging, and other digital-oriented activities.
Scanning the existing literature revealed the lack of 
studies about DSs and competencies among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the level of DSs among librarians in Jordan and to examine the influence of the DSs on technology adop-tion and acceptance.
Research problem
In today’s digital information environment, it has become inevitable that librarians need to acquire DSs. DSs are nec-essary to work in digital library environments and manage electronic library infrastructures and services. Singh and Pinki (2009) stressed that library professionals must develop digital competencies and skills to manage change and fulfill users’ information needs. Consequently, there is a great need to assess the level of DSs among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan. It is also important to inves-tigate the relationship between the level of DSs and tech-nology acceptance among librarians in Jordan. The findings of the study will be relevant for making decisions by library management for the employment processes, the training and development of librarians, and equipping libraries with digital resources for adequate learning.
Research questions
This study examines the level of DSs among librarians at academic (university) libraries in Jordan. It also investi-gates if the level of DSs influences the acceptance of tech-nology application in library operations. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following research questions:
1. What is the level of DSs possessed by librarians working in academic libraries in Jordan?
2. How do librarians working in academic libraries in Jordan acquire DSs?
3. What are the challenges encountered by the librar -
ians while acquiring digital literacy skills?4. Is there a relationship between the level of DSs and librarians’ acceptance of technology applications at academic libraries in Jordan?
5. Are there differences at the significance level (α = 0.05) in the staff level of DSs based on differ -
ent variables: sex, experience, library type, age, and specialization?
Research hypothesis
H1. The level of DSs positively influences librarians’ acceptance of technology application at academic libraries in Jordan.
Literature review
Digital skills in university libraries
DSs are the ability to effectively perform tasks in digital 
environment and use digital tools, communication tools, or networks in computerized environments (Chinien and Boutin, 2011) to locate, evaluate, use, and create informa-tion (Okeji et al., 2019; Shank and Bell, 2011) affirmed that DSs are the ability to understand and use information in multiple formats from a wide range of sources through computers. It is also the ability to read and interpret media, to reproduce data and images through digital manipula-tion, and to evaluate and apply new knowledge gained from digital environments (Okeji et al., 2019). Moreover, UNESCO (2018) defined DSs as the capability to use computer hardware and software, communication applica-tions, use appropriate security measures, and protect digi-tal information.
Digital technologies have also changed the way users 
search for information. This prompted the libraries to adapt and change their routines and operations by starting to offer new services such as reference services, chat services, indi-vidual consultations, email, and social networking services (Khan and Bhatti, 2017; Machin Mastromatteo, 2009). This requires new skills from librarians to handle the changes in library environments and the evolving users’ information needs and seeking behaviors. A study by Safahieh and Asemi (2010) revealed that the majority of the librarians at Isfahan University (Iran) did not have adequate computer skills. For instance, the librarians perceived their computer skills levels to be “very good.” Bhatti and Nadeem (2014) found that almost all academic librarians were interested in being skilled in using social networks, the Internet, and online activities. Librarians require new skills to work effectively in this digital environment and to meet the chal-lenges of digital librarianship.
Choi and Rasmussen (2006) stated that librarians need 
to be competent in the creation and management of digi-tal libraries; metadata creation and preservation of infor -
mation; management of digital contents; and use of Hamad et al. 3
scanners, imaging skills, and assigning optical character 
recognition (OCR) records. Adeleke (2016) affirmed that librarians need skills and competencies to establish and maintain a digital repository, including traditional library skills and knowledge, management and technical skills, familiarity with metadata creation, and knowledge of copyright. Martzoukou and Elliott (2016) reported a set of DSs that were considered important by librarians. This includes development of information technology (IT) skills and encompasses different communication media and tools, such as e-books, online databases, and social media platforms.
In line with this, Tiemo (2019) pointed out that the level 
of digital technology skills acquired among library person-nel in Nigerian academic libraries in managing online resources for effective library services is high. However, they still need more training on their digital technology skills to manage and improve their online resources and services.
Baro et al. (2019) results affirmed that librarians work-
ing in academic libraries in Africa possess a high level of digital literacy skills. Librarians indicated that DSs such as database search skills, uploading documents to online plat-forms, using different social media, sending and receiving emails skill, digital library development skills, applying new technologies into library services, and the ability to create different file formats and ability to use open source software is very high. However, skills related to metadata development and library website development is low.
The changing role of librarians in the digital 
world
Information professionals’ traditional role was to provide 
access to the collection in the libraries. Libraries adopted Web 2.0 technologies and introduced a new concept named “Library 2.0” (Erich, 2007). This concept means to adopt ideas and concepts from Web 2.0 in library environ-ment (Needleman, 2007). To meet the growing needs of library users, libraries need to recruit skilled librarians to provide innovative services that are involved in the crea-tion and dissemination of knowledge in digital environ-ment (Heinrichs and Lim, 2009).
Modern libraries services are closely linked to web 
technology. And accordingly, academic libraries have moved in the direction of creating digital content and then organizing and preserving it through metadata creation and management to make their special collections more accessible through the web. However, there is a need for librarians to have competencies related to digital library architecture and software, technical and quality standards, HTML coding, general computer skills and computer lit-eracy, database development and management, and web mark-up languages such as SGML and XML, and web development and design (Choi and Rasmussen, 2009). In the same context, Ocholla and Shongwe (2013) pointed out that academic and research environments are seeking skills in IT or e-access and e-service. Also, Sutton and Davis (2011) identified that librarians need to have skills related to managing electronic resources, using technology in libraries, knowledge of URL web protocols, licensing of e-resources, knowledge of electronic resources, cataloging skills, developing online public access catalogs (OPACs), and management of information systems.
The American Library Association (ALA) Council 
(2009) has identified “Technological Knowledge and Skills” as one of the ALA’s Core Competencies of Librarianship. The ALA report indicated that librarians need competencies and skills related to technologies concerning information, communication, assistive, affecting the resources, service delivery, and uses of libraries and other information agen-cies. They need to know how to apply these technologies in library context. Other skills include assessing and evaluat-ing the specifications, efficacy, and cost efficiency of tech-nology-based products and services.
Recently, analytics and data visualization techniques 
emerged in libraries and presented new skills that are required by librarians. Digital librarian is an emerging position in academic libraries (Choi and Rasmussen, 2009). The Research Planning and Review Committee at the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2018) also identified the 2018 top 10 trends in academic libraries. The committee identified mining techniques and methods for information extraction, information retrieval, natural lan-guage processing, classification, and clustering different ways of text summarization among the skills that are needed from librarians (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2018). Learning analytics and data collection were among competency that ACRL identified as necessary (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2018).
There is also a great need for digital competencies/
skills among librarians for developing and managing digi-tal contents. For instance, DSs such as e-resources collec-tion development, digitization (creating digital content), and curation of digitized content (including metadata crea-tion and management) are also required from librarians (Raju, 2014). Digitization project technologists, digital library experts, interface designers, metadata experts, and others are key participants in libraries (Dooley, 2009).
Okiji (2019) argued that librarians need to develop ade-
quate digital literacy skills for the development and man-agement of digital resources. He affirmed that they need competencies in using digital library software and scan-ning processes, they also need to have knowledge about server technology, understand database development and management, be aware of copyright and licensing issues, manage access control and finally, to possess digital com-petencies to protect digital contents. Librarians need to be fully equipped with DSs and prepare themselves for the technological challenges ahead.4 Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 00(0)
Martzoukou and Elliott (2016) identified some basic IT 
skills that are required by librarians which include e-books; 
operating systems (Microsoft windows, Mac OS) and software applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint); web design social media platforms and emerging technologies, blogs, and Wikis; basic personal computer (PC) trouble shooting online research skills (i.e. information retrieval); and database design, manage-ment, and concepts. In line with this, Emiri (2017) findings show that electronic mailing, social networking, use of per -
sonal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, and Internet surfing are the major DSs that are needed by librarians. The study also demonstrated that librarians acquired digital literacy skills (DLS) through colleague’s assistance, trial and error, IT programs, and formal education.
Bawden et al. (2005) emphasized that digital librarians 
must possess competencies for developing and managing digital libraries include the use of the Internet and knowl-edge of the web (including navigation, search techniques, virtual reference services, and web design); knowledge of multimedia technology; knowledge of video conferencing; knowledge of multimedia technology; and knowledge of digital systems such as digital library software develop-ment, designing user interfaces, and developing digital content. In line with this, Khan and Bhatti (2017) findings showed that librarians are required digital competencies related to developing and managing digital libraries. They affirmed that librarians need digital competencies/skills for developing digital libraries; digital competencies/skills for managing digital libraries; and digital competencies to protect digital contents. Accordingly, it is highly important and useful for university librarians to acquire digital com-petencies/skills.
Summary
Apparently, DSs became very important aspects in today’s university libraries. The digital environment has changed the landscape of libraries services and its daily activities. Therefore, it is important for librarians to have the ability to effectively perform digital tasks using digital tools, communication tools or networks in computerized envi-ronments. Librarians need to have good working knowl-edge of ICTs to become digital librarians who are able to apply digital technology in libraries. In other words, the changes in digital environment has been directly reflected on users behaviors and accordingly libraries needs to respond and reflect these changes on their routines and ser -
vices by incorporating technologies in their environment.
Methodology
This research investigates the level of DSs among librari-ans at academic libraries in Jordan. It also investigates the relationship between the level of DSs and technology acceptance among librarians in Jordan. And finally, it will assess the difficulties associated with DSs acquisitions faced by librarians at the Jordanian academic libraries. In Jordan, there are 10 public universities and 20 private uni-versities. For this research, public and private universities have been selected from the Ministry of Higher Education and the scientific research website. These libraries provide services to students, academic staff, and other university staff, and they are open for public use to support research.
The data collection method used was a questionnaire 
administered to all library professional staff (N = 230) 
from all of the participating academic libraries during the academic year 2019–2020. The rational of using a ques-tionnaire to collect data was for a better outreach and a comprehensive exploration of librarians’ self-assessment of their DSs. It was also to assess their attitude toward technology acceptance in their library environment. The research personally visited the population to collect the required data.
Of the 230 respondents, 203 questionnaires were suita-
ble for analysis with a response rate of 88.3%. The term “library staff” is used to refer to any personnel working in the library, including top managers (such as heads of divi-sions, heads of departments) or professionals performing routine tasks. The term “division” represents multiple departments, for example, the technical division or the information division. The term “department,” however, deals with certain processes and includes a number of employees such as the acquisitions department and the cataloging and classification departments. Table 1 demon-strates the distribution of the sample based on several fac-tors that might affect respondent level of DSs in their profession.

technology acceptance among librarians at academic 
libraries in Jordan. The first part of the questionnaire col-lected personal demographic information to establish the extent to which certain external factors (sex, library type, specialization, experience, and age) might affect the level of DSs among librarians. The second part of the question-naire consisted of 53 items (ranked questions) in an attempt to answer the main research questions, which are the following:
1. What is the level of DSs possessed by librarians working in academic libraries in Jordan? (25 items)
2. What are the challenges encountered by the librar -
ians while acquiring digital literacy skills? (16 items)
3. What is the level of technology acceptance among librarians at the Jordanian academic libraries? (12 items)
4. Is there a relationship between the level of DSs and librarians’ acceptance of technology applications at academic libraries in Jordan?
5. Are there significant differences at significance level (α = 0.05) in the staff level of DSs based on 
different variables: sex, experience, library type, age, and specialization?
Research hypothesis
H1. The level of DSs positively influences librarians’ acceptance of technology application at academic libraries in Jordan.
A Likert-type scale was applied to weigh the degree of agreement with the questionnaire items. Table 2 demon-strates the range of weights used to determine the degree of agreement for each item using the mean value.
Questionnaire validity
To ensure validity, the questionnaire was reviewed by a group of referees from the faculty of Educational Sciences and library professionals to check for clarity and gram-matical errors and to identify the suitability of the ques-tionnaire items to provide answers to the research main questions. All reviewer recommendations were taken into consideration, and the questionnaire was revised accord-ingly. Moreover, a Cronbach’s alpha test was conducted to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire. Cronbach’s alpha value was high, scoring 0.89 as indicated in Table 3.
Statistical analysis
Mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) were calculated to assess the degree of the respondents’ assessment of their level of DSs and the difficulties they face to acquire the required DS in their library profession. Multi-way ANOV A analysis was conducted to investigate the existence of any statistical differences at significance level (α = 0.05), using f-tests between responses based on different variables. Inferential statistical methods such as multiple regression analyses were also applied to test the formulated hypothe-sis at significance level 0.05 to determine the relative influence of the level of the possessed DSs on the technol-ogy acceptance. Regression analysis was used to deter -
mine the influence of the DSs on the acceptance of technology among librarians at significance level 0.005. Also, the direction and strength of the relationship between the variables were tested.
The level of digital skills among librarians
To answer this question, M and SD were calculated for all factors under the main research question to investigate the level of DSs possessed by librarians in the Jordanian aca-demic libraries (see Table 4).
Staff were mainly asked questions (items) to rate the 
level of DSs that they possess. As indicated in Table 4, the librarian assessment of their possession DSs was generally moderate with a total M of 3.66 and SD of 0.52. Twelve out of the 25 questionnaire items scored a high mean rang-ing between 4.36 and 3.83. The highly rated DSs accord-ing to respondents are proficiency of using all Microsoft office applications as the most DSs they have (M = 4.36, 
SD = 0.9); skills of using computers, the Internet, and com-
munication networks to handle information and research services (M = 4.26, SD = 0.91); and the ability to work with 
integrated library management systems (M = 4.25, SD =  
0.95). However, the respondents indicated that their skills in library website development (M = 3.58, SD = 1.31), 
evaluating the suitability of software for digital projects (M = 3.35, SD = 1.01), and working with open source Table 2. The weights used to determine the degree of 
agreement for each item.

software (M = 2.96, SD = 1.2) as moderate (see Table 4 for 
more results).
Challenges that face librarians to obtain digital 
skills
The second question in the questionnaire focused on find-
ing the challenges that might face librarians working in academic libraries in Jordan. The results showed (Table 5) that librarians’ perception of the challenges that might face them in acquiring DSs was moderate, as indicated by a total M value of 3.49 and a SD of 0.50. The results showed that librarians see the lack of funds allocated to support library professionals’ training as the main challenge they face in order to obtain DSs (M = 4.28, SD = 0.77). Also, the 
librarians indicate that their library administration does not provide the required support for them to attend training workshops (M = 4.20, SD = 0.76). Apparently, financial considerations are the main challenge. However, the librar -
ian did not see language as a barrier for them to obtain DSs (M = 2.66, SD = 1.33). See Table 5 for more challenges and 
librarians’ perceptions of these challenges.Technology acceptance among librarians
The third question in the questionnaire focused on finding the rate of technology acceptance among librarians work-ing in the Jordanian academic libraries. The results in Table 6 indicate a high technology acceptance ratio among librarians (M = 3.73, SD = 0.51). For instance, librarians 
showed a high intention of using new technology as soon as it is available (M = 4.11, SD = 0.84). Also, they see that 
new technology can contribute to improving the work environment (M = 3.95, SD = 1.03).
Effect of external factors (demographic 
information) on results
It is crucial to investigate whether there are external fac-
tors that might influence responses. M and SD of responses based on the five variables, as well as multi-way ANOV A were calculated (see Tables 7 and 8).
The results revealed that the mean values of responses 
varied between respondents with different factors: sex, age, experience, specialization, and library type. For Table 4. Means and standard deviations (SDs) of responses on librarians assessment of their digital skills level in academic libraries

instance, respondents under the age of 26 appeared to 
have a better assessment of DSs (M = 3.68, SD = 0.31) 
compared to older respondents. Please refer to Table 8. To support the result, multi-way ANOV A analysis at signifi-cance level (α  = 0.05) between the means of responses of 
the different libraries staff based on different variable was conducted. The analysis suggested that there were no sta-tistically significant differences at significance level (α = 0.05) between the means of responses based on different variables. This means that all librarians have about the same perception of the level of DSs, the chal-lenges, and the acceptance of technology. Another impor -
tant factor to investigate was library type, either public or private. The results showed that staff perception at all aca-demic libraries regardless of its type (public or private) have about the same perception of the level of DSs, the challenges, and the acceptance of technology in academic libraries in Jordan (see Table 8).Table 5.

Testing the hypothesis
H1. The level of digital skills positively influence 
librarians’ acceptance of technology application at aca-demic libraries in Jordan.
The hypothesis was tested using regression analysis indi-cated in Table 9. Table 9 shows that the calculated t-value (13.427) is bigger than the tabulated t-value (1.162) at a significance value with 0.000 which is greater than α < 0.05. This indicates the existence of a significance rela-
tionship between the level of DSs and technology accept-ance among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan.The prediction of librarians’ possession of DSs on 
their technology acceptance revealed that the level of DSs positively influences librarians’ technology accept-ance. The results show that multiple correlations coeffi-cient (R = 0.082) and multiple (R
2 = 0.007). This means 
that 0.7% of the variance in the librarians’ technology acceptance in academic libraries in Jordan was affected by the level of the librarians’ DSs. The significance of the influence of DSs was tested at α  < 0.05.
Therefore, the hypothesis H1 was supported, which 
means that librarians’ DSs are important determinants of technology acceptance among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan.
Discussion
Level of digital skills among librarians
This study was able to determine a moderate level of DSs 
among librarians who are working in academic libraries in Jordan. For instance, the highest rated DSs among librari-ans was the proficiency of using MS office which was con-sidered one of the most important and used applications in all industries. These results are supported by Martzoukou and Elliott (2016). Also, skills in using computers, the Internet, and communication software were also among the highest rated DSs that librarians seem to have. The results are also supported by Chinien and Boutin (2011), Gui and Argentin (2011), Bhatti and Nadeem (2014), and Emiri (2017). Moreover, librarians affirmed their ability to handle the integrated library management system. They also are able to search various databases which is consid-ered one of the basic functions of librarians. Academic librarians asserted that they also have the ability to com-municate and transmit information through various virtual channels and design, develop, and analyze systems. These results go along with existing literature such as Baro et al. (2019), who affirmed that librarians should have the abil-ity to search databases, and apply new technologies into the library. Also, Choi and Rasmussen (2006) affirmed that librarians should have skills in managing digital libraries and creating metadata.
As expected, the study also revealed that librarians 
rated their sending and receiving emails and uploading documents to online platforms as high (Table 4). Campbell (2006) and Baro et al. (2019) also confirmed that libraries need to offer new services, including chat Table 7. Means and standard deviations (SD) of responses

services, individual consultations, and email and social 
networking services, which require experience and knowledge from the librarians themselves.
Digital preservation and digitization were among the 
DSs that were rated as moderate (see Table 4), which means that librarians still need more training in this field in order to be able to build institutional repositories in their libraries. Adeleke (2016), Raju (2014), and Dooley (2009) also affirmed that librarians need skills and competencies to establish and maintain a digital repository. Librarians rated their metadata development skills to be high, which is expected, as they are knowledge curators who are responsible for organizing information resources and mak-ing it available for future retrieval. Metadata management is considered by researchers such as Choi and Rasmussen (2006), Seena and Pillai (2014), Raju (2014), Adeleke (2016), and Baro et al. (2019) as one important skill that librarians should master. They also rated their digital library development, design, developing and analyzing systems, managing and designing databases, library web-site development, and data security by keeping backup of digital contents in case of any disaster and ability to create different file formats (PDF, gif, bitmap, and jpg) skills as moderate. These results align with Okeji et al. (2019) and Khan and Bhatti (2017) results.
Librarians are required to provide support for their users 
and for researchers. This means that they need to keep improving their DSs related to communication and infor -
mation transmission beside their databases search skills. Also, some involvement in informational and institutional repositories is required. Academic libraries, the Jordanian one in particular, are research-intensive institutions, and therefore, they should guarantee that their librarians are able to organize research data and handle big data to pro-vide it when it is required. Izuagbe et al. (2019) and Adeleke (2016) also affirmed in their research the need for librarians to have competencies in maintain a digital repository, man-agement and technical skills, familiarity with metadata creation, and knowledge of copyright. These results have been established in the research results (see Table 4).
Challenges that librarians face to obtain digital 
skills
As expected, lack of library funds to support library profes-
sionals’ training in sites, poor financial support to attend training workshops, and poor library infrastructure were the main issues that hinder librarians to improve their DSs. These results are also supported by Baro et al. (2019) and Okeji et al. (2019). This emphasizes what both Satpathy and Maharana (2011) and Kumar (2013) pointed out: inadequate facilities and poor training opportunities are the primary problems in acquiring the necessary skills to work in a digi-tal library. The poor library infrastructure might also be con-sidered as a money/budget related issue. Cox and Pinfield (2014) and Hamad et al. (2019) pointed out that while a data repository is an important part of an infrastructure that needs to be in place in order for libraries to provide full services for its users to operate, librarians still need training in digital preservation and digitization in order to build such digital repositories. Researchers such as Tenopir et al. (2014) and Corrall (2014) emphasized on training library staff in the specialized areas of curation and IT skills and marked it as a priority.
The results also clearly indicate that librarians and 
libraries currently lack confidence in their experience with digital content management law. This might refrain employees from keeping pace with technological develop-ments. Also, the lack of experience in managing and devel-oping DSs was perceived as a challenge for the librarians. And finally, librarians do not seem to have time for train-ing, which might reflect the size of workload at library environment. Responses imply the significant demands on staff time in the context of information organization. Another challenge is the lack of assessment from the library administration of its librarians’ technical skills or their technical needs. This might reflect that libraries’ administrations are more oriented toward hiring recruits, managing finances, and marketing rather than considering their librarians’ needs (Hamad et al., 2017). Also, Emiri (2017) emphasized that DSs should be given more atten-tion during recruitment of librarians among others.
Another relevant finding was that librarians’ levels of 
DSs have not been affected by the external factors of sex, age, experience, educational level, specialization, and library type. This clearly indicates that all librarians at aca-demic libraries in Jordan, regardless of their variant demo-graphics, have the same perception of their DSs and the challenges they face to obtain the required DSs. Also, all librarians, at converging level, accept technology in their library environment (see Table 8).
Given the presented results, it is crucial to provide 
training for librarians to improve their DSs. This will increase the librarians’ confidence in their skills, which will reflect on their performance and the library services. Librarians’ main problem was the lack of financial support and allocated funds for training sessions and workshops. Furthermore, it is important to increase library administra-tion awareness about their librarians’ needs, which calls for a continuous needs assessment procedure in light of new technologies that might add value to the library ser -
vice. Emiri (2017) recommends that management of aca-demic libraries should provide training for librarians to help update their knowledge in application of DSs and improve DS competencies.
Digital skills and technology acceptance among 
librarians
As expected, a positive correlation between DSs and tech-
nology acceptance was found. This suggests that DSs lev-els independently and significantly influence technology 10 Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 00(0)
acceptance among librarians at Jordanian academic librar -
ies. This finding is supported by Alharbi and Drew (2014) 
where they reported that DSs are essential for individuals’ propensity to use the library system. Also, Izuagbe et al. (2019) confirmed that the extent to which technology deployment permeates a sector or an economy is a direct reflection of its ICT model and the extent to which citizens are equipped technologically. Significantly, DSs indepen-dently accounted for 0.7% of the variance in individual intention toward technology acceptance. For example, librarians indicate that they tend to use new technology as soon as it is available. Their opinion of the new technology and its role in improving library services is high (see Table 6). Therefore, the results indicate that librarians are highly accepting and intending to use digital technologies in their professional activities. Both perceived usefulness and per -
ceived ease of use were the underlying factors that were used in technology acceptance dimension. Apparently, the librarians’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use depends on their DSs and therefore, their level of DSs is the predictor for their intention to accept and use technology.
Research implications
This research aimed at identifying DSs that are considered to be essential for librarians who are working in university libraries. The study will be useful first, for library manag-ers to realize the required set of DSs to plan for their employees training program and workshops. Second, it will be useful for trainers in order to arrange training for academic librarians in Jordan and other developing coun-tries. This research results will also be useful for other libraries such as specialized and school libraries. Moreover, it will help LIS department and schools to revise their cur -
riculum in accordance with the required skills and compe-tencies for academic librarians in the market.
Conclusion
The DSs level among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan is generally moderate. It was noted that librarians rated their database searching skills, sending and receiving emails, uploading documents to online platforms, and skills in using different social media as high. These are the basic DSs that individuals might obtain easily at university and with practice. However, the results have established the need for libraries to support their librarians by provid-ing training and also supporting them to attend workshops in terms of financial support and allocating time for them to improve their DSs according to the needs of their library services. There is also a need to increase library manage-ment awareness of the needs of their library staff and how to improve their library services.
Furthermore, this research recommends the awareness 
of academic libraries at all levels—locally, regionally, and intentionally—about the vast and important role of libraries to support its users. This can be realized by helping libraries recognize their emerging role in digital environment—in more depth—and then developing the library services. Lack of library budget to provide training support for its staff appeared to be the main obstacle that might hinder librarians from obtaining the required DSs. Also, lack of confidence and experience in digital collection manage-ment was a major concern of the library staff.
Apparently, technology acceptance among librarians is 
positively affected by the level of DSs possessed by the librarians at academic libraries in Jordan. Librarians play an important role in providing proactive services to sup-port their research, teaching, and training programs. Accordingly, it is important for academic librarians to enhance their skills and competencies.
This study recommends that university libraries con-
tinuously train their professional staff in order to keep up with digital environment requirements. This is an impor -
tant aspect that strongly contributes to increase librarians’ confidence in themselves and their work environment. Furthermore, it strongly recommends keeping enhancing librarians’ DSs and competencies to ease their acceptance of technology. Further studies are needed to deeply inves-tigate and understand the set of skills that are required by librarians using practice-based assessment.
