An Analysis of Mobile Financial  
Services and Financial Inclusion  in Bangladesh
Nahid Akhter1 and M. A. Baqui Khalily2
Abstract
In a short span of time, starting in 2011, mobile financial services (MFSs) have burgeoned in Bangladesh, 
and elsewhere in the developing world. MFSs have brought about major changes in financial products and institutional structures in the financial services market. The study of Bangladesh’s experience with MFS shows that financial inclusion has greatly improved along with efficiency of provision. This article shows that the probability of using MFSs by a household increases by about 43 per cent if the house-holds have temporary domestic migrant members. Female household heads are less likely to use MFS compared to male household head. Out of 1,588 micro merchants in the sample, around 30 per cent have access to MFSs. Individuals engaged in the non-agriculture sector, those from households with the head having higher education, those from non-poor households and those from urban areas have higher probabilities of MFS use. But more research must be done to design appropriate MFS products for the poor, so that they too can also leverage the benefits of MFSs.

Introduction
Competition in financial markets and the drive for higher market share are the major drivers in the 
expansion of financial services, which has significant positive effects on growth and financial development in countries like Bangladesh. Innovation in finance, either in the form of new products or new processes, have contributed to such competition and expansion of financial services (Van Horne, 1985). Both providers of financial services (financial institutions) and users of services (depositors and borrowers) derive benefits from financial innovations. On the supply side, the benefits are development of quality financial products, increases in efficiency and lower transaction cost, among others (Adewoye, Article

2013; Arnaboldi & Claeys, 2008; Hosein, 2013; Akhisar et al., 2015; Weigelt & Sarkar, 2012). The 
demand-side factors can be derived from the theory of technological acceptance model (Davis, 1989). 
The theory states that two key factors are major determinants of acceptance of technology, as perceived 
by users: perceived usefulness and ease of use. Such perception is influenced by low transaction costs, 
expected higher level of security and convenience and minimum transaction risk for the users of financial services (Frame & White, 2004; Lee & Chung, 2009; Luo et al., 2010; Mallat, 2007; Mbogo, 2010; Mehta, 2013; Van Horne, 1985; Viehland & Leong, 2007). In addition, technology and innovation have positive effects on production and efficiency, and in turn, on growth at the macroeconomic level and on institutional performance at the firm level.
Mobile technology has enabled financial innovation, which has multi-dimensional effects. It improves 
efficiency and financial inclusion (Frame & White, 2004; Mbogo, 2010; Van Horne 1985). It not only ensures efficient use of resources and higher levels of profitability but also contributes to growth in the local and national economy. Because of the transfer of resources from one place to another; from one region to another region, and from one country to another, it increases mobility of money and thereby it has multiplier effects on the regional and macroeconomic growth.
Mobile banking or mobile financial services (MFSs) have brought about a major revolution in 
financial markets. There is no doubt that MFSs will have widespread effects. A recent estimate shows that MFS has contributed 4.2 per cent to global GDP. More than 4.5 billion individuals have uniquely subscribed MFSs. The penetration rate is expected to reach 72 per cent of the adult population by 2020. It has contributed to employment creation. Some 17 million jobs were directly supported by the mobile ecosystem. This is expected to reach 20 million jobs by 2020 (GSMA, 2016). Furthermore, it has been contributing to expand mobile insurance services and expansion of health services.
As of December 2015, the GSMA report on the ‘State of the Industry Report on Mobile Money’, 
emphasised on three key findings: (a) strong growth is emerging in new regions including South Asian countries, where more than a third of all registered mobile money accounts were opened in 2015;  
(b) strong growth in international remittance by 52 per cent in volume in 2015 from the 2014 level involving 29 cross-border mobile money initiatives connecting 19 countries; and (c) increasing use of mobile money by customers with over a billion transactions in December 2015.
In South Asian countries, mobile money has made major headway into providing financial services. 
In Bangladesh,1 in October 2016 alone, total number of transactions reached 128 million, growth of 9.19 per cent over the previous month, amounting to total transactions of USD 2.5 billion. There were inward remittances of USD 0.91 million in October 2016; cash-in transactions amounted to USD 1.09 billion compared to USD 0.23 billion as cash-out transaction (Bangladesh Bank). Most of these transactions are Person to Person (P2P) transactions. Evidences are quite strong in other countries as well. In India,2 in 2015–2016, mobile banking transactions amounted to USD 56 billion from 389.5 million transactions. One of the important developments that have taken place in India compared to other South Asian countries is savings through mobile, commonly known as Mobile Wallet. During 2016, in India, 603 million transactions (approximately USD 2.84 billion) was done through mobile wallets. In Pakistan,
3 
MBS has progressed quite well with a higher growth rate. In the last quarter of 2015–2016, the value of MFS was USD 4.43 billion from approximately 118.7 million transactions. Although at a slow pace, savings through mobile accounts has grown at a higher rate. Deposits in the last quarter of 2015–2016 grew by over 60 per cent to USD 0.11 billion from the previous quarter (Imauddin, 2016).
Financial institutions that had difficulty providing services to the poor using their traditional financial 
production technology, now can offer financial services using mobile technology at a relatively low cost. Government agencies also find it appealing because of the multi-dimensional effects of MFS, and Akhter and Khalily 215
revenue maximising instruments. They are coming forward with required legal and policy support to 
expand MFSs with more security and taxation.
There is no unique and universal form of mobile money or financial services. They vary from country 
to country because of the stated goals and available structures. Diversified financial functions that  
MFSs offer include payments to traders and shopkeepers, payments of utility bills, P2P transfers  
between individuals and remittance within country or between countries. Who offers these services? There are different modes of offering services—(a) banks only; (b) telecommunication providers; and  
(c) combinations of (a) and (b).
Technological advancement and diversification of institutional arrangements have changed the 
landscape for financial development—from postal savings institutions to banks; from branch banking to branchless banking on the supply side. This advancement has multi-dimensional effects. They, as noted earlier, are (a) convenience and the payment effects, when households or firms can make payment for utility services; (b) financial inclusion effect, when mobile technology leads to increase in access to financial services in addition to security and safety of funds; (c) institutional effect, where new institutions can now venture into providing financial services in excluded households and firms in both accessible and inaccessible areas; (d) ease to do business effect, when cooperatives and microfinance institutions (MFIs) in inaccessible areas like mountainous or coastal regions can now be more effective in transferring financial resources and offering financial services to its members; (e) remittance effect, when hardworking poor migrants can remit money to their families either from within the country or abroad at low transaction costs using secured means for improving their quality of life; and (f) informational effect, when bank account holders can access their accounts for transactional information. List of the potential effects of MFS can be longer if one recognises all economic activities at the micro level.
The objective of this article is to assess the current situation of MFS in Bangladesh and the effect of 
MFS on financial inclusion in Bangladesh.
Development of Mobile Financial Services in Bangladesh
In Bangladesh, with network support from two mobile companies, that is, Banglalink and Citycell and software solution support from Sybase 365, Dutch Bangla Bank limited (DBBL) for the very first time in Bangladesh started MFSs on 31 March 2011. In July 2011, BRAC Bank Limited established a subsidiary called ‘bKash’ to facilitate banking services at the household level and in unbanked areas with different products. They have started offering mobile banking with a VISA technology platform to transact money. They have also brought in a useful way of transferring international remittances.
Currently, 28 banks in Bangladesh are licensed to provide mobile banking services (Appendix A). Up 
to December 2018, 18 banks have already launched their mobile banking services. But BRAC Bank and DBBL remain the two dominant players in the market. Moreover, not only the poor but also many well-off individuals are using those services because of its convenience. In a short span of time, mobile banking has flourished at a geometric rate because of higher intensity of mobile users (120.73 million as of October 2016) and diversification in MFSs.
Most of the users of mobile banking services use it for transfer of fund and security. More than three-
quarters use it for remittance of money and one-quarter for security reasons (Bangladesh Bank, 2012). The principal purpose of rural users is receiving remitted money. In urban areas, payment services are the primary reason for using mobile banking. The same policy paper predicted about development of mobile banking in future as almost three-fourth of the users desire to continue using MFSs. With wider mobile network backed by appropriate set of policies, MFSs will expand and contribute to higher 216  Indian Journal of Human Development 14(2) 
intensity of financial inclusion. From a regulatory standpoint, Bangladesh Bank has approved only the 
bank-led model4 to operate in Bangladesh. Accordingly, it provides guidelines for providing MFS through banks in Bangladesh. The allowable MFSs, as per the guidelines, are: (a) disbursement of inward foreign remittances; (b) cash in/out using mobile account through agents/bank branches/ATMs/mobile operator’s outlets; (c) person to business (P2B) payments; (d) business to person (B2P) payments;  
(e) government to person (G2P) payments; (f) person to government (P2G) payments; (g) person to person (P2P) payments; and (h) other payments like microfinance, overdrawn facility and insurance premium (Bangladesh Bank, 2017).
The guidelines provided by Bangladesh Bank allow only a bank-led model to perform mobile banking 
services and P2P highest transaction of about BDT 25,000 per day and BDT 75,000 per month, which may change with time (Table 1). This will be a non-checking account. Among the various transactions through mobile banking, P2P transaction is the most popular. Other services like, P2B or B2P are limited.
An amendment of Bangladesh Bank in 2015, 2017 and an updated amendment in May 2019 set a limit 
on daily transactions, in term of the amount of cash-in and cash-out of mobile banking.
In the recent amended instruction in May 2019, Bangladesh Bank has almost doubled the limit of 
transactions through MFSs. In a recent circular, the central bank set the new limit for the mobile banking where a customer can deposit maximum BDT 30,000 in five times a day, this was BDT 15,000 earlier. Agents can deposit money in his or her mobile account not more than five times daily and 25 times monthly. Similarly, agents are also allowed to withdraw cash not more than five times daily and 20 times monthly. For cash-out, one person can withdraw maximum BDT 25,000 per day and the maximum withdrawal per month is BDT 150,000. Before any transaction, the banks are also required to follow ‘know your customer’ guidelines provided by Bangladesh Bank.
As of December 2018, registered clients reached to 67.52 million and total number of agents reached 
almost 0.89 million (Figure 1[e]). Total number of mobile bank accounts were 37.32 million (Figure 1[b]). The average daily transaction volume was BDT 10.36 billion and the number of daily average transactions was around 6.78 million. Total volume of transactions reached BDT 321.06 billion in December 2018, growth of 1.8 per cent over the previous month. This included inward remittances of BDT 635.1 million, cash-in transactions of BDT 122.61 billion compared to BDT 122.13 billion as cash-out transactions. (Figure 1[g])
The critical question is, has expansion of mobile banking contributed to financial inclusion in 
Bangladesh? No paper, to the best knowledge of the authors, has yet addressed the issue of impact of mobile banking or MFSs on financial inclusion in Bangladesh, although some papers sporadically show that mobile banking has expanded for financial services to micro and small enterprises (e.g., Donner & Escobari, 2010).

The Framework
There are several approaches to understand growth and impacts of MFS in developing countries including 
South Asian countries. We can at least think of three major approaches. They are (a) transaction cost approach; (b) inclusive finance approach; and (c) empowerment approach.
Formal banks generally offer services to their customers or clients through branches. The branches 
are located more in commercial centres or economically active areas. The rationales are deposit potential and investment opportunities. Until otherwise subsidised by the government or central bank, banks have

expanded their areas of operations from the perspective of profit maximisation. Although in recent 
decades, branch density has increased in developing countries, particularly in South Asian countries, quite a large number of adults in the population remain inaccessible. Such inaccessibility is due to high transaction cost of providing financial services to the potential clients and also due to the high cost of receiving financial services by the clients. A financial market is deemed to be efficient if transaction costs of banks and clients converge. It will only converge when transaction cost is low. Therefore, banks through their branches have not been able to provide financial services to every adult individual. In last few decades, agent banking in Southeast Asian countries became quite successful, particularly in Indonesia. Yet there are significant numbers of adult populations that are left out of the network of banks. One of the important drivers for the growth of MFS is low transaction cost. Parvez et al. (2015) reported that 91 per cent of the MFS users in Bangladesh considered ‘low transaction cost’ as the prime driver of using MFSs. Because of low transaction cost and ease of access, financial institutions do have advantages of economies of scale and scope.
The ‘inclusive finance’ approach makes the institutions more focused. The stated objective then 
becomes reaching out to the excluded adult population or households. Availability and uses of technology 
are present in excluded individuals and regions. But when payments of utility bills become a dominating purpose for the users of MFSs, then it really does not talk of improving intensity of inclusive finance;  
it speaks of the multi-dimensionality of services for existing bank clients. The ‘financial inclusion’ approach should have higher marginal effects on the new users of services, excluded groups of low-income households and micro or small enterprises. They will require services beyond ‘payment services’. They will require savings, credit and insurance services. Therefore, our argument of ‘inclusive finance’ approach should be for these financial services through mobile technology.
The ‘empowerment approach’ underscores the need for empowering the ‘less-empowered’ or 
neglected segments of the society. The segment that has remained less empowered or neglected are women. Access to finance does empower them. This is well established empirically in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world. In Kenya, access to MFSs has empowered women and made them more economically active. The ‘empowerment’ approach will enable the banks and mobile service providers to target women in their approach to promote MFSs.
In this article, we focus on assessing the impact of access to mobile banking on financial inclusion 
using household-level data. Mobile banking is an outcome of technological advancement and new financial innovation. Therefore, the framework that we use to understand the effect is essentially the impact of mobile banking as financial innovation on financial inclusion.
Before we use a framework for understanding growth and impacts of mobile banking, we need to 
recognise the kind of financial services that can be offered in mobile baking. In the financial models, new innovations take place due to different reasons.
Generally, financial system offers mainly six types of services. They are (a) transfer of funds,  
(b) pooling of funds, (c) risk management, (d) generation of information for financial decisions,  
(e) solving problems of asymmetric information and moral hazard and (f) payment services. But the 
market does not act perfectly all the time and various crises arise periodically (Merton, 1992). Market imperfections like incomplete markets, asymmetric information restrict the members to avail required financial services. This exists also because of lack of appropriate financial production technology, and consequently not all groups of society receive financial services (Tufano, 2003). Financial innovations like mobile banking have solved the problem of transfer of fund in remote areas, payment services from workplace or home, mobilisation of savings from remote areas, where branches find it difficult to operate.
How does financial innovation benefit providers of financial services? Financial institutions provide 
financial services to the users of financial services as long as providing such services maximise profit 220  Indian Journal of Human Development 14(2) 
through reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity. By duality, this benefits user of financial 
services; financial deepening as well as area deepening of financial institutions takes place. As a result, financial inclusion increases and financial institutions will be more efficient. Financial development increases with such efficiency. This can be graphically represented.
Efficiency of financial intermediation along with higher output is determined by the technological 
innovations and progress, ceteris paribus. With technological progress and innovations, there will be two 
types of output gains: more output given the fixed or previous inputs and more output with lower combination of inputs. Consequently, it allows firms to produce more outputs with the same or fewer inputs resulting an upward shift in the total product curve (TPC) from TPC
1 to TPC2 (Figure 1).

Akhter and Khalily 221
When technological change occurs, production possibility frontier (PPF) shifts outward. Figure 2 
shows that outward shift in PPF with change in improved financial service/transaction caused by mobile 
technology. With the use of mobile technology, financial services have expanded at relatively low labour cost because of higher labour and capital productivity. This will be clear from a simple discussion of how mobile banking works.
Banks can offer mobile banking services through either using mobile agents or own mobile accounts. 
In Bangladesh, both the modes are popular, but mobile agents are more popular. The marginal cost of providing MFSs through agents is quite negligible. It is a popular form of financial service as it involves less paperwork, low transaction cost and higher ability to provide services across the country. In many cases, a household can transact through agents without opening any mobile banking account. One can also save in mobile bank accounts through wallet services. Regardless of mode of offering mobile banking financial services, with financial production technology, marginal cost of capital and labour will reduce.
Data and Methodology
We use the data of the study on ‘Access to Financial Services in Bangladesh, 2015’, of the Institute for Inclusive Finance and Development (InM) to assess intensity of financial inclusion and its determinants. The survey was carried out in 2014. The data is nationally representative, covering 8,449 households in 63 districts out of 64 districts of Bangladesh, following the methodology of household income and expenditure surveys of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). The sampling design of the survey was stratified. The survey covers both rural (77%) and urban (23%) areas of the country. Primarily, 300 primary sampling units (PSUs; villages and wards) were selected from 63 districts, and we randomly selected 30 households from each PSU.
Access to finance is defined as access to different financial services—deposits, credit, payment 
services, remittance service and any other formal financial services that are offered by banks and MFIs. The variables included household-level characteristics, region (rural and urban) and types of financial services accessed and mobile-banking-related information.
We have conducted our analysis in several steps. In first step, a logistic regression analysis has been 
conducted to examine the association between the access to mobile banking and various socio-economic characteristics of the households, such as, migrated member, household head’s age, education, gender, main occupation, poverty status of the household, rural and urban variation, etc. The model has been adjusted by geographical variation of the household.
In the next step, we analysed the relationship between access to MFS and financial inclusion. For 
doing this, we have used an instrumental variable, as access to MFS is endogeneous which means that this is determined by some other factors and may be correlated with the error term. Therefore, using instrumental variable, we proceed by applying a probit model with continuous and binary endogenous regressors (instrumental variable [iv]probit).
Intensity of Access to Mobile Banking Across Division and  
Poverty Status
The intensity of access to MFSs across region will help to understand the coverage of the service. Table 
2 measures the intensity of access to financial services and reports the role of mobile banking in 222  Indian Journal of Human Development 14(2) 
Bangladesh. Since the study was based on survey of 8,449 households, it provides information of unique 
access of households to financial services and the intensity of access to MFSs. Essentially, it avoids duplicate counting of overlapping users of services.
Table 2 provides several findings. First, based on households, approximately 27 per cent of the 
households have access to MFSs using either their own mobile account or others’ accounts. Second, despite relatively higher percentage of households having access to mobile banking, only around 13 per cent of the adult populations have accessed MFSs. Third, intensity of uses of MFSs varies by divisions with higher access in Barisal and Rangpur; the one reason is temporary domestic migration is higher in those regions (Appendix B). It is expected that, higher the percentage of migrant workers, higher will be the remittance flow. Fourth, intensity of uses of MFSs is higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Fifth, in terms of poverty status, non-poor households use MFS more than the poor. Finally, there is ample scope for expanding MFS in Bangladesh because of the fact that only 13 per cent of the adult populations have had access to MFSs in 2014–2015. These findings give us a good understanding of who uses MFSs.
Who Uses Mobile Banking Services and Why?
One of the critical issues in determining the impact of mobile banking on financial inclusion will be to understand the characteristics of the users and non-users as this will give an idea about who is accessing financial services through mobile banking. Therefore, it will shed some lights on the determinants of mobile banking. The household characteristics include annual income, land asset holdings, occupation, age, education, migration, poverty status and so on. It has been seen that the comparatively well-off households are mostly using mobile banking services (Table 3). Those households are better in terms of annual food and non-food expenditure, income and land holding. Even a higher percentage of non-users Table 2.

households (30.74%) are below poverty line compared to mobile banking user households (18.74%). 
The most apparent disparity among the two types of households is in having migrant members. Above 34 per cent of the mobile banking user households have at least one local migrant member, which is tiny for the nonuser mobile banking households, only around 8 per cent. Therefore, this discussion illustrates that financially better-off households who have at least one migrant member are mostly using mobile banking services. Out of 1,588 micro merchants (cottage, small, medium and micro enterprise) in the sample, around 30 per cent have access to mobile banking.
Through Logit regression, we assessed the probability of households with different characteristics 
using the MFSs.
A logistic regression analysis has been conducted to examine the association between the dependent 
variable, that is, the log of the odds-ratio and the independent variables. Here the dependent variable represents the log of odds-ratio of access to mobile banking, that is,

And the independent variables are various socio-economic characteristics of the households, like, migrated member, household head’s age, education, gender, main occupation, poverty status of the household, rural and urban variation, etc. The model has been adjusted by geographical variation of the household.

non-agriculture or wage earner are explanatory variables taking binary values of 0–1. γijγij, βijβij are 
statistics to be estimated. εi εi is random error term that varies among households.
Along with the logit regression co-efficient, the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on the 
dependent variable are also shown for ease of interpretation.
For the binary explanatory variables, marginal effects assess discrete change, that is, the change in 
predicted probabilities due to the binary independent variable changes from 0 to 1. Marginal effects for 
continuous variables assess the instantaneous rate of change.
There is a clear significant relationship between national migration and use of mobile banking. It is 
quite expected, as migrant members of the households send money to their family through various mediums of transaction. And nowadays, mobile banking is one of the most popular means to so this.
The results are reported in Table 4. We have reported both Logit coefficients and marginal coefficients.The marginal effect for a dichotomous independent variable shows how the dependent variable 
changes as the dichotomous independent variable changes from 0 to 1, after controlling in some way for the other variables in the model. Here, in Table 4, the marginal effect shows that, on average, the probability of using MFSs by a household increases by about 43 per cent if the household have temporary domestic migrant family member. This indicates that the households with a migrant within the country have higher probability to use MFSs. Previously, migrant workers had to visit their home and carry the money by themselves or they had to depend on someone to send the money to their relatives. Family members rely heavily on the money that migrant workers send home and they had to wait earlier. Currently, MFSs are saving migrant workers and their family’s money/time compared to how money had to be remitted before. That would apparently increase incomes and also free up social resources for more productive uses.
Second, households in urban areas are more expected to use MFSs. This is quite expected because of 
the fact that internal remittances are sent mostly from urban areas to the households living in rural areas. Third, Non-poor households have a higher probability to use the services compared to the poor. This suggests that poor households are more likely to be left out from using MFSs. This might be the reason for their accessing financial services of MFIs (Appendix C).
Similarly, education has a positive impact on using MFSs. Educated individuals are more likely to use 
the services of mobile banking than less educated individuals. Individuals with profession in non-agriculture have higher probability to use MFSs. All these results were statistically significant, and corroborate the findings that we derived from Table 4.

Situation of Access to Finance of Different Income Groups
We notice that the share of accessing bank financial services is highest among the richest 20 per cent 
which gradually decreases as we move from the richest 20 per cent to the lowest 20 per cent  
(Figure 4). Similarly, the percentage of households having access to finance in MFS is also highest  
for the richest 20 per cent and lowest for the bottom 20 per cent. Conversely, households belonging  
to the poverty stricken groups (i.e., lower middle and middle income groups) are mostly accessing financial services from the MFI sector. Therefore, there is ample scope of expanding MFSs through MFIs among the poor.
Analysis of Impact of Mobile Banking on Financial Inclusion:  
Instrumental Variable Based Estimates
Now let us bring the issue of impact of mobile banking on financial inclusion in Bangladesh. A frequently 
used basis of financial inclusion is the percentage of people who own bank accounts. Agarwal (2008) pointed that the number of deposit accounts as a proportion of the number of families is taken to be a better indicator of banking diffusion. Some commonly used indicators for assessing financial inclusion are: number of bank accounts, bank branches numbers, number of ATMs, amount and volume of bank loans and levels of deposits made in banks. Considering any single indicator as financial access provide only partial information on the inclusiveness of the financial system of an economy. Therefore, in this study, financial inclusion has been measured by accessibility in terms of three dimensions: access to banks, access to bank and MFIs and finally access to savings accounts in banks. The intensity of access to MFSs on financial inclusion is reported in Table 5.

As access to mobile banking is an endogenous variable which means that this is determined by some 
other factors and may be correlated with the error term, therefore a proper instrument is required to 
correctly capture the effect. Here the ‘percentage of households in a village having own mobile banking account’ has been used as instrumental variable. As the variable represents information about mobile banking and also mobile bank networking therefore this is a proper instrumental variable that can signify the variable access to mobile bank account. Instrumental variable estimation can be applied to improve the causal effect of treatment on the outcome. This estimate can be interpreted as a causal effect for the part of the population whose participation in the treatment was affected by the instrument (Becker, 2016).
Using this instrumental variable, we proceed by applying a probit model with continuous and binary 
endogenous regressors (ivprobit) in this context.
We have reported only the significant coefficients of three groups—banks only, banks and MFIs and 
access to savings account in bank. The other variables that we included in the model estimation were regional dummy variables and selected characteristics of the households.
The variable, ‘percentage of households in a village having own mobile bank account’ has significant 
positive impacts on access to bank financial services and services of both banks and MFIs, and also access to savings account in banks. Here, in Table 5, the marginal effect for the instrumental variable shows that, on average, the probability of a household having access to bank increases by about 40 per cent, if the percentage of households in that village having own mobile bank account increases by about 1 percentage point. This is quite expected because mobile services are offered through banks in Bangladesh. Finally, marginal effect on financial inclusion is higher for non-poor groups and also for households having higher education and older household head. This is also expected, as literacy of using financial services is higher among non-poor and educated households.
The conclusion of the analysis of the impact of mobile banking or money on financial inclusions is 
that it has contributed positively to financial inclusion. But the findings do also lead to the conclusion that there is a non-poor bias in providing MFSs in Bangladesh. This is equally true in other SAARC countries as the sector is still emerging, not in terms of intensity, but in terms of scope and versatility.
The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) conducted a survey on the socio-economic impact of MFSs in 
five countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Serbia and Malaysia in 2011. The study reported several important findings. First, MFS will drive financial inclusion with varying degree, ranging from Table 5. Impact of Mobile Banking on Access to Financial Services in Bangladesh (instrumental variable-based

a 20-percentage point increase in financial inclusion in Pakistan to a 5 per cent increase in Malaysia. In 
other three countries (Bangladesh, India and Serbia), intensity of impact will be around 10–12 per cent. Second, MFS will accelerate economic growth in India by 5 per cent and by around 2–3 per cent in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Serbia in 2020. The study further estimated that income inequality will reduce by 5 per cent by 2020 because of supporting poor population and micro and small entrepreneurs with savings and credit, increasing flow of domestic and international remittances and transfers.
All these results do provide information about the very positive effects of MFSs. Impacts will be 
higher on economic growth and income inequality as well as poverty reduction because of increasing flow of resources through mobile technology and provision for savings and credit.
Regulatory Approach
Regulation of MFSs is an area of major concern for central banks. It becomes a concern when banks and mobile operators offer MFSs. Banks are regulated by the central bank, and mobile operators are regulated by a separate agency, for example, in Bangladesh, it is Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). Mobile operators are a crucial part of providing financial services. The strong argument for regulation is to ensure financial stability with growth. This is justified when MFSs include savings, credit and insurance. We focus on the broad issue of regulation.
In most countries including Bangladesh in South Asia, MFSs are bank-led. That means, banks provide 
financial services through mobile accounts and the agents in conjunction with telecom operators. In Bangladesh, most banks have been offering MFSs either directly or through establishing subsidiaries. When they offer direct services, they recruit their own agent network. The principal holds a major share in the subsidiary company to ensure that focused services are provided.
In 2011, Bangladesh Bank issued guidelines for MFSs and updated in December of the same year. 
Under the guidelines, two ownerships structures can exist—MFS could operate as a wing of the banks, and MFS can be provided under a subsidiary with 51 per cent share of the primary bank. A draft new guideline was issued in 2015 that are likely to have significant changes, the important one being that a single entity (bank or non-bank) will not have ownership of more than 15 per cent, and interoperability.
MFSs will involve multiple institutions. In many countries, particularly developed countries, it 
provided largely techno operators. In South Asian countries, it is bank-led.
As long as money is the raw material of the financial products and is being offered through banks, 
regulation should be in the hands of the central bank. But central banks ought to not only regulate or monitor the behaviour of the banks and subsidiaries but should ensure flexibility and create an appropriate environment for expanding MFSs. The ultimate outcome should be expansion through minimising risk for the financial system.
The Role of Government in Advancing Mobile Financial Services
MFSs are at different stages in different countries. Moreover, there cannot also be any regulatory approach or a set of role for the government that can be applied in all contexts and all countries. A government should play a role in creating an enabling environment for developing a financial system that is largely mobile based. An enabling environment should ensure flexibility for the operators and the banks.228  Indian Journal of Human Development 14(2) 
We consider that the government role can be elucidated based on the seven pillars of developing 
MFSs. The seven pillars can be broadly classified into four groups (Table 6). The World Economic 
Forum in 2011 identified these seven pillars for developing MFSs.
Government has a keen interest in the development of MFSs even in the context of using the services. 
It can provide subsidy and other financial benefits to the targeted groups through using MFSs. This will reduce the cost of transfer and minimise leakage. More importantly, beneficiaries will receive it at a very low transaction cost. But from the perspective of a bigger picture, governments should contribute to the development of MFSs as a financial system. The critical role that government can play is to ensure protection of consumers and financial stability through an appropriate legal framework. It is needed because multiple agencies are involved in it.
Challenges and Some Recommendations
This study identifies several major challenges for MFSs in Bangladesh. Those are discussed as follows.
Consumer Literacy and Awareness
Consumer literacy and awareness play an important role in mobile internet or money adoption. In Bangladesh, as revealed in our survey, around 56 per cent of the households do not have an awareness and literacy about mobile banking or MFSs. Regardless of substantial access, mobile phone usage is still very basic among Bangladeshis. A common perception among customers is, MFS can only be used for P2P transfers, and not for advanced functions such as, bill payment or savings. Some consumers complain that the service fees charged by MFS operators are high. These findings do clearly suggest that there is a need for consumer literacy and awareness.Table 6.

Recommendation 1
Providers have to come up with innovative products and services to attract more customers and can make 
it as a daily need for the customers. They have to promote services through leaflets, booklets, banners, e-banners, etc. Literacy and awareness building programmes through television or radio could also prove useful.
Security and Efficiency
Security and efficiency is another area of challenge. Even in the USA, more than 50 per cent of the adult 
populations have ‘safety’ concerns about using mobile money. Therefore, in Bangladesh individual approach5 will be required for selecting clients or subscribers.
Recommendation 2
National identity smart card should be the basis for selecting clients. This will reduce risk of financing 
terrorism or informal use of money in informal inter-country border trade or business. All agents should be highly trained to offer best services to its customers and prevent sensitive or illegal monetary transactions. For controlling criminal activities, the central bank has already set a limit for transaction numbers, cash-in and cash-out of mobile banking in Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank, 2019).
Limited Competition in Mobile Financial Services
Many mobile companies and banks operate in a country. Jointly they are offering MFSs. Although 28 
banks have received the license to offer MFS and 18 banks have launched their products, but only two providers (bKash and ROCKET) have the largest market share.
Recommendation 3
For expansion of MFS, the government as well as the central bank should ensure that the required 
infrastructure develops, and competition exists. This will help institutions to expand services with scale economy and offer the services at a low cost. The other firms providing MFSs should promote their services through their leaflets, booklets, pamphlets, banners, etc. Additionally, misinterpretation about risks of service usage should also be removed from consumers mind by applying appropriate marketing strategies. The providers have to come up with innovative products and services to attract more customers and can make it a daily need for customers.
Other Concerns
Savings and credit through mobile technology need to be clearly perceived. Bangladesh is yet to enter 
into ‘mobile wallet’.6 But it is used in India and Pakistan, for example. There are other countries that are 230  Indian Journal of Human Development 14(2) 
‘mobilising’ savings and offering credit. Where should the wallet be opened? Should it be the mobile 
operator or the bank? Security of money or savings needs to be clearly examined. This has to be examined from the perspective of safety and institutional accountability and guarantee.
Conclusions
Growing mobile network in Bangladesh has brought forth new possibilities, which comprises expanded 
mobile phone usage, smart-phone usage and internet services. Along with technological advancement, new mobile banking services have commenced. The increase in technology usage in the urban areas is influencing consumer behaviour, payment techniques and purchasing habits eventually. And a number of people from all levels are using this service. It is an easy, cost-effective, secured and affordable way to send and receive money. Financial services, like, bill payment, transfer of funds, depositing or withdrawal of cash through mobile telecom could play a significant role. The result of this study shows that it significantly improves efficiency and financial inclusion. Additionally, MFSs have brought major changes in financial products and institutional structure.
Findings of this study suggest that compared to the poor, financially solvent households are mostly 
using MFS. But more research has to be done to design appropriate MFS products for these poverty stricken groups, so that poor people can also enjoy the benefits of MFS. Thus, it can reach excluded low-income and micro and small entrepreneurs, migrant family members, all of which will aid alleviating poverty and making growth more inclusive. In this model, mobile operators and the financial sector can work together to provide financial services by minimising the duration of time taken in transections at the point of sale to different groups of people with minimum or no paper work. This will facilitate consumers to enjoy multiple services on one device.
Although MFS has been showing a geometric growth rate, a huge number of people are still not using 
it. Given the large scale of operation, the providers can think of reducing the service charge to make it more attractive to the customers. Additionally, all MFS agents should be highly trained to prevent sensitive or illegal monetary transactions. Providers need to take special initiatives to encourage female participation in MFS.
Our analysis showed the positive role of mobile banking on financial inclusion. The findings do 
suggest that the role of banks and MFIs to expand services in inaccessible areas can be effective if they are complemented by mobile money. The central bank should also collaborate with institutions like MFIs or cooperative that can expand financial inclusion through using mobile technology. While banks may be driven by profitability or the central bank may be driven by their commitment to financial inclusion, MFSs should be provided with appropriate regulatory framework.
The need for MFSs is beyond question now. By developing appropriate MFSs products for the poor 
can play a complimentary role in expanding financial services in mountainous and other inaccessible areas. MFIs have been playing role in financial inclusion in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries as well as in many developing countries. Our final point is that research on impact or efficiency of MFSs is largely absent in Bangladesh. Whatever studies are available; there are none on the impact of mobile money. There is a need for further research on the impact of mobile money both at the micro and macro levels. There should be study on what should constitute optimum regulation for mobile money. However, MFSs ought to be bank-led. Finally, we can state that MFS is bringing a smart banking system to life.Akhter and Khalily 231
