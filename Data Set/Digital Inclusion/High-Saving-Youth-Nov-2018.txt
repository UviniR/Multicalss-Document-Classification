High-Saving Youth in Smallholder 
Households: An Untapped Market
This analysis uses data on young people 15 to 30 years old 
in smallholder households from CGAP’s financial diaries and 
national surveys with smallholder households, specifically 
examining their saving habits, ownership of mobile phones, 
and use of mobile money. These two research methods are 
highly complementary. The smallholder diaries captured 
detailed cash flows from 270 families in three markets, 
while the national surveys of smallholder households 
examined the agricultural and financial lives of roughly 
18,000 smallholder families in six countries.1
This Brief makes the case for providers to leverage the 
strong savings habits of youth in smallholder families 
and their access to mobile phones to develop digital 
products as an onramp into the formal financial system.
What do the data tell us?
Youth in the smallholder diaries sample saved average 
annual amounts two to five times as much as their elders.  
Results from CGAP’s financial diaries with smallholder 
families in three communities in Mozambique, Tanzania, 
and Pakistan show that youth age 15 to 30 saved much 
more money than older age groups did (Figure 1).2 In 
Tanzania, over the year of data collection, youth 15 to 30 
in smallholder families saved an average total equivalent 
of US$174—over four times as much as adults 31 to 60.
In contrast, borrowing was relatively less common 
among youth in the smallholder diaries.  Across the 
three sample communities, young people 30 and under 
in these smallholder households generally borrowed less than those 31 and over (Figure 1). And what debt these 
young people did take on is dwarfed by the amount they 
saved. In all three samples, on average, young people 
saved four to five times more than they borrowed; they 
were clearly more inclined to save than to borrow, and 
they looked to informal financial tools and their social 
network to meet these needs.
Younger and older age cohorts in smallholder 
households generally have the same views on savings .3 
When asked in the national surveys of smallholder 
households about their family’s savings priorities and 
their preferred ways to put money aside, responses from 
younger and older age groups tracked closely.
Financial inclusion is relatively lower among younger 
members of smallholder households.4 The national 
surveys show a similar pattern across age groups 
(Figure 2). Financial services from providers like banks, 
microfinance institutions, and mobile network operators 
are used by relatively fewer younger people, peaks 
between ages 31 and 60, and then declines with older 
people. Young people in smallholder families instead 
rely overwhelmingly on informal financial services and 
social networks, putting money aside in savings and 
credit groups and with trusted family members.
Young people in smallholder households tend to have 
mobile phones, but they have not widely adopted mobile 
money.5 In Côte d’Ivoire and Bangladesh, for example, 
83 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of youth 15 to 
30 years old in smallholder families own a mobile phone, BRIEFYoung people in smallholder families tend to save more than their elders and have mobile 
phones, but they use mobile money at lower rates. Instead of using mobile money, they rely 
on informal forms of savings, which can be risky and do not leave “financial footprints” that can 
unlock access to other financial tools. How might financial services providers (FSPs) develop 
solutions that leverage technology, demonstrate value, and better meet the needs and 
aspirations of high-saving young people in smallholder families? Could savings be the use case 
that drives adoption of mobile money among the next generation of smallholder customers?

2 CGAP’s financial diaries with smallholder families collected detailed financial information from 270 small-scale farming households in three 
communities in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Pakistan over the course of a year. The diaries methodology combines in-depth quantitative and 
qualitative research. Research teams met participating families every two weeks to collect granular data on all household cash flows, financial 
tools, assets, shocks, life events, and attitudes toward agriculture and financial services. For more information, see Anderson and Ahmed 
(2016) and the research methodology that accompanies the datasets.
3 The sample for the national surveys includes household members who contribute to household income or participate in agricultural 
activities, so individuals in this younger age group could not be strictly considered dependents.
4 Financial inclusion, in this case, is defined as an account in the national smallholder survey respondent’s name with either a formal bank, 
microfinance institution, credit union, cooperative, more formal savings group (e.g., savings and credit cooperative organizations in 
Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria), or mobile money provider.
5 Most of these are basic or feature phones. Only small percentages of smallholders in each market own smart phones. While this analysis 
focuses on the gap between mobile phone ownership and mobile money use and how that differs among age cohorts in smallholder 
households, clearly these six countries present different environments for the overall use and expansion of mobile money, due in part to 
differences in their regulatory framework and infrastructure.November 20182

Note: “Informal savings deposit” includes setting money aside through financial activities or instruments such as lending to friends and family, 
a savings and credit group (e.g., rotating savings and credit association [ROSCA], accumulating savings and credit association [ASCA]), and a 
money guard. “Informal borrowing received” could involve various financial activities or mechanisms, including credit from a store, acting as a 
money guard for others, informal savings and credit groups, a wage advance, pawning assets, and a moneylender.7067

but only 22 percent in both countries have a mobile money 
account. The gap between the percentage of young 
people who have a mobile phone and the percentage who 
have a mobile money account is also remarkable in Uganda 
and Tanzania (39 and 29 percentage points, respectively).
What drives the different financial behaviors of 
younger and older members of smallholder house -
holds requires further exploration in each market . 
Younger  members may have fewer expenses than their 
elders, though they may also be earning less. Other 
hypotheses point to the preference to save and avoid 
credit risk among younger people, different customer 
experiences and levels of trust of FSPs, and the lack of 
financial products that meet their needs. From their side, 
providers may perceive young people to be riskier, with 
relatively less working experience, collateral, and finan -
cial history. But they should not overlook the longer-term 
business case for serving youth.What can providers do?
Young people 30 and under in smallholder households 
regularly put money aside and have high rates of mobile 
phone ownership. Providers can build on this savings 
habit and offer more appealing ways for young people 
to continue saving. New mechanisms that allow them to 
put money aside may also seem more relevant than other 
formal financial services like commercial bank accounts. 
Digitally enabled means of storing value—be they mobile 
money accounts, digitally enabled layaways with retailers, 
or savings accounts with formal banks offered through 
digital channels—that are tailored to their needs and 
aspirations may drive youth to use formal financial services.
And the youth market in smallholder households 
is sizeable (see Figure 4). In Tanzania, for example, 
7.6 million young people 15 to 30 years old live in 
smallholder households, and 1.8 million of them own a

mobile phone but not a mobile money account. This in 
and of itself is a big market of potential mobile money 
clients who could be transferring money and buying 
airtime, ringtones, and other fee-based services. Data 
indicate that they would also be putting aside meaningful 
amounts of money. For example, if young people in 
smallholder households were to each save US$174 per 
year (i.e., the average annual savings of youth 15 to 30 
in the smallholder diaries sample in Tanzania [Figure 1]), 
then over US$318 million could be mobilized through 
financial channels every year.
This untapped youth market is notable for both its 
number of clients and the potential cumulative value 
of their transactions. Access to a robust portfolio of 
financial products is important for customer value and choice. The goal is not to eradicate informal financial 
services or obviate the importance of social networks 
in money management and asset accumulation. Each 
financial tool—formal, informal, or social—has its own 
profile of benefits and constraints, and individuals 
should have a range of financial tools available to meet 
their objectives, in line with their personal preferences 
for privacy, immediacy, cost, transaction size, risk 
exposure, and future access to other services.
How can FSPs engage high-saving youth in smallholder 
households? Here are two key considerations.
Discover what motivates youth to save and design a 
responsive solution.  Most young people 15 to 30 years 
old in smallholder households consider it very important

© CGAP , 2018to set money aside for future purchases.6 Their specific 
household savings priorities varied, from health care 
in Tanzania (32 percent), to school fees in Uganda (39 
percent), to general future purchases in Côte d’Ivoire 
and Nigeria (43 percent and 42 percent, respectively). 
FSPs can dig further into why young people in their 
market put money aside and then design products that 
respond specifically to these aspirations and concerns. 
Indeed, research suggests that generic products will 
not lead to significant uptake and use. Providers 
need to offer a broad range of customized and 
targeted services.7 Customers adopt and use financial 
solutions to solve problems, seize opportunities, and 
pursue dreams, not as ends unto themselves. Games, 
competitions, and incentives can also keep customers 
engaged and encourage repeated saving.
Today’s young saver may be tomorrow’s entre preneur 
and head of household, so FSPs would be wise to invest 
in a long-term customer relationship.  There are links 
between the level of savings and youth entrepreneurship, 
because savings allow youth to purchase productive 
assets.8 Encouraging and reinforcing savings among 
youth can also help to increase broader financial 
awareness, build trust, and lay the foundation for a long-
term relationship. FSPs that provide youth an entry point 
to financial services can offer stepping stones to other 
relevant financial products over time, particularly as young 
people transition from adolescence into adulthood. After 
all, today’s young people are tomorrow’s entrepreneurs 
and workers, community leaders, and household elders: 
The next generation of clients for FSPs.
