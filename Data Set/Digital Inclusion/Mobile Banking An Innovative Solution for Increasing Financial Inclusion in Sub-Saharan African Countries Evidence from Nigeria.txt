Abstract: Purpose‚ÄîThis research discusses emerging trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, barriers and
factors inÔ¨Çuencing mobile banking as an innovative solution for increasing Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with a speciÔ¨Åc focus on Nigeria. Design /methodology /approach‚ÄîUsing a
qualitative meta-synthesis (QMS), an interpretivist research paradigm, authors provide an analytical
tool for understanding the subject of inquiry by integrating Ô¨Åndings from previous studies and
relevant data from the reports of the Central Bank of Nigeria on emerging trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion.
Findings‚ÄîThree major factors emerged as drivers of mobile banking in Nigeria: (a) the ease of using
mobile devices for personal banking transactions including prompt information about users‚Äô Ô¨Ånancial
transactions (savings and withdrawals) immediately through SMS (short message service) alert
(easy management of my account ); (b) the security /safety concerns of theft and cyber fraud; (c) social
inÔ¨Çuence of friends, relatives, policy makers and social trends. Implications‚ÄîIn contextualizing
mobile banking in SSA and in Nigeria in particular, this paper contributes to exploring the growth in
the use of mobile banking by linking it with the ‚Äúvalue in use‚Äù (VIU) perspective. This approach of the
service dominant logic involves three sub-constructs (experience, personalization, and relationship),
which all validate and support the proposed assertion that mobile banking is adopted by users because
of utility expectancy (perceived usefulness), e ort expectancy (perceived ease of use), and social
inÔ¨Çuence expectancy (opinions of friends /relatives). Originality /value‚ÄîThis research, although
qualitative in nature, validates information technology (IT) adoption theories /perspectives and
enriches the ‚Äúvalue in use‚Äù approach.

1. Introduction
The global economy faces extreme poverty, slower growth, climate change, widening inequalities,
unemployment, and growing inconstant working conditions, but the plight of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
is worse because more than 204 million people are unemployed, and the worsening unemployment
situation provides breeding grounds for forced labour, slavery and human tra cking [ 1]. Additionally,
the report of the World Bank from 2019 [2] identiÔ¨Åed extreme poverty, growing public debt /debt risk,
slow growth of the labour market, rising labour force, and gender disparities as the critical inhibiting
factors holding back economic growth and sustainable development in SSA.

In the midst of the economic crisis explicated above, the people and businesses in the area,
including Nigeria, su er an extremely low level of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion [ 3,4]. Studies have explicated
that the phenomenon of the lack of access (Ô¨Ånancial exclusion) to basic Ô¨Ånancial services is a global
problem, but the problem is most pronounced in emerging economies including SSA [5,6].
At the global level, Ô¨Ånancial inclusion has occupied the attention of international organisations
especially the agendas of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development
goals (SDGs). Some of the targets of the expired MDGs alert the United Nations member countries to
the pressing issue of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and its complexity. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the goals of Ô¨Åghting extreme
poverty foundationally (MDG1); achieving gender equality to promote equal opportunities for women
to access employment, social protection, and training (MDG3); and forging a global partnership for
development (MDG 8) directly address Ô¨Ånancial inclusion challenges. Similarly, the targets of the
ongoing SDGs that directly impact on Ô¨Ånancial inclusion include: no poverty (SDG1), zero hunger
(SDG2), good health and wellbeing (SDG3), quality education (SDG4), decent work and economic
growth (SDG8), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG9), reduced inequality (SDG10), peace,
justice and strong institutions (SDG16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG17).
In Nigeria, several attempts have been made by the government to improve Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
through a number of public-sector led credit schemes and poverty alleviation programmes such as
National Economy Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND); the People‚Äôs Bank, Community Banking Models,
the Bank of Industry (BOI), the MicroÔ¨Ånance Institutions (MFIs) the Small and Medium Enterprises
Equity Investment Scheme (SMEEIS), National Poverty Eradication Programme, Youth Enterprise with
Innovation in Nigeria (You Win) Programme, Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme or
SURE-P , National Enterprise Development Programme or NEDEP and several others [ 7,8]. In spite of
the Ô¨Ånancial inclusion intervention schemes, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (drafted in 2012
and revised in 2018) and the ‚Äúcash-less Nigeria policy‚Äù, the e orts failed because of the government‚Äôs
inability to properly nurture its development programmes, weak reward system, dysfunctional
structures and endemic poor programme implementation [ 8‚Äì11]. In the early 2000s, mobile banking
emerged as an information technology (IT)-driven innovative technology, which greatly improved
the degree of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in the continent [ 5,12‚Äì15]. Mobile banking provides virtual access
for individuals and businesses to procure Ô¨Ånancial transactions such as savings, funds‚Äô transfer,
and stock market deals with banks at any convenient time and place [ 16]. The receptiveness to
mobile banking is impressive, as the majority of the banks in Nigeria have adopted and introduced
mobile banking applications. Additionally, mobile banking has thrived because Nigeria has the fastest
growing telecommunication infrastructure in Africa and the third in the world [ 17]. The beneÔ¨Åt
of IT infrastructure is supported by the population of over 150 million people [ 18]. Providing an
enabling environment for better and improved Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, Nigeria justiÔ¨Åes the adoption and
introduction of mobile banking to strengthen local and international e orts towards Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
(the timely introduction of mobile phone technology in the continent within the last 10 years resulted
in 82% mobile banking penetration in Nigeria, the highest penetration of mobile banking across
developing markets [19].
It is possible to state that research on Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in SSA is just emerging [ 20‚Äì22]. To enrich
the body of knowledge in this important Ô¨Åeld of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, there is a need to explore empirical
evidence. Financial inclusion, in fact, has been delayed in the continent prior to the liberalization of
the Ô¨Ånancial sector in the 1980s, because many African banks were owned, controlled and heavily
regulated by the governments as monopolies, a situation that restricted the adoption of innovative
technologies in banking operations [3,6,23].
Thus, the purpose of this exploratory qualitative research is to critically discuss the emerging
trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, the barriers to Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and factors inÔ¨Çuencing mobile banking
adoption as an innovative solution for increasing Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in SSA with a speciÔ¨Åc focus
on Nigeria.Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 3 of 24
There are several parts to this paper. The Ô¨Årst part presents the introduction of the thematic
issue of mobile banking and Ô¨Ånancial inclusion. The second part focuses on the deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Ånancial
inclusion and mobile banking from both managerial and academic perspectives, examining barriers to
Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and factors inÔ¨Çuencing adoption of mobile banking in Nigeria. Then, this paper
discusses methodology and proposes Ô¨Åndings and discussions of thematic issues. The concluding
part discusses the implications and recommendations on the mobile banking agenda and direction in
sub-Saharan Africa.
2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Financial Inclusion: DeÔ¨Ånitions and Features
The need to achieve the sustainable development goals brings to the attention of the authorities a
pressing issue, namely the complexity of the phenomenon, the multitude of tools that could be used to
achieve the set targets, the large number of stakeholders involved or that may be involved and the lack
of Ô¨Ånancial funds [ 24‚Äì27]. For these reasons, Ô¨Ånancial inclusion has become important, both at the
microeconomic and macroeconomic levels, as it can be a tool for promoting the principles of sustainable
development [ 28‚Äì36]. Financial inclusion is not only a concern of Ô¨Ånancial institutions that are trying to
attract more and more categories of consumers and have a responsible attitude towards them but also
of public authorities [ 33,37‚Äì42]. In fact, there are specialists who consider Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, for some
countries, even a catalyst for sustainable development, a tool for poverty reduction and a facilitator
of economic growth [ 27,43‚Äì45]. Financial inclusion is a complex concept in a continuous evolution
taking into account the transformations that are taking place worldwide from an economic, social and
political point of view. Financial inclusion refers to ‚Äúaccess to and usage of appropriate, a ordable,
and accessible Ô¨Ånancial services‚Äù [ 46]. Given the complexity of the phenomenon and the importance
of national and regional characteristics on it, Ô¨Ånancial inclusion presents multiple deÔ¨Ånitions in the
literature, which emphasize certain aspects such as Ô¨Ånancial innovation, microÔ¨Ånance and the use of
mobile phones [ 47]. According to the World Bank, which is a main international Ô¨Ånancial institution
with preoccupations in this Ô¨Åeld, Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúaccess to useful and a ordable
Ô¨Ånancial products and services that meet their needs‚Äîtransactions, payments, savings, credit and
insurance‚Äîdelivered in a responsible and sustainable way‚Äù [43].
Apiors and Suzuki (2018) consider that Ô¨Ånancial inclusion supposes ‚Äúthe full range of services
(payments, savings, credit, and insurance), to speciÔ¨Åc quality features of delivery (for example, stability
and a ordability), inclusiveness (with special focus on the poor), and choice (o er of service by a range
of institutions)‚Äù [48].
The concept of social inclusion emerged as a solution to the phenomenon of social exclusion
that has been identiÔ¨Åed by geographers who have observed limited access of certain categories of
citizens to basic Ô¨Ånancial services [ 49]. After the emergence of the concept of social exclusion, the 90s
were characterized by intense scientiÔ¨Åc concerns regarding citizens‚Äô access to Ô¨Ånancial services for
payment, savings, and credit, but also to insurance services. Subsequently, the European Commission
focused on this issue, considering that Ô¨Ånancial exclusion is a component of the phenomenon of social
exclusion that a ects, in various forms, important categories of citizens of the European Union [ 45].
Financial exclusion targets people that ‚Äúencounter di culties accessing and /or using Ô¨Ånancial services
and products in the mainstream market that are appropriate to their needs and enable them to lead a
normal social life in the society in which they belong.‚Äù It must be highlighted that the phenomenon of
Ô¨Ånancial exclusion a ects both developed and developing countries, but the share of the non-banked
population is di erent across the world, depending on the level of development of that country [45].
Although the concept of Ô¨Ånancial exclusion has emerged in the UK [ 50], the phenomenon mainly
aects developing countries characterized by a precarious Ô¨Ånancial infrastructure from an institutional,
technical, legislative, or social point of view. Given the manifestation of the phenomenon of Ô¨Ånancial
exclusion predominantly in developing countries, more and more deÔ¨Ånitions and approaches [ 51,52]Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 4 of 24
focus on: (i) citizens‚Äô access to the formal or semi-formal Ô¨Ånancial sector composed of commercial banks,
development Ô¨Ånance institutions, post o ces, microÔ¨Ånance banks, credit unions and cooperatives,
(ii) improving the process of saving but also accessing loans, (iii) enhancing risk management,
(iv) developing innovative Ô¨Ånancial solutions, (v) protection of consumer rights.
The concerns of international Ô¨Ånancial institutions such as the World Bank, development agencies,
national market supervisors and regulators have intensiÔ¨Åed [ 53] in order to attract an increasing number
of citizens to gain access to products and services. As the Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is a multidimensional
concept [ 47], various categories of stakeholders from supply and demand sides must be involved.
Public authorities and Ô¨Ånancial institutions must o er sustainable alternatives to consumers, and citizens
must make e orts to increase the degree of Ô¨Ånancial education by participating in programs conducted
in this regard by various entities [ 45,54‚Äì58]. Given the multiple crises and scandals that have particularly
aected the banking market, Ô¨Ånancial institutions need to substantially improve their behaviour so as to
inspire consumer conÔ¨Ådence. Therefore, consumers are also required to use the proper Ô¨Ånancial services
according to their ability to understand Ô¨Ånancial phenomena or income level [ 59,60]. In addition,
in certain particular situations, such as immigrants, Ô¨Ånancial consumers have to overcome certain
language, cultural, and religious barriers [ 45,48,61]. Consumers must not only show responsibility
when making Ô¨Ånancial decisions but must also have the ability to learn and adapt to the new conditions
of the Ô¨Ånancial market generated by the digitization of operations. Achieving the objectives set at
national level, usually by launching Ô¨Ånancial inclusion strategies, therefore requires sustained e orts
both by the population and by the Ô¨Ånancial authorities and institutions.
Given the large number of deÔ¨Ånitions [ 47], three dimensions of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion have been
established, namely access (refers to physical proximity and a ordability), usage (refers to regularity,
frequency, duration of time used) and quality (refers to products well-tailored to clients‚Äô needs and
to appropriate segmentation to develop products for all income levels). To the three dimensions,
other specialists [44,62] added an additional dimension‚Äîchoice (Figure 1).

institutional, technical, legislative , or social point of view. Given the manifestation of the 
phenomenon of financial exclusion predominant ly in developing countries, more and more 
definitions and approaches  [51,52 ] focus on: (i) citizens‚Äô access to the formal or semi -formal financial 
sector composed of commercial banks, development finance institutions, post offices, microfinance 
banks, cred it unions and cooperatives, (ii) improving the process of saving but also accessing loans, 
(iii) enhancing risk management, (iv) developing innovative financial solutions, (v) protection of 
consumer rights.  
The concerns of international financial instituti ons such as the World Bank, development 
agencies, national market supervisors  and regulators have intensified [53] in order to attract an 
increasing number of citizens to gain access to products and services. As the financial inclusion is a 
multidimensiona l concept [47], various categories of stakeholders from supply and demand sides 
must be involved. Public authorities and financial institutions must offer sustainable alternatives to 
consumers, and citizens must make efforts to increase the degree of finan cial education by 
participating in programs conducted in this regard by various entities  [45,54‚Äì58]. Given the multiple 
crises and scandals that have particularly affected the banking market, financial institutions need to 
substantially improve their behav iour so as to inspire consumer confidence. Therefore, consumers 
are also required to use the proper financial services according to their ability to understand 
financial phenomena or income level [59,60 ]. In addition, in certain particular situations, such  as 
immigrants, financial consumers have to overcome certain language, cultural, and religious barriers 
[45,48,61 ]. Consumers must not only show responsibility when  making financial decisions but must 
also have the ability to learn and adapt to the new con ditions o f the financial market generated by

Mobile banking largely stimulates and promotes financial inclusion in developing economies, 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa [13], mobile penetration promotes financial inclusion, and 
significantly red uces the probability of a household becoming poor [63‚Äì69]. Having briefly 
synthesized this complex topic, th is paper will focus on the analysis of financial inclusion , taking

Nigeria is one of the leaders on the African continent along with Kenya in the process of increasing the
degree of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion through the use of mobile banking. In addition, the successful experiences
registered in these countries have been models for other countries in the areas of implementation and
development of mobile banking systems. Despite the similarities between the two countries in terms
of the level of development, the degree of Ô¨Ånancial exclusion penetration rates in mobile phone usage,
the structure of the banking system and the approach to the need to increase Ô¨Ånancial inclusion wereSustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 5 of 24
undertaken with di erent instruments. The reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria to use this model
based on a mobile phone company monopoly, the structure of the mobile phone market and the late
launch of initiative that coincided with the onset of the 2008 international Ô¨Ånancial crisis made the
results modest. Therefore, the model of ‚Äúbank-led‚Äù (or a non-MNO-led-mobile network operators-led)
ecosystem used in Nigeria generates di erent network externalities compared to mobile network
operator systems used in Kenya [70‚Äì73].
2.2. Barriers to Financial Inclusion
In developing countries, Ô¨Ånancial exclusion is fuelled by the country‚Äôs economic structure
(mainly agriculture), the location of the majority of the population is in the rural areas with poor
banking intermediation and low spread of money deposit bank branches across di erent parts of
the country due to the policy of commercial Ô¨Ånancial institutions [ 27]. Other factors that limit the
Ô¨Ånancial inclusion of the population are bureaucracy, high costs of banking products and services and
distance [52,74,75].
Leveraging on past studies developed in Nigeria, Table 1 below clearly shows the degree of
Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in the country measured in terms of Ô¨Åve metrics, namely (a) % of adult using
formal payment systems, (b) % of adult with savings accounts, (c) % of adult with credit from the
bank, (d) % of adult with insurance policies, (e) % of adult with pension schemes and (f) % of adult
Ô¨Ånancial exclusion.

The barrier of distance mentioned above is generated both by the weak representation in the
territory of commercial banks, but also by the state of infrastructure that exacerbates the problem of
moving citizens from rural areas to cities to make various Ô¨Ånancial operations [ 77]. Moreover, Table 2
below shows that weak representation of deposit money bank branches engenders the problem of
Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in Nigeria. In fact, states in Northern Nigeria such as Adamawa, Jigawa, Bornu,
Bauchi, and Kwara with a large population have very few bank branches, whereas smaller cosmopolitan
states with a relatively low population have large bank branches.

In addition, the rapid growth of the population in developing countries contributes to the
deepening of the phenomenon of population impoverishment, and implicitly of social exclusion.
Despite the e orts made by the public authorities in the banking sector and by the credit institutions,
the population growth precedes the growth of the banked population, there are also multiple regional
dierences [45].
The ways of manifesting the phenomenon of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and Ô¨Ånancial literacy di er
depending on consumers‚Äô level of income and the development level of the countries [ 44,77,79].
In high-income countries, Ô¨Ånancial exclusion a ects a small part of the population, and citizens have
concerns about making sophisticated investments in the Ô¨Ånancial market and an investment plan
for retirement [ 80]. In low-income countries, the concerns of Ô¨Ånancial authorities and institutions
regarding Ô¨Ånancial inclusion are much more complex and lasting because they concern a considerable
proportion of the population being attracted from the non-formal to the formal sector, and the causes of
Ô¨Ånancial exclusion are generated by the economic situation, and not only the poor Ô¨Ånancial education
of the population [ 80]. In these countries, citizens have problems when simply trying to open a bank
account or purchase insurance.
In developing countries, the main cause of low Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is extreme poverty that a ects a
large part of the population. Citizens of these countries do not have bank accounts because they do not
have enough money to save [ 47,52]. Studies conducted for African countries have revealed a positive
link between per capita income and Ô¨Ånancial inclusion. Thus, the study conducted by Alenoghenain
(2017) for 15 African countries for the period 2005‚Äì2014 showed that a high income per capita generates
a higher Ô¨Ånancial inclusion [81].Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 7 of 24
Therefore, a phenomenon with multiple economic and social implications such as Ô¨Ånancial
exclusion /inclusion has a complex of determining factors, and solving the problem requires a systemic
approach and the involvement of several categories of stakeholders.
In addition, Ô¨Ånancial exclusion a ects not only poor people and women but also
migrants [44,82‚Äì84] . The trend of international migration has also generated Ô¨Ånancial problems,
as migrants have to overcome certain psychological barriers generated by distrust in complex banking
systems (compared to those in the country of origin), lack of Ô¨Ånancial education speciÔ¨Åc to developing
countries or the time horizon (if the stay is prolonged, there is a change in attitude towards the banking
system). The phenomenon of saving speciÔ¨Åc to migrants is followed by the periodic sending of large
sums of money to the family in the country of origin, which is why having a bank account to make
bank transfers is essential [ 85,86]. The frequency of remittances is di erent, being inÔ¨Çuenced by the
needs of the family, the sex of the migrant, the prospects of opening a business in the country of origin
or buying a home and by the intention to reunite the family in the destination country [61,87].
2.3. Drivers of Mobile Banking
The adoption of mobile banking has improved all aspects of Ô¨Ånancial transactions for both
corporate and non-corporate customers of banks in Nigeria [ 21,88,89]. Conceptually, the term mobile
banking is understood as the use of mobile devices for undertaking virtual Ô¨Ånancial transactions
(especially savings, funds‚Äô transfer, and stock market transactions) with banks by customers at any
convenient time and place [ 16]. Financial consumers are increasingly interested in achieving easy
access to banking services and products, either to save money or to pay for goods or to send money
to relatives or friends. In this sense, the statistical data provided by Global Findex [ 90] show the
increase in the percentage of the population that makes domestic remittances. The intensiÔ¨Åcation
of the international migration process has also led to an increase in the frequency and value of the
remittances sent by migrants to origin countries, mobile banking being a feasible solution that allows
Ô¨Ånancial transfers but it also contributes to increasing the degree of Ô¨Ånancial education and Ô¨Ånancial
inclusion in these countries. The feasibility of this method is also supported by the low costs generated
by the intensiÔ¨Åcation of competition between banks. From the consumers‚Äô perspective, the future of
mobile banking depends on essentials such as ubiquity, instant connectivity, pro-active functionality,
convenience, access to the service regardless of time and place, privacy, and savings in time and
eort [91‚Äì93] (Singh 2012, Tiwari et al., 2016, Akturan and Tezcan, 2012). In addition, ‚ÄúThe younger
generations of the society seem to be fascinated by modern data and telecommunication services ‚Äù[92].
The analysis of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion vis- √†-vis mobile banking and information technology (IT) has to
be embedded in IT adoption theories /perspectives. According to Bankole et al. (2011), the widely
used theories in mobile banking [ 16] include the technology acceptance model (TAM), the extended
technology acceptance model (TAM2), the theory of reasoned action (TRA), the theory of planned
behavior (TPB) and the uniÔ¨Åed theory of use and acceptance of technology (UTAUT). Other specialists
have focused on the task‚Äìtechnology Ô¨Åt (TTF) theory and the di usion of innovation (DOI) in order
to explain the determinants of the acceptance of mobile banking [ 94,95] (Munoz-Leiva et al. 2017,
Sharma 2019). The technology acceptance model (TAM), the main inÔ¨Çuential model, focuses on
two main issues‚Äîperceived usefulness and perceived ease of use‚Äîto explain the variance in users‚Äô
intentions [ 96] (Luarn and Pin, 2005). According to Nasri and Charfeddine 2012, the ‚ÄúTPB suggests that
in addition to attitudinal and normative inÔ¨Çuence, a third antecedent to the theory called perceived
behavioral control, perceived behavioral (PBC), also inÔ¨Çuences behavioral intentions and actual
behavior‚Äù [ 97]. Particularly, TAM and TPB were used by several researchers to investigate the factors
inÔ¨Çuencing users‚Äô behavioural intentions towards mobile banking [ 16,98]. Summing up the insights
from all the IT adoption theories, proponents argued that mobile banking is an o -shoot of IT that is
adopted by users for Ô¨Ånancial transactions because of key factors, namely performance expectancy
(perceived usefulness), e ort expectancy (perceived ease of use), social inÔ¨Çuence (opinions of friends,Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 8 of 24
relatives), facilitating conditions, trust and privacy, convenience and cost, user satisfaction and national
culture [98‚Äì100].
Starting from these premises, the receptiveness of Nigerian customers towards mobile banking
is impressive, as all banks have adopted and introduced mobile banking applications (the popular
mobile banking apps in Nigeria include Diamond Mobile Banking, Stanbic IBTC Mobile Banking,
First Bank Mobile Banking, Eco Bank Mobile Banking, Access Bank Mobile Banking, Fidelity Bank
Mobile Banking and Sterling Bank Mobile Banking). Several factors have been identiÔ¨Åed by scholars
as the determinants inÔ¨Çuencing mobile banking in the country. In a sequential order, the following are
insights on factors inÔ¨Çuencing the adoption of mobile banking.
Anyasi and Otubu (2009) noted that mobile banking was adopted in Nigeria as a preferred means
of accessing Ô¨Ånancial services with or without access to traditional banks, it also o ers a way to lower
the costs of transferring funds from place to place, while at the same time improving Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
by bringing unbanked people into contact with the formal Ô¨Ånancial systems [ 101]. A decade ago,
a result of the research of Oni et al. (2010) indicated that the e-banking system in Nigeria is widely
adopted and preferred by customers because it is convenient, easy to use, time e cient, and appropriate
for Ô¨Ånancial transactions. However, the users have concerns for the network security especially the
privacy of transactions [102].
Moreover, Bankole et al. (2011) explained that utility expectancy and e ort expectancy are major
factors inÔ¨Çuencing behavioural intention to adopt mobile banking in Nigeria. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the ease of
using a mobile device for personal banking transactions (easy management of accounts); the security
and safety concerns of moving cash around regarding cyber fraud; and prompt information about
users‚Äô Ô¨Ånancial transactions (savings and withdrawals) immediately through the SMS alert. However,
the social inÔ¨Çuence of friends, relatives, colleagues at work and the service providers (banks) is not a
major inÔ¨Çuence on mobile banking users in Nigeria [16].
Nevertheless, Aliyu et al. (2012) contended that the six critical success factors that inÔ¨Çuence the
adoption of mobile banking in Nigeria include awareness, ease of use, security, cost, reduced reluctance
to change and accessibility of mobile devices for undertaking Ô¨Ånancial transactions [103].
Furthermore, Balogun et al. (2013) a rmed that three factors largely inÔ¨Çuenced customers‚Äô
satisfaction with di erent aspects of e-banking in Nigeria, such as telephone banking, mobile banking,
point of sale terminals, smart cards, and television banking. These factors are the quality services
provided by banks through SMS alerts and e-mail alerts; the second factor is access to the option of
electronically opening a bank account, and the third factor is availability of automated teller machines
in strategic locations for making withdrawals when needed without going into the banks [104].
However, Adewoyein (2013) reported that the adoption of mobile banking by customers is premised
on a number of factors such as transactional convenience, better turn-around time (saving time),
quick transaction alert, reduction in service cost and overall customer satisfaction [ 105]. Similarly,
Njoku and Odumeru (2013) opined that seven factors positively inÔ¨Çuence the adoption of mobile
banking in Nigeria, these include relative advantage that mobile banking gives to bank customers;
less complexity of mobile technology; compatibility of mobile banking with customers‚Äô norms, belief,
existing values, and past experience; perceived trialability /ease of mobile banking when experimented
with by the customers; perceived observability /visibility of the outcomes of mobile banking to
customers; age of customers using mobile banking; and educational qualiÔ¨Åcation of customers using
mobile banking [7].
Moreover, Agwu and Carter (2014) noted that the use of mobile phones for mobile banking
has fundamentally changed the way Nigerians (as individuals and businesses) conduct Ô¨Ånancial
transactions [ 106]. Particularly, mobile banking is more established than internet banking and ATM
(automated teller machine) services because it has wider reach than both internet banking and mobile
banking (e ort expectancy).
Three factors identiÔ¨Åed by Tarhini et al. (2015) as key drivers of mobile banking adoption [ 107] in
Nigeria include: (a) functionality factor that consists of awareness, ease of use and accessibility; (b) risksSustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 9 of 24
factors that comprise trust, security and privacy; and (c) context factor that includes convenience.
From the viewpoints of Agu et al. (2016), mobile banking became a prominent feature in banking
operations in the country because it is an e ective technology for providing the growing population
of customers with fast, accessible, reliable and quality services. Secondly, as an innovative option,
mobile banking enables users carry out banking transactions anywhere and anytime and it provides
an easy platform for paying for goods or services [108].
In the view of Khan and Ejike (2017), widespread adoption of mobile banking is inÔ¨Çuenced by
access to technological domains, which enhance good knowledge regarding mobile devices, but the
degree of convenience and satisfaction of usage are very low [ 109]. Additionally, Bagudu et al. (2017)
explained that the singular and most important success factor for the widespread adoption of mobile
banking in the country is access to functional mobile technology, which makes it easy for customers to
carry out Ô¨Ånancial transactions on their mobile handsets with ease [110].
In SSA, there has been an increase in both registration and usage of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion tools such
as mobile banking and related systems. This fact is corroborated by Bille et al., (2018) who reported that
as of 2018 there has been an encouraging improvement in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion because unbanked people
and the small and medium-sized enterprises (have been well integrated into the Ô¨Ånancial landscape
in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of improved access to Ô¨Ånancial inclusion tools, which have been
made accessible by the Ô¨Ånancial service providers, especially banks, microÔ¨Ånance institutions, di erent
mobile network operators and licensed payment service providers [ 111]. Particularly, the World Bank
report indicated that Ô¨Ånancial inclusion has reached over seven million new Ô¨Ånancial services users
across SSA, from Senegal to Tanzania, from Nigeria to Zambia [111] (Bille et al., 2018).
3. Methodology
In view of the exploratory nature of this research, a qualitative meta-synthesis (QMS),
an interpretivist research paradigm, provides a rich analytical tool for this study.
The qualitative meta-synthesis was applied as a suitable approach and essential stage towards
enlarging the research and setting the basis for analysing the contributions of this paper [ 112]. This step
makes it easy to identify boundaries of the conceptual content of the Ô¨Åeld and contribute to theory
advances [ 113]. In line with the qualitative research tradition, a qualitative meta-synthesis is an
analytical approach that is widely used in meta study to integrate di erent Ô¨Åndings from diverse
studies on the same subject of inquiry from di erent contexts [8,114].
The purpose of integrating Ô¨Åndings and insights from groups of studies in a qualitative
meta-synthesis is to develop an explanatory theory or model that explains the phenomenon being
investigated better and richer [ 115]. With regard to steps involved in carrying out a sound QMS,
Walsh and Downe (2005) proposed seven steps for using qualitative meta-synthesis in research [116].
(1) Framing a meta-synthesis exercise: our topic from the outset is framed for a qualitative
meta-synthesis exercise.
(2) Locating relevant papers: we searched and located several papers on mobile banking within and
outside SSA to gain richer insights on the subject of inquiry.
(3) Deciding what to include: after a literature audit of searched and located papers on mobile
banking, we selected those related to mobile banking issues and Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in SSA in line
with the qualitative meta-synthesis tradition.
(4) Appraising studies: the selected papers from SSA were then appraised to draw rich and
meaningful information for making informed and evidence-based Ô¨Åndings in line with the
qualitative meta-synthesis tradition.
(5) Comparing and contrasting exercise: the Ô¨Åndings in the selected papers from SSA were compared
and contrasted.
(6) Reciprocating translation: we o ered an explanation for the similar and opposing Ô¨Åndings.Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 10 of 24
(7) Synthesizing translation: the mixed Ô¨Åndings extracted from di erent papers selected were then
fused and synthesised to give a unique explanation for the trends and direction of mobile banking
in relation to Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in SSA.
These steps were followed in the above study.
First of all, in order to manage the groundwork for the following QMS, and to identify emerging
trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, the key items were deÔ¨Åned. In line with the mentioned deÔ¨Ånitions
and features, but extending to related terms, ‚ÄúÔ¨Ånancial inclusion‚Äù, ‚Äúin-debtedness‚Äù, ‚ÄúmicroÔ¨Ånance‚Äù,
‚Äúdigital Ô¨Ånancial services‚Äù, ‚Äúmobile banking‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNigerian banks‚Äù were used for identifying related
peer reviewed journal articles. The main reason for searching with these alternative items /terms was to
ensure the comprehensive nature and content validity of our key terms.
The exploration for meaningful publications was conducted through databases such as Wiley,
Elsevier, Scopus, Emerald, and Springer. The selection of these databases was based upon their use by
academics in past systematic QMS in the Ô¨Åelds of business, management, marketing, communication,
and social sciences, along with the openness of the data for the analysis. In addition, the analysis
was conducted by selecting only papers with a managerial /marketing perspective in peer-reviewed
scientiÔ¨Åc journals published in the English language. Several papers in di erent languages or with a
dissimilar focus were excluded. The list with articles used for this analysis is presented in Appendix A.
The list of relevant papers was attained after removing duplicated articles and then exploring the
Ô¨Åltered articles. Appendix A also refers to some relevant topics that are analysed in each paper, such as
number of factors a ecting mobile banking and type of speciÔ¨Åc factors a ecting mobile banking.
Additionally, Appendices B and C show selected articles classiÔ¨Åed under several categories:
number of research publications per year and classiÔ¨Åcation based on number of determinants /factors
able to inÔ¨Çuence mobile banking development. Moreover, for a meaningful selection of scholarly
papers, a search for relevant articles on Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and mobile banking was carried out using
a purposive sampling technique. Furthermore, 58 sampled articles that focused on Nigeria were
systematically reviewed and synthesized with insights from the reports of the Central Bank of Nigeria
to form integrated Ô¨Åndings that explain the emerging trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion [ 117] and the barriers
and factors inÔ¨Çuencing mobile banking in Nigeria.
The analysis and synthesis of papers aimed to reach two main objectives, Ô¨Årst of all,
brieÔ¨Çy summarise existing research by identifying hot themes /matters; afterwards, contribute to
shape the conceptual Ô¨Åeld of study. Obviously, the authors found it challenging to read everything
about Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and mobile banking, especially if it is considered that the topic is not always
called this label or the research is not always related to the selected country: Nigeria.
4. Findings and Discussions
Leveraging on the qualitative meta-synthesis, the Ô¨Åndings that emerged could be classiÔ¨Åed into
emerging trends on Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and the barriers and factors that inÔ¨Çuenced the adoption of
mobile banking in Nigeria.
On the emerging trends of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in connection with mobile banking, the research
found that several attempts have been made by the government to improve Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in the
country through a number of public-sector led credit schemes such National Economy Reconstruction
Fund (NERFUND); the People‚Äôs Bank, Community Banking Models, the MicroÔ¨Ånance Institutions
(MFIs), the Bank of Industry (BOI), the Small and Medium Enterprises Equity Investment Scheme
(SMEEIS), National Poverty Eradication Programme, Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria
(You Win) Programme, Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme or SURE-P , National
Enterprise Development Programme or NEDEP and several others (Table 3).Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 11 of 24

At the global level, Ô¨Ånancial inclusion has also occupied the attention of international organisations
especially the agendas of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development
goals (SDGs). Some of the targets of the expired MDGs and SDGs alert the United Nations member
countries to the pressing issue of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and its complexity. Providing an enabling
environment for better and improved Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in Nigeria justiÔ¨Åes the introduction of
mobile banking.
Considering the barriers to Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, this research identiÔ¨Åed a number of institutional
and environmental barriers (Table 4). These barriers provided enabling grounds and springboards for
the introduction of mobile banking in Nigeria. Financial inclusion intervention schemes failed because
of the government‚Äôs inability to properly nurture its development programmes, weak reward system,
dysfunctional structures, and endemic poor programme implementation. Related to the barriers above
are issues of bureaucracy of Ô¨Ånancial operations, high costs of banking products and services and
distance of banks to the population.
With regard to drivers of mobile banking, this research identiÔ¨Åed three major factors as
inÔ¨Çuencers of mobile banking in Nigeria; the ease of using a mobile device for personal banking
transactions including prompt information about users‚Äô Ô¨Ånancial transactions (savings and withdrawals)
immediately through the SMS alert (easy management of account); the security and safety concerns of
moving cash around regarding cyber fraud; social inÔ¨Çuence of friends, relatives, policy makers and
social trends. With regard to the contextualization of the Ô¨Åndings, the three factors that emerged could
be categorized as (a) utility expectancy (perceived usefulness), (b) e ort expectancy (perceived ease of
use), and (c) social inÔ¨Çuence expectancy (opinions of friends, relatives). Each of the three factors has
speciÔ¨Åc elements assigned to them as shown in Table 5.Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 12 of 24

These three key factors seem to be in line with the complex perspective of the ‚Äúvalue co-created in
use‚Äù, a very well-known facet of the service dominant logic (SDL) [ 118]. This approach considers value
as co-created in use (VIU) because consumers assess and decide the value of a proposition based on
their usage [ 119]. The VIU involves three sub-constructs: experience, personalization, and relationship.
Taking into consideration the Ô¨Årst item, experience indicates an impressive, cognitive and /or
emotional interface that creates essential value [ 118]. In our case, utility expectancy (perceived
usefulness) can be perceived as a factor that is able to generate value for customers pushing them to
use the banking sector‚Äôs services as they are strongly based on setting a positive experience for these
kind of potential clients through mobile banking.
On the other hand, personalization highlights the distinctiveness of the usage process, the value
developed by individual needs [ 118]. In the current analysis, this is expressed by the e ort expectancy
(perceived ease of use). In fact, due to the fact that mobile banking is seen by customers as feasible
and not too complicated, this also a ects the perception that consumers have of banking services in
general, before they were considered as misleading and problematic; nowadays, this trend is changing,
setting the place for a new horizon in the sector.
Finally, relationship considers a mutual, continuing exchange and alliance not only among
consumers, but also between the company and its clients, following an active communication
setting [ 118]. The sub-construct of relationship, expressed in our study by the factor of social inÔ¨Çuence
expectancy (opinions of friends, relatives), is able to empower current and potential consumers to
resolve daily problems; thus, engendering mobile banking with a value that was not taken into account
by people that until now decided to not use any kind of Ô¨Ånancial product [120].Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 13 of 24
5. Implications, Limitations and Future Research
This paper has the merit to deepen the understanding of current trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion.
This topic can be considered nowadays as a catchphrase for banking specialists, researchers and
other categories of stakeholders considering its implications on economic growth and achieving the
SDGs [ 51,88,121]. Financial inclusion can be considered as an international challenge [ 122] but on
the African continent, this issue is more stringent as there are high rates of Ô¨Ånancial exclusion and
in addition, the heterogeneity generated by the speciÔ¨Åc economic situation, ethnic warfare, religious
considerations and cultural perceptions is very high [ 123]. Little is known about emerging trends in
Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and mobile banking, barriers to Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and factors inÔ¨Çuencing mobile
banking especially in SSA and particularly in Nigeria. Exploring the trends, factors, barriers, and main
items that impact on Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is essential, particularly in the African context where the level
of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is extremely low. Thus, this paper has contributed to the existing literature
as it focuses on the importance of mobile banking as an innovative solution for increasing Ô¨Ånancial
inclusion in a speciÔ¨Åc sub-Saharan African country: Nigeria.
Connecting back to previous conceptual research on VIU and SDL, a key theoretical contribution
of this study lies in its extension of the boundary of this approach. Our study empirically illustrates
the eects of VIU and of its variables in the Ô¨Åeld of mobile banking. In line with Ranjan and Read
(2016) [ 118], our results empirically validate that consumers‚Äô VIU is due to personalized, memorable
experiences and positive relationships with mobile banking features and applications. The three factors
presented, in fact, not only increase consumers‚Äô propensity to continue to use mobile banking for the
valuable services it provides to them but also nurtures a solid loyalty towards the banking sector that
was never so developed before in the selected area.
From a managerial point of view, our Ô¨Åndings regarding the applicability of SDL and the
importance of VIU in mobile banking can be of special interest to managers and mobile app designers.
Our results highlight that VIU is essential to boost Ô¨Ånancial inclusion towards banking services and
Ô¨Ånancial products. From the VIU perspective, in fact, consumers are dynamically engaged in the value
co-creation process, which relies on experience, personalization and relationship. This statement sets a
challenge for managers and mobile app designers because for a client to play a role in the co-creation
process, she /he have not only to download and utilize the app but log into the app for practitioners to
attain her /his suggestions /comments /opinions. For instance, managers have to create more chances
to co-create VIU with the client because the bank /Ô¨Ånancial institution needs to propose appropriate
customized services and customer care that produce better experiences and set the basis for long term
relationships with the customers. Additionally, leveraging on personalization is another key asset for
managers, banks have to ‚Äúpush‚Äù clients to try new personalised Ô¨Ånancial services through mobile
banking apps, o ering to pioneer several incentives in order to reward their positive attitude towards
the organisation and its services.
Moreover, this paper states that Ô¨Ånancial inclusion is a complex phenomenon and the solutions to
reduce Ô¨Ånancial exclusion are economic, technical and social and have to be used in a mixed set up by
public authorities and Ô¨Ånancial institutions.
For this reason, our work shows policy makers that the strategy of increasing Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
must be based on the collaboration between di erent categories of stakeholders such as Ô¨Ånancial
consumers, credit institutions, public authorities with supervisory and control attributions in Ô¨Ånancial
markets, schools and universities.
From this perspective, this paper suggests that policy makers play an important role in creating
online communities for consumers that use mobile banking. They could foster Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
practices in virtual places, guiding users and acting as a reference point, or simply answer questions
and solve doubts that consumers may have regarding using the Ô¨Ånancial products. In fact, policy
makers should act as a ‚ÄúÔ¨Ålter‚Äù between banks and users. This involves them being the Ô¨Årst to catch
customers‚Äô speciÔ¨Åc requests and needs and presenting them to banking managers.Sustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 14 of 24
Additionally, they can be useful in explaining how to use more complex software to banking
clients who are now choosing to employ only services with a low level of complexity; in this case,
policy makers can show to users that a major degree of personalization in services is not going to harm
them, instead it should be preferred as it can give them more beneÔ¨Åts. Actually, if they are involved in
presenting these new personalised services, users could be more interested in approaching them as
they trust these kind of players more than employees or spokespersons who are directly paid by banks
and other Ô¨Ånancial institutions.
Having said that, these individuals should be rewarded for their important contribution inside
the community with tax incentives, Ô¨Ånancial beneÔ¨Åts, easy-terms loan, soft Ô¨Ånancing, etc. Actually,
feedback posted in online communities can be also appreciated by managers, who can follow the users‚Äô
point of view to Ô¨Ånd new ways to increase the level of personalization of services o ered through
mobile banking.
In addition, public service announcements and other kinds of social advertising should be created
by policy makers to communicate to the public that Ô¨Ånancial inclusion (spread thanks to mobile
banking) can highly beneÔ¨Åt not only the economy of a country but also the whole society‚Äôs lifestyle
and level of education.
On the other hand, it must be highlighted that our analysis shows several limitations that provide
some precious opportunities to future researchers in this underestimated area of research.
We acknowledge that the highlighted features of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion, explored in this paper, do not
represent a comprehensive list of factors expressing all the potentialities hidden inside this concept as
we took into consideration a speciÔ¨Åc country and its peculiarities. This proposes opportunities for
further analyses in this vast area employing other speciÔ¨Åc methodologies and context-related factors.
Each of the labels chosen to conduct the qualitative meta-synthesis are strictly linked with the
concept of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion but, of course, they are not part of an exhaustive list. Therefore, an increase
in the labels used may help in the future to better understand how the concept has evolved through the
years. Given the di erent approaches of central banks in Nigeria and Kenya to mobile money services,
one of the areas that future studies should investigate is the adequacy of existing Ô¨Ånancial regulations
and policies in SSA regarding mobile banking, particularly because mobile banking is an interface
between Ô¨Ånancial services and telecoms. Another important raging issue that should be explored in
the future is the moderating e ect of culture on the relationship between mobile banking and Ô¨Ånancial
inclusion in developing countries. Finally, as the Ô¨Ånancial inclusion represents a challenging area
of research that is continuously evolving, we were unable to include all features of this topic in our
analysis. In fact, what is clear now is that the main characteristics of Ô¨Ånancial inclusion may vary
over time as they are highly a ected by other factors and by technological developments. Therefore,
we encourage future researchers to conduct a longitudinal analysis by including a wider range of
factors, especially those related to the online world. Considering the intensiÔ¨Åcation of the Ô¨Ånancial
innovation process and the increase in the standard of living, consumers are oriented towards more
and more complex products and services. For this reason, a future direction of research may be towards
mobile Ô¨Ånancial services as a tool for Ô¨Ånancial inclusion. Such e orts will surely further contribute to
the theoretical development of this research area.
6. Towards Conclusions
This study discusses the emerging trends in Ô¨Ånancial inclusion and the barriers and factors
inÔ¨Çuencing mobile banking as an innovative solution for increasing Ô¨Ånancial inclusion in SSA with
a speciÔ¨Åc focus on Nigeria. After a qualitative meta-synthesis of the literature and other secondary
materials, it was found that mobile banking was introduced by the government and adopted by
major banks in the country to strengthen national and international e orts towards Ô¨Ånancial inclusion
in spite of institutional and environmental barriers engendering Ô¨Ånancial inclusion. Three major
factors emerged from the qualitative meta-synthesis as drivers of mobile banking in Nigeria. Firstly,
the ease of using a mobile device for personal banking transactions including prompt informationSustainability 2020 ,12, 10130 15 of 24
about users‚Äô Ô¨Ånancial transactions (savings and withdrawals) immediately through the SMS alert
(easy management of account). Secondly, the security and safety concerns of theft and of cyber fraud.
Thirdly, social inÔ¨Çuence of friends, relatives, policy makers and social trends.
In contextualizing mobile banking in sub-Saharan Africa in general and Nigeria in particular,
it could be stated that the growth of the use of mobile banking is largely supported by the IT adoption
theories /perspectives, such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the extended technology
acceptance model (TAM2), which all validate and support the assertion that technology is adopted by
users because of (a) utility expectancy (perceived usefulness), (b) e ort expectancy (perceived ease of
use), and (c) social inÔ¨Çuence expectancy (opinions of friends, relatives).
