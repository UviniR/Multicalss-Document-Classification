About 
DE4A
Rapid digital transformation is reshaping our global economy, 
permeating virtually every sector and aspect of daily life, 
changing the way we learn, work, trade, socialize, and access 
public and private services and information. In 2016, the global 
digital economy was worth some $11.5 trillion, equivalent to 15.5 
percent of the world’s overall GDP. It is expected to reach 25 percent 
in less than a decade, quickly outpacing the growth of the overall 
economy (Huawei and Oxford Economics, 2016). However, countries 
like Ghana are currently capturing only a fraction of this growth and 
need to strategically invest in the foundational elements of their 
digital economy to keep pace. 
9The Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative forms part of the World Bank Group’s support for the African Union’s Digital 
transformation for Africa, which aims for every African individual, business and government to be digitally enabled by 2030. The 
Digital Economy for Africa initiative is underpinned by five principles: 
For a successful and inclusive digital economy, African countries need to build key foundational elements of a digital economy (see 
figure A). These foundations, or pillars, which are synergistic and require the use of public and private sector solutions, are the following:Taking an ecosystem 
approach that looks at 
supply and demand 
and defies a narrow 
silo approach in 
defining the digital 
economy elements

Summary
Universal adoption and effective application of digital 
technologies are expected to characterize economies of the 
future, shaping their ability to succeed in the global marketplace 
and offer a better quality of life for their citizens. Disruptive 
technologies are already altering traditional business models and 
pathways to development, yielding significant gains, increased 
convenience, as well as supporting better access to services for 
consumers. In 2016, the digital economy was worth an estimated 
$11.5 trillion worldwide, equivalent to 15.5 percent of global GDP. It is 
forecast to reach 25 percent in less than a decade, far outpacing the 
growth of the “traditional” economy (Huawei and Oxford Economics 
2016). Mobile money is driving financial inclusion, particularly in Sub-
Saharan Africa, with the number of accounts doubling to 21 percent 
between 2014-17. African e-commerce is also rapidly growing, at an 
estimated annual rate of 40 percent. Over the past five years, there 
has been a tenfold increase across the region in the supply of new 
intermediaries such as incubators, accelerators, and technology 
hubs, amongst others, numbering more than 400 across Africa 
today. The digital economy in Africa is expected to grow to over 
$300 billion by 2025 (McKinsey 2013).
17Amid this promise, the digital economy also introduces new 
challenges and risks including a growing digital divide, risk 
of cyber-attacks and fraud, threats to privacy, and disruption 
to markets. Access to the Internet remains out of reach for most 
people, too few citizens have digital IDs or transaction accounts 
– locking them out of access to critical public services, financial 
inclusion, and markets. Digital startups struggle to attract funding 
and traditional businesses are only slowly adopting digital 
technologies and platforms to boost productivity and sales. Few 
interventions are investing strategically and systematically in 
developing digital infrastructure, data frameworks, platforms, skills, 
and entrepreneurship. 
Ghana’s economy is led by the services sector, with information 
and communications technology (ICT) contributing about 3.6 
percent of the country’s GDP, telecommunication services being 
the main one. The contribution of Ghana’s ICT sector to the overall 
GDP of the country has grown steadily over the years, becoming one 
of the best performing sectors in the country’s economy. In 2017, 
the contribution of ICT services was $1.7 billion, or 3.6 percent of 
the overall GDP of Ghana. The combination of a competitive market 
structure, an improved international connectivity, an increase in 
private sector investment, and a reduction in telecommunications 
prices, in particular at the wholesale level, has been instrumental 
in fueling innovation and investments in the broader ICT sector, 
including in IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS). A vibrant IT sector is 
emerging with companies such as mPedigree, Rancard, Softtribe, 
Hubtel, mPharma, Logiciel, Nosmay competing globally in software 
and applications platforms for everything from finance and payments 
to agriculture and medical services.
The Government of Ghana (GoG) is making significant efforts and 
investments that are expected to position the country as a regional 
hub for digital services. The current government recognizes 
the opportunity that digital development has for stimulating jobs, 
improving productivity, and accelerating inclusive growth, and 
has pledged to put digital economic transformation at the center 
of the country’s Ghana Beyond Aid agenda. The government 
is also undertaking a number of keystone projects including a 
comprehensive digital address system, which is essential for digital 
commerce, and more aggressive automation of government 
business processes. These efforts are being complemented by a 
more proactive signaling to the international tech community that 
the country is open for business, including, for instance, the visit of 
a group of Ghanaian technology companies in April 2018 to engage 
counterparts in Silicon Valley led by the Vice President. 
As part of Ghana Beyond Aid, the government aims now to develop 
a digital strategy and an implementation plan to establish Ghana as 
the leader in ICT innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2023. It aims to 
(i) foster the growth of the local IT industry beyond the boundaries of Ghana, (ii) bridge the urban-rural divide by expanding digital services 
to rural and underserved communities, and (iii) leverage ICT to: (a) 
increase efficiency, improve citizen experience and engagement 
with government by reducing the mean time to deliver government 
services to citizens; (b) increase transparency in government functions; 
and (c) increase government revenue generation.
Ghana’s ability to position itself as a leading digital innovation 
hub will depend to a large extent on its ability to address risks 
and it needs to strategically invest in the foundational elements 
of its digital economy. A holistic approach to digital economy 
development is necessary to maximize Ghana’s chance for attaining 
its digital potential. Rather than implementing multiple, fragmented 
interventions, a coordinated and high-level crossboundary approach 
that maximizes complementarities is needed to build an inclusive 
digital economy – to ultimately spur the development of high-
impact applications for health, education, e-commerce, agriculture, 
and social service delivery, among others, while mitigating exclusion, 
fraud, and cyber risks.
Ghana’s telecommunication sector has experienced impressive 
growth, thanks to early liberalization and deregulation of the 
market since the late 1990s. Strong competition has resulted in 
near ubiquitous mobile coverage and a high mobile penetration 
rate of 131 SIM cards per 100 inhabitants, compared to an average of 
80 in the rest of Africa (GSMA 2018a). The country’s mobile Internet 
penetration of about 68 percent is notable, albeit only slightly above 
the Africa regional average (GSMA 2018a). 
More needs to be done to create a more comprehensive, robust, 
secure and redundant nationwide network and to make Ghana’s 
digital economy more competitive. Most of the infrastructure is 
concentrated in urban and commercial areas with large sections of 
the country’s rural areas without effective coverage. Internet cost 
remains high and access low, especially in rural areas. Providing 
reliable and fast broadband connectivity for ministries, departments, 
and agencies (MDAs), and metropolitan, municipal, and district 
assemblies (MMDAs) across the country is still a challenge. In the 
absence of a more robust and comprehensive nationwide fiber 
backbone, operators have been investing in parallel wireless 
solutions to extend 3G service to key parts of the country. Similarly, 
Ghana needs to unfold a cyber-conscious culture across the 
economy, particularly in financial institutions and SMEs, with a 
national program that raises awareness of cybersecurity risks and 
secure online behavior.
The growing desire to achieve greater efficiency, transparency 
and accountability has led to the government’s continued 
investment in public sector digital platforms. A number of digital 
platforms have been developed in an effort to improve governance 
and delivery of public services, including a digital address system, 
18e-procurement, e-immigration, e-parliament, and e-judiciary. The 
government has just begun the rollout of the much-anticipated 
digital identification program (the Ghana Card). If the roll-out is 
successful, and take-up is widespread, it could be a critical first step 
to citizens’ access to services including through online platforms. In 
this way, in the 2018 survey of the UN E-Government Index, Ghana 
is the only African country that transitioned from the middle to high 
E-Government Development Index (EGDI) level. 
Nevertheless, a number of challenges exist that affect the 
government’s ability to operate digitally. Trust in e-services offered 
by the government is generally low and the majority of Ghanaians 
are not even aware that e-government services exist. The National 
Information Technology Agency (NITA), as the key player in driving 
the digital transformation of the public sector in Ghana, does not 
have sufficient institutional capacity nor funding for implementation 
of the ambitious digital government platforms that the government 
envisions. As a result, MDAs suffer from a chronic lack of connectivity, 
and dysfunctional e-mail, websites, and other basic services. There 
is also a need to strengthen data protection expertise to protect 
personal data.
Ghana ranks third in Africa in private digital platforms, after Nigeria 
and South Africa (Insight2Impact 2019). Digital platforms in Ghana 
are transforming the provision of services, particularly in the retail, 
transportation, and accommodation sectors. Microwork platforms are 
becoming a source of jobs (1 percent of Internet users in the country 
are microwork users, reaching almost 80,000 in 2017 and mainly 
used by women and young people). Digital commerce is ramping up, 
positioning Ghana as the sixth country in Africa in B2C E-commerce 
in 2018, climbing six positions from its 2017 ranking. The government 
is providing training and support to increase online presence of 
Ghanaian products and services, including initiatives such as Ghana 
Online Mall, Digital Marketing, and Made in Ghana Mall. 
However, there are a number of challenges and risks for the 
expansion of the platform economy in Ghana. First, different 
ministries, departments, and agencies, lead initiatives often with 
parallel and overlapping activities, and therefore there is a need 
for coordination and streamlining of programs. Platform diffusion 
remains low, as only 28 percent of domestic firms have a website and 
only 7.8 percent of people perform online transactions. The delivery 
of high quality and standardized products and services to local and 
international markets is a challenge for most Ghanaian companies.
Recognizing the importance of catalyzing greater innovation in 
and adoption of digital financial services (DFS), the Government 
of Ghana has adopted a National Financial Inclusion and 
Development Strategy (NFIDS) 2017‐2023. The NFIDS commits 
the government to priorities that will serve as important steps 
towards achieving universal access to DFS and creating the Africa-wide payments infrastructure by 2030. Complementing the NFIDS, 
the Government of Ghana is working concurrently on a National 
Digital Financial Services Policy, which is currently being drafted by 
the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Ghana. The DFS policy is 
expected to outline the government’s vision for the country moving 
into the next decade, including that (i) a majority of Ghanaians will 
have secure access to a broad range of suitable and affordable 
digital financial services, and (ii) business and government will have 
achieved greater transparency and efficiency to contribute to the 
equitable economic growth of the nation.
Ghana has made substantial progress on financial inclusion, due 
in large part to growth in DFS. According to the World Bank’s Global 
Findex, the share of Ghanaian adults (over 15 years of age) with a 
formal financial account increased by 42 percent between 2014 and 
2015. As a result, nearly 6 in 10 adults had formal access in 2017. With 
mobile account ownership increasing by nearly 200 percent between 
2014 and 2017, mobile money has become the preferred payment 
alternative to cash when measured in terms of transaction volumes. 
In May 2018, the Bank of Ghana mandated that all mobile money 
providers connect to GHLink, with full interoperability between 
mobile money providers and banks introduced in December 2018.
Despite robust electronic payment infrastructure, Ghana remains 
a cash-based economy. 98.72 percent of payments by volume are 
still in cash and the main noncash instrument continues to be checks. 
The current extensive use of cash in Ghana among individuals can be 
explained by the high cost of digital payments that is often passed 
on to users, trust issues with using digital payments, low penetration 
of debit and credit cards, and low availability of POS devices at 
merchant points. Moreover, without business rules in place to govern 
pricing and other aspects of the scheme, many providers have 
effectively discouraged their customers from sending money off-net 
by increasing the fees for these transactions. As a result, interoperable 
transactions remain just a fraction of overall transactions. Additionally, 
financial technology firms (fintechs) are not yet connected to GHLink 
and there are no clear rules governing participation in the scheme.
Entrepreneurship support policies, programs, and actors in 
Ghana are growing at a rapid pace, but the country still lags many 
of its regional peers in terms of ecosystem maturity. Ghanaian 
entrepreneurs still face many challenges that threaten their ability 
to start and grow viable businesses. However, despite these 
challenges, Ghana has many of the core components and resources 
needed for a successful entrepreneurship ecosystem that can help 
achieve its long-term strategic vision of becoming a middle-income 
country and building an economy capable of providing good jobs 
that are suitable and sustainable for development. Political stability, 
an influential diaspora, and strong Internet connectivity are some 
of the factors that work in Ghana’s favor toward creating a ripe 
ecosystem for entrepreneurship.
19Like many Sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana has a young and 
increasingly urban population ready to tap into entrepreneurial 
opportunities. In 2017, nearly 60 percent of the population was under 
25 years old (Index Mundi 2019) and 55 percent lived in urban areas, 
with the urban population growing at a rate of 3.5 percent from 2013-
2017 (World Bank 2016a). The country is primarily English speaking, 
making it easier for Ghanaians to conduct business in international 
markets, while Ghana’s diaspora is large (nearly 250,000 people 
in 2006) and concentrated in the United States and the United 
Kingdom, providing connections to key international consumer 
and financial markets (OECD 2019). Ghana also boasts a strong ICT 
infrastructure, though access to fiber connections is expensive.
However, leveraging these advantages into new businesses, 
new wealth, and higher standards of living will require Ghana 
to develop and sustain a strong entrepreneurship ecosystem. 
Ghana’s ecosystem is growing rapidly. The 24 active entrepreneurship 
hubs (business incubators, accelerators, and similar spaces for 
entrepreneurs) now in Ghana represent an increase of 50 percent since 2016 (GSMA 2018b). Although startup activity and the number 
of formal SMEs are not yet tracked, $266 million of private capital 
was deployed in 15 venture capital deals in 2016-17 compared to 
$63 million in 16 deals in 2014-15, illustrating some growth in venture 
financing (World Bank 2018a). However, government support for 
entrepreneurship is uncoordinated, consisting of multiple agencies 
and programs that provide overlapping support without a clear 
overall vision. A poor business environment, lack of access to credit 
and finance, and mixed quality of entrepreneurial support are other 
key challenges that must be addressed within the ecosystem.
The government has created multiple agencies and programs that 
support SMEs, entrepreneurs, and enterprise development, many 
of which provide overlapping support without clear coordination 
(see figure 0.1). Without clear rationalization of mandates, the impact 
that these programs may have on SMEs and entrepreneurship will 
remain limited. The lack of consolidation and streamlined structure 
for existing government support programs reduces their likelihood 
for sustainability.

GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN GHANA 
Source: – Authors
20Ghana’s labor force demand for digital skills is expected to reach 
nearly nine million people by 2030. This figure, however, does not 
represent the entirety of the training demand. The current digital 
skills workforce of almost four million people likely will need more 
digital skills training every four to five years, resulting in more than 
nine million digital skills training experiences. More than five million 
new people will need training and another four million will require 
additional digital skills training experiences. The total digital skills 
training needs will climb to nearly 19 million through 2030 (IFC 2019b).
The government is playing a significant role in building a 
workforce with strong digital skills. The current National ICT 
in Education Policy for Ghana (2015) states as its mission: to 
articulate the relevance, responsibility and effectiveness of utilizing 
information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the education 
sector, with a view to addressing current sector challenges and 
equipping Ghanaian learners, students, teachers, and communities 
in meeting the national and global demands of the 21st century. 
Though clearly stated, the implementation continues to face many 
challenges, including the absence of computer labs in schools, few 
or no computers in schools, lack of ICT teachers and unstable or 
no power supply. In turn, in the Global Competitiveness Report 2017 
-2018, Ghana ranks 48th and 87th on quality of education and Internet 
access in schools, respectively. 
Only a few Ghanaians, below the numbers required for a 
successful and inclusive digital economy, have the requisite 
digital skills experience beyond the basic use of a computer or 
tablet. The private sector is paying a premium to get these skills, 
making it significantly more difficult for the public sector to retain 
people with such skills. There is high demand for digitally skilled 
professionals in both the public and private sectors in Ghana. There 
is a huge need for software developers, coders, cybersecurity 
professionals and project developers to further Ghana’s progress to 
establishing a successful and inclusive digital economy.
To advance towards a vibrant digital economy that can foster 
Ghana’s leadership potential, a set of recommendations are 
proposed for the development of actions aimed at solving the 
challenges identified across the digital economy foundations. 
Recommendations are classified by level of priority: (i) quick-wins, for 
improvement actions with immediate benefit that can be delivered 
quickly with results; (ii) high-priority, for critical recommendations 
that cannot be delayed; and, (iii) long-term, for actions that focus 
on consolidating results while building the policy framework, 
infrastructure, systems, and capacity needed to achieve goals, and, 
therefore, whose implementation spans a longer timeframe. All five foundations of the digital economy rely on a robust legal 
and regulatory framework that fosters competition. All areas of 
the digital economy require effective competition. Firms operating 
within the digital economy – whether to offer digital connectivity, 
payment solutions, or digital platforms – require a level playing 
field. Free market forces can help drive down prices and ramp up 
usage. At the same time, all aspects of the digital economy need to 
be inclusive, giving equal opportunity to men and women, and to 
the disadvantaged.
The results of recommended interventions seek to support Ghana’s 
achievement of the goals set under the Digital Roadmap for the 
Beyond Aid Agenda (Digital Roadmap Concept Note, May 2019). 
Progress on implementing actions to enhanced digital economy 
transformation is expected to:
• EXPAND DIGITAL SERVICES TO BRIDGE THE URBAN-RURAL 
DIVIDE: digital transactions, connections, applications, and 
services have the potential to transform the way people, 
governments, businesses, governments, and civil society interact 
with each other. From parents enrolling their children in school, to 
social safety net administrators verifying the identity and eligibility 
of a new beneficiary, to businesses submitting their annual tax 
filings, the transactions that fill our daily lives have historically 
required paper forms, in-person visits during business hours, and 
cash payments. The combination of digital platforms, with digital 
financial services and powered by digital infrastructure, skills, 
and entrepreneurship, support transactions, marketplaces, and 
other spaces that are on-demand, paperless, and cashless, and 
available through the Internet from anywhere in Ghana and the 
world. Increased access to digital services contributes to equity 
and inclusion of disadvantaged groups, such as farmers, rural 
households and women, for instance, as they would be able to sell 
their local produce and homemade products. 
• FOSTER THE GROWTH OF THE LOCAL IT INDUSTRY BEYOND 
THE BOUNDARIES OF GHANA: the rise of the Internet has brought 
to ventures in Ghana, enhanced adoption and adaptation of digital 
technology by existing businesses, opened access to microwork 
jobs, and is expected to generate new digital jobs (that is those 
that are nonexistent today) in both traditional industries and newly 
created industries. Recommendations for the growth of the local 
IT industry target the growth of digital firms as well as digital 
transformation of private sector by leveraging digital technology 
to improve performance of nondigital businesses, having both 
expected impacts on boosting job creation. In this way, a strong 
digital private sector is expected to contribute to Ghana’s 
economic growth. 
21Results of recommended interventions seek to support the 
achievement of the three overarching goals included at the 
Digital Roadmap for the Beyond Aid in Ghana. The proposed 
recommendations include 37 interventions that target the three 
established goals: six recommendations seek to improve digital 
infrastructure; eight to strengthen digital platforms; seven to mature 
digital financial services; nine to promote digital entrepreneurship; 
and seven to develop digital skills. Tables 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 summarize 
the 37 recommendations grouping them by Beyond Aid goal. Each recommendation follows from the analysis of the strengths 
and challenges in Ghana in the five foundational pillars (see 
appendix D for full descriptions of all recommendations). Each 
recommendation includes the expected development outcome, 
the type of intervention required, the government agencies that will 
need to coordinate to deploy such recommendation, the priority, the 
foundation pillar that gave origin, and the synergies to actions done 
in another foundation pillar. Recommended priorities and Beyond aid goals are intrinsically linked to the development outcomes of equity/inclusion, productivity  
and growth.

(including public and private sector

EFFICIENCY OF SERVICE: digital transformation helps improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of core functions and services 
of both, public and private, reduces duplication, combats fraud 
and corruption by increasing the security and traceability of 
transactions, and improves engagement and accountability. By providing trusted venues and resources for digital transactions, 
including tax filling and formal registrations, digital technologies 
enhance the ability of the government to generate revenues. 
Overall, improved quality and efficiency of services is linked to 
more productive use of the economy’s resources. 
Hence, achievement of these objectives is also linked to progress towards the overarching development outcomes of equity and inclusion, 
economic growth, and productivity (see table 0.1).

Introduction
Ghana is a middle-income country that has performed well in the 
past two decades, with economic growth slowing in recent years. 
Between 2005 and 2012, the Ghanaian economy grew an impressive 
7.7 percent per year on average, with an annual job creation rate of 
4.0 percent, meaning that every one percent increase in economic 
growth was associated with a 0.5 percent increase in job growth (see 
table 1.1). Economic growth has largely been driven by commodity 
exports (cocoa and gold, for which prices more than tripled between 
2000 and 2010) and the start of commercial oil production in 2011. 
However, GDP growth rates slowed between 2012 and 2016, 
averaging 5.6 percent (with a low of 1.6 percent in 2015), while 
picking-up again to 8.5 percent in 2017.
Dependence on commodities results in volatility and noninclusive 
growth. Ghana’s commodity driven growth has increased economic 
volatility with cyclic volatility costing Ghana about 0.3 percent of 
growth per year during 2000-2015, and as much as 0.7 percent 
per year in the early 2010s. Moreover, while growth rates are still 
high, their impact on poverty has dramatically slowed since 2012. 
As emphasized by the recent World Bank Systematic Country 
Diagnostic (SCD) for the country (World Bank 2017c), Ghana’s largest 
fall in poverty, 2 percent a year, was experienced during 1991–1998. 
As growth accelerated, however, the annual reduction in poverty 
rate fell to 1.4 percent in 1998-2005, and 1.1 percent in 2005-2012. 
Between 2012 and 2016, the poverty rate declined by only 0.2 
percent per year, and stood at 23.4 percent in 2016. This may reflect 
the declining contribution of agriculture, in which the majority of poor 
households are engaged, the limited job opportunities for higher 
productivity in the services sector, and a largely capital-intensive 
industrial development in commodity-focused sectors.1.1 Country at a Glance

Ghana needs to invest more, diversify, and increase productivity 
– in short, accelerate economic transformation, if it is to achieve 
higher and inclusive growth. Ghana’s medium-term prospects 
are strong: GDP growth was 8.5 percent in 2017 (Ghana Statistical 
Service 2018) and was projected to be 7.5 percent in 2018, assuming 
fiscal consolidation remains on track. However, the “lack of structural 
transformation and economic diversification” are the key challenges 
to achieve inclusive development for commodity-dependent 
developing countries such as Ghana (UNCTAD 2017a). The oil and 
gas sectors are expected to continue to be the main driver of growth, 
with a recovery of commodity prices in the medium term further 
boosting export earnings. However, at 16.7 percent of GDP during 
2014-2016, Ghana’s overall gross capital formation is low compared 
with its structural and aspirational peers and productivity growth 
remains limited. According to the World Bank Long-Term Growth 
Model, even if investment levels reached 25-30 percent of GDP – 
moderately higher than the historical average of 20-25 percent – the 
predicted per capita growth would not go much beyond the 1.7-2.5 
percent range, barely keeping up with the projected 2.2 percent 
population growth. This suggests that raising overall productivity, 
in addition to higher investments in nontraditional (nonextractive) 
sectors, will be critical to ensure that growth is inclusive and achieves 
poverty reduction.
The current government’s strategy is to transform the Ghanaian 
economy to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, with the 
private sector as the main driver. In the words of Ghana’s President, 
the aim is to “build the most business friendly economy in Africa” and 
foster the competitiveness of Ghanaian firms (World Bank 2018g). 
To achieve this, the government’s agenda includes: reforming 
the energy sector, improving trade facilitation and the business 
environment, investing in infrastructure, and diversifying beyond 
primary products (hydrocarbons, gold and cocoa).1

Algorithmic  
economyIn Ghana and around the world, potential opportunities for 
digitizing economies are immense. Digital economies are growing 
by an average of 15 to 25 percent a year (Sabbagh and others 2013). 
The information and communications technology (ICT) sector lies 
at the core of a digital economy, and its impact covers all types of 
business activity, as well as public service provision and daily life for 
individuals (see figure 1.1). 
The ICT sector in Ghana comprises six groups of activities, with 
telecommunications services dominating in terms of employment 
and number of establishments (see table 1.2). The Integrated 
Business Establishment Survey for 2014 revealed the following 
insights (Ghana Statistical Service, 2015):• ICT ESTABLISHMENTS. There were 4,153 ICT establishments in 
the country, adding 7 percent of total establishments in Ghana. 
Seventy-one percent of establishments are quite young since 
their launch year was between 2015-2014. Establishments are 
concentrated in two regions, in Greater Accra (42.4 percent) and 
Ashanti (20.7 percent). 
• JOBS IN ICT. There are 39,506 persons engaged in the ICT sector, 
70 percent of them working in Greater Accra, and 10 percent 
in Ashanti.
• MAIN ICT ACTIVITIES. Telecommunications services account 
for 45.3 percent of ICT employees; Computer programming, 
consultancy, and related activities employs 13 percent.1.2 Background on the Digital Economy

Ghana’s economy is led by the services sector, with ICT 
contributing about 3.6 percent of the country’s GDP (IFC 2019). 
The contribution of Ghana’s ICT sector to the overall GDP of the 
country has grown steadily over the years, becoming one of the best performing sectors in the country’s economy. In 2017, the 
contribution of ICT services was $1.7 billion, or 3.6 percent of overall 
GDP (see figure 1.2).

30Ghana’s digital sector has experienced impressive growth thanks 
to early liberalization and deregulation of the telecommunications 
market in the late 1990s. The combination of a competitive market 
structure, improved international connectivity, an increase in private 
sector investment in communications infrastructure, and a reduction 
in telecommunications prices, in particular at the wholesale level, 
has been instrumental in fueling innovation and investments in the 
broader ICT sector, including in IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS). A 
vibrant IT sector is emerging with companies such as mPedigree, 
Rancard, Softtribe, Hubtel, mPharma, Logiciel, Nosmay competing 
globally in software and applications platforms for everything from 
finance and payments to agriculture and medical services. There are 
over 20 registered business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, 
a handful of IT parks, and over 50 innovation hubs for incubating and 
providing training and mentorship to startups. 
The traditional ICT industry has also been disrupted by 
automation, standardization, and emerging technologies. Cloud 
services, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 
robotics, among others, have reduced demand for back office and 
contact center services. That said, the ITeS/BPO sector continues 
to hold significant promise, while some key African countries are 
rethinking their strategies and positioning themselves to attract 
significant investments in niche markets. For example, the BPO 
sector contributed about $4 billion towards South Africa’s national 
GDP and employed 222,500 people in 2016. The value of Egypt’s 
BPO industry was estimated at $1.3 billion in 2016 and is expected 
to expand to about $2 billion by the end of 2019, employing close 
to 100,000 people in 2015. The Egyptian government has a goal of 
increasing IT-related contributions to over 8 percent of GDP by 2020. 
Kenya has targeted the ITeS sector to contribute about 8 percent to 
the country’s GDP as well as creating 180,000 jobs. (Research and 
Markets 2017). While Ghana continues to make strides in the ICT, 
ITeS, BPO and software development space, there is no coherent 
strategy, and little support is provided to promote the current and 
potential opportunity. 
In the past few years, adoption of disruptive technologies has 
gathered pace in Ghana. There have been several recent initiatives 
by the Government of Ghana to adopt new technologies and some 
other developments in the private sector have also contributed to 
this demand:
• The Ghana Health Service, in partnership with the World Health 
Organization (WHO), has developed the Vaccine Wastage 
Sentinel Monitoring System, which uses sensor technology to 
monitor the supply chain of vaccines to improve management 
and minimize wastage.• Google opened an AI research lab in Accra in April 2019, which is 
the first AI research center in Africa (see box 2.7).
• The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources in Ghana is 
working with IBM to plan a blockchain-based solution for land 
administration. This will change the current inefficient paper-
based central land records system to an immutable and secure 
decentralized ledger of land records.
• Rancard, a Ghana-based company and a leader in social 
recommendations and AI-powered customer engagement 
technology, has recently launched R2, which is a virtual agent 
that makes use of best-in-class machine learning and artificial 
intelligence (AI) to automate interactions between businesses 
and their customers.
• The government has signed a deal with a U.S. tech firm Zipline 
that will see unmanned drones delivering blood and other 
medical supplies to hospitals and clinics.
The government has undertaken a series of policy and 
infrastructure-related reforms in recent years, including the 
ICT for Accelerated Development Policy (ICT4AD), National 
Telecommunications Policy, the Data Protection Act, the Electronic 
Transaction Act, the Electronic Communications Act, implementation 
of a fiber optic backbone that should put it on a more solid footing 
for sustained economic growth, improved service delivery, and 
more effective policy making. Liberal policies and strategic initiatives 
for private sector participation have paved the way for the creation 
of a highly competitive digital market in Ghana. In 2003, the ICT4AD 
policy set out the plans to engineer an ICT-led socioeconomic 
development process with the potential to transform Ghana 
into a middle-income, information-rich, knowledge-based and 
technology-driven economy and society (ICT4AD Policy 2003). The 
government is currently taking steps to update the ICT4AD policy 
towards a new digital roadmap strategy for the country.
As part of Ghana Beyond Aid, the government aims to develop a 
new policy in line with digital opportunities to develop a digital 
strategy and an implementation plan to establish Ghana as 
the leader in ICT innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2023. It 
envisages to (i) foster the growth in the local IT industry beyond the 
boundaries of Ghana, (ii) bridge the urban-rural divide by expanding 
digital services to rural and underserved communities, (iii) increase 
efficiency, improve citizens’ experience and engagement with 
government by reducing the mean time to deliver government 
services to citizens while increasing government revenue generation, 
(iv) increase transparency in government functions (Digital Roadmap 
Conference Concept Note 2019).
31For countries in Africa, the digital economy offers opportunities 
and brings the risk of being left behind. Improved digital connectivity 
can only achieve the desired transformational impact on economic 
opportunity and inclusive growth if combined with improvements in 
digital skills and literacy, the coverage of digital identity schemes, 
access to digital payments and other financial services, as well 
as digital support to startups and existing businesses. With such 
capabilities, the African economy can harness digital data and new 
technologies, generate new content, link individuals with markets 
and with government services, and roll out new and sustainable 
business models. 
Yet in much of the African region today, too few citizens have 
digital IDs or transaction accounts, locking them out of access 
to critical public services, financial inclusion, and markets. Digital 
startups struggle to attract funding and “traditional” businesses are 
only slowly adopting digital technologies and platforms to boost 
productivity and sales. There is a shortage of workers with the digital 
skills needed, while limited digital literacy holds back adoption 
and use of digital products and services. Inadequate policy and 
regulatory frameworks, including for data protection, cybersecurity, 
and competition, also constrain the development of a digital 
economy in Africa.
Digital economies also introduce new risks – to consumers, 
creditors or firms, on personal data and cyber threats, in ways 
systemic or otherwise – and require safeguards to mitigate these 
risks and ensure robust job markets. A key area of concern has 
been that widespread adoption of automation and other digital 
technologies can cause significant net job losses. However, in the 
aggregate, technological change does not seem to have led to a 
significant increase in joblessness and global employment continues 
to expand in line with the growth in the labor force (ILO 2018). Though 
it may displace jobs, automation using technology causes “creative 
destruction,” stripping some jobs, while creating new ones. To 
develop safeguards for job markets, developing countries in Africa 
need to invest in the requisite skills and systems early on, including 
in the digital domain, so that such skills are tied to meaningful jobs. 
This can help strengthen the country’s competitiveness in the global 
marketplace. 
Additionally, while digital economic development can be critical, 
the process is neither linear nor a panacea. Effective prioritization 
and sequencing are required, especially as it deals with the public 
sector. For example, if public service delivery is a key priority to improve 
the targeting of the poor, the development of government platforms 
will need to be prioritized. Key investments and reforms may need 
to be prioritized as part of an overall development strategy. Shifting cash into digital accounts for government payments, remittances, 
small and medium enterprise (SME) payments, and agricultural 
value-chain payments can enable broad-based participation in 
digital economy. Digital financial services can be more accessible 
for lower-income segments of the population, and for women and 
agricultural households – population segments often underserved 
by traditional financial services.
A digital economy has the potential to enhance productivity 
and gains in multiple ways. A digital economy can change the 
way economies of scale are achieved, particularly with online 
service delivery, as the incremental cost of offering an additional 
product or service may become negligible. The digital economy 
may provide better matching of buyers and sellers in a competitive 
marketplace. It may address certain concerns with asymmetric 
information, solving some principal-agent problems where buyers 
and sellers are separated by intermediaries, or, even, multiple 
levels of intermediaries. It may strengthen people’s trust in firms or 
governments by enabling some decentralized forms of trust (such 
as with blockchain) where centralized authorities are not trusted. It 
may allow products and services to be customized and targeted – 
enabling better inclusion but also easier ways to exclude some too. 1.3 Rationale for Digital Economy Development

DIGITAL ECONOMY CAN BRING SHARED PROSPERITY AND REDUCED POVERTY
33The analysis of Ghana’s digital economy has been launched as 
part of the World Bank Group’s DE4A Initiative, which takes stock 
of recent relevant assessments and leverages the integrated 
and foundation-based diagnostic framework to examine the 
present level of digital economy development across Africa. This 
assessment, which focuses on Ghana, maps the current strengths 
and weaknesses that characterize the national digital economy 
ecosystem, as well as identify challenges and opportunities for 
future growth. The DE4A framework findings ultimately provide 
practical and actionable recommendations that inform priority 
areas for development, proposing a mix of possible policy reforms 
and interventions that directly address the needs and support for 
harnessing the economic and social benefits digital economies bring 
and mitigates risks.With the purpose to identify priority actions for Ghana to continue 
strengthening its digital economy progress, this stocktaking 
exercise has been conducted by a multidisciplinary WBG team in 
collaboration with the Government of Ghana (GoG). The stocktaking 
exercise focuses on integrating insights from the exhaustive analysis 
already completed in the country into comprehensive analysis 
aligned to the five-foundational elements framework presented 
above. Throughout the stocktaking exercise, analytical gaps are also 
being identified for further, targeted inquiry. 
Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is no other than setting out the 
roadmap for priority interventions that would underpin Ghana’s 
ambitions to become a digital economy leader in the region. As 
such, this analytical work seeks to inform the GoG on critical reforms 
and required investments in line with government priorities. Given 
the vast information and data already available, the approach 
proposed for this work was tailored to Ghana’s unique advanced 
starting point and is depicted in figure 1.4.1.4 Diagnostic Methodology
34For the digital entrepreneurship foundation, this report performs 
a diagnostic stocktaking to assess the key components of Ghana’s 
digital entrepreneurship ecosystem, using the framework 
adopted by the New Metrics of Entrepreneurship Methodology 
Note developed by the World Bank (2019a). The new metrics methodology examines the interactions between pillars of the 
entrepreneurship ecosystem, based on the supply and demand for 
knowledge and the capacity to convert it into successful or impactful 
businesses. STOCK-TAKING

37IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Digital infrastructure provides the way for people, businesses, and 
governments to get online, and link with local and global digital 
services – thus connecting them to the global digital economy. 
Broadly, digital infrastructure consists of connectivity (such as high-
speed Internet and Internet exchange points),2 the Internet of Things 
(such as mobile devices, computers, sensors, voice-activated devices, 
geospatial instruments, machine-to-machine communications and 
vehicle-to-vehicle communications), and data repositories (such as 
data centers and clouds).3 With a growing digital economy, information 
security and cybersecurity also become more significant, adding 
security functions to protect critical information and infrastructure. 
For the digital economy, good connectivity provided by broadband 
Internet is a critical foundation (World Bank 2018f). 
DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS: CURRENT 
STATE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Ghana’s telecommunications sector has experienced impressive 
growth thanks to early liberalization and deregulation of the 
market since the late 1990s. Strong competition has resulted in 
near ubiquitous mobile coverage and a high mobile penetration 
rate of 131 SIM cards per 100 inhabitants, compared to an average 
of 80 in the rest of Africa. The country’s mobile Internet penetration 
of about 68 percent is notable, albeit only slightly above the Africa 
regional average (GSMA 2018a). >>  Backbone Infrastructure
The World Bank’s World Development Report (WDR) 2016 report: 
Digital Dividends  (World Bank 2016a), provides a useful framework 
for analyzing the broadband supply chain: starting from the first 
mile  (the point where the Internet enters a country – international 
Internet access, including submarine cable landing stations and 
satellite international connectivity) through the middle mile  (national 
backbone and intercity network, including fiber backbone, IXPs) to 
the last mile  (reaching the end user through local access network). 
The framework also highlights an  invisible mile  (the intangible parts 
of the network such as spectrum, licensing, cybersecurity, and so 
on) which could constrain or promote broadband access. A problem 
on any of these  miles results in disparate networks and poor delivery 
of services. 
There are five submarine cable landings in the country providing 
over 340 Gbps in available capacity (see table 2.1). At the national 
level, five4 regional mobile operators, (MTN, Vodafone, Airtel/Tigo, 
Expresso, and Glo) continue to make significant investments in 
terrestrial backbone and last mile infrastructure.2.1 Digital Infrastructure

SUBMARINE CABLES IN GHANA (2017)
38What appears to be missing is a robust and comprehensive 
middle mile, or the domestic backbone infrastructure to carry 
traffic from the landing points to all parts of the country – cities, 
towns, and rural communities. While there is significant backbone 
infrastructure (largely microwave) across the country, there is no 
single comprehensive and seamless domestic fiber backbone 
infrastructure. Most of the operators have invested in parallel infrastructure on similar, more profitable routes across the country 
(see table 2.2). Additionally, the 800-kilometer Eastern Corridor 
Fiber Optic Intercity Network, managed by the National Information 
Technology Agency (NITA), which links Ghana’s north and south 
to international submarine gateways, remains largely unutilized 
because of high wholesale prices and the missing last mile to 
the communities.
Reaching out to largely rural and poorer customers is often a 
challenge to most private operators. The Ghana Investment Fund 
for Electronic Communications (GIFEC) is leading efforts to close 
rural connectivity gaps through a number of initiatives including a 
recent partnership with MTN and Ericsson for a $12 million Rural 
Telephony Project to extend mobile telephone service coverage to 
about 40 rural communities in the country. Similar efforts from GIFEC, 
the Ministry of Communications (MoC), and the World Bank include establishment of over 200 community and regional innovation 
centers that are providing various communication and innovation 
services to rural and underserved communities. The fact remains, 
however, that the country still has relatively low Internet and voice 
penetration (actual voice penetration may be no more than 50 
percent of the population). GIFEC has significant resources. In 2016, 
it received about ₵35 million (about $6.5 million) from the operators. TABLE 2.2.

At the end of December 2018, there were a total of 40.94 million 
mobile subscribers (138 percent penetration rate) in Ghana, with 
annual growth of 11.5 percent (Fitch Solutions 2019). The rapid 
growth of 3G/4G services are supported by value-added mobile 
solutions and applications provided by mobile operators. 3G service 
launched in 2013. Currently four operators provide 3G services and, 
as of December 2018, there were about 14 million 3G subscribers. 4G 
services launched in June 2016. Currently only one provider (MTN) 
provides 4G services. As of December 2018, there were about 1 
million 4G subscribers (TeleGeography 2019). >>>  Broadband
Compared to the rapid growth of the mobile market, broadband 
infrastructure development in Ghana has been slow. In particular, 
the fixed broadband network (including copper, fiber, or cable) is 
not effective. End-user prices are still high (typically in excess of ₵120 
(about $22) per month) and not affordable for those with average 
incomes (about ₵1000 or $185 per month). Providing reliable and fast 
broadband connectivity for ministries, departments and agencies 
(MDAs), and metropolitan, municipal and district assemblies (MMDAs) 
across the country is still challenging. The eTransform Ghana project 
has been providing support for NITA to reduce the connectivity gap.
40 TABLE 2.4. 
KEY POLICY AND LEGISLATIONS RELATED TO ICT/DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT IN GHANAThe Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for the 
development of reliable and affordable digital infrastructure 
and services in Ghana and in charge of development policy and 
regulation of ICT in Ghana.
The National Information Technology Agency (NITA) is the ICT 
policy implementation arm of the Ministry of Communications, and 
NITA has implemented several digital government infrastructures 
and provides connectivity to MDAs and MMDAs across the country. 
NITA has built a Tier 3 data center to host all government applications (see section 2.2 on Digital Platforms for a description of how NITA 
functions with regards to government platforms).
The National Communication Authority (NCA) is an independent 
regulator responsible for setting standards, licensing, and regulating 
communications services (wire, cable, radio, television, satellite, and 
others) in Ghana. NCA has been proactively implementing future-
forwarding policies and promote adoption of new technologies and 
services. Also, NCA has been influential in terms of improving the 
quality of ICT and digital services in Ghana.
Ghana’s proactive policy and regulatory interventions have been 
key to the relative success of the reforms and progress made 
to date. Several policies have been put in place to strengthen 
competition, including the ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) 
Policy (2003), the proinvestment National Telecommunications 
Policy (2004), and National Broadband Policy (2012), though some 
are in need of updating. A foundational legal framework has also 
been developed and key legislation passed for strengthening 
the ICT regulatory agency and other regulatory institutions, and 
for safeguarding electronic communications and transactions. 
The National Communications Regulations of 2003 provides the 
foundational legal framework for the main regulator, the National 
Communications Authority (NCA). The NCA and other regulatory 
institutions are supported with several industry-specific regulations, 
such as the National Communications Authority (NCA) Act 769, 
Electronic Communications Act (Act 775), Electronic Communications 
Amendment Act (Act 786), Electronic Transactions Act (Act 772), DTT 
Broadcasting Policy, 2016, The National Information Technology Act, 
Ghana Investment Funds for Electronic Communications (GIFEC) Act, Data Protection Act, National Broadband Policy and Implementation 
Strategy, amongst others. While the NCA is the main regulator of 
the sector, GIFEC exists to provide universal service and access to 
underserved and rural communities, and the National Information 
Technology Authority (NITA) is mandated to create an enabling 
environment for effective deployment and use of ICT by all public-
sector institutions and organizations.
Improved international connectivity has resulted in a fall in 
wholesale bandwidth prices, and relatively cheaper retail 
prices to end-users. The Government of Ghana, with funding 
from the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), has 
complemented investments through a $38 million Eastern Corridor 
Fiber Optic Backbone Project, providing about 800 kilometers of 
fiber optic cable for over 120 communities across Ghana. It links 
Ghana’s north and south as well as international submarine gateways 
via the country’s Eastern Corridor. Funds are being explored for a 
counterpart Western Corridor project to complete the loop. >> Key Government Ministry and Institutions for Digital Infrastructure Development in Ghana

41In Ghana, most of the infrastructure is concentrated in urban 
and commercial areas with large sections of the country’s rural 
population without effective coverage. There are several white 
spots in the urban areas and the periurban areas are also not well 
covered. In the absence of a more robust and comprehensive 
nationwide fiber backbone, operators have been investing in 
wireless solutions to extend 3G service to key parts of the country. 
MTN’s recently launched 4G LTE service is introducing faster and 
more reliable mobile data services to the country, but in March 2019 
there were only about 20,000 subscribers. Internet penetration of 
about 36 percent is provided largely through 3G mobile connections. 
Several keystone projects are being deployed by private operators 
and are contributing to strengthening the network. These include 
CSquared’s Metro Fiber, the only private sector owned, wholesale-
only, carrier-neutral, and open-access network of over 1,000 
kilometers currently operational across the largest cities in Ghana 
(Accra, Tema, and Kumasi); Vodafone and MTN’s fiber to-the-home 
(FTTH) services which are already connecting ISPs and several 
thousands of homes and communities; and Gridtel’s Fiber on Power 
Transmission Network, which is providing backbone services to 
operators and ISPs across the country. 
More needs to be done to create a more comprehensive, robust, 
and redundant nationwide network and to make Ghana’s digital 
economy more competitive. The cost of the Internet is still high 
and access low, especially in rural areas. The Alliance for Affordable 
Internet 2018 report (A4AI 2018) confirmed Ghana is yet to meet the 
affordability target of “1 for 2”— defined as 1 GB of data for no more than 
2 percent of national monthly income.5 Ghana also compares only 
modestly with key competitors in Africa and the world on broadband 
speeds. It is ranked 10th out of 12 leading African countries (110th out of 
189 globally) with its average broadband speed of 2.3 Mbps.6 Kenya, 
which ranks first in Africa (51st in the world) with 10.71 Mbps is the only 
African country with speed above the minimum 10 Mbps considered 
to be needed by consumers “to fully participate in a digital society” 
(Ofcom 2019). On the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) 
ICT Development Index, Ghana dropped slightly to 112 out of 175 
countries in 2016 (ITU 2017). 
Spectrum licensing prices represent a major barrier to digital 
infrastructure growth. The NCA has generally been quite efficient 
in developing a strategy and engaging in public consultations to 
auction spectrum in Ghana. However, the industry considers that 
prices being achieved through these auctions are prohibitive, and 
likely to strangle its growth. In 2015, the NCA sold 800 MHz of 4G 
spectrum for $67.5 million to MTN, which was the only operator 
who could afford the high fees. MTN currently has only about 20,000 4G subscribers. Moreover, the current licensing regime 
requires operators to acquire new sets of licenses to deploy new 
technologies and services. This restricts innovation in the range 
of services that can be offered within existing spectrum bands. A 
number of countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Cote D’Ivoire, and 
Nigeria, have transitioned to a unified licensing regime to reflect 
convergence of the telecommunications sector. 
Despite the expansion of Internet exchange points (IXP) in 
Ghana, sustainability has not been achieved yet. IXPs are critical 
to lowering the cost of bandwidth and allow local traffic/content to 
be exchanged locally, obviating high fees required for international 
transit. While Ghana’s IXP membership has grown and currently 
includes over 20 members (MNOs, ISPs, government, educational 
institutions), its long-term sustainability is questionable for two key 
reasons: first, a dearth of locally produced content, and second, 
most local content being hosted outside of Ghana. 
Reduced number of grade A facilities with high broadband prices 
combined with the lack of highly skilled/low-cost labor has 
explained the slow takeoff of BPO services in Ghana. The government 
made concerted efforts to address some perceived challenges 
including improvements in broadband quality and price and other 
infrastructure. Ghana’s 2012 National Broadband Strategy defined 
high-speed broadband as Internet speeds greater than 2 Mbps, in 
line with ITU’s 2011 definition. The objective then was to achieve this 
target by 2020. In principle, Ghana has already achieved this objective, 
with estimated current average speed of 2.3 Mbps. However, many 
countries, including the United States, have revised broadband speed 
targets as part of new broadband plans and strategies. It is clear that 
countries with the most robust Internet infrastructure also rank the 
highest in the Global Competitiveness Report: the faster the speed, 
the more consumers can transact business and access services 
online. 
Poor performance of the government’s data center. For data 
centers/cloud services, the global potential is important (for 
example, 40 percent annual growth in India, with a global public 
cloud market estimated to grow to $236 billion by 2020, following a 
22 percent CAGR between 2015 and 2020). The poor performance of 
the government’s data center (Tier 3, $30m investment, largest in the 
country) which is being managed by NITA, points at opportunities 
for the private sector to step in: opportunities for privatization are 
being discussed. These are to be balanced with a trend towards the 
geographical concentration of data centers globally, so the need for 
local storage needs to be properly assessed (CPSD Ghana 2017). >>  Challenges
Despite progress, a number of challenges persist, the main ones being summarized below:
42Revise Broadband Speed Targets
Ghana needs to revise its stated minimum threshold speeds for what constitutes broadband service, as the most 
competitive countries are doing. Singapore, for example, which ranked as one of the world’s fastest countries,7 has a mean 
download speed of 70.86 Mbps – nearly ten times faster than Kenya and more than 20 times faster than Ghana. 
Develop a robust and comprehensive middle mile (domestic backbone infrastructure)
Policies and actions should encourage additional investment in domestic backbone for more efficient utilization of existing 
infrastructure and completion of missing links. The NCA needs to provide better guidelines on infrastructure sharing for 
these and other emerging complementary infrastructures, including those being provided by the power companies Gridco 
and ECG, as well as CSquared’s metro fiber. Promotion of infrastructure sharing will limit concentration and duplication of 
infrastructure in more profitable areas and redirect resources to underserved communities. The government needs to 
accelerate efforts to complete the counterpart Western Corridor project to ensure a more redundant national backbone. 
The planned connectivity transaction, led by NITA, under the World Bank-funded eTransform Ghana program, should also 
help here.
 Increased investment in last mile Infrastructure 
The government needs to be more proactive in the use of resources to partner with the private sector in the extension of 
services to more underserved communities. 
Revise spectrum allocation and award of unified licenses
The NCA needs to revise its spectrum policy to allow more competition, investment, and expansion of broadband for all 
Ghanaians. The award of additional frequency spectrum emerging from the digital TV migration process should also be 
more open. A unified licensing regime could introduce more competition in the sector for both 3G and 4G8 operators and 
could encourage more investment in broadband services at competitive cost to operators. 
Streamline effective implementation of cybersecurity policy and strategy
Ghana needs to unfold a cyber-conscious culture across the economy, particularly for financial institutions and SMEs, with 
a national program that raises awareness of cybersecurity risks and secure online behavior. Task regulators, in particular 
MoC and the Bank of Ghana (BoG), need to mandate the implementation of a nationally agreed baseline of IT security 
standards, including procurement processes and in all steps of software development.
Explore and encourage private sector solutions for data storage capacity needs
Local data storage requirements should be assessed and partnerships fostered with the private sector to ensure market 
needs are met. A cascade approach should be followed before investing more public resources to ensure Ghana’s data 
storage needs are fulfilled.The cyber ecosystem in Ghana has also been described as still 
in its early stages and experts have said the country’s culture 
is not yet cyber conscious. Ghana is estimated to have lost about 
$50 million to cybercrime in 2016. The threat of attacks continues to 
be a challenge for both government and businesses. The National 
Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (NCSPS) from 2016 had been 
drafted under the lead of the Ministry of Communications (MoC) 
and its implementation is at an early stage (World Bank 2018b). 
The NCSPS includes a five-year strategic plan 2016-2020, with 
nine priority areas, which are directly linked to the socioeconomic and development goals of the ICT4AD policy, in particular pillar 14 
“Facilitating National Security and Law and Order,” one of the policy’s 
Priority Focus Areas (World Bank 2018b). However, Ghana’s Critical 
Infrastructure Protection (CIP) has been described to be in its infancy 
by experts (Ghana Cybersecurity Capacity Review 2018). Though 
there have been a number of coordinated attacks against several 
government websites in the past, they were handled by NITA and 
the Ghana Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GH), and 
none of the incidents impacted on the national crisis management 
concerning cyber incidents (World Bank 2018b).

43IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS
Digital platforms span every aspect of life and are offered by 
government and firms: Digital platforms represent the use of digital 
technology in all aspects of life, such as healthcare, education, 
commerce, or government services.9 Both governments and firms 
operate digital platforms, serving people, businesses, or government. 
Governments use digital platforms (public sector platforms) to improve 
the delivery of government services, or to improve the effectiveness 
of its functions. For example, a government operates digital identity as 
a government platform to offer a unique identity to every person in a 
country, and for use by most, if not every, sector in the country. Firms 
use digital platforms (private sector platforms) to offer new products 
or services. For example, a firm operates an e-commerce platform to 
offer retail services online, or by connecting buyers with sellers. 
Digital marketplaces help create economies of scale and capitalize 
on the network effects of digital products or services to strengthen 
a country’s competitiveness. This is particularly relevant in the 
context of a digital economy, where tech startups have potential to 
scale up and capture market share. Digital platforms can achieve 
exponential growth and value, as increasing numbers of users adopt 
the services offered, and generate more data and content. In building 
and boosting a digital economy, countries have potential to create 
larger markets within which companies may offer digital products or 
services (whether online or by mobile phone), while removing barriers 
to crossborder e-commerce, incentivizing investment, and increasing 
the competitiveness and dynamism of each region’s or country’s 
digital economy. It is particularly beneficial for digital products and 
services because of the network effects they create. Increasing the 
size of the digital marketplace may thus help amplify these network 
effects in Ghana and Africa, and may offer the opportunity for locally 
developed applications, platforms, and content providers to grow.DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:  
CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS
>> Public Sector Platforms
The growing desire to achieve greater efficiency, transparency, and 
accountability has led to the government’s continued investment 
in public sector digital platforms. A number of digital platforms have 
been developed in an effort to improve governance and delivery of 
public services. Notable among them is the automation of tax and 
business registration systems, which has significantly broadened 
the tax base and streamlined business processes by reducing the 
number of days for registering businesses. 
In the 2018 survey of the UN E-Government Index (EGDI), Ghana 
is the only African country that transitioned from the middle to 
high level. Based on the technical features of national websites as 
well as e-government policies and strategies applied in general 
and by specific sectors in delivering services, the number of African 
countries in the High-EGDI-level group remains relatively modest 
at six, with only one country, Ghana, joining the group since 2016. 
The EGDI is a weighted average of normalized scores on the three 
most important dimensions of e-government: the scope and quality 
of online services as indicated by the Online Service Index (OSI),10 
the status of the development of telecommunication infrastructure 
rated through the Telecommunication Infrastructure Index (TII), and 
the inherent human capital scored through the Human Capital Index 
(HCI). Each of these indices is by itself a composite measure that can 
be extracted and analyzed independently. 2.2 Digital Platforms

44>>>  Institutional Setup for Digital Government Platforms
Digital government development in Ghana is led by the Ministry of 
Communication (MoC). MoC is spearheading several key initiatives 
such as the National Identification System (NIS), ICT Infrastructure 
Development Program, Public Key Infrastructure, Open Data 
Initiative, and other digital government initiatives. As mentioned 
in the Digital Infrastructure pillar, the ministry has established 20 
enhanced Community Information Centres (eCICs) in selected 
areas in the northern part of Ghana to bridge the technological gap 
between served and underserved areas. The Government of Ghana 
has undertaken several other massive digitization projects, such as 
the National Digital Property Addressing System, and efforts on the 
land records digitization agenda.
The National Information Technology Authority (NITA) is the ICT 
policy implementing arm of the Ministry of Communications. A 
public service institution established by Act 771 in 2008 (the NITA 
Act), NITA is the agency responsible for implementing Ghana’s ICT 
policies. In addition to digital infrastructure, its mandate includes 
“identifying, promoting and developing innovative technologies, 
standards, guidelines and practices among government agencies 
and local governments.” It is also responsible for “ensuring the 
sustainable growth of ICT via research and development, planning 
and technology acquisition strategies to facilitate Ghana’s prospect 
of becoming a technology-driven, knowledge-and values-based 
economy.” NITA has implemented the e-Government Infrastructure 
Platform Project to connect all MDAs and MMDAs across Ghana. 
NITA has also built a Tier 3 data center to host all government 
applications and has also decided to commercialize its excess 
capacity to generate more revenue to support developmental work. 
Currently, NITA is also pursuing a public key infrastructure (PKI) 
and is also working on developing a compliance policy for all the 
government institutions for third-party software licensing and usage.
>>>  National ID and e-ID
The need for a national ID platform to form the underlying 
infrastructure for other digital ID platforms has been recognized 
by the Government. There is an ongoing national ID card program 
led by the National Identification Authority to ensure that every 
Ghanaian has a national ID card known as the Ghana Card. The 
process of registration and issuances of the national ID began in May 
2018. The Ghana Card is meant to serve as the primary ID card that 
Ghanaians will use to access all services in the country – it will serve 
as a valid ID to open a bank account, apply for a passport, telephone 
account, driver’s license and many other services. The Ghana Card 
will help consolidate ID information, which is currently held in nine 
separate databases across various government and public entities. Ghana’s EGDI encapsulates the various fronts on which progress 
has been achieved. This includes some steps toward streamlining its 
institutional and policy frameworks to capitalize on ICT innovations. 
Since 2017, the country has also been investing in improving online 
services delivery and has so far made significant contributions 
towards the development of ICTs under the e-Ghana and e-Transform 
projects. The Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda 
(GSGDA) incorporates an ICT strategy which implies increasing use 
of ICT across economic sectors, e-government, in implementing the 
National Electronic Security system, and the proliferation of other 
ICT-related mechanisms for public benefit. 
Government commitment to, and spending on, technology in 
Ghana is intensifying to attract investors from across the globe. 
Public-sector digitization and outsourcing contracts have been 
awarded to both multinational companies as well as local players 
in the market to provide ICT services for MDAs and MMDAs. Such 
efforts put Ghana on a strong footing to digitize and improve 
efficiency of the delivery of various services. 
Against that background, this section further assesses the 
existing strengths as well as the remaining challenges on Ghana’s 
path toward fully developed public sector digital platforms. Both 
strengths and weaknesses run along the core building blocks for 
these platforms:
• Institutional setup for digital government development  
and management; 
• Data policy and frameworks; 
• Digital ID;
• Back-office systems and shared systems; 
• Interoperability; and
• Digital service delivery.
These building blocks are tightly interconnected. Institutional setup 
and leadership underpin the coordination of digital government 
initiatives. This, in turn, depends on the legal and behavioral norms 
regarding sharing the data among the MDAs and the public at large. 
Coordination and data exchange further enable or hinder the creation 
and operating of shared systems, as well as ensuring interoperability 
among the systems of MDAs. Creation of shared systems and ensuring 
interoperability also depends on how much of the government back-
office operations are digitized in the first place. At the interface with the 
public, digital ID services are crucial to ensuring trust and facilitating 
secure transactions. Finally, all of these issues impact the ability of the 
government to provide digital services to its citizens. 
45>>> Back-Office Systems and Shared Systems 
The digitization of back-office systems started in Ghana in the 
1990s with the digitization of payroll. Initially, the Integrated 
Personnel Payroll System (IPPS) handled both the payroll and 
human resource aspects. However, with the introduction of the 
Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) in 
2014, the HR functionality is handled separately. The payroll system 
is running on an Oracle platform and includes over 600,000 public 
employees. The automation of the payroll system has helped to 
improve the security and monitoring of the system. The system is 
currently mature and includes full budgetary control (no payments 
possible outside the budget). Further enhancements to delivery and 
performance, fiscal and user security, and disaster recovery plans 
are currently underway. Future enhancements include pensions and 
integration into the Oracle financials.
Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System 
(GIFMIS) began its rollout in 2011 and has since been adopted by 
283 MDAs across Ghana. This has resulted in the timely preparation of 
monthly financial reports, annual financial statements, effectiveness 
of expenditure commitment and payroll controls, reduction of audit 
observations, and regularity of account reconciliation. 
The Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) 
is currently being rolled out and is managed by the Public Service 
Commission. Now in its fifth year of implementation, much headway 
has been made, with about 84 percent of public services currently 
included in the system. This allows for sufficient analysis of human 
resource management (HRM) and allows for position control, that 
is, a system of tracking information based on positions rather than 
employees. The transition to the electronic system has had some 
teething problems, including technical and behavioral challenges. At 
the same time, there is a strong buy-in from the senior management 
in the MDAs who already reap the benefits from the electronic 
system: better management of the number of civil servants, picking 
up double entries (“ghosts”) and flagging them for payroll, and 
improving the system of onboarding. 
The Ministry of Finance runs a budget preparation and reporting 
system, Hyperion. Hyperion is connected to GIFMIS, pushing 
budget data for budget implementation. It is also interfaced with 
HRMIS, providing the compensation budget. It is further connected 
to the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management 
System. There are plans to connect it further to the procurement 
planning system and to a high-level public investment management 
planning, to provide a link with capital budgeting.GIFMIS, HRMIS, and payroll reside at a shared data center at the 
office of the Accountant & Controller General (CAG). As such, they 
share computing, storage, and networking with the CAG. 
NITA is expected to provide the bulk of shared services. This 
includes e-mail, web hosting, videoconferencing, and processes 
to be defined within each MDA (for example, task planning, task 
assignment, escalation). The Smart Workplace platform is also 
available and gaining popularity among the MDAs. Currently there 
are also plans for a government cloud computing service to avoid 
the need for MDAs to own their own servers.
>>> Interoperability
The interoperability between payroll, GIFMIS, HRMIS, and 
Hyperion systems is now mostly functional. As long as they have 
connectivity, MDAs and local governments can access payroll, 
invoices, budget information, and other key information online in real 
time. 
More centrally, the Ghana Government Enterprise Architecture 
(GGEA) is designed for increased interoperability through the 
principles of shared infrastructure services, service-oriented 
architecture and event-driven architecture. These principles are 
essential ingredients for interoperability and the GGEA is designed 
to ensure that information for government services is available 
anytime, anywhere, to anyone who is authorized to access it, from 
many channels. 
The GGEA enables Ghana’s e-Government Interoperability 
Framework (eGIF). The eGIF is a set of policies, technical standards, 
and guidelines covering ways to achieve interoperability of public-
sector data and information resources, ICT, and electronic business 
processes. It creates the ability for any MDA to join its information, 
ICT, or processes with those of any other using a predetermined 
framework based on open (that is, non-proprietary) international 
standards. eGIF will act as a foundation for the overall e-government 
strategy to ensure that government-wide systems are implemented 
in accordance with widely accepted policies, technical standards, 
and guidelines. MDAs and the public service adherence to the eGIF 
policies and specifications is mandatory.
46>>> Digital Services
With the improvement in broadband and mobile penetration, 
the adoption of e-services in Ghana is beginning to take root. 
NITA has developed the e-government portal (www.eservices.gov.
gh) that is designed to serve as a single service point – a one-stop 
shop – for the public for government digital services. The services 
available include forms to obtain a driver’s license, passport, online 
registration of taxpayer identification numbers, and others. Other 
services outside this one-stop shop, such as registration of births 
and death, company registration, criminal background check, 
fingerprint analysis, background check for job and visa applications, 
and marriage licenses, have digital applications. Upcoming 
digital platforms for identification, procurement, immigration, and 
parliamentary and judiciary services are expected to result in cost 
savings and transform the way government engages with citizens 
and businesses. Several private players have also entered the market 
as intermediaries for citizen to government (C2G) and government to 
citizen (G2C) payments using mobile money platforms, such as IT 
Consortium, Wirecard, and so on.
Ghana Single Window is a secure trade platform that facilitates 
the exchange of information between the GoG and the logistics 
and trading community, thus allowing Ghana’s digital government 
initiatives to be used extensively. Ghana Single Window was 
launched in 2002 and has been progressively updated and extended 
in line with international best practice. The platform reduces the need 
for data to be entered multiple times – instead it can be exchanged 
and reused electronically, achieving faster, more accurate results 
and improving the ease of compliance with Government of Ghana 
requirements. It is deployed and supported by Ghana Community 
Network Systems (GCNet). GCNet is a public-private partnership in 
which the government of Ghana holds a 38 percent shareholding. 
The following systems are integrated into the Ghana Single Window.Ghana has a digital business registry which makes the registration 
process less cumbersome. The digital portal used for registration 
is a public-private partnership supported by NITA and the Ministry 
of Finance. The digital business registry improves the efficiency of 
processing registration applications and the Registrar General’s 
Department (RGD) aims to complete processing applications within 
48 hours if the applicant meets all requirements. It makes business 
registration accessible to all firms irrespective of their location 
and eliminates the activities of middlemen who add friction to the 
business registration process while increasing the cost of doing 
business. The RGD has opened as fully automated offices in various 
locations across Ghana to decentralize the process of business 
registration and save time and resources for the many businesses 
who throng the department for registration. The digital portal is also 
integrated with the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) e-tax portal and 
the Tax Identification Number (TIN) is used as the linking identifier. 
In addition, a recent 2019 initiative by the Registrar General’s 
Department has established a requirement for all businesses to  
link a digital address code for their business to complete its 
registration process. 
This automation has led to substantial improvements for both 
businesses and government. GRA’s automation led to a substantial 
increase in automated business registrations (87,900 in 2015) and 
TIN registrations (425,305 in 2015). In addition, for the government, 
it meant an increase in tax revenue from 12 percent in 2009 to 
16.9 percent in 2015, and enhanced efficiency in tax collection. The 
RGD automation system led to similar improvements, including 
a consistent increase in registration of companies, an average 
15 percent year-over-year increase in the number of companies 
registered between 2014 and 2016. In addition, a consistent increase 
in efficiency and payment collection for registrations was recorded.
TradeNet Services e T ax Services eRegistrar Services
TradeNet permits the logistics 
community to exchange trade-
related documentation electronically 
with all agencies involved in trade-

A SAMPLE OF GHANA’S DIGITAL SERVICES
47TIn January 2012, NITA launched the Ghana Open Data Initiative 
(GODI). It created a central repository of datasets from 25 govern -
ment agencies including The Energy Commission, Ghana Statistical 
Service, and the Ministry of Finance. The 2011 Web Foundation fea -
sibility report indicated that the Government of Ghana had the po -
litical will to make information transparently available to its citizens. 
An Open Data Steering Committee was appointed to guide GODI in 
August 2012. It included representatives of the cabinet, NITA Board, 
Ministry of Communication, and civil society organizations (CSOs). 
Since 2018, NITA has embarked on a project to address GODI’s 
weaknesses. As of June 2019, the GODI platform hosted 90 datasets 
in open data formats from 11 agencies. Going forward, the MoC has 
submitted a new draft policy on data sharing to the cabinet that envi -
sions three phases: portal to receive datasets; building the ecosys -
tem around the use of the datasets (for example, hackathons); and 
training for MDAs on data and change management.
The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) is responsible for produc -
tion, management, and dissemination of national statistics in the 
country. In March 2018, GSS published the Ghana Statistics Devel -
opment Plan 2018-2022. It recognizes the need for Ghana’s official 
statistics to be the standard bearer for accuracy, consistency, and 
credibility of statistics in the country. In particular, this strategic plan 
seeks to address the underdevelopment of the administrative data 
system, such that more and better-quality data may be collected at 
lower cost, while simultaneously ensuring survey credibility. This will 
be particularly important to fulfill the reporting requirements of both 
national and international development program, such as the Ghana 
Shared Growth and Development Agenda, the African Union’s Agen -
da 2063, and the Sustainable Development Goals.
>>> Challenges
Nevertheless, a number of challenges exist that affect the gov -
ernment’s ability to operate digitally as a platform: 
Institutional setup. NITA as a key player in driving the digital trans -
formation of the public sector in Ghana is institutionally weak. It does 
not have sufficient institutional capacity nor funding for implemen -
tation of the ambitious digital government platforms that the gov -
ernment envisions. As a result, MDAs suffer from the chronic lack of 
connectivity, dysfunctional e-mail, websites, and other basic servic -
es that they expect from NITA. It is therefore paramount to invest in 
NITA’s capacity as well as its ability to ensure basic ICT functionality 
across MDAs in order to build trust in shared services, such as com -
mon servers and government cloud computing. This will take time 
and a significant increase in funding of the agency, as well as consis -
tent institutional, leadership, and human capacity building. In addi -
tion to empowering and enabling NITA, it is important to strengthen 
the coordination of digital initiatives from the center of government, 
for example, from the Office of the President, in order to set the tone 
for the MDAs.Digital ID. Even though 98 percent of Ghanaians have some sort of ID, 
Ghana currently has nine separate databases across various government 
and public entities and no unique property addressing scheme in place. 
The multiplicity of current ID systems, fueled by inefficiency and delays, 
is making it difficult for government agencies, businesses, and financial 
institutions to properly authenticate citizens and their data. This, in turn, 
is contributing to a high cost of doing electronic business in Ghana. The 
inefficient ID system is also challenging the government’s ability to offer 
targeted services and generate revenue. The government is currently 
working to remedy this situation by rolling out the Ghana Card program.
Back-office systems, interoperability, and shared systems. While 
payroll and Hyperion are mature systems, HRMIS and GIFMIS are still 
ongoing projects, largely because their development began more 
recently. Although their rollout has been progressing reasonably well, it 
will take several more years to complete. The main challenges include 
change management and continuous capacity building. Capacity is 
an ongoing challenge even for the use of the mature systems, leading 
to an overreliance on consultants for every minor upgrade. As for the 
shared systems, the key challenge is the lack of trust of the MDAs in 
NITA’s capacity to deliver quality shared services. In order to build that 
trust, the investment in NITA and gradual demonstration effects of the 
agency’s ability to deliver will be critical. 
Digital service delivery. Digital platforms for the national  
identification card, digital address system, e-procurement, 
e-immigration, and e-parliamentary and e-judiciary services are 
currently being built, some with the support of the eTransform 
project. Upon completion, they are expected to bring efficiency and 
transform the way in which the government engages with citizens and 
businesses. However, trust in e-services offered by the government 
is generally low and the majority of the Ghanaian society is not even 
aware that e-government services exist (World Bank 2018b). At the 
time of drafting, the online e-service portal was down as NITA’s 
servers were undergoing an upgrade. In sum, while many of the 
building blocks for digital services are in place, they are not always 
well connected and have not yet produced the expected outcome 
for citizen. The main issue seems to be the insufficient user-centricity 
in development of the digital services and government platforms in 
general. A change in thinking and the adoption of a more citizen-
centric approach will be required to overcome this challenge.
Open data. Contrary to what is specified in the terms of use of the 
GODI website, there is no open data license attached to government-
produced datasets. This means that not all of the content available 
through data.gov.gh is legally “open” according to international 
standards, which would allow commercial and noncommercial 
exploitation and redistribution without restitution. Further, available 
datasets are largely outdated and some are in nonmachine-readable 
formats. There is no data collection procedure in place between MDA 
focal points and GODI, and data officers collect datasets from each MDA 
separately. As a result, GODI has not fully met its primary objectives.>>> Open Data 
48>> Private Sector Platforms
Private digital platforms can create multiple opportunities to 
engage in trade and development, but policy concerns arise too. 
UNCTAD states that economic policies and regulations will need to 
maximize the benefits while at the same time minimizing the costs of 
digital platforms (UNCTAD 2019).
• Benefits: Efficiency gains, reduced information asymmetries 
supported by rating systems, lower consumer prices, increased 
market access, more competition, and better use of underutilized 
resources and increased flexibility for the providers of services. 
• Growing concerns: rising market power of super platforms and 
the related implications for competition, data protection and 
ownership, consumer protection, and taxation and employment 
policies. 
Private digital platforms include nonprofit and profit-oriented 
approaches. This section will focus on digital commerce platforms 
and digital labor platforms that facilitate the sharing economy.
>>> Domestic Private Platforms
Ghana ranks as the third country in Africa with the most private 
digital platforms operating, after Nigeria and South Africa (see 
figure 2.3). In Nigeria, 94 digital platforms operate, in South Africa 
91, followed by Ghana with 72 platforms. Out of 72 private digital 
platforms operating in the country, 42 percent developed locally 
(domestic platforms listed in appendix C). In comparison, in Nigeria, 
73 percent of private digital platforms operating are African, with 
59 percent in South Africa, and 56 percent in Ghana. Private digital 
platforms are comparatively young in Ghana, with 83 percent of 
them launched less than five years ago (Insight2Impact 2019).
Although super platforms are utilized locally, they do not displace 
the opportunity to develop and use innovative local platforms. 
For example, Uber started operations in Ghana in 2016, growing 
the market for such service but charging a significant commission 
per ride (20-25 percent). Drivers’ dissatisfaction became a business 
opportunity, and in 2017, Uru and Dropping, local endeavors, 
launched different business models, eliminating surge charges, and 
charging a fixed low-booking fee per trip, respectively.
Digital platforms in Ghana are transforming the provision of 
services. Retail, transportation, and accommodation are the services 
to which private digital platforms facilitate access in Ghana.

>>> Digital CommerceIn Ghana, microwork11 platforms are a source of job creation. 
It is estimated that 1 percent of Internet users in the country are 
microwork users (see table 2.6), almost reaching 80,000 in 2017 
(Research ICT Africa 2017). Considering that digital workers could 
make up more than 10 percent of the labor force of Africa by  
2030 (Mastercard Foundation 2019), such types of work requires 
attention considering the working-age population and Internet use 
rapidly growing. In Ghana, microwork platforms are mainly used by women and 
young people, while contributing to poverty alleviation in rural 
areas. Remarkably, in the country, microwork platforms are used 
more by women than men, of which 56 percent have a secondary 
school certificate, and almost 60 percent were unemployed 
(Research ICT Africa 2017). In the country, there are 19 microwork 
platforms in use, such as 15ghana.com and freelancer.com, 
through which local talent is satisfying local and global demand 
(Insight2Impact 2019).
Digital commerce is growing, positioning Ghana as the sixth 
country in Africa in business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce in 
2018, climbing six positions from its 2017 ranking (UNCTAD 2018 
and 2019). Online shoppers grew from three percent in 2018 to 
7.8 percent in 2019 (DataReportal 2019). Even when 54 percent of 
mobile connections are still from basic and feature phones (GSMA 
2018a), a double-digit growth rate in mobile Internet penetration is an 
opportunity to increase digital commerce. In addition, 64.9 percent 
of firms interact with clients or suppliers using e-mail.
B2C commerce in the country is growing at a fast pace, increasing 
from $30 million to $90 million between 2009 and 2012. At the 
continental level, the B2C market in Africa was worth about $5.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, estimates reveal that by 2030, digital commerce 
will total $500 billion, which is equivalent to 10 percent of expected 
continental gross domestic product (Mastercard Foundation 2019). 
At the continental level, African platforms are preferred to 
non-African Platforms. The availability of African marketplaces is 
broadening access to local products and services (see box 2.1) with 
49 percent of African online users shopping solely domestically, 
compared to the 6 percent of shoppers that buy only from 
crossborder platforms (PayPal 2016). Even so, social platforms, such 
as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, are becoming popular as 
online marketing and advertising tools in the country. TABLE 2.6.

DIGITAL COMMERCE RANKINGS, SELECTED AFRICAN COUNTRIES
52Jumia was founded in 2012 in Nigeria by two locals and two 
ex-McKinsey consultants. Today the company is known as the 
African Amazon. To thrive digital commerce in the continent, the 
company tackled Africa’s digital commerce challenges: 
• Addressing – Jumia partnered with over 100 thousand 
logistic partners.
• Payment – Besides cash on delivery option, the company 
developed JumiaPay to facilitate online and mobile 
payments, covering 54 percent of transactions in 2018. 
• African offering – to attract local consumers, the platform 
partnered with African SMEs to offer products and services 
through its marketplace.According to the company, after seven years of operations,  
they achieved (Jumia, 2019a):
• E-commerce operations in 14 African countries
• 1.2 billion consumers and 17 million SMEs to serve 
across Africa
• Over 700 million visits to their marketplace in 2018
• One transaction or lead every two seconds
• 81 thousand active local SME sellers on the platform
• Over 29 million products, hotels, restaurants, and other 
services listed
In April 2019, Jumia went public on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) and raised $196 million in net proceeds. The 
share price, was initially offered at $14.50; on June 10, 2019, the 
share price was $24.88 (Jumia, 2019b).
• Listing of firms – To facilitate Ghanaian firms to be contacted online based on their business classification, the National 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP) is providing support to 10,000 businesses with a full directory, product 
images, and brief videos. Such contents are part of the listing diffused at Ghana Online Mall (https:/ /ghanaonlinemall.com), a 
private digital platform.
• Digital Marketing – To stimulate the use of social media to market products and services online, the National Youth 
Authority (NYA), in partnership with the Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT, launched the e-Marketing and Digital Media 
Entrepreneurship Training Program, which in its first edition trained 2,900 young adults during three months throughout ten 
centers around the country.
• Digital Commerce – Made in Ghana Mall (https:/ /madeinghanamall.com) is a NEIP Initiative to position a secure online 
marketplace for authentic made-in-Ghana products that can be delivered globally by using DHL international services. This 
domestic e-mall provides a tool for Ghanaian companies to showcase their products for free.BOX 2.1.

TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO INCREASE ONLINE PRESENCE OF GHANAIAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
53Institutional coordination. Work on digital commerce and the 
collaborative economy spans different ministries, departments and 
agencies, often with parallel and overlapping activities. This need 
for coordination includes dialogue with other relevant stakeholders, 
including the private sector, social entities, and customer groups.
Digital gap. There is a lack of information regarding digital 
commerce in the country, which narrows the understanding of 
challenges and opportunities, and limits monitoring of efforts taken. 
The large population is not benefitting from digital commerce or 
the collaborative economy since only 35 percent of the people are 
Internet users, and on digital skills the country ranks 76th (out of 139 
countries) and 11th among 34 Sub-Saharan countries. If not properly 
addressed, the digital gap may increase economic inequalities 
among people.
Platform diffusion. Usage and development of private digital 
platforms in Ghana is growing but diffusion remains low, mainly 
because of low Internet user penetration (35 percent) and a low 
percentage of people doing online transactions (7.8 percent). 
Economic benefits of microwork are limited since only one percent 
of the population aged 15 and older are taking advantage of 
these platforms.
B2C and B2B are lagging. Ghana ranks 92nd in B2C transactions 
(WEF 2016). In Africa, B2C accounts for only one percent of retail 
sales, while the B2C share of global retail sales accounts for 10.2 
percent with a total value of $2.4 trillion (eMarketer 2017). Ghana 
ranks 99th in B2B transactions (WEF 2016), while only 28 percent of 
domestic firms have a website (World Bank 2017a). Considering that 
B2B typically represents 75 percent of digital commerce, this type of 
interaction needs attention to increase digital trade.
MSME digital maturity. There is no data at country level, but at the 
continental level, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) 
identify as their main bottlenecks to engage in digital commerce: 
that their products are not suitable, their technical knowledge, 
their business knowledge, and logistics costs (Mastercard 
Foundation 2019).>>> Challenges
However, there are challenges and risks for the uprising of the platform economy in Ghana, which can be summarized as follows:
Buildup of reputation ratings. The hiring of workers in microwork 
platforms and buying products or services to new small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) is mainly based on evidence, such as previous 
client testimonials, making it difficult for new entrants to digital 
platforms or to shift to another platform.
Data security and lack of trust. Shoppers in Africa are most likely to 
see data security as a barrier to shopping online in their own country 
(PayPal 2016). GSMA has estimated that as much as 85 percent of 
e-commerce transactions in Africa are “payment on delivery,” a sign 
of a low-trust environment in which the buyer will only part with 
payment on evidence of delivery.
Standards compliance. The delivery of high-quality and standardized 
products and services to local and international markets is critical 
to support rapid economic transformation underpinned by strong 
growth of manufacturing. Reaching these high standards of products 
and services demanded by global trading partners and customers is 
a challenge for most Ghanaian companies.
Logistics. Ghana ranks 76th on the Integrated Index for Postal 
Development, which measures performance of countries at four 
dimensions: reliability, reach, relevance, and resilience (UPU 2018). 
The National Digital Property Addressing system brings a digital 
solution to mitigate difficulties but addressing in some parts of the 
country is still a challenge. In addition, package delivery solutions 
and logistic hubs can continue to improve delivery performance.
Tax policies. According to UNCTAD, governments should endeavor 
to strike a balance between ease of collection and fairness, and to 
be neutral with regard to different sectors of the economy. As such, 
care must be taken to avoid unintended consequences arising from 
tax policies on entrepreneurs, small businesses and the poorest 
members of society.
Risks for workers. There is global concern around the collaborative 
economy regarding potential harmful labor practices. Risks include 
poor pay, long working hours, and the lack of social protection 
for workers.
54>> Enabling Conditions to Create Platforms
The Government of Ghana has embarked on a reform agenda 
to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework for 
standardization and National Quality Infrastructure (NQI).12 
Upgrading NQI is being led by the Ghana Standards Authority 
(GSA) and the goal is to support companies to adopt appropriate 
production technologies and improved processes to ensure that all 
goods and services for international and domestic markets meet the 
required quality, environmental, and health and safety standards. 
GSA faces a number of constraints limiting its capacity to 
implement its strategic plan and meaningfully contribute to key 
industrialization development and diversification programs. These 
include inadequate laboratory equipment, servicing and repair, 
inadequate provision of laboratory and office space, and insufficient 
training of GSA staff in metrology and certification of products and 
systems. One of the most critical shortcomings in the NQI system is 
the absence of a demand assessment for QI (Quality Infrastructure) 
services. This is needed so that the system can prioritize QI services, 
improving efficacy and efficiency in the utilization of public resources.
Ghana has recognized the power of data generated by digital 
platforms and the need to ensure that consumers have adequate 
control over their data. The data protection act was adopted in 2012, 
and officially launched the act in November 2014, to protect the 
privacy of consumers and personal data by regulating the processing 
of personal information. The act established a Data Protection 
Commission (DPC) whose mandate is to protect the privacy of the 
individual and personal data by regulating the processing of personal 
information.. In late 2018, the government established a Cyber 
Security Center and is in the process of developing a cybersecurity 
strategy and capacity to address the challenge of cybercrime. 
Ghana’s cybersecurity ecosystem protects individual rights and 
privacy as well as general economic interests, as described in the 
Digital Infrastructure section, is in its early stages.
The effective implementation of data protection in Ghana has 
been affected by (i) lack of public sector commitment, (ii) financial 
challenges, (iii) lack of in-country data protection expertise, and (iv) 
enforcement challenges. In turn, there is limited awareness of the 
existence of DPC and of obligations of data controllers with low 
appreciation of data security issues and citizens’ rights. After long delays, in March 2019 the Ghanaian Parliament passed 
into law the Right to Information (RTI) Bill to allow citizens 
access information.13 It provides for the operationalization of the 
constitutional right to information from public and some private 
institutions, subject to exemptions that are necessary and consistent 
with the protection of the public interest in a democratic society. It 
also seeks to foster a culture of transparency and accountability in 
public affairs and to provide for related matters. On July 20, 2017, 
while delivering the keynote address at the Africa Open Data 
Conference held in Accra, the President affirmed that his government 
would ensure the passage of the bill to “encourage citizens to hold 
the government accountable and ensure greater transparency.” 
The Research Department of Parliament has estimated that the 
implementation of the Right to Information in Ghana will cost ₵750 
million (about $140 million) over the next five years. The report which 
was compiled in 2017 indicated that the cost will revolve around the 
setting up of an RTI Commission.
The full potential of public data as a raw material for innovation 
and improved services is largely untapped in Ghana. The African 
Development Bank estimates that the economic potential of open 
data to Africa could equate to roughly 1–2 percent of the region’s 
GDP, with significant opportunities to be gained for the region in the 
agriculture sector, in public procurement, and in geospatial data, 
and there is far greater upside potential than downside risk. Ghana’s 
national program has been suffering from a lack of investment and 
oversight since its launch in 2012. Although several hackathons have 
been held to encourage the public to use the data, the current supply 
of 90 datasets from 11 agencies (in energy, agriculture, education, 
and health) is far from meeting the strong and growing demand for 
government data. 
55RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
Strengthen NITA to facilitate the citizen-centric development of public sector digital platforms
NITA is a key player both as a service provider for MDAs and as an institutional anchor for the development of public sector 
digital platforms. As such, it requires both a significant boost in financing as well as a serious investment in its institutional, 
technical, human, and leadership capacity. The lack of trust in NITA’s ability to provide services to MDAs is a bottleneck for 
the development of shared services and for utilizing the existing preconditions for interoperability. Change management 
strategies will also be required to shift NITA’s approach to a more user-centric one, where the development of G2C and 
G2B, but also G2G services is thought about from the point of view of the end-user.
Prioritize the rollout of digital ID to enable access to digital services
The rollout of the Ghana Card program will lift the key constraints both on citizens’ access to digital services as well 
as increase their efficiency and effectiveness. At the same time, to truly maximize the citizens’ use of digital services, 
the rollout of the digital ID must go hand-in-hand with upgrade of NITA servers and an information and communication 
campaign to encourage their usage.
Emphasize public sector digital capacity building
The ability of the Ghanaian public sector to capitalize on digital back-office systems, shared services, and to provide digital 
services to citizens critically depends on the ongoing development of digital capacity among civil servants. The current 
situation suffers from very thin in-house capacity and an overreliance on contractors for ongoing upgrades. Building a 
cadre of government ICT professionals who work together with other technical specialists will increase the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the existing digital government platforms and their further development. This includes better change 
management to increase trust in digital platforms.
Strengthen protection of Ghanaians’ data 
There is a need to strengthen data protection expertise with international knowledge sharing activities on international 
good practices on data protection. The government’s commitment to protect Ghanaians’ personal data should warrant 
DPC’s independence with own financial and logistic allocations to increase the operational capacity for awareness raising 
activities, investigations, and enforcement. 
Revamp and enhance GODI to maximize social and economic value of public data 
The adoption of a proper licensing regime for GODI would be the first quick-win step from the open data policy-making 
perspective. An open data policy serves the government users of Ghana and other “supply-side” organizations, and 
citizens and private sector consumers. Open data needs to provide policy guidance, instructions, requirements, and tools 
for implementing open data effectively in Ghana. The policy would need to spell out which types of data may not be 
considered open and why, and how to safeguard sensitive information. It may also enhance the governance of the GODI, 
describe interagency working groups and provide points of contact. The GSS must also venture into new territories and 
explore the potential role that big and open data could play in the development and dissemination of official statistics.
Develop a coordinated digital commerce support program
Build on a multiagency coordinated action plan, with a multistakeholder approach with a clear champion. The program 
should take advantage of ongoing local government efforts (such as NYA and NEIP), regional efforts (such as the Nairobi 
Manifesto on the Digital Economy and Inclusive Development in Africa (UNCTAD 2018) and private digital platforms 
(domestic and regional) to increase crossborder market (such as Jumia). Actions need to go beyond online advertising and 
move towards facilitating individuals and MSMEs (urban and rural) to complete digital commerce transactions to increase 
B2C and B2B in the country; and, build online reputation for individuals, MSMES, and the country itself. Domestic efforts 
regarding training, rural coverage, logistics, and building trust in domestic commerce could benefit from lessons learned 
from international experiences, especially the Taobao Villages case (see box 2.3).DP.R1

56Institutionalize data production and availability for evidence-based digital commerce policies 
Collecting data to monitor digital commerce and the collaborative economy is fundamental to define and assess policy 
actions and to measure the digital economy. Ghana needs to conduct enterprise surveys with special attention on innovation 
and technology (the most recent survey took place in 2013). To determine what questions and topics to include in surveys, 
the Ghana Statistical Service can review UNCTAD’s “Questionnaire for Official Statistics on the ICT sector, and ICT use by 
enterprises”14 and the variables collected by Eurostat regarding ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises. Surveys should 
be conducted every two years to maintain the relevance of the data collected. Given global efforts on standardization for 
digital commerce data, this recommendation focuses on bridging Ghana’s data gap on digital commerce and is intrinsically 
linked to the forth recommendation in Digital Entrepreneurship (R4) on a digital economy observatory. 
Establish a regulatory sandbox for digital commerce and microwork economy labor regulations 
Whether and how to regulate these topics are an ongoing discussion globally with no consensus on which is the better 
regulatory framework to adopt. A regulatory sandbox could provide a safe space to test innovative approaches in 
collaboration with the private sector and without damping the benefits of the digital economy. Topics could cover pay 
conditions, competition, tax regime, data protection, among others. DP.R7.

China leverages e-commerce to create a sustainable business model in a rural area. 
• Taobao Village is a typical example of online retail in rural areas, that sell local featured products, such as clothes, shoes, apples, 
and rice (AliResearch 2017).
• Its annual sales are over Y 10 million (about $1.5 million), even though some merchants sell over Y 1 million (about $150 million). 
• At least 10 percent of village households actively engage in e-commerce or at least 100 active online shops operated by 
villagers, primarily with the use of Taobao.com and Tmall.com
• The number of Taobao Villages increased from 20 in 2013 to 3,202 in 2018 (World Bank 2019b).
Recognizing the opportunity, the Alibaba Group and local governments deployed training and infrastructure development 
“packages” to involve poor rural communities in e-commerce. 
Ongoing research indicates that e-commerce is creating new opportunities for people, including for the less advantaged and those 
living in remote areas. BOX 2.3.

IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES
Digital financial services (DFS) offer a more convenient, secure 
and efficient way for people, businesses, and governments to 
access a range of financial products and services. Given their 
potential to enhance efficiencies and expand access to financial 
services, DFS are increasingly viewed as central to the health and 
development of a country’s economy. Digital financial services can 
encompass a range of payments use cases (for example, retail 
payments, person-to-person payments, government payments, 
bill payments, remittances), as well as other products and services, 
such as credit, savings, and insurance. The products and services 
available to users are facilitated by modern financial services infrastructure that can include credit bureaus, collateral registries, 
automated teller machines, point-of-sale devices, agent networks, 
Internet and mobile phone penetration. Innovation in DFS and the 
enabling infrastructure that supports it have expanded the types 
of providers offering financial services beyond traditional financial 
institutions, including mobile network operators (MNOs), financial 
technology firms (fintechs) and big tech platforms (for example, 
Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook). By breaking down barriers to 
entry in the financial services industry, DFS can drive value for users 
and increase financial inclusion. Appendix A includes detailed data 
on DFS performance. 2.3 Digital Financial Services
57Recognizing the importance of catalyzing greater innovation in 
and adoption of DFS, the Government of Ghana has adopted a 
National Financial Inclusion and Development Strategy (NFIDS) 
2017‐2023. Cocreated with the World Bank, this new strategy 
outlines a series of reforms to increase financial inclusion from 58 
percent in 2015 to 75 percent in 2023. The reforms are structured 
around five mutually reinforcing priority areas or pillars of financial 
sector development: (i) Financial Stability; (ii) Access, Quality, and 
Usage of Financial Services; (iii) Financial Infrastructure; (iv) Financial 
Consumer Protection; and (v) Financial Capability (World Bank 
2018c). The NFIDS commits the government to priorities that will 
serve as important steps towards achieving the World Bank’s DE4A 
Initiative objectives: Universal Access to Digital Financial Services, 
and creating the Africa-wide payments infrastructure 2030 are 
aligned with the NFIDS objectives. The DE4A Initiative will strengthen 
and complement the operations deployed under this new strategy, 
helping the Government of Ghana achieving its objectives of financial 
inclusion through leveraging the advantages and opportunities of 
digital technologies. DFS has the potential to make formal financial 
services more accessible and less costly, promoting efficiency and 
offering both the private sector and government several benefits in 
revenue collection and stimulating entrepreneurship growth. 
Complementing the NFIDS, the Government of Ghana is working 
concurrently on a National Digital Financial Services Policy, which 
is currently being drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank 
of Ghana. The DFS policy is expected to outline the government’s 
vision for the country moving into the next decade, including that (i) 
a majority of Ghanaians will have secure access to a broad range of 
suitable and affordable digital financial services, and (ii) business and 
government will have achieved greater transparency and efficiency 
to contribute to the equitable economic growth of the nation.
The DE4A initiative is equally aligned with the government’s 
Coordinated Program of Economic and Social Development 
Policies (2017‐2024), especially with the priority of moving the 
country away from cash and towards electronic payments. The 
policies also outline other priorities for the financial sector, such 
as the need to undertake reforms that deepen financial markets, 
promote financial inclusion, and enhance the supervision and 
regulation of financial institutions.Ghana was relatively early to issue branchless banking guidelines 
in 2008, which were intended to set the stage for the development 
of a digital financial services ecosystem in the country. However, 
several well-intentioned provisions in the guidelines were widely 
seen as hampering provider investment in new products and services 
such as mobile money. Recognizing these challenges, the BoG 
issued revised agent and e-money guidelines in 2015, which have 
been hailed by banks, mobile network operators, GSMA, the Ghana 
Telecoms Chamber, and others in the industry as a best practice 
policy framework for digital financial services. Most importantly, 
the new rules permit nonbanks to be directly licensed by the Bank 
of Ghana, allowing them to own and run e-money businesses and 
create an open and level playing field for various types of digital 
financial services providers (CGAP 2018a).
Since the adoption of the 2015 guidelines, the Government 
of Ghana has taken further steps to foster an inclusive digital 
financial system through the passage of the Payment Systems 
and Services Act in 2019. This new act, while still awaiting signature 
by the President, sets the stage for further competition and 
innovation by formalizing the licensing process for and opening the 
nation’s financial infrastructure to fintechs, which have proliferated 
in recent years and are driving the development of new use cases 
and enhanced user experiences. This represents an unprecedented 
opportunity to expand the adoption and use of digital financial 
services. 
In addition to an enabling regulatory environment, Ghana has 
already deployed the necessary infrastructure to promote 
digital payments. Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement 
Systems (GhIPSS), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana 
(BoG), provides the backbone of the country’s digital payments 
infrastructure. GhIPSS facilitates interbank transfers, automated 
teller machine (ATM) networks, domestic card payments, automated 
clearing house (ACH), and mobile money interoperability.DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS: CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES
581. Gh-link™ switches and clears all transfers and facilitates net 
settlement in the BoG RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) for 
ATM networks, domestic card payments, interbank transfers 
and interoperable transfers between mobile money providers 
and financial institutions. Importantly, financial institutions and 
mobile money providers are the only participants in Gh-link, 
with fintechs currently not connected to the switch. Gh-link also 
includes GhIPSS Instant Pay (GIP), which allows payments to be 
sent instantly between accounts at different financial institutions 
using channels such as Internet banking, mobile, ATM, POS or 
tellers. For the moment, GIP participation is limited only to banks 
– mobile money providers and fintechs not participants.
2. E-Zwich is the brand name for the National Switch and Smart 
card payment system. The E-Zwich system consists of a 
biometric smart card (E-Zwich card) that acts as a digital wallet 
for cardholders and switch that allows for cash-in/cash-out at 
branches, ATMs, and agents of participating financial institutions. 
The payment system was initially introduced in 2008 (before 
the advent of mobile money) as a way to interconnect financial 
institutions and provide an alternative to foreign card schemes 
that would also be accessible by smaller, rural banks. Smart 
card holders can transfer funds between E-Zwich cards and 
accounts at these institutions and can use the cards to make 
purchases at merchant locations with E-Zwich-enabled POS 
devices. The cards are issued by participating banks. 
3. Ghana Automated Clearing House. GACH can be used to 
handle bulk or single electronic credit and debit of funds 
and does not require scanned documentation. There are two  
types of ACH transfers, namely ACH Direct Credit and ACH 
Direct Debit.15With support from the World Bank’s e-Ghana Project, Ghana has 
also rolled out a new Ghana E-Payment Portal (GEPP),16 which is 
designed to facilitate electronic payment for government services 
by citizens, businesses, and other entities conducting business with 
the GoG. The e-Payment Portal accepts a range of payment options, 
including card payments, mobile money, and bank transfer. Available 
services include payment of fixed fees, tangible goods, and services 
payments. Payments for taxes are also supported.17
Nevertheless, Ghana has made substantial progress on financial 
inclusion, due in large part to growth in digital financial services. 
According to the World Bank’s Global Findex, the share of Ghanaian 
adults (age 15+) with a formal financial account increased by 42 
percent between 2014 and 2015. As a result, nearly 6 in 10 adults 
had formal access in 2017. The percentage of adults with an account 
(by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another 
type of financial institution or who had used a mobile money service 
increased from 41 percent in 2014 to 58 percent in 2017. The number 
of adults who made or received a digital payment in the past year 
increased from 25 percent in 2014 to 49 percent in 2017 (Findex 2017). 
The percentage of Ghanaians with an account at a formal financial 
institution (bank or Nonbank financial institution, NBFI) grew by 
22 percent between 2014 and 2017, while mobile money account 
ownership increased by nearly 200 percent over the same time period 
(see figure 2.4). Thanks largely to this dramatic rise in mobile money 
account ownership, the majority of Ghanaians (58 percent) are now 
financially included – a 42 percent increase over 2014 (Findex 2017).
With mobile account ownership on the rise, mobile money has 
become the preferred payment alternative to cash when measured 
in terms of transaction volumes. Cheques remain the dominant 
cash alternative for higher-value payments, but statistics indicate that 
mobile payments are not far behind (see figure 2.4). While card-based 
payments, including E-Zwich, have not witnessed the same level of 
adoption because of the ongoing scarcity of POS terminals at merchant 
locations, these channels have also grown in usage over recent years.

60The increase in E-Zwich card transaction volumes and number 
of cards is largely the result of a government decision to digitize 
G2P payment streams such as the Livelihood Empowerment 
Against Poverty (LEAP) social transfer program and government 
employee salaries using the cards. However, use of the card 
beyond receiving payments remains relatively low, as indicated by 
low average account balances. Limited merchant acceptance and 
cash-out points mean that most recipients simply withdraw their 
funds upon receipt, thus limiting the potential for these cards to 
contribute to broader digital payments usage (BTCA 2017).
Importantly, the increasing popularity of mobile accounts has also 
facilitated a rise in digital financial services beyond payments. 
Mobile money increasingly serves as the rails for a range of bank and 
fintech products and services, including savings accounts, pensions, 
credit, remittances and even investment products such as treasury 
bills. In some cases, these services are offered in direct partnership 
with mobile money providers and can be accessed directly on the 
provider’s Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) menu, 
while in other cases they are offered as over-the-top (OTT) services 
that leverage mobile money as a payments channel.
Moving forward, the Government of Ghana has embarked on 
an ambitious digitization agenda that bodes well for ongoing 
innovation in, and adoption of, digital financial services. The roll 
out of a new biometric national identity card (the Ghana Card) and 
digital addressing system (Ghana Post GPS) will offer additional 
pieces of market-level infrastructure that can support a more robust 
DFS ecosystem. Examples of how this new digital infrastructure can 
be leveraged to support greater financial inclusion include digital 
know-your-customer (KYC) utilities (CGAP 2018c), data sharing 
utilities, and a more inclusive digital payments ecosystem that 
allows for greater competition between providers and drives greater 
value for customers.
>>  Mobile Money
Expansion of agent banking as a delivery channel for financial 
services. Following the adoption of the 2015 E-Money Issuers (EMI) 
guidelines, there was an explosion in provider investments in agent 
networks (see figure 2.6). These investments in crucial cash in/cash 
out points are widely seen as a prerequisite for greater adoption of 
mobile money, and this is borne out by payments system statistics 
that show the number of active accounts and transaction volumes 
increasing alongside the number of active agents in the country (see 
figure 2.6).

VOLUME AND VALUE OF MM INTEROPERABILITY, 2018Thanks to its decision to invest aggressively in agent networks even 
before the adoption of the 2015 guidelines, MTN Ghana has emerged 
as the main player in the mobile money space with approximately 75 
percent of the country’s active accounts in 2017. Questions remain 
regarding the impact of MTN’s dominance on competition in the 
space, even as a range of new players, products, and services enter 
the market to challenge MTN’s position (CGAP 2018a).
Another factor driving mobile money adoption is widespread 
mobile phone ownership and network coverage. The most recent 
data available shows that 87 percent of Ghanaians were covered 
by a mobile network in 2016 (WEF 2016b). In 2017, 67 percent of 
Ghanaians owned a mobile phone, which indicates some room for 
additional growth as this stands well above the 39 percent mobile 
money account ownership. At the same time, smartphone ownership 
remains relatively low, at just 27 percent in 2017 (GSMA 2017). Given 
the importance of smartphones as a channel for fintechs and over-
the-top (OTT) products and services, future increases in smartphone 
penetration may also lead to greater competition, innovation and 
customer choice. 
One of the most important factors behind mobile money 
adoption has been an enabling regulatory environment created 
by the government’s release of the 2015 EMI guidelines. These 
regulations include a number of best practices, including mandating 
that mobile money providers pass the interest earned on float along 
to customers (pass-through interest), which has increased the 
attractiveness of money wallets as stores of value rather than just 
transaction accounts. Furthermore, the guidelines stipulated that 
mobile money accounts would be included in the country’s deposit 
protection scheme, while also featuring less stringent KYC (Know 
Your Customer) requirements (tiered-KYC) – thus making it safer and 
easier for excluded customers to open an account (CGAP 2018c). With many of the necessary pieces of an inclusive digital 
payments ecosystem in place, the government’s recently 
mandated Mobile Money Interoperability (MMI) offers a further 
opportunity for growth. Interoperability refers to the ability of 
mobile money providers to interconnect with each other, and it is 
commonly assumed that this ability to transact across provider 
networks provides additional value to consumers by removing 
barriers to person-to-person (P2P) payments, merchant payments, 
and more. In May 2018, the BoG mandated that all mobile money 
providers connect to GHLink, with full interoperability between 
mobile money providers and banks introduced in December 2018. 
This arrangement allows for the seamless movement of funds 
between and among mobile money, bank, and E-Zwich accounts.
Despite this robust electronic payment infrastructure, Ghana 
remains a cash-based economy. 98.72 percent of payments by 
volume are still in cash and the main noncash instrument continues 
to be checks. The current extensive use of cash in Ghana among 
individuals results from (i) the high cost of digital payments that is 
often passed on to users (that is, charging customers a fee to use 
credit cards or mobile money); (ii) trust issues with using digital 
payments, and (iii) the low penetration of debit and credit cards and 
low availability of POS devices at merchant points (BTCA 2017). 
Still, additional challenges remain. Without business rules in 
place to govern pricing and other aspects of the scheme, many 
providers have effectively discouraged their customers from 
sending money off-net by increasing the fees for these transactions. 
As a result, interoperable transactions remain just a fraction of 
overall transactions (see table 2.7). Additionally, fintechs are not 
yet connected to GHLink and there are no clear rules governing 
participation in the scheme (BTCA 2017). 
Payment aggregators represent yet another key piece of Ghana’s 
mobile money ecosystem. At a basic level, all aggregators do two 
things: Integration, where they connect the systems of payment 
instrument providers to third party systems; and value-added 
services (VAS), like notification of successful payments, reconciliation, 
and receipts (CAGP 2019). It is quite difficult for utilities and other 
service providers to integrate directly with each MM provider – 
instead they go through aggregators, which saves them the work of connecting to each provider API (and saves the MNOs the time of 
providing support to each service provider to use their APIs). Through 
these bilateral integrations, digital payment providers are able to 
offer a broad range of innovative solutions, such as; digital savings 
accounts, where money can be moved back and forth between a 
mobile wallet and an account at a bank, insurance products, credit 
products, and more.
63 FIGURE 2.7. 
FINANCIAL INCLUSION BY ACCOUNT TYPE 2014 VS 2017PER PAYMENT INSTRUMENT 2017Overall, the success of mobile money in Ghana has not only 
contributed to greater account ownership, but also to a broad 
transformation in how Ghanaians pay for goods and services and 
access financial services. This transformation is highlighted by 
mobile money’s contribution to overall account ownership, in which 
15 percent of Ghanaians are included by mobile money alone, while 
another 24 percent have both a mobile money account and some 
other form of formal financial institution account (bank or NBFI) (see 
figure 2.7). Furthermore, given the availability of formal savings/
credit products offered in partnership with mobile money providers, 
it may be reasonable to assume that some of the significant increase 
in individuals who have both a mobile and financial institution 
account points to mobile money having a role in expanding access 
to bank and NBFI services. Findex finds that of those with a financial 
institution account, 29 percent used a mobile phone or the Internet 
to access their account in the past year. In fact, there is evidence that 
DFS such as mobile money has already made a strong contribution 
to increases in financial inclusion in Ghana.As adoption of mobile money continues to grow, its impact is 
also being felt throughout the country’s economy. For example, 
rural use of mobile money is on the rise, with 35 percent of adults 
in rural areas reporting that they had used a mobile money service 
in 2017 (up from 12 percent in 2014) (see figure 2.8). This has also 
had an impact on the agriculture sector, illustrated by an increase in 
the number of adults who have received a payment for agricultural 
products (9 percent in 2017 versus 1 percent in 2014) (Findex 2017). 
Still, the persistent gap in account penetration between rural and 
urban areas suggests that action could be taken to stimulate uptake. 
Mobile network coverage continues to be weakest in rural areas, 
where the economics of establishing towers remain challenging 
(GSMA 2017). Expanding network coverage in rural areas could offer 
a means towards driving greater adoption. Furthermore, given the 
importance of agriculture to Ghana’s rural economy – it contributes 
nearly 20 percent to GDP (World Bank 2017c) – digitization of 
payments in agricultural value chains could also contribute to higher 
usage among rural populations.

64There is also evidence that the financial inclusion impact of mobile 
money has accrued to both women and low-income households. 
An analysis of Findex data suggests that of the increase in mobile 
money account use between 2014 and 2017, about 43 percent of 
new users were women. However, women’s use of mobile money 
continues to lag behind that of men, with 34 percent of women 
reporting having used mobile money compared to 44 percent of 
men. While use among the poor has also increased, a similar gap 
between rich and poor Ghanaians remains: 32 percent of the poorest 
40 percent used mobile money compared to 42 percent among the 
country’s richest 60 percent. The most common mobile money transactions in Ghana are 
the transfer of value from one person to another person (P2P), 
payment of goods and services such as buying airtime, paying for 
utility bills, and digital satellite television (DSTV) bills, salaries of 
some workers, taxi fares, microcredit, savings and microinsurance 
(Findex 2017). Since 2014 the percentage of adults paying utility 
bills (water, electricity or trash collection) using a mobile phone 
increased from 2 percent to 8 percent (see figure 2.9). In terms of 
wages, in 2017, 7 percent of adults received their wages through a 
mobile phone, a substantial increase since 2014, when only 1 percent 
of adults received their wages through a mobile phone. However, 
the main driver of mobile money use continues to be P2P, with 43 
percent of adults reporting that they had either sent or received 
domestic remittances via mobile phone (Findex 2017). Source: Global Findex10% 0% 30% 50% 20% 40%

65Despite the increasing diversity of use cases for mobile money, 
there are several untapped opportunities for growth. For example, 
few if any Ghanaians receive government payments via mobile 
phone despite near 100 percent digitization of these payments 
(Findex 2017). One reason for this may be the government’s decision 
to promote use of the E-Zwich card for payment of government 
salaries and benefits, which has increased use of the card over 
the past several years. Moreover, the Better than Cash Alliance 
(BTCA) finds that nearly 100 percent (99.9 percent) of payments 
for consumption goods by volume are made in cash, indicating 
a significant opportunity for increasing use of mobile money for 
merchant payments. When it comes to these merchant payments, 
mobile offers an advantage over card payments as BTCA cites the 
unavailability of POS terminals at merchants as a key barrier to 
greater digitization (BTCA 2017). 
As mobile money has become increasingly common, the nature 
of competition has also evolved, with some financial institutions 
engaged in a type of “coopetition” in which they use mobile money 
services and agent networks as channel to reach new customers 
(CGAP 2018a). In September 2016, Ecobank Capital Advisors, a 
subsidiary of Ecobank, launched Ecobank TBill4All in collaboration 
with MTN Mobile Money. The Ecobank TBill4All is a self-service 
digital product that allows Ghanaians to invest in 91-day and 182-
day Treasury bills using MTN’s mobile money platform (BTCA 2017). 
There are also a range of savings, credit, and insurance products 
offered by mobile money networks in partnership with financial 
institutions. However, banks are also launching their own mobile 
financial services, including Ecobank’s Masterpass QR solution that 
allows customers to pay merchants by scanning a Quick Response 
(QR) code displayed at checkout on their smartphones, or by entering 
a merchant identifier into their feature phones. 
One negative consequence of increasing mobile money use is 
that these payments services are increasingly the target of fraud. 
According to the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications, MTN 
Mobile Money, TigoCash, Airtel Money, and Vodafone Cash recorded 
388 money fraud cases in 2016, up from 278 in 2015 (African Eye 
Report 2017).
In this context, the speed of DFS development tends to leave in its 
wake a range of “catch-up” work to fill in and harmonize financial 
consumer protection (FCP) standards. Ghana has a comprehensive 
framework for consumer recourse that applies to all financial services 
providers (including EMIs). However, the framework for disclosure 
is more fragmented, with a specific regulation on credit products 
(other than credit cards) and disclosure provisions included in the 
e-money guidelines (there are still no rules specified for savings 
products). On the other hand, protections against error and fraud 
in payments services are insufficient, although there is a significant 
push underway in Ghana to address these issues (CGAP 2018b).
66>> Fin T ech Ecosystem
There are several private sector digital platforms resulting from 
the growing competition in the financial technology (fintech) 
space in Ghana. Payment aggregators, such Interpay, Slydepay, 
expressPay and others have invested in the development of services 
that support card, mobile, and web (Internet banking) payments. 
They also offer interoperable P2P transfers and electronic payments 
for government services, utility payments, merchant payments 
and the convenience for customers to pay school fees to many 
educational institutions in Ghana with their mobile phone (BTCA 
2017). Some payment aggregators have also deployed technologies 
like near field communication (NFC) to make electronic payments 
more convenient.
The microinsurance is a sector where fintech innovation has 
been concentrated. Generally known for loyalty-based, “freemium” 
products, microinsurance companies such as BIMA, MicroEnsure, 
and aYo, a joint venture between MTN Group and MMI Holdings, 
have formed strategic partnerships with mobile money providers 
(MM providers) and banks to offer customers one-month insurance 
policies that cover life, hospitalization, maternity, and disability, 
among other policies. The People’s Pension Trust has partnered with 
Vodafone and Dusk Capital to develop a mobile-enabled pension 
product that is targeted at informal workers. This innovative pension 
product allows workers in the informal sector to make voluntary 
pension contributions through Vodafone Cash (BTCA 2017). 
Moving forward, the recent passage of the Payment Systems and 
Services Act (PSSA) will further drive innovation in the fintech 
space. Fintechs are currently prevented from receiving licenses 
from the Bank of Ghana and connecting to the national switch, which 
excluded them from the interoperability scheme and forced them 
to forge bilateral connections with providers. But as the PSSA has 
made its way through the legislative process, the Bank of Ghana has 
recently been proactive in involving fintechs in regulatory dialogue. 
Once the PSSA is signed into law (enacted in September2019), the 
act will address many of the impediments to fintech innovation by 
formalizing a licensing process for fintechs and allowing them to 
benefit from the country’s robust payments infrastructure, including 
through inclusion in the interoperability scheme. >> Digitization of Government Payments
Almost 100 percent of all government-to-person (G2P) and 
government-to-government (G2G) payments are digital. 
However, about 90 percent of government-to-business (G2B) and 
other government payments by volume are still made via check 
or cash (BTCA 2017). In terms of value, 86 percent of government 
payments are made electronically, but person-to-government (P2G) 
and business-to-government (B2G) payments remain largely cash 
based. In the case of B2G, 47 percent of total payments by value are 
made electronically, whereas just 27 percent of P2G payments are 
conducted electronically.
While multiple channels are currently available for government 
payments (E-Zwich, mobile money, cards and direct debit/credit), 
most of the recent increase in electronic government payments 
are E-Zwich transactions. In order to promote the E-Zwich scheme, 
the government encourages use of the system for payment of 
salaries for civil servants, payments to beneficiaries of Livelihood 
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), and personnel of the National 
Service Scheme (NSS). The promotion of E-Zwich for G2P payments 
has been to the exclusion of other channels such as mobile money: 
in 2017, just 6 percent of adults received government payments 
through a mobile phone (Findex 2017). Still, the adoption of E-Zwich 
beyond government payments has been a constant challenge. At 
this stage most, E-Zwich transfers are being immediately cashed 
out by recipients, meaning that government payments are not being 
retained in the electronic payment’s ecosystem (BTCA 2017). 
P2G payments (for example taxes represent an opportunity 
for digitization, and the government has allowed for the use of 
mobile money for some services, including payment for passport 
applications and school fees. But according to the most recent 
data from Findex, just 1 percent of Ghanaians used a mobile phone 
to pay school fees in 2014. For some payments to government, the 
launch of the Ghana E-Payment Portal (GEPP) offers an opportunity 
for greater digitization in the future. However, a transaction fee is 
charged to customers for usage of the portal, so it is not surprising 
that there is low uptake of these services to date (BTCA 2017).
67RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
Government can build upon its digital financial services success and drive greater financial inclusion and financial sector development by 
considering the following recommendations:
Mobile money interoperability
High mobile phone penetration, investments in robust agent networks, and a proliferation of use cases have made mobile 
money one of the most promising drivers of financial inclusion in Ghana. Recent steps to implement interoperability are 
promising, especially as they reduce barriers to use and acceptance of digital payments by allowing for the seamless 
transfer of funds across providers. However, in order to go beyond technical interoperability, which has sometimes failed 
to drive transaction volumes in other markets, a more holistic perspective is needed. For interoperability specifically, this 
means looking at governance and business rules that drive incentives in the scheme (who can participate and under 
what conditions, pricing, and so on). Specific recommendations include allowing fintechs to connect to GhIPSS, while 
also revisiting rules around transaction pricing to encourage greater adoption by customers. Furthermore, government 
should consider expanding interoperability to allow both mobile money providers and fintechs to participate in GhIPSS 
InstantPay, thereby facilitating real-time interoperable payments that would increase the attractiveness of digital payments 
versus cash.
Drive greater digitization through opening new channels for government payments
Current efforts to promote E-Zwich card usage by using the cards to pay government salaries and benefits have led to the 
successful digitization of these payment streams. However, the lack of merchant acceptance points and cash in/cash out 
points mean that the funds in these accounts are immediately withdrawn upon receipt. Government should endeavor to 
open up payment options for recipients so that they can choose the most convenient mode of payment, including mobile 
money. By offering payment to recipients’ preferred provider, there is a greater likelihood that the funds will remain in 
digital form and will thus contribute to Ghana’s cash-lite vision.
Encourage competition and promote an enabling environment to drive DFS innovation
The roll out of the biometric Ghana Card national ID, digital addressing through Ghana Post GPS and real-time payments 
through GhIPSS Instant Pay present an enormous opportunity for digital financial services. Markets such as India, 
Bangladesh, Thailand, and others have connected these pieces of infrastructure to offer a range of new use cases and 
overcome barriers to DFS use. For example, biometric ID and digital addressing systems can be leveraged to create a 
digital KYC utility that automates customer due diligence and overcomes barriers to account opening. These systems 
could also be connected to create a secure store of personal data that could be shared on-demand with providers in 
order to qualify for credit or other financial services. Additionally, connecting ID systems to real-time payments can further 
enhance interoperability by enabling customers to perform instant transactions everywhere regardless of device, provider, 
or account type by simply verifying their biometric identity. Such a system could help to overcome barriers to merchant 
payments and increase competition by levelling the playing field between banks, MNOs, and fintechs. Increasing the use 
of DFS depends on ensuring affordability and relevance of use cases to citizens and businesses alike. One way to achieve 
this goal is through encouraging greater competition, which drives innovation and pushes down costs, thus producing 
greater value for customers. The government should proceed with the implementation of the draft Payment System and 
Services Bill in a way that facilitates risk-based licensing and oversight of fintechs by the Bank of Ghana. The Bank of Ghana 
should also allow fintechs to connect to GhIPSS and participate in the country’s interoperability scheme in order to level the 
playing field and allow them to compete directly with banks and MNOs. Finally, the government should continue to resist 
proposals to impose new taxes on mobile money transactions, which risks driving up prices and slowing Ghana’s transition 
to a cash-lite economy. DFS.R1.

DFS.R7. Adopt policies that encourage greater use of merchant payments
A key barrier to further advances in digitization is the low uptake of merchant payments. When customers cannot use 
electronic funds to pay for goods and services, there is a greater likelihood that they will convert these to cash, thus 
undermining the government’s vision of a cash-lite economy. Working with providers to reduce the cost of merchant 
payment transactions is one way to increase the attractiveness of paying digitally, while interoperability and other policies 
that ease the cost of merchant acquisition can increase acceptance points and thus the convenience of digital payments. 
Expand rural adoption by facilitating investments in last mile infrastructure and the digitization of agricultural 
value chains
Given the importance of agriculture to Ghana’s economy, particularly key value chains such as cocoa, digitization of 
payments along these value chains could contribute significantly to rural adoption of DFS, which currently lags behind 
that of urban citizens. Government should work with providers to stimulate investment in rural network coverage, agents, 
and merchants that make DFS more accessible to rural households. Policies that encourage the sharing of infrastructure 
like towers and agents can help expand coverage. Additionally, incentives such as tax rebates or other support offered 
to providers who invest in underserved rural communities could help to narrow the access gap. Finally, the government 
should work with agribusinesses and the Cocoa Board to encourage digitization of bulk payments to producers, which can 
help to drive adoption and usage of DFS not only among farmers but also within rural economies. 
Strengthen digital financial consumer protection policies
There must be a well-developed strategy for digital financial customer protection regulation that covers areas such as 
effective consumer redress through internal dispute resolution (IDR) and external dispute resolution (EDR) mechanisms 
and supervision by the Bank of Ghana. A well-regulated consumer services protection policy will boost confidence in the 
usage of digital financial services. Ghana currently boasts a comprehensive framework for consumer recourse that applies 
to all financial services providers. But the framework for disclosure is fragmented, with a specific regulation on credit 
products, disclosure provisions included in the e-money guidelines, but no rules for savings products. Protections against 
error and fraud in payments services are also insufficient (CGAP 2018b). The country should push for a more comprehensive 
disclosure framework. Furthermore, given the importance of protecting consumer privacy and data, efforts should be 
made to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to the Data Protection Agency (DPA) and it should be empowered 
to supervise service provider compliance.
DFS and e-money regulation and surveillance
The government needs to strengthen the digital financial services monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and compliance 
procedures, implementing an efficient surveillance system and a robust regulation framework for E-Money Issuers, 
especially regarding capital requirements, provisions to cover financial risks, and e-money issuing permissions. The Payment 
Services and Systems Bill (PSSB) under consideration by the government must be reinforced with an increased budget for 
effective implementation. The E-Money Guidelines foresee that electronic money will be issued by both regulated financial 
institutions and duly licensed nonbank entities (such as subsidiaries of MNOs and other third parties) engaged solely in the 
business of e-money and incidental activities, defined as Dedicated Electronic Money Issuers (DEMIs). While they came 
into force since 2015, the E-Money Guidelines have not yet been fully implemented. Therefore, although direct licensing 
of DEMIs is possible in theory, given the lack of implementation, E-Money Issuers have not yet been licensed and are still 
being regulated informally (BTCA 2017). Likewise, capacity building of public workers and private companies’ experts in 
this field is a must.
69IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS: CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIPDigital entrepreneurship can be defined as the formation of 
new ventures and the transformation of existing business by 
creating and using novel digital technologies. Digital enterprises 
are characterized by a high intensity utilization of new digital 
technologies (particularly social, mobile, analytics, and cloud 
solutions) to improve business operations, invent new (digital) 
business models, sharpen business intelligence, and engage 
with customers and stakeholders through new (digital) channels. 
Establishing entrepreneurship ecosystems depends on a range of 
factors that go beyond investment into traditional inputs such as 
R&D, infrastructure, and education. Helping create the ecosystem for entrepreneurship may further 
grow the digital economy: Harnessing the potential of disruptive 
technologies to drive Africa’s transformation requires addressing the 
main barriers to digital entrepreneurship. While countries in Africa 
have made great strides in fostering entrepreneurship ecosystems, 
progress is mostly clustered in a few countries and urban centers.
African entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of using digital 
technologies to create innovative solutions to development 
problems. In each problem, constraint, or challenge, these innovators 
see opportunities. Some experiences, such as mobile money and 
pay-as-you-go solar energy, have given Africa hope that it can also 
be a dynamic and innovative player (Juma 2017).
Findings show that the number of entrepreneurship support 
policies, programs, and actors in Ghana is growing at a rapid 
pace, but the country still lags many of its regional peers in 
terms of ecosystem maturity. Ghanaian entrepreneurs still face 
many challenges that threaten their ability to start and grow viable 
businesses. However, despite these challenges, Ghana has many 
of the core components and resources needed for a successful 
entrepreneurship ecosystem that can help achieve its long-term 
strategic vision of becoming a middle-income country and building 
an economy capable of providing good jobs that are suitable and 
sustainable for development. Political stability, an influential diaspora, 
and strong Internet connectivity are some of the factors that work in 
Ghana’s favor toward creating a ripe ecosystem for entrepreneurship.
Like many Sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana has a young and 
increasingly urban population ready to tap into entrepreneurial 
opportunities. In 2017, nearly 60 percent of the population was under 
25 years old (Index Mundi 2019) and 55 percent lived in urban areas, 
with the urban population growing at a rate of 3.5 percent from 2013-
2017 (World Bank 2016b). The country is primarily English speaking, 
making it easier for Ghanaians to conduct business in international 
markets, while Ghana’s diaspora is large (nearly 250,000 people in 
2006) and concentrated in the United States and United Kingdom, 
providing connections to key international consumer and financial markets (OECD 2019). Ghana also boasts a strong ICT infrastructure, 
though access to fiber connections remains expensive.
Leveraging these advantages, however, into new businesses, new 
wealth, and higher standards of living will require Ghana to develop 
and sustain a strong entrepreneurship ecosystem. Ghana’s 
ecosystem is growing rapidly. The 24 active entrepreneurship 
hubs (business incubators, accelerators, and similar spaces for 
entrepreneurs) now in Ghana represent an increase of 50 percent 
since 2016 (GSMA 2018b). Although startup activity and the number 
of formal SMEs are not yet tracked, $266 million in private capital 
was deployed in 15 venture capital deals in 2016-17 compared to 
$63 million in 16 deals in 2014-15, illustrating some growth in venture 
financing (World Bank 2018a). However, government support for 
entrepreneurship is uncoordinated, consisting of multiple agencies 
and programs that provide overlapping support without a clear 
overall vision. A poor business environment, lack of access to credit 
and finance, and mixed quality of entrepreneurial support are other 
key challenges that must be addressed within the ecosystem. Table 
2.8 shows Ghana’s global ranking in several well-known innovation 
and entrepreneurship indices. In these indices, Ghana is an average 
performer compared to its regional peers, ranking between 75 and 
107 globally.2.4 Digital Entrepreneurship
70Despite the challenges present in Ghana today, its ecosystem 
is home to a range of vibrant initiatives and several notable 
success stories. There are a small number of globally competitive 
digital startups emerging that are gaining international recognition. 
The country’s IT sector is home to companies such as mPedigree, 
Rancard, SoftTribe, Hubtel, mPharma, Logiciel, and Nosmay, which 
compete in state-of-the-art software and applications platforms for 
everything from finance and payments to agriculture and medical 
services. 
>>  Supply Factors
Supply factors are all the sources of knowledge that support firm 
demand within the ecosystem. Physical capital includes efficient 
domestic industries, as well as institutions that support entrepreneurs 
and SMEs through a range of services. On the human capital side 
are the available workforce, as well as educational institutions and 
training programs that teach the skills that feed into higher worker, 
managerial, and entrepreneurial efficacy. The knowledge capital 
side comprises the country’s research infrastructure and technology 
transition capacities.
>>>  Physical Capital
The number of entrepreneurship and SME support organizations in 
Ghana has been growing rapidly, but the quality of support provided 
is generally mixed and there are few support organizations outside 
of Accra (see box 2.4). In 2017, there were 24 active entrepreneurship 
hubs (business incubators, accelerators, and similar spaces for 
entrepreneurs) in Ghana, an increase of 50 percent over the 16 active 
hubs present in Ghana in 2016 (see appendix B). However, despite 
this growth in support organizations, Ghana still lags many of its 
regional peers, including Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa, 
in the number of entrepreneurship hubs nationwide (GSMA 2018b).Sources: Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO 2018; WEF 2018; Acs and others 2018; and StartupBlink 2019.Country Ranking

The Accra Digital Centre (ADC) was initiated in 2011 with 
support from the World Bank and Rockefeller Foundation. 
ADC was established to meet the demand for affordable 
“plug-and-play” facilities for existing and prospective IT 
and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies. The 
center is also home to a Mobile Applications Lab (mLab) 
and an Innovation Hub (IHub), allowing ADC to serve as an 
incubation hub for technology startups working in emerging 
technologies such as the IoT, cybersecurity, AI, and so on. 
With $10 million funding secured from the eTransform Ghana 
program, 12 warehouses were refurbished and repurposed by 
the Ministry of Communication to support the development 
of the IT and business processing services industry. 
ADC has recently become operational, with several BPO and 
technology companies already utilizing it.

The Ministry of Communications facilitated the development 
of an independent company, Ghana Digital Centre, with its 
focal node based at ADC. This organization plans to develop 
more digital support centers across Ghana based on the 
lessons learned from ADC. BOX 2.4.

Startups
71While growing in number, entrepreneurship support organizations 
are of mixed quality and many are not able to adequately support 
businesses past startup stage through to growth and maturity 
(World Bank 2019c). Some hubs are actively incubating and growing 
new startups, but many are more akin to coworking spaces that offer limited support services. Acceleration courses are rare, as are 
active mentorship programs (see box 2.5). Many incubators are also 
faced with high rates of attrition among their startup cohorts, which 
threatens their sustainability. 
Entrepreneurship hubs are also largely concentrated in Accra and on the ICT sectors. The ecosystem is generally weak outside of Accra 
and leaves startups and entrepreneurs outside of the capital underserved (see figure 2.10). Source: https:/ /meltwater.org/.Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) 
is a full time, 12-month program in Accra that provides 
entrepreneurship training in business, communication, and 
advanced digital skills in software development to graduate-
level African participants. 
MEST targets Africans who are interested in starting their own 
software companies. It requires completion of an online form 
followed by in-person assessments and a series of tests to 
evaluate applicants’ analytical thinking, business acumen, 
and interest in technical entrepreneurship. The program 
received more than 2,500 applications in 2018 with about 1,000 
individuals making it past the initial application filter. Its interview 
panels are made up of business professionals, including 
general managers and recruitment managers.
MEST Entrepreneurs in Training complete three capstone 
projects during the program. EITs are required to develop their 
business ideas and simulate the entire process up to market 
launch. This enables them to understand how to start their own 
businesses before investors evaluate their final pitches.Students spend roughly 80 percent of their learning in 
classrooms, while the remainder is spent on lectures, field work, 
market research, events, and group projects. These activities 
allow participants to receive an interactive learning experience. 
Apart from focusing on technical skills, the program’s emphasis 
on business and communication skills have emerged as 
important in local employment. The strong partner network 
at MEST further allows participants to engage with and 
receive mentorship from pioneers in the technology industry. 
Throughout the program, guest lecturers also travel to Ghana to 
mentor and teach EITs.
MEST has grown from 10 percent female students in 2008 to 
30 percent in 2018, and the organization is working to increase 
that number. To develop this initiative, it recently launched 
a partnership with on-profit STEMbees, founded by MEST 
alumni. The partnership is aimed at providing mentorship 
to young women looking to pursue careers in science and 
technology fields.BOX 2.5.

Startups and SMEs are also challenged by a lack of space and 
high commercial rents. Commercial property rents in Accra are 
higher than most of Ghana’s regional peers, as shown in figure 2.11, 
and affordable space is extremely limited. There are currently over 
20 registered Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies and several innovation hubs for incubating and providing training and 
mentorship to startups; however, there only a few tech parks, such 
as the Accra Digital Center, that offer affordable rental rates for 
startups and other ICT-related businesses (World Bank 2017b).

73Limited usage of modern technology solutions. Given notable 
Internet coverage gaps in rural areas, particularly in Ghana’s northern 
region, Ghana’s digital market has relied on lower technology 
solutions – SMS, USSID, 2G, or 3G – instead of fiber optic to function. 
The potential market is probably limited to about 200,000 users, with 
the demand for more advanced technologies mostly coming from 
the urban population and large businesses (World Bank 2017c).
Growing foreign direct investment. Ghana experienced a moderate 
amount of green field foreign direct investment (FDI) in the areas 
of ICT and digital infrastructure, research and development, and 
business services sectors from 2015-17, totaling $3.7 billion. This 
was higher than its regional peers Mauritius ($159 million) and Kenya 
($2.2 billion), but lower than Morocco ($5 billion), Nigeria ($6.4 billion), 
and South Africa ($5.6 billion) (UNCTAD 2017b).
>>>  Human Capital
Ghana generally lacks the entrepreneurship and business skills 
that would allow Ghanaian startups to survive the commercial 
phase. The state education system generally fails to provide 
Ghanaians with the entrepreneurial, problem-solving, and technical 
skills required to generate and sustain significant startup activity 
(DfID 2013). In particular, entrepreneurs need a range of soft skills 
related to developing and managing teams, communicating and 
presenting ideas, networking, and time management, which are not 
part of Ghana’s traditional education system (Dalberg 2011).
However, Ghana is home to several organizations that provide 
solid entrepreneurship training curricula, such as: Ashesi 
University, a private university with a focus on entrepreneurship that 
won the 2017 Education Prize at the World Innovation Summit (see 
box 2.6); and the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology 
(MEST), an entrepreneurial training program, seed fund and incubator 
for African tech startups with 60 students from five countries. 
The Government of Ghana also has several programs that aim to 
develop entrepreneurship skills among Ghana’s youth, including the 
Employment and Entrepreneurship Programme. Growing entrepreneurial workforce. Given the country’s 
increasingly young, increasingly urban population, the pool of 
potential entrepreneurs is large and growing by the year, so more 
organizations will be needed to provide them with the skills to 
succeed at starting and growing a business. For example, in 2017, 
about 30 percent of Ghana’s ICT students said they wanted to launch 
their own business but did not have the necessary business skills to 
do so (World Bank 2017c). 
In technical skills, while there is a good availability in ICT education, 
quality is limited. There is large involvement from the private sector, 
but quality needs improvement as training courses and curricula 
are largely focused on hardware and graduates generally lack the 
software skills demanded by the modern ICT market. Ghana’s ICT 
education and training curricula were largely developed to meet 
the needs of the first ICT revolution (hardware), and skills needed 
for the second revolution (software) are missing: cybersecurity, web 
design, marketing, and development. Demand for ICT specialists 
is high, requiring additional investment in education and training to 
both increase the quantity of ICT skills in the market and to develop 
new curricula and specialties not currently taught in the country 
(World Bank 2017c). Scientists and engineers are also generally in 
short supply in Ghana (World Bank 2017c).Ashesi University, an internationally recognized Ghanaian 
private university founded in 2002, places a strong 
emphasis on interdisciplinarity in its curriculum, aiming to 
develop critical thinking, creative problem solving, ethical 
reasoning, and effective communication skills among its 
students. Ashesi offers degrees in business, management, 
computer sciences, and engineering, often partnering 
with business leaders to identify existing gaps between 
Ashesi’s curriculum and local industry needs.
Ashesi hosts a number of projects that promote 
entrepreneurship and interdisciplinary skills, including 
the Education Collaborative, a week-long workshop 
that brings together higher education leaders and 
stakeholders to communicate best practices in teaching, 
management, and administration; the Ghana Climate 
Innovation PayPal (GCIC), an incubator that provides 
business advisory services, financing, and mentorship to 
clean tech startups; and the Ashesi Innovation Experience 
(AIX), a two-week program for high-school students 
designed to promote creative problem solving, leadership, 
and entrepreneurship.BOX 2.6.

74>>>  Knowledge Capital
Ghana’s academic and research institutions designed to foster 
technological development are generally weak and not aligned to 
the economic needs of the country, and overall research outputs 
are low relative to many of Ghana’s regional peers (UNCTAD 2011). 
Research inputs, in terms of research and development expenditure 
as a percentage of GDP, were 0.38 percent in 2010, well below its 
regional peers Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa. Ghana’s research 
outputs in 2016, in terms of publications and patent applications, 
were similarly low when compared to regional peers, as can be seen 
in table 2.9.
However, Ghana has in place many of the individual components 
necessary for effective knowledge capital creation. It has at 
least 16 research and development (R&D) institutes, most of which 
are managed by the Council on Scientific and Industrial Research 
(CSIR), 7 public universities, about 40 private universities, 10 public 
polytechnics, many technical institutes (see box 2.7), and several 
technology support and regulatory agencies (UNCTAD 2011).
The capacity of the overall R&D system is limited in comparison 
to middle-income countries such as India or South Africa. This 
is because of several factors, including policies and institutions 
that are not aligned with the country’s economic growth and 
human development goals; weak links and poor positive feedback 
between and among institutions, including the higher education and 
research institutes and the private sector; and a lack of incentives 
and mechanisms that encourage communication and collaboration 
(UNCTAD 2011).In April 2019, Google opened a new AI research center in 
Accra, which aims to bring together top machine learning 
researchers and engineers to develop new AI applications. 
The center will collaborate with local universities and 
research centers, to build products that can solve 
problems that Africa faces today. The center will also focus 
on enhancing Google Translate’s ability to capture African 
languages more precisely.BOX 2.7.

75Demand factors are the overall set of incentives for firms to invest 
and accumulate. This includes the macro context, in particular, the 
volatility of sales, the competitive structure, and the trade regime 
that determine whether firms seek to enter or grow. It also includes 
firm’s internal capabilities, including their managerial capacity and 
production and technological systems. Demand factors also include 
national entrepreneurial characteristics, including risk tolerance and 
ability to recognize business opportunities. 
>>>  Market Incentives
There are several large market opportunities for digital startups in 
Ghana and the West African region, in developing digital products 
for local digital and analog infrastructures and in digitizing and 
curating locally relevant information. The mobile banking (see 
DFS section), e-commerce, and IT-enabled services (ITeS) market 
segments have been highlighted as particular areas of opportunity. 
The largest constraints are existing broadband Internet blackspots, 
which limit the size of Ghana’s internal market, and the fact that 
Ghana remains a largely cash-based society, limiting opportunities 
for mobile and Internet transactions. Ghana’s economy has been 
booming in recent years, with Ghana’s internal market, measured in 
GDP purchasing power parity (GDP PPP), growing at a rapid pace – 
4.5 percent from 2013 to 2017 – which is higher than regional peers 
Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa (WDI 2017). Meanwhile, 
Ghana’s external market, measured in total exports in U.S. dollars, 
grew by 2.6 percent from 2012 to 2017, higher than all of its regional 
peers (WITS 2017). 
Recent evidence has shown that African companies struggle to 
compete internationally in global digital platform markets (for 
example, apps, software, devices) but can find success targeting 
domestic and regional markets with localized products and 
services (Friederici and others forthcoming). Regionally, there 
are a number of untapped opportunities for digital entrepreneurs 
related to wider penetration of mobile phones and the Internet and 
to the digitization of existing enterprises. Ghana’s mobile phone 
penetration rate is relatively high (at 140 percent, but only 50 percent 
if unique subscribers are counted), and as mobile phones continue 
to spread, so too does the potential market for a broad range of 
app-based services for digital enterprises. The country’s Internet 
penetration rate is 66.8 percent with 3G, and that number will likely 
increase with the auction of 4G licenses in 2016 and as mobile data 
costs decline. Access to affordable and quality broadband service 
reduces transaction costs for businesses and consumers and allows 
for flexible firm locations, opening up new geographic opportunities. 
In addition, broadband allows for information technology ITeS 
exports such as business process outsourcing (BPO). A study of 27 
developed and 66 developing countries found that a one percentage 
point increase in the number of Internet users is correlated with a boost in exports of 4.3 percentage points (Clarke and Wallsten 
2006). Broadband also contributes to the competitiveness of the 
service sector, bringing positive spillover effects to less technology-
intensive industries.
Digitization of existing enterprises and industries likely represents 
the largest opportunity for digital entrepreneurs, though 
important challenges remain. A 2014 McKinsey report identified 
six industry sectors where the Internet and digitization would likely 
have the largest impact on in Sub-Saharan Africa: financial services, 
education, health, retail, agriculture, and government. The report 
estimated that technology-related productivity gains in these sectors 
could reach $148 billion to $318 billion by 2025 (McKinsey 2014). 
Unlocking these untapped markets will require additional technology 
deployment, in the form of fiber and 4G Internet connections, and 
coverage expansion to reduce the number of black spots in rural 
and underdeveloped areas (World Bank 2017c). Existing enterprises 
– particularly SMEs – may also require a range of additional support 
before they are able to adopt new digital technologies and services. 
Firms in developing countries require a range of complimentary 
factors, including managerial competencies that will allow them to 
adjust their business strategies and processes to fully utilize digital 
technologies (Cirera and others 2019).
The World Bank’s 2017 Ghana CPSD ICT Deep Dive identified 
mobile money, e-commerce, ITeS, and agribusiness as the 
sectors that present opportunities for ICT- and digital-enterprises 
in Ghana (see DFS chapter for details on mobile money): 
E-commerce in Ghana grew from $30 million to $90 million 
between 2009 and 2012, though Deloitte estimates that only 
10 percent of retail in 2018 had an e-commerce platform in the 
region (UNCTAD 2015). Growth of the sector has slowed down after 
an enthusiastic start because of fraud in marketplaces and bad first 
experiences. The cash economy is a constraint on e-commerce 
growth, and cybercrime and cybersecurity remain a challenge. 
IT-enabled services (ITeS). Ghana ranked as the number one 
destination in Sub-Saharan Africa and 29th globally in the 2016 AT 
Kearney Global Services Location Index. However, despite this 
promise, Ghana’s performance in the ITeS sector has been poor in 
recent years. The market is small and fragmented, with about 20 
registered BPO companies in the country. The closure of one of 
the largest BPO companies, ACS, in 2015, which was providing jobs 
for over 1,000 Ghanaian young people has dampened the sector’s 
vibrancy (World Bank 2017b). There remain promising, albeit smaller, 
BPO companies that are providing innovative back office support 
services to telecommunication operators, power, financial and 
insurance companies. The traditional ITeS has also been disrupted 
by automation and standardization, as well as by other emerging >>  Demand Factors
76As in the rest of the world, SMEs in Ghana lag larger firms in both 
technical and managerial capacities. Ghana’s SMEs have limited 
access to quality providers of technical assistance and demonstrate 
inefficient practices and low management capabilities. There is 
also a gap between SMEs and large firms in ICT connectivity, 
reducing SMEs’ abilities to adopt and use new digital technologies 
(International Trade Centre, 2016).
>>>  Entrepreneurial Characteristics
Available data about the entrepreneurial and risk-taking 
characteristics of Ghana’s pool of entrepreneurs show that they 
generally have positive opinions about entrepreneurship and 
their own capabilities for starting a new business, along with a low 
fear of failure. In the 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Adult 
Population Survey, Ghanaians generally had higher opinions about 
entrepreneurial activities than their regional peers, as shown in  
table 2.10.technologies such as cloud services, the IoT, artificial intelligence, 
and robotics, which have reduced demand for back office and 
contact center services. That said, the ITeS/BPO sector continues to 
hold significant promise for Ghana. 
Agribusiness. Digitization of agriculture is still at an early stage of 
development in Ghana. There are 4.8 million farmers in the country 
and the potential for growth is important. Esoko (a startup which 
provides information for and about 400-500,000 farmers related 
to market prices, extension services, seeds, inputs, and so on) aims 
to add 200,000 more farmers in its database every year. Solutions 
have already been deployed in rice, maize, soya, cocoa, vegetables 
(cabbage and lettuce), and fish, with projects for extension in cassava, 
pineapple, mango, and banana). Lack of mobile Internet coverage in 
rural areas is a constraint.
Additionally, open data platforms, particularly those that make 
large-scale government data sets available, also represent a 
major opportunity for digital entrepreneurs (see analysis on GODI 
in the digital platforms section). Numerous studies have found 
that making public data available via open data platforms creates 
opportunities for the private sector and generates economic value, 
with estimates ranging from the billions to trillions in economic gains 
(McKinsey Digital 2013; Zeleti and others 2016). Open government 
data can serve as the foundation for new digital products and 
services and provide business intelligence through data analytics.
>>>  Firm Capabilities
Information about the private sector is extremely limited in Ghana. 
This lack of data, particularly data covering SMEs and startups, is a 
barrier to introducing targeted reforms or incentives to boost and 
improve the sustainability of small businesses in the country. Part of 
the challenge is that Ghana’s private sector is dominated by informal 
firms, which constituted 90.5 percent of all firms in the country in 
2014 (Ghana Statistical Office 2015), while the number of formal 
startup SMEs are not yet tracked. 
Available data suggests that Ghana is neither a high or low 
performer among its regional peers in terms of firm capabilities. 
In 2013, 58.9 percent of firms had an annual financial statement 
reviewed by external auditors, 33.2 percent of firms had their own 
website, 14.5 percent of firms used a technology licensed from a 
foreign company, and 22.9 percent of Ghanaian firms invested in 
some level of R&D, all slightly above the Sub-Saharan average (World 
Bank 2017a). The World Economic Forum’s 2017 Executive Opinion 
Survey ranked Ghana lower than Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, 
and South Africa in firm-level technology adoption (WEF 2017).Ghana also ranked highest among Sub-Saharan Africa countries 
in 2012 in opportunity-driven entrepreneurship, that is, the 
percentage of early-stage entrepreneurs who claim to be driven by 
opportunity as opposed to finding no other option for work; and who 
indicate the main driver for being involved in this activity is being 
independent or increasing their income, rather than just maintaining 
their income (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2013). Ghanaians are 
also generally tolerant of risk, with Ghana ranking third in Africa in the 
2017 Global Preferences Survey’s Risk-Taking Index behind South 
Africa and Botswana (Falk and others 2018).Output Ghana (%)Sub-Saharan

77Barriers impair the linkages between the demand and supply factor 
of knowledge in the ecosystem. These include access to finance, 
regulations, and social capital. 
>>>  Access to Finance
Access to finance is a recurrent problem for Ghanaian startups 
and SMEs. There is a gap in early-stage risk capital funding for 
startups, and access to credit is a challenge for both startups and 
SMEs. The two most recent Ghana World Bank Enterprise Surveys 
(in 2007 and 2013) both identified access to finance as the largest 
single challenge in Ghana’s business environment.
As in most countries around the world, access to early-stage 
financing for new or growth-oriented companies is limited in 
Ghana (World Bank 2019c). While the government has tried to 
stimulate venture capital funding through the Venture Capital Trust 
Fund (VCTF), important challenges persist. Seed funding for new 
startups is limited, and venture capital, while growing, is limited by 
a shortage of investment-ready companies, lack of a stronger cadre 
of investment professionals and highly skilled lawyers, and legal and 
regulatory issues. Assessments of the industry also point to limited 
knowledge of how to structure VC-type investments (both from 
the demand and supply side), as well as lack of diversity in how the 
investments are structured, as constraints for further growth of risk 
financing in the country.
Although there is limited data infrastructure to monitor startup 
activity in Ghana, $266 million in private capital was deployed in 
15 venture capital deals in 2016-17, compared to $63M in 16 deals 
in 2014-15 (World Bank 2016c). The startup phase of business 
financing (grants and investments of less than $25,000) appears to 
be reasonably funded in Ghana, evidenced by the growing number of 
incubators and startups in the country. However, there is a shortage 
of funds at the early/acceleration stage (typically $25,000 to 
$500,000) of both investible deals and investors, with many startups 
failing at commercialization and scaling-up (pointing at the lack of 
entrepreneurship skills of startup teams, as well as poor incentives 
for investors with a lack of equity markets and exit strategies). For 
growth stage ($1 million and above) deals, there are several regional 
investors willing to invest (World Bank 2016c). Currently there are 
three main categories of private equity (PE) or venture capital (VC) 
funds either active or operating in Ghana, with most of the dynamism 
in the PE/VC ecosystem coming from regional and pan-African 
funds investing in Ghana, rather than the local Ghanaian funds.• Local VCTF-backed funds, with local fund managers, capitalized 
by VCTF and mainly Ghanaian financial institutions. These funds 
invest in Ghanaian SMEs, with a ticket size of less than $1 million.
• West Africa regional funds (such as Injaro Capital Holdings and 
West Africa Emerging Market Growth Fund), with a focus across 
the region, but sometimes with a specific focus on Ghana and Côte 
d’Ivoire. Investors for such funds include development finance 
institutions (DFIs), international family offices, regional pension 
funds, and so on. These funds typically have a ticket size of $1-
$5 million.
• Pan African or global funds, with sometimes an explicit allocation 
or strategy to invest in Ghana (for example, Helios, ECP, Abraaj). 
These funds are typically invested in by DFIs and institutional 
investors. They sometimes have offices in Ghana (for example, 
Abraaj). Ticket sizes are over $20 million.
Ghana is generally touted as an attractive investment destination 
on the continent because of its stable government and business 
environment. However, there are also some market impediments 
specific to private equity/venture capital in Ghana. For example, 
the SME investment terrain is difficult, as it is in many developing 
countries. SMEs lack the financial literacy to recognize the added 
value of PE/VC; they are usually family-owned businesses that are 
reluctant to cede control or ownership to outsiders; SME financials 
are often not in order; and SMEs are typically reluctant to reveal 
financial information, which causes problems for valuation. Exit is 
also an issue, whether the intended exit route is acquisition or IPO. 
Although exiting to the public markets remains a secondary source 
of liquidity in Ghana as it is in most emerging markets, it is worth 
nothing that the Ghana Stock Exchange has had few recent IPOs. 
Finally, domestic institutional investors are not comfortable with 
the PE/VC asset class in general. While Ghanaian banks have been 
more active and early players in PE/VC in Ghana, both pension 
funds and insurance companies are less comfortable investing in the 
asset class, partly because of investment guideline restrictions. In 
addition, the service industry surrounding the private equity industry 
is generally weak – for example, due diligence, legal services, and so 
on (World Bank 2016c). >>  Challenges
78>>>  Regulations
The Government of Ghana has numerous entrepreneurship 
support policies and programs, but they suffer from overlap and 
coordination, which hinders their effectiveness. ICT regulations 
have several gaps and grey areas, which constrain private sector 
investment and market creation. Ghana also has a generally poor 
environment for doing business.
The government has created multiple agencies and programs that 
support SMEs, entrepreneurs, and enterprise development, many of which provide overlapping support without clear coordination 
(see figure 2.13). For example, the two lead ministries for SME and 
entrepreneurship development , the Ministry of Trade and Industry 
(MOTI) and the Ministry of Business Development (MBD), are 
currently formulating national policies that appear to have significant 
overlap. Without clear rationalization of mandates, the impact that 
these programs may have on SMEs and entrepreneurship will 
remain limited. The lack of consolidation and streamlined structure 
for existing government support programs reduces their likelihood 
of sustainability.Lack of adequate credit information, high interest rates, and a 
weak insolvency framework are barriers to accessing credit for 
both entrepreneurs and SMEs. According to the 2019 World Bank 
Doing Business Rankings, only 22.4 percent of Ghanaian adults are 
covered by the credit bureau. On the supply side, limited availability 
of credit information is a barrier to financing startups. Bank loans 
are often not an option for small businesses because of the lack of 
collateral and credit information and high interest rates (often above 
20 percent) (World Bank 2017c). Moreover, the process in place to 
recover debt and a weak insolvency framework makes financial service providers reluctant to provide credit to new entrepreneurs. 
The 2019 Doing Business report shows that Ghana’s insolvency 
framework is weaker than the regional average. In addition, the 
time required to recover debt is 1.9 years and the cost of recovery 
is approximately 22 percent of the debtor’s estate value.18 In overall 
access to financing, Ghana ranked 110th in the world in affordability 
of financial services, 113th in financing through the local equity 
market, 91st in the ease of access to loans, and 42nd in venture capital 
availability in the Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018, as 
shown in figure 2.12.

GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN GHANA
Source: Authors
Currently, the legal/regulatory environment in Ghana for private 
equity and venture capital is still being developed. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) was recently authorized to register, 
license, authorize or regulate private equity funds and venture 
capital funds, though regulatory guidelines for PE and VC are still 
being drafted. Scant regulation for private equity and venture capital 
is not necessarily problematic in a nascent ecosystem because PE/
VC funds typically target sophisticated investors. However, Ghana 
has a bifurcated legal/regulatory framework, which creates some 
confusion in the ecosystem (World Bank 2016c). 
There are also legal and regulatory gaps related to ICT and digital 
industries that constrain private sector investment and market 
creation, calling for a rationalization of the existing framework 
and its implementation in consultation with the private sector. The 
private sector has developed in the absence of a legal/regulatory 
framework for digital activities, and the legislator/regulator is now 
catching up, creating tensions and grey areas. Some important parts 
of the legal framework are missing, or grey areas subsist (related 
to data storage, consumer protection, data ownership, privacy and 
cybersecurity, and so on) that could affect the growth of digital 
industries (World Bank 2017c). 
Implementation of new ICT regulations is also an issue: Ghana  
has adopted no less than 11 laws related to ICT in recent years but lacks the resources to implement them. For example, the 
Data Protection Commission was created in 2012, but has limited 
resources to operate. 
Ghana’s general business regulatory environment, as measured 
by the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, is poor when 
compared to high-income countries and middle of the road when 
compared to its peers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana improved its 
ranking to 114 out of 190 economies in 2019, up six places from its 
2017 ranking, with major regulatory challenges related to starting a 
business, enforcing contracts, and trading across borders. 
Regarding intellectual property, according to WIPO both patents 
and trade secrets are effective forms of IP protection, but one may 
be more suitable than the other depending on the subject matter 
and circumstances. It is important that those taking decisions 
about IP strategy are aware that trade secrets can potentially be 
as valuable as patents when protecting digital innovations. While 
most large multinational companies have the resources and funds 
to invest in the patenting process, which can be costly and time-
consuming, SMEs often struggle with it. Trade secrets, on the other 
hand, are relatively straightforward, entail no registration costs or 
lengthy legal processes and can add real value for small businesses. 
That is why it is important to raise awareness among SMEs about the 
value of trade secrets and how to protect them effectively.
80>>>  Social Capital and Culture
Limited social capital. Social capital serves as the connective 
tissue of an ecosystem, bringing together actors, ideas, and 
resources. This social capital is partially lacking in Ghana, hindering 
connectivity and coordination across the ecosystem. There are 
a number of networks and events in Ghana focused on bringing 
together entrepreneurs and investors, but these many actors lack 
platforms for communication and coordinating support. Linkages 
and connections among Ghana’s research institutions, and between 
research institutions and industry, are also weak.
Lack of innovation among telecom providers. Ghana’s 
telecommunications providers have been playing an increasing 
role in offering platforms for digital content developers and users. 
While they are not interested in developing content by themselves, 
they sponsor several initiatives that look promising (for example,  MTN apps challenge and Tigo innovation challenge) for fostering 
connections between digital entrepreneurs and end users (World 
Bank 2017c).
Social media usage, which can be an effective platform for 
entrepreneurial activities, has been growing. Social media can 
also provide platforms for ecosystem actors to connect and share 
information. Social media usage is growing at a rate of more than 
20 percent per year in Ghana, with over 5.6 million users in 2018.  
 
The social media penetration rate is 23 percent, higher than regional 
peers Kenya and Nigeria, but lower than Mauritius, Morocco, and 
South Africa. However, the use of LinkedIn, a global business- and 
employment-oriented social media platform, is low in Ghana, with 
only 3 percent of Ghanaians using the platform, lowest among its 
regional peers (We Are Social 2018).
81RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
Develop IT-ITeS sector programs to support the scale up of Ghana’s exports, players, digital innovation, and expertise.
Advancing towards a vibrant digital economy requires a national private sector policy approach. Public efforts need to 
capitalize on those made on digital infrastructure, public digital platforms (government digitization), and digital financial 
services. Policies are needed to develop a competitive IT-ITeS sector and to accelerate private sector transformation 
taking advantage of digital innovation for improved productivity. To transform Ghana into the most relevant digital hub in 
Africa requires a bigger footprint of capable and innovative IT-ITeS companies operating in the country. What involves 
increasing jobs, exports, number and size of local and global players, while boosting innovation within the sector. The 
IT-ITeS sector comprises entrepreneurs, SMEs, large indigenous companies and global players, and efforts to facilitate 
their scale up in headcount and expertise calls for targeted and connected initiatives where government agencies play an 
active role in collaboration with the private and academic sector
Develop a digital technology adoption program to accelerate  
digital transformation of the economy, targeting specific audiences.
Joint efforts between the government and the IT sector can help nurture and accelerate digital transformation of the 
private and public sector in Ghana, specially SME, women-owned businesses, and nondigital sectors. According to BCG, 
7 out of the 10 most innovative companies are digital natives and thus digital innovators; and while 79 percent of strong 
innovators reported that they have properly digitized innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators made 
the same change (BCG 2018). Digital innovation adoption of private and public sectors can be done with country-based 
IT companies, but initiatives will be needed to ramp the local IT sector into an innovative digital partner. To improve the 
supply of business-ready ideas and innovations, including disruptive technologies (that is artificial intelligence, the IoT, 
and robotics) GoG can establish programs or instruments to promote R&D, technological innovation, and digital upgrading 
in Ghana’s private sector in the form of competitive grants or tax incentives for research and development. Also, provide 
more incentives and platforms for collaboration between research institutes, universities, and the private sector through 
collaborative research or centers of excellence for ICT or digital solutions.
Articulate Ghana’s value proposition to position Ghana as a relevant global digital hub
To become a trusted destination the country needs to showcase its expertise, business infrastructure, and a set of capable 
and competitive companies based in Ghana. Positioning Ghana´s name as a top destination to outsource and invest goes 
beyond a branding campaign and event participation. To build an articulate message of Ghana’s value proposition, a portfolio 
of capable IT companies operating in the country and a set of satisfied customers willing to share their experience while 
working with a Ghana-based company are needed. Exporting companies will need to be proficient to manage offshore 
client needs, and prove their experience and capacity to deliver quality services, on time, and on budget. To comply with 
requirements and service level agreed, companies will need to invest in tools and technical and soft skills.
Unify the national vision for digital entrepreneurship by developing a single digital  
economy policy and establishing a digital economy observatory
Establish a clear national vision for the development of the digital economy – captured within a single digital economy 
policy document and clearly define the role of digital entrepreneurship in achieving that vision. And establish an observatory 
that systematically captures data and tracks progress in Ghana’s development of the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem 
that is, number of startups, investment deals, jobs, and so on).DE.R1. 
DE.R2.
DE.R3.
DE.R4.
82Improve specific regulations for digital industries (that is taxes, IP rights, limited partnerships)
This would entail to (i) Creating tax policy, business registration, and insolvency rules that support startups and risk-taking 
entrepreneurial businesses; (ii) Utilizing procurement policy to incentivize production of digital solutions by local SMEs, 
specially IT-ITeS to scale up companies; (iii)Establishing a dedicated digital intellectual property (IP) track within Ghana’s 
IP office to raise awareness among SMEs about the value of trade secrets and how to protect them effectively; and (iv) 
Creating legislation to enable limited partnerships, and ensure that private equity/venture capital (PE/VC) regulations 
allow funds to be formed as limited partnerships.
DE.R6. Increase the pool of human capital with digital and entrepreneurial skills by amplifying existing efforts 
Explore the private partnerships for the provision of rapid digital skills programs combined with entrepreneurial skills (for 
example, Codetrain, MEST) to targeted underserved audiences, such as women and talent based at second-tier cities, by 
providing training grants and facilitating training spaces and mentorship participation.
DE.R7. Streamline and consolidate entrepreneurship support and entrepreneurship intermediaries
This would include (i) Streamlining and consolidating GoG support programs for digital SMEs and entrepreneurs; (ii) 
Restructuring and building capacity at GoG agencies that support digital entrepreneurship (NEIP, NBSSI, VCTF) to ensure 
adequate program funding, efficient operations, and incorporation of systematic monitoring and evaluation to assess 
impact of activities; (iii) Providing benchmarking and program funding for entrepreneurship hubs/intermediaries to boost 
their quality of support past the startup phase and in areas outside of Accra; and (iv) Providing intermediary organizations 
with funding to develop a platform that enables effective collaboration between these organizations.
Encourage early-stage private capital and credit guarantees access for startups and SMEs
The government should restructure the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) to ensure it operates as a trusted intermediary 
in the venture capital ecosystem by enforcing clear independent governance (for example an independent investment 
committee). Provide early-stage financing and VC industry-wide technical assistance (TA) through the VCTF that diversifies 
the stage of financing support (particularly sub-$500,000 investment deals), the types of partner vehicles (for example, 
seed funds, accelerators, angel networks), and the diversity of investment instruments (for example, venture debt, quasi-
equity). Encourage partial credit guarantees and other risk sharing mechanisms to lower the cost of capital from traditional 
financing institutions (that is, banks) to startups and SMEs. 
DE.R9. Analysing digital centers necessary for digital entrepreneurs to thrive across the country
Establish additional tech parks such as the Accra Digital Center to bring commercial rents down and provide affordable 
class-A real estate to digital startups and SMEs. It is important that these tech parks are established on the outskirts of 
major cities such as Accra and Tema to bring down rental prices. Furthermore, recommendations on digital infrastructure 
should be implemented to expand broadband coverage for opening the nationwide market for digital solutions.DI.R1.

83IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL SKILLS
Intimately linked to the overall digital economy are the skills and 
know-how of the workforce to innovate and implement digital 
technology. The drive to develop a digital economy would be of little 
use without human capital that possess the digital skills to operate 
and reap the benefits of it. Digital skills are not only the backbone 
of a digital economy, but it is critical to creating a level playing field 
that facilitates innovation (see box 2.8). The ability to harness talent, 
encourage technological innovation, and mobilize digital skills is key 
to economic growth. 
A transition in the global economy is underway what will disrupt 
the landscape for jobs and work. The Fourth Industrial Revolution 
is shaping the future where technological advancement promises 
disruption across sectors, requiring more complex skills and 
retraining of the workforce.
• About 65 percent of children entering primary school today, 
according to one estimate, will end up working in a job that does 
not yet exist (WEF 2018a). 
• Online platforms are enabling entirely new industries and 
redefining interactions with customers and employees. 
• Automation is changing the demand for labor as technological 
advancement makes it possible for machines to do the jobs once 
performed by people.Owing to the pace of innovation, a significant gap in supply and 
demand exists across all levels of digital skills in the region, 
especially on intermediate and advanced skills. Nearly 50 percent 
of subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year 
technical degree will be outdated by the time students graduate 
(WEF 2018a). The supply of digitally skilled labor in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and Ghana must increase to meet anticipated labor market 
needs or Africa’s economies will falter. Companies are turning to 
talent abroad, and while governments have taken steps to integrate 
information and communication technology in education, the 
policy response has not been sufficient. New models for skilling are 
required that will enable lifelong skills acquisition and retraining. 
The declining contribution of agriculture to Ghana’s economy 
and shift towards the services sector, entails equipping those 
households that were previously engaged with the agriculture 
sector with the necessary skills needed for job opportunities 
in the services sector. One of the objectives of the government’s 
overall theme of “Sowing the Seeds for Growth and Jobs” is to 
develop leadership skills, quality education, entrepreneurship, job 
skills, and creative skills. Digital skills are critical for spurring the 
digital economy in Ghana and enabling the country to become the 
IT hub for the West African subregion. 2.5 Digital Skills
• Basic digital skills are entry level 
functional skills required to make 
rudimentary use of digital devices and 
applications (UNESCO 2017). With basic 
digital skills, users are typically able to 
operate devices such as computers 
and smartphones, access and store 
information from online resources, and 
set up online accounts and profiles.• Intermediate digital skills enable 
individuals to use digital tools for more 
significant task-oriented purposes. 
Intermediate skills include using 
professional software for presentations 
and analytics, digital marketing and 
social media analytics, and web and 
graphic design. They can be used 
across business functions, such as 
accounting or project management.• Advanced digital skills allow people 
to use technology in empowering 
and transformative ways. UNESCO 
defines these as “the group of skills 
that form the basis of specialist ICT 
occupations and professions (UNESCO 
2017). Advanced skills may include 
programming, big data analytics, 
cloud computing, cybersecurity, 
web development, and search 
engine optimization.Digital skills refer to skills related to the use of technology. The development of ICT involves a set of skills that are continuously 
evolving and built upon as technology shapes our working lives. Skills are separated into three levels: basic, intermediate, and 
advanced (World Bank 2018d).BOX 2.8.  
DIGITAL SKILLS
84The influence of technology and automation means that the 
future of work will be very different to the present and will require 
a changing set of skills. Countries are faced with an unprecedented 
challenge of updating education systems built for another era. They 
must confront this reality to prepare the next generation of learners 
for an evolving landscape with new kinds of jobs, including digital 
skills and sociobehavioral skills.Global employers consider digital skills among the top seven 
skills required for the future workforce, with a higher proportion 
in Ghana recognizing this (see figure 2.14). While a demand-supply 
gap for all skills is identified, this implies a greater demand for these 
skills than their supply in the economy. This gap is even more severe 
in Sub-Saharan Africa and Ghana.

AfricaDIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS: CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL SKILLS 
The government is playing a significant role in building a workforce 
with strong digital skills. The current National ICT in Education Policy 
for Ghana (2015), first drafted in 2003 and subsequently reviewed 
in 2006 and 2008, states the mission to articulate the relevance, 
responsibility and effectiveness of utilizing ICT in the education 
sector. It aims at addressing current sector challenges and equipping 
Ghanaian learners, students, teachers, and communities to meet 
demand for 21st century skills. The policy document is structured 
around three pillars, each of which is expected to receive slightly 
different policy interventions and strategies to assure effectiveness, 
namely: (i) ICT as a learning and operating tool; (ii) ICT as integrated 
into teaching and learning; and (iii) ICT as a career option for students. 
The policy further places ICT as a fundamental subject to be taught 
from basic to more senior schools. Significant improvement on Internet access in schools have not 
enhanced quality levels throughout the education system yet. 
In the Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018, Ghana ranks 48th 
and 87th on quality of education and Internet access in schools, 
respectively (see figures 2.15 and 2.16). If compared to 2013-2014 
rankings, Ghana’s rank on Internet access in schools was 114th, which 
shows a meaningful improvement; while in quality of the educational 
system ranked the country at 46th, which shows stagnation. When 
compared to other countries in the region, only Kenya shows a 
better performance on both indicators.
In Ghana, half of the labor force will need digital skills. The IFC study found that the overall requirement for digital skills, assuming a 
workforce of more than 20 million Ghanaians, is expected to reach 50 percent by 2030 (IFC 2019b). This will comprise a 75 percent to 80 
percent usage rate in the formal sector and 45 to 50 percent in the informal sector. This figure, however, does not represent the entirety of 
the training demand since actual and new workforce skills needs incremental and renewal must be considered. Therefore, total digital skills 
training needs will climb to nearly 19 million by 2030 (see figure 2.17). FIGURE 2.15:

Globally, most of the top digital skills requested are basic level; however, in Ghana, emphasis is also given to intermediate and 
advanced skills as a mean to improve in competitiveness, especially in the burgeoning services sector. Respondents to the Global Digital 
Skills Survey19 agreed on the top digital skills required for the future workforce, regardless of geography (see figure 2.18); however, Ghanaian 
respondents expect more emphasis on intermediate skills, such as data analytics, use of professional software, and digital marketing.~4.1m

There are number of public sector efforts focused on young 
people. Policy efforts to expand employment outcomes among 
young people cut across the MDAs, including the Council for 
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (COTVET). COVET 
was established by Act of Parliament 718 in 2006 to coordinate 
and oversee all aspects of technical and vocational training across 
the formal and informal sectors. In 2012, the Parliament passed 
a Legislative Instrument (LI 2195) to legally enable COTVET to 
undertake registration and accreditation of training providers in the public and private sectors. COVET implements the National 
Apprenticeship Program (NAP) as well as the Ghana Skills 
Development Initiative (GSDI) in collaboration with the Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). Moreover, 
the Youth Employment Agency, established in 2015, aims to 
empower young people to contribute meaningfully to sustainable 
socioeconomic development of Ghana. 
Many private sector organizations and the nonprofit sector have 
undertaken training programs to contribute to and improve the 
labor force in Ghana, particularly among young people. The key 
focus of youth employment initiatives in Ghana is skills development 
and training, entrepreneurial training, apprenticeship, employment 
services, and direct employment. 
89The National ICT in Education Policy for Ghana continues to face 
considerable challenges, mainly related to its implementation. 
These include the absence of computer labs in schools, few or no 
computers in schools, lack of ICT teachers, and unstable or no power 
supply (National ICT in Education Policy for Ghana 2015). 
There is high demand for digitally skilled professionals in both 
the public and private sector in Ghana. Only a few Ghanaians have 
the required digital skills and experience beyond the basic use of 
a computer or tablet. In turn, the private sector is forced to pay a 
premium to attain these skills, which makes it even more difficult for 
the public sector to retain such professionals (World Bank 2017b). 
Respondents to the Global Digital Skills Survey in Ghana cited lack 
of access to practical educational experiences such as internships 
as the main obstacle, and education as the second biggest driver 
for the demand-supply gap found for digital skills. Employers across 
Sub-Saharan Africa report lack of access to workers with appropriate 
skills as a critical constraint to their growth and productivity (World 
Bank 2017b). The increasing demand for software developers, 
coders, cybersecurity professionals and project developers with 
relevant working experience would condition Ghana’s progress 
towards a successful and inclusive digital economy (World Bank 
2017b). 
Poor Development of foundational skills. Ghana stands out in the 
region for having steadily increased its preprimary net enrollment 
ratio from 63 percent in 2008 to 90 percent in 2014 (UNESCO 2015). 
This in part reflects the government’s commitment to meeting 
global development goals. However, studies of Ghana’s preschool 
sector have found that the curriculum is rarely implemented, and 
that quality is low across the country (Wolf 2018). Strengthening 
foundational skills from the earliest years of education will be critical 
for equipping next generations with the skills the economy would 
demand in the future. 
Supply of trained teachers. Ghana also faces a shortfall of 140,000 
teachers (IFC 2017) and qualified candidates are in short supply 
(World Bank 2018e). The GoG has set out national teacher training 
policies, though these have yet to be fully implemented and suffer 
from lack awareness, insufficient funding, and minimal infrastructure 
support facilities. 
Provision of quality learning resources. Digital skills improvement 
relies on students’ access to both these basic and additional 
technology-based learning materials. Computers are not equitably 
accessible and are often concentrated in a few schools that meet 
basic infrastructural needs to install them. In Ghana, employers also 
mention the lack of access to suitable ICT resources as one of the 
biggest challenges in digital talent recruitment (IFC 2019b).While there are various programs to bolster digital skills 
particularly among young people, systematic information and 
data on the scope of these programs is not available. Many 
efforts target digital skills for young people. For instance, the Youth 
Employment Agency (YEA) runs the largest program in terms of 
youth coverage, and it is just one of 17 public sector initiatives that 
support digital skills for young people. Moreover, little is known about 
which programs are most effective in bridging the digital skills gap 
in Ghana. To guide public policies and inform private efforts, more 
evidence is needed about the effectiveness of various initiatives and 
approaches in fostering youth employment and smooth transition 
from education and training to work. In addition, existing programs 
are mostly concentrated in urban areas and are not accessible to 
Ghanaians in rural areas. The majority of programs do not provide 
support or follow up beneficiaries, which dilutes their effectiveness 
and reduces opportunities for improvement. 
Because of price barriers, by 2030 only one million people will be 
able to afford intermediate and advanced digital skills training 
(see figure 2.20). Basic digital skills training programs are unlikely 
to be viable for business-to-consumer models since the potential 
for self-pay is limited and there is the expectation that such skills 
can be acquired at school age. Intermediate and advanced digitals 
skills courses provide an opportunity for the private sector to directly 
charge trainees. >>  Challenges

90Most private sector-led skills development initiatives are 
expensive for the population. Moreover, there is a wide gap 
between the cost associated with government and privately run 
initiatives. According to the 2016 Ghana Youth Employment Inventory 
Report, the cost of fully government-funded programs is ₵100–150 
(about $18-27) per participant, compared to the average cost of 
₵2,320 (about $425) per participant in private sector programs. Private 
sector training programs, including those run by corporate entities, 
NGOs, and civil society organizations, tend to be smaller in coverage 
and focus more on providing digital skills. By not addressing the digital skills gap, the country’s economic 
growth rate may not be sustained. A lack of digital skills could 
constrain the growth of Africa’s economies and reduce productivity 
just as more industries need to adopt digital technologies to drive 
productivity. IFC’s findings coming out of the Digital Skills in Sub-
Saharan Africa Spotlight on Ghana suggest:
• Nearly 20 percent of surveyed Ghanaian companies recruit only 
internationally. Of these, nearly 70 percent do so because they 
cannot find skilled local talent (see figure 2.21).
• Insights from market participants suggest that many employers 
are leveraging either in-house or externally secured training to fill 
gaps in employees’ digital skills.
• The demand-supply gap in digital skills could be harming 
productivity and compromising Sub-Saharan African 
competitiveness. The 80 percent of Ghanaian industry members 
consulted believe an undersupply in digital skills is likely to 
hamper economic growth in Ghana (see figure 2.22).

91RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
Improve basic digital skills provision in the education system 
The most effective training solution will depend to a large extent on the digital skills being taught throughout the education 
system as foundational skills. For basic skills, schools are perceived as the ideal platform for delivery. To spur improvement, 
policy makers need to create frameworks for public education institutions to leverage up-to-date digital skills training 
content. Take advantage of existing online training resources, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 
Boost supply of digitally literate teachers
Ghana also faces a shortfall of 140,000 teachers (IFC 2017) and qualified candidates are in short supply (World Bank 2018e). 
The GoG has set out national teacher training policies, though these have yet to be fully implemented because of a lack 
of awareness of the policies, insufficient funding, and minimal infrastructural support facilities. To tackle such challenges, 
GoG should invite other stakeholders to coinvest in them. 
Increase coverage of quality digital learning resources
To make computers equitably accessible by improving basic school infrastructure needs, especially in rural areas. In 
parallel, a mobile literacy curriculum could leverage mobile penetration to take better advantage of smart devices.
Align intermediate digital skills taught with future workforce needs
For intermediate skills, both school age and preemployment/postsecondary education are essential. To focus on 
employability, partnerships with the private sector are vital to improve the curriculum and provide relevant working 
experience (internships) during the schooling phase. The emphasis on the most demanded intermediate skills for the 
workforce is critical, such as data analytics, use of professional software, and digital marketing.
Scale and cofund advanced digital skills
Advance digital skills will require significant resources to upgrade the provision and coverage of effective training. The 
scale-up of the supply of advanced skills would require partnering with other stakeholders, including the private sector, 
donors, and private training service providers. These types of training surpass schooling years and encompass short 
courses such as rapid-skills training or bootcamps, typically from three to 12-months long, and with a mix of instructional 
methods geared towards practical learning rather than theoretical concepts. The private sector can provide business-to-
consumer training, while others may involve business-to-business or business-to-government services, and others may 
include ecosystem-building activities that contribute to broader sector development.
Provide digital skills to underrepresented groups
Conduct campaigns to provide digital skills to underrepresented groups, offer free or subsidized training, stimulate private 
scholarships by offering tax incentives for such scholarships, raise awareness in lagging communities with an outreach 
strategy. 
Establish a multistakeholder governance framework for coordinating efforts to foster digital skills with an 
ecosystem approach
There is space for multiple stakeholders to take multiple roles and actions to improve and ramp-up digital skills training. 
If efforts are not orchestrated, impact may be diminished. To articulate efforts, a governance framework should be 
established with an ecosystem approach (see table 2.11).DS.R1.

Conclusion: 
A Way 
Forward
To advance towards a vibrant digital economy that can foster 
Ghana’s leadership potential, a set of recommendations are 
proposed for the development of actions aimed at solving the 
challenges identified across the digital economy foundations. 
Recommendations are classified by level of priority: (i) quick-wins, for 
improvement actions with immediate benefit that can be delivered 
quickly with results; (ii) high-priority, for critical recommendations 
that cannot be delayed; and, (iii) long-term, for actions that focus 
on consolidating results while building the policy framework, 
infrastructure, systems, and capacity needed to achieve goals, and, 
therefore, whose implementation spans a longer timeframe. 
Ghana’s ability to position itself as a leading digital innovation 
hub will depend to a large extent on its ability to address risks 
and needs to strategically invest in the foundational elements 
of their digital economy. A holistic approach to digital economy 
development is necessary to maximize Ghana’s chance of attaining 
its digital potential. Rather than implementing multiple, fragmented 
interventions, a coordinated and high-level crossboundary approach 
that maximizes complementarities is needed for building an inclusive 
digital economy. To ultimately spur the development of high-impact 
applications for health, education, e-commerce, agriculture, and 
social service delivery, among others, while mitigating exclusion, 
fraud, and cyber risks.
All five foundations of the digital economy rely on a robust legal 
and regulatory framework that fosters competition. All areas of 
the digital economy require effective competition. Firms operating 
within the digital economy – whether to offer digital connectivity, 
payment solutions, or digital platforms – require a level playing 
field. Free market forces can help drive down prices and ramp up 
usage. At the same time, all aspects of the digital economy need to 
be inclusive, giving equal opportunity to men and women, and to 
the disadvantaged.
95• Expand digital services to bridge the 
urban-rural divide: digital transactions, 
connections, applications, and services 
have the potential to transform the 
way people, governments, businesses, 
governments, and civil society interact 
with each other. From parents enrolling 
their children in school, to social safety 
net administrators verifying the identity 
and eligibility of a new beneficiary, to 
businesses submitting their annual 
tax filings, the transactions that fill our 
daily lives have historically required 
paper forms, in-person visits during 
business hours, and cash payments. The 
combination of digital platforms with 
digital financial services and powered 
by digital infrastructure, skills, and 
entrepreneurship – support transactions, 
marketplaces, and other spaces that are 
on-demand, paperless, and cashless, 
and available through the Internet from 
anywhere in Ghana and the world. 
Increased access to digital services 
contributes to equity and inclusion of 
disadvantaged groups, such as farmers, 
rural households, and women, for 
instance, as they would be able to sell 
their local produce and homemade 
products. • Foster the growth of the local IT 
Industry beyond the boundaries of 
Ghana: the rise of the Internet has 
brought to ventures in Ghana, enhanced 
adoption and adaptation of digital 
technology by existing businesses, 
opened access to microwork jobs, and 
is expected to generate new digital jobs 
(that is, those that do not exist today) 
in both traditional industries and newly 
created industries. Recommendations 
for the growth of the local IT industry 
target the growth of digital firms as well 
as digital transformation of the private 
sector by leveraging digital technology 
to improve performance of nondigital 
businesses, having both expected 
impacts on boosting job creation. In 
this way, a strong digital private sector 
is expected to contribute to Ghana’s 
economic growth.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • Leverage digital technologies to 
improve quality and efficiency of 
service: digital transformation helps 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of core functions and services of 
both the public and private sectors, 
reduces duplication; combats fraud and 
corruption by increasing the security and 
traceability of transactions, and improves 
engagement and accountability. By 
providing trusted venues and resources 
for digital transactions, including tax 
filling and formal registrations, digital 
technologies enhance the ability of 
the government to generate revenues. 
Overall, improved quality and efficiency of 
services is linked to more productive use 
of the economy’s resources. The results of recommended interventions seek to support Ghana’s achievement of the goals set under the Digital Roadmap for the 
Beyond Aid Agenda (Digital Roadmap Concept Note, May 2019). Progress on implementing actions to enhance digital economy transition 
is expected to:

RELEVANCE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES
96Recommended priorities and Beyond Aid goals are intrinsically linked to the development outcomes of equity/inclusion, productivity and 
growth (see figure 3.1). 
Thus, the recommended interventions seek to support the 
achievement of three overarching goals included in the 
Digital Roadmap for the Beyond Aid in Ghana. The proposed 
recommendations include 37 interventions that target the three 
established goals: six recommendations seek to improve digital 
infrastructure; eight to strengthen digital platforms; seven to mature 
digital financial services; nine to promote digital entrepreneurship; 
and seven to develop digital skills. Tables 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 summarize 
the 37 recommendations, grouping them by Beyond Aid goal. Each recommendation follows from the analysis of the strengths 
and challenges in Ghana in the five foundational pillars (see 
appendix D for full descriptions of all recommendations). Each 
recommendation includes the expected development outcome, 
the type of intervention required, the government agencies that will 
need to coordinate to deploy such recommendation, the priority, 
the foundation pillar that gave origin, and the synergies to actions 
pursued in other foundations. PrioritiesInterventionsOutcome

dations 
to Enhance 
the Digital 
Economy 
in Ghana
119# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR
1DI.R1. Revise 
Broadband 
Speed TargetsGhana needs to revise its stated minimum threshold speeds for what constitutes broadband service, 
in line with the best ranked countries in competitiveness. Singapore, which ranked as the world’s 
fastest country by Cable.co.uk, has average speed of 70.86 Mbps more than five times Kenya and 20 
times Ghana.
2DI.R2. Develop 
a robust and 
comprehensive 
middle mile (domestic 
backbone 
infrastructure)Policies and actions should encourage additional investment in domestic backbone for more efficient 
utilization of existing infrastructure and completion of missing links. The NCA needs to provide better 
guidelines on infrastructure sharing for these and other emerging complementary infrastructure 
including those being provided by the Power Companies Gridco and ECG, as well as CSquared’s 
metro fiber. Promotion of infrastructure sharing will limit concentration/duplication of infrastructure in 
more profitable areas and redirect resources to underserved communities. The government needs to 
accelerate efforts to complete the counterpart Western Corridor project to ensure a more redundant 
national backbone. The planned connectivity transaction, led by NITA, under the World Bank-funded 
eTransform Ghana program should also help here.
3DI.R3. Increased 
investment in Last 
Mile Infrastructure The government needs to be more proactive in the use of resources to partner with private sector in the 
extension of services to more underserved communities. 
4DI.R4. Revise 
Spectrum Allocation 
and Award of 
Unified LicensesThe NCA needs to revise its spectrum policy to allow more competition, investment, and expansion of 
broadband for all Ghanaians. The award of additional frequency spectrum emerging from the digital 
TV migration process should also be more open. A unified licensing regime could introduce more 
competition in the sector for both 3G and 4G operators and could encourage more investment in 
broadband services at competitive cost to operators. Additional 4G licenses have been issued to three 
broadband wireless operators who are restricted to data.
5DI.R5. Streamline 
effective 
implementation of 
Cybersecurity Policy 
and StrategyGhana needs to unfold a cyber-conscious culture across the economy, particularly financial institutions 
and SMEs, with a national program that raises awareness of cybersecurity risks and secure online 
behavior. Task regulators, in particular MoC and BoG, need to mandate the implementation of a 
nationally agreed baseline of IT security standards, including procurement processes and in all steps of 
software development.
6DI.R6. Explore and 
encourage private 
sector solutions 
for data storage 
capacity needsAssess the local data storage requirements and foster partnerships with the private sector to avoid 
disconnection to market needs. A cascade approach should be followed before investing more public 
resources to ensure Ghana’s data storage needs are fulfilled.
# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL PLATFORMS PILLAR
7DP.R1. Strengthen 
NITA to facilitate 
the citizen-centric 
development 
of public sector 
digital platformsNITA is a key player both as a service provider for MDAs and as an institutional anchor for the development 
of public sector digital platforms. As such, it requires both a significant boost in financing as well as a 
serious investment in its institutional, technical, human, and leadership capacity. The lack of trust in NITA’s 
ability to provide services to MDAs is a bottleneck for the development of shared services and for utilizing 
the existing preconditions for interoperability. 
8DP.R2. Prioritize the 
rollout of Digital ID 
to enable access to 
digital servicesThe rollout of the Ghana Card program will lift the key constraints both on citizens’ access to digital services 
as well as increase their efficiency and effectiveness. At the same time, to truly maximize the citizens’ use 
of digital services, the rollout of the digital ID must go hand-in-hand with upgrade of NITA servers and an 
information and communication campaign to encourage their usage.
120# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL PLATFORMS PILLAR
9DP.R3. Emphasize 
public sector digital 
capacity buildingThe ability of the Ghanaian public sector to capitalize on digital back-office systems, shared services, and 
to provide digital services to citizens critically depends on the ongoing development of digital capacity 
among civil servants. The current situation suffers from very thin in-house capacity and an overreliance 
on contractors for ongoing upgrades. Building a cadre of government ICT professionals who work 
together with other technical specialists will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing 
digital government platforms and their further development. This includes better change management to 
increase in trust in digital platforms.
10DP.R4. Strengthen 
Protection of 
Ghanaians’ data There is a need to strengthen data protection expertise with international knowledge sharing activities 
on international good practices on data protection. The government’s commitment to protect Ghanaians 
personal data should warrant DPC’s independence with own financial and logistic allocations to increase 
the operational capacity for awareness raising activities, investigations, and enforcement. 
11DP.R5. Revamp and 
enhance GODI to 
maximize social 
and economic 
value of public 
data The adoption of proper licensing regime for GODI would be the first quick-win step from the open 
data policy making perspective. An open data policy that serves government users in Ghana and other 
“supply-side” organizations, and citizens and private sector consumers. Open data needs to provide policy 
guidance, instructions, requirements, and tools for implementing open data effectively in Ghana. The policy 
would need to spell out which types of data may not be considered open and why, and how to safeguard 
sensitive information. It may also enhance the governance of the GODI, describe interagency working 
groups and provide points of contact. The GSS must also venture into new territories and explore the 
potential role that big and open data could play in the development and dissemination of official statistics.
12DP.R6. Develop 
a coordinated 
digital commerce 
support programBuild on a multiagency coordinated action plan, with a multistakeholder approach with a clear champion. 
The program should take advantage of ongoing local government efforts (such as NYA and NEIP), 
regional efforts (such as the Nairobi Manifesto on the Digital Economy and Inclusive Development in Africa 
(UNCTAD 2018) and private digital platforms (domestic and regional) to increase crossborder market 
(such as Jumia). Actions need to go beyond online advertising and move towards facilitating individuals 
and MSMEs (urban and rural) to complete digital commerce transactions to increases B2C and B2B in the 
country; and, build-up online reputation for individuals, MSMES, and the country itself. Domestic efforts 
regarding training, rural coverage, logistics, and building trust on domestic commerce could benefit from 
lessons learned in international experiences, especially the Taobao Villages case.
13DP.R7. 
Institutionalize 
data production 
and availability for 
evidence-based 
digital commerce 
policies Collecting data to monitor digital commerce and the collaborative economy turns fundamental to define 
and assess policy actions and to measure the digital economy. Ghana needs to conduct enterprise surveys 
with special attention on innovation and technology (the most recent took place in 2013). To determine 
which questions and topics to include in surveys, the Ghana Statistical Services can review UNCTAD's 
"Questionnaire for Official Statistics on the ICT sector, and ICT use by enterprises" (https:/ /unctad.org/en/
Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/ICT4DQuestionnaire.aspx) and the variables collected by Eurostat regarding 
ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises. Surveys should be conducted every two years to maintain 
the relevance of the data collected. Data to monitor digital commerce and the collaborative economy 
is fundamental to assess policy actions and to measure the digital economy. Given global efforts on 
standardization for digital commerce data, this recommendation focuses on bridging Ghana’s data gap on 
digital commerce and is intrinsically linked to the forth recommendation in digital entrepreneurship (R4) on 
a digital economy observatory. 
14DP.R8. Establish 
a Regulatory 
Sandbox for Digital 
Commerce and 
Gig Economy labor 
regulations. Whether and how to regulate these topics are ongoing discussion globally with no consensus on which 
is the better regulatory framework to adopt. A regulatory sandbox could provide a safe space to test 
innovative approaches in collaboration with the private sector and without damping the benefits of the 
digital economy. Topics could cover pay conditions, competition, tax regime, data protection, among others. 
12115DFS.R1. Mobile 
Money InteroperabilityHigh mobile phone penetration, investments in robust agent networks and a proliferation of use 
cases have made mobile money one of the most promising drivers of financial inclusion in Ghana. 
Recent steps to implement interoperability are promising, especially as they reduce barriers to use 
and acceptance of digital payments by allowing for the seamless transfer of funds across providers. 
However, in order to go beyond technical interoperability, which has sometimes failed to drive 
transaction volumes in other markets, a more holistic perspective is needed. For interoperability 
specifically, this means looking at governance and business rules that drive incentives in the scheme 
(who can participate and under what conditions, pricing, and so on). Specific recommendations 
include allowing fintechs to connect to GhIPSS, while also revisiting rules around transaction pricing 
to encourage greater adoption by customers. Furthermore, government should consider expanding 
interoperability to allow both mobile money providers and fintechs to participate in GhIPSS InstantPay, 
thereby facilitating real-time interoperable payments that would increase the attractiveness of digital 
payments versus cash.
16DFS.R2. Drive 
greater digitization 
through opening 
new channels for 
government paymentsCurrent efforts to promote E-Zwich card usage by using the cards to pay government salaries and 
benefits have led to the successful digitization of these payment streams. However, the lack of 
merchant acceptance points and cash in/cash out points mean that the funds in these accounts are 
immediately withdrawn upon receipt. Government should endeavor to open up payment options for 
recipients so that they can choose the most convenient mode of payment, including mobile money. By 
offering payment to recipients’ preferred provider, there is a greater likelihood that the funds will remain 
in digital form and will thus contribute to Ghana’s cash-lite vision.
17DFS.R3. Encourage 
competition and 
promote an enabling 
environment to drive 
DFS innovationThe roll out of the biometric Ghana Card national ID, digital addressing through Ghana Post GPS, and 
real-time payments through GhIPSS Instant Pay present an enormous opportunity for digital financial 
services. Markets such as India, Bangladesh, Thailand, and others have connected these pieces of 
infrastructure to offer a range of new use cases and overcome barriers to DFS use. For example, 
biometric ID and digital addressing systems and can be leveraged to create a digital KYC utility that 
automates customer due diligence and overcomes barriers to account opening. These systems could 
also be connected to create a secure store of personal data that could be shared on-demand with 
providers in order to qualify for credit or other financial services. Additionally, connecting ID systems 
to real-time payments can further enhance interoperability by enabling customers to perform instant 
transactions everywhere regardless of devices, provider or account type by simply verifying their 
biometric identity. Such a system could help to overcome barriers to merchant payments and increase 
competition by levelling the playing field between banks, MNOs, and fintechs. Increasing the use of 
DFS depends on ensuring affordability and relevance of use cases to citizens and businesses alike. 
One way to achieve this goal is through encouraging greater competition, which drives innovation and 
pushes down costs, thus producing greater value for customers. The government should proceed with 
the implementation of the draft Payment System and Services Bill in a way that facilitates risk-based 
licensing and oversight of fintechs by the Bank of Ghana. The Bank of Ghana should also allow fintechs 
to connect to GhIPSS and participate in the country’s interoperability scheme in order to level the 
playing field and allow them to compete directly with banks and MNOs. Finally, the government should 
continue to resist proposals to impose new taxes on mobile money transactions, which risks driving up 
prices and slowing Ghana’s transition to a cash-lite economy. # Recommendation Description
DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PILLAR
12218DFS.R4. Adopt policies 
that encourage 
greater use of 
merchant paymentsA key barrier to further advances in digitization is the low uptake of merchant payments. When 
customers cannot use electronic funds to pay for goods and services, there is a greater likelihood 
that they will convert these to cash, thus undermining the government’s vision of a cash-lite economy. 
Working with providers to reduce the cost of merchant payment transactions is one way to increase the 
attractiveness of paying digitally, while interoperability and other policies that ease the cost of merchant 
acquisition can increase acceptance points and thus the convenience of digital payments. 
19DFS.R5. Expand rural 
adoption by facilitating 
investments in last 
mile infrastructure 
and the digitization 
of agricultural 
value chainsGiven the importance of agriculture to Ghana’s economy, particularly key value chains such as cocoa, 
digitization of payments along these value chains could contribute significantly to rural adoption of DFS, 
which currently lags behind that of urban citizens. Government should work with providers to stimulate 
investment in rural network coverage, agents, and merchants that make DFS more accessible to rural 
households. Policies that encourage the sharing of infrastructure like towers and agents can help 
expand coverage. Additionally, incentives such as tax rebates or other support offered to providers who 
invest in underserved rural communities could help to narrow the access gap. Finally, the government 
should work with agribusinesses and the Cocoa Board to encourage digitization of bulk payments to 
producers, which can help to drive adoption and usage of DFS not only among farmers but also within 
rural economies. 
20DFS.R6. Strengthen 
digital financial 
consumer 
protection policiesThere must be a well-developed strategy for digital financial customer protection regulation that 
covers areas such as effective consumer redress through internal dispute resolution (IDR) and 
external dispute resolution (EDR) mechanisms and supervision by the Bank of Ghana. A well-regulated 
consumer services protection policy will boost confidence in the usage of digital financial services. 
Ghana currently boasts a comprehensive framework for consumer recourse that applies to all financial 
services providers. But the framework for disclosure is fragmented, with a specific regulation on credit 
products, disclosure provisions included in the e-money guidelines, but no rules for savings products. 
Protections against error and fraud in payments services are also insufficient (CGAP 2018b). The country 
should push for a more comprehensive disclosure framework. Furthermore, given the importance 
of protecting consumer privacy and data, Efforts should be made to ensure that adequate resources 
are allocated to the Data Protection Agency (DPA) and it should be empowered to supervise service 
provider compliance.
21DFS.R7. DFS and 
e-money regulation 
and surveillanceThe government needs to strengthen the Digital Financial Services M&E and compliance procedures, 
implementing an efficient surveillance system and a robust regulation framework for E-Money Issuers, 
especially regarding; capital requirements, provisions to cover financial risks and e-money issuing 
permissions. The Payment Services and Systems Bill (“PSSB”) under consideration by the government 
must be reinforced with more budget for an effective implementation. The E-Money Guidelines 
foresee that electronic money will be issued by both regulated financial institutions and duly licensed 
nonbank entities (such as subsidiaries of MNOs and other third parties) engaged solely in the business 
of e-money and incidental activities, defined as Dedicated Electronic Money Issuers (DEMIs). While they 
came into force since 2015, the E-Money Guidelines have not yet been fully implemented. Therefore, 
although direct licensing of DEMIs is possible in theory, given the lack of implementation, e-money 
issuers have not yet been licensed and are still being regulated informally (BTCA 2017). Likewise, 
capacity building of public workers and private companies' experts in this field is a must.# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PILLAR
12322DE.R1. Develop IT-
ITeS sector programs 
to support the 
scale up of Ghana’s 
exports, players, 
digital innovation, 
and expertise.Advancing towards a vibrant digital economy requires a national private sector policy approach. Public 
efforts need to capitalize those made on digital infrastructure, public digital platforms (government 
digitization), and digital financial services. Policies are needed to develop a competitive IT-ITeS sector 
and to accelerate private sector transformation taking advantage of digital innovation for improved 
productivity. To transform Ghana into the most relevant digital hub in Africa requires a bigger footprint 
of capable and innovative IT-ITeS companies operating in the country. What involves increasing jobs, 
exports, number and size of local and global players, while boosting innovation within the sector. The 
IT-ITeS sector comprises entrepreneurs, SMEs, large indigenous companies, and global players, and 
efforts to facilitate their scale up in headcount and expertise calls for targeted and connected initiatives 
where government agencies play an active role in collaboration with the private and academic sector
23DE.R2. Develop a 
digital technology 
adoption program 
to accelerate digital 
transformation of the 
economy, especially 
SMEs. Joint efforts among government and IT sector can help nurture and accelerate digital transformation 
of the private and public sector in Ghana, especially SMEs, women-owned businesses, and nondigital 
sectors. According to BCG, 7 out of the 10 most innovative companies are digital natives and thus 
digital innovators; and while 79 percent of strong innovators reported that they have properly digitized 
innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators made the same change (BCG 2018). Digital 
innovation adoption of private and public sectors can be done with country-based IT companies, but 
initiatives will be needed to ramp the local IT sector into an innovative digital partner. To improve the 
supply of business-ready ideas and innovations, including disruptive technologies (that is artificial 
intelligence, the Internet of Things, and robotics) GoG can establish programs or instruments to promote 
R&D, technological innovation, and digital upgrading in Ghana's private sector in the form of competitive 
grants or tax incentives for research and development. Also, provide more incentives and platforms 
for collaboration between research institutes, universities, and the private sector through collaborative 
research grants or centers of excellence for ICT or digital solutions.
24DE.R3. Articulate 
Ghana’s value 
proposition to position 
Ghana as a relevant 
global Digital HubTo become a trusted destination the country needs to showcase its expertise, business infrastructure, 
and a set of capable and competitive companies based in Ghana. Positioning Ghana´s name as a top of 
mind destination to outsource and invest, goes beyond a branding campaign and event participation. To 
build an articulate message of Ghana’s value proposition, a portfolio of capable IT companies operating 
in the country and a set of satisfied customers willing to share their experience while working with a 
Ghana based company are needed. Exporting companies will need to be proficient to manage offshore 
client needs; and prove their experience and capacity to deliver quality services, on time, and on 
budget. To comply with requirements and service level agreed, companies will need to invest in tools 
and technical and soft skills.
25DE.R4. Unify 
the national 
vision for digital 
entrepreneurship 
by developing 
a single digital 
economy policy and 
establishing a digital 
economy observatoryEstablish a clear national vision for the development of the digital economy – captured within a single 
digital economy policy document and clearly define the role of digital entrepreneurship in achieving that 
vision. And establish an observatory that systematically captures data and tracks progress on Ghana’s 
development of the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem (for example, number of startups, investment 
deals, jobs, and so on).# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  PILLAR
12426DE.R5. Improve 
specific regulations 
for digital industries 
(that is taxes, IP rights, 
limited partnerships)This would entail (i) Creating tax policy, business registration, and insolvency rules that support startups 
and risk-taking entrepreneurial businesses; (ii) Utilizing procurement policy to incentivize production 
of digital solutions by local SMEs, specially IT-ITeS to scale up companies; (iii)Establishing a dedicated 
digital intellectual property (IP) track within Ghana’s IP office to raise awareness among SMEs about the 
value of trade secrets and how to protect them effectively; and (iv) Creating legislation to enable limited 
partnerships, and ensure that private equity/venture capital (PE/VC) related regulations allow PE/VC 
funds to be formed as limited partnerships.
27DE.R6. Create a pool 
of human capital 
with digital and 
entrepreneurial skills Develop curricula at all levels of the education system for missing skills and IT-literacy support. Ensure 
digital skills become a central component of education and skills development programs in tertiary 
institutions. Encourage private provision of rapid digital skills programs (for example Codetrain, MEST).
28DE.R6. Streamline 
and consolidate 
entrepreneurship 
support and 
entrepreneurship 
intermediariesThis would include (i) Streamlining and consolidating GoG support programs for digital SMEs 
and entrepreneurs; (ii) Restructuring and building capacity at GoG agencies that support digital 
entrepreneurship (NEIP, NBSSI, VCTF) to ensure adequate program funding, efficient operations, and 
incorporation of systematic monitoring and evaluation to assess impact of activities; (iii) Providing 
benchmarking and program funding for entrepreneurship hubs/intermediaries to boost their quality 
of support past the startup phase and in areas outside of Accra; and (iv) Providing intermediary 
organizations with funding to develop a platform that enables effective collaboration between 
these organizations.
29DE.R7. Boost early-
stage risk capital 
financing and access 
to credit for SMEsThe government should restructure the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) to ensure it operates as a 
trusted intermediary in the venture capital ecosystem by enforcing clear independent governance (for 
example, an independent investment committee). Provide early stage financing and VC industry-wide 
technical assistance (TA) through the VCTF that diversifies the stage of financing support (particularly 
sub-$500,000 investment deals), the types of partner vehicles (for example, seed funds, accelerators, 
angel networks), and the diversity of investment instruments (for example, venture debt, quasi-equity). 
Encourage partial credit guarantees and other risk sharing mechanisms to lower the cost of capital from 
traditional financing institutions (that is banks) to startups and SMEs.
30DE.R8. Establish Digital 
Centers necessary for 
digital entrepreneurs 
to thrive across 
the countryEstablish additional tech parks such as the Accra Digital Center to bring commercial rents down and 
provide affordable class-A real estate to digital startups and SMEs. It is important that these tech parks 
are established on the outskirts of major cities such as Accra and Tema to bring down rental prices. 
Furthermore, to implement recommendations on digital infrastructure to expand broadband coverage 
for opening the nationwide market for digital solutions.# Recommendation Description
DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  PILLAR
12531DS.R1. Improve basic 
digital skills provision 
at education system The most effective training solution will depend to a large extent on the digital skill level being taught 
throughout the education system as foundational skills. For basic skills, schools are perceived as the 
ideal platform for delivery. To spur improvement, policy makers need to create frameworks for public 
education institutions to leverage up-to-date digital skills training content. Take advantage of existing 
online training resources, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 
32DS.R2. Boost 
supply of digitally 
savvy teachersGhana also faces a shortfall of 140,000 teachers (IFC 2017) and qualified candidates are in short supply 
(World Bank 2018e). The GoG has set out national teacher training policies, though these have yet 
to be fully implemented due to a lack of awareness of the policies, insufficient funding, and minimal 
infrastructural support facilities. To tackle such challenges, GoG should invite other stakeholders to 
coinvest in them.
33DS.R3. Increase 
coverage of 
quality digital 
learning resourcesTo make computers equitably accessible by improving basic school infrastructure needs, especially 
in rural areas. In parallel, mobile literacy curriculum could leverage mobile penetration to take better 
advantage of smart devices.
34DS.R4. Align 
intermediate 
digital skills 
taught with future 
workforce needsFor intermediate skills, both school age and preemployment/postsecondary education are essential. 
To focus on employability, partnerships with private sector would turn vital to improve the curriculum 
and provide relevant working experience (internships) during the schooling phase. The emphasis on 
the most-demanded intermediate workforce skills is critical, such as data analytics, use of professional 
software, and digital marketing.
35DS.R5. Scale and 
co-fund advanced 
digital skillsAdvance digital skills will require significant resources to upgrade the provision and coverage of 
effective training. The scale up of the supply of advanced skills would require partnering with other 
stakeholders, including the private sector, donors, private training service providers. These types 
of training surpass schooling years and encompass short courses such as rapid-skills training or 
bootcamps, typically from three to 12-month long, and with a mix of instructional methods geared 
towards practical learning rather than theoretical concepts. The private sector can provide business-to-
consumer training, others may involve business-to-business or business-to-government services, others 
may include ecosystem-building activities that contribute to broader sector development.
36DS.R6. Provide digital 
skills to under-
represented groupsConduct campaigns to provide digital skills to underrepresented groups, offer free or subsidized 
training, stimulate private scholarships by offering tax incentives for such scholarships, raise awareness 
in lagging communities with an outreach strategy.
37DS.R7. Establish a 
multistakeholder 
governance 
framework for 
coordinating 
efforts to foster 
digital skills with an 
ecosystem approachThere is space for multiple stakeholders to take multiple roles and actions to improve and ramp-up 
digital skills training. If efforts are not orchestrated impact can be diminished. To articulate efforts a 
governance framework should be established with an ecosystem approach.# Recommendation Description
