ICT empowers rural women? Evide nce from poor counties in China

China has been proactively investing in ICT development in recent decades. From late 
2015, China started implementing pilot telecommunication servi ce projects and further 
integrating 4G network into these pilot projects with more focus on poor villages.  
Meanwhile, there is abundant papers research on ICT for development. However, the 
link between ICT and broader social welfare such as women empowerm ent is still not 
explicit, especially with sparse empirical evidence on their relationship.  
In this context, we first examine the possible mechanism and channels under which ICT 
may contribute to women empowerment.  Then we use two -year panel dataset, coll ected 
from farm household in poor rural China during 2015 -2018, to regress the women 
empowerment indicator and ICT adoption in addition to a set of control variables, 
gaining a fixed effects  estimator to evaluate possible effect of ICT application on 
women  empowerment . For possible endogeneity , we further identify an instrument to 
solve the issue.  
Although ICT has the potential s of changing women in all aspects, t he empirical results 
from our sample haven’t show n significant effect of ICT on women empowermen t, 
which implies that it may be  a chanellage for women to transform technologies into 
income geneating activities, and economic earnings don’t necessarily change the gender 
relation in a household for a short term. The insignificant results  also inform pol icies 
and government initiatives aimed at using ICT tools for development outcomes 
especially from gender perspective.   
Key words: ICT adoption, women empowerment, rural China

Information communications technologies (ICTs), include both the information 
infrastructure -wires, transmitters, computers - and the information technology, i.e. the 
applications and content that travel through these infrastructure (Pigato 2001) , have 
been changing the world and the way people work and live. They not only provide 
opportunities for those who use ICTs, but also present challenges for those who are left 
behind (FAO 2018) . During the period of 2005 to 2019, the number of internet users 
grew on average by 10 per cent every year with an estimated 4.1 billion people using 
the internet around  the world at the end of 2019, while there were only 19 per cent of 
individ uals online in the least developed countries (LDCs) with the lowest mobile 
phone ownership rates found in Africa and South Asia (ITU 2019) . China has also been 
proactively investing in ICT development in last decade.  From late 2015, China started 
implem enting pilot telecommunication service projects and further integrating 4G 
network into these pilot projects with more focus on poor villages.  As of October 2019, 
more than 98% of administrative villages  in China have connected with optical fiber 
network a nd 4G network.  Meanwhile, t he internet penetration rate reach ed 46.2 percent  
as of March 2020 , which was 30.3 percent lower than urban areas but 7.8 percent higher 
than 2018  (CNNIC 2020) . 
A growing body of literature reveals that ICT, pa rticularly mobile phones  and internet , 
has the potential of contributing to agricultural sector (Deichmann, Goyal et al. 2016, 
Abdul -Salam and Phimister 2017, Kaila and Tarp 2019) , including technology  adoption  
and extension services  (Aker 2011, Fu and Akter 2016, Maredia, Reyes et al. 2018) , 
market access  (Muto and Yamano 2009, Zanello 2012, Fan and Salas Garcia 2018) , 
market price (Aker 2010, Shimamoto, Yamada et al. 2015, Nsabimana and Amuakwa -
Mensah 2018) , and off -farm activities (Muto 2009) . However, the evidence is mixed, 
on the one hand, the effect of ICTs depends on what sophisticated the technologies are, 
for example, audiovisual messages have significantly effect on farmers’ agricultural 
practices, but little evidence of an inc remental effect of the interactive voice response 
service or short message services  (Van Campenhout, Spielman et al. 2020) . On the other 
hand, some research argued that ICTs had  limited effects such as the effects of mobile 
phones on agricultural market performance  at micro -level (Nakasone, Torero et al. 2014, 
Tadesse and Bahiigwa 2015, Aker and Ksoll 2016) . 
From a broader perspective of soci al welfare, there is also a number of papers 
researching on ICT for development. Existing research shows that ICT use has 
improved several development outcomes such as household income (Chang and Just 
2009, Khanal an d Mishra 2016) , food security and nutrition (Nakasone and Torero 2016, 
Parlasca, Mußhoff et al. 2020)  , women empowerment  (Sekabira and Qaim 2017)  and 
poverty allevia tion (Mariscal Avilés, Benítez Larghi et al. 2016) . Among these 
development topics, women empowerment is one of  important content s. Since 2000, 
the potential of ICT for empowering wome n has been long discussed, some researchers 
have suggested that new technologies could enhance women's skills and capabilities 
(Mitchell & Gillis, 2007) , create opportunities for women to exchange information and 
engage in e -commerce activities  (Marcelle, 2002) . The empowering process makes ICT 
such as mobile phone as catalyzing women’s self -consciousness and further clustering 
individuals toward female collective power  (Pei and Chib 2020) . However, other 
research illustrated that such a straight outcome was not always the case. Findings 
suggest that mobile phones are not inherently empowering to women, and they also can 
serve as a de vice that strengthens hierarchical power relations between women and men 
under specific circumstances (Garcia 2011) .  
In this context, we raised the research questions: does the ICT development has changed 
women’ role in their family? This study first examines  the possible pathways for ICT’s 
contribution to women empowerment  under a conceptual fr amework. Then  we use two -
year panel dataset, collected from farm household in poor rural China during 2015 -
2018, to regress the women empowerment indicator and ICT adoption in addition to a 
set of control variables, gaining a fixed effects  estimator to eva luate possible effect of 
ICT application on women empowerment, where the respective indicator of women 
empowerment is composite  measures  conducted by intra -household decision -making 
in dimensions of livelihood and the key variable of interest (ICT) measure d by 
smartphone ownership at the household level. For possible endogeneity caused by 
reverse causality or simultaneity, we further identify the number of smartphone owners 
among the f ive nearest neighbors based on GIS coordinates as an instrument for 
smart phone ownership.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a conceptual framework to 
examine the possible mechanism and channels under which ICT may contribute to 
women empowerment . Section 3 presents the methodology to detect the impact of IC T 
on women empowerment, including data collection , measuring women empowerment, 
empirical specification , and descriptive statistics. Section 4 and 5 report the results of 
empirical models and discuss the main findings. Section 6 gives the summary and 
concl usions.  
 
Conceptual framework  
International society has attached great importance to the role of information and 
communication technologies for development (ICT4D)  since 1990s.  The application of 
internet sparked growing interests in ICTs, especially in ho w ICTs could be applied in 
developing countries in the 1990s, then ICTs was viewed as a new tool to achieve the 
development goals just when international development moved back to the policy 
agenda and searched for a delivery mechanism . In this context, a large number of 
ICT4D projects, represented typically by telecenters, began rolling out mainly by 
international development organizations during ICT4D 1.0 and gradually move forward 
to ICT4D 2.0 with a demand -driven focus (Heeks 2008) . At the same time, ICT4D 
research has also come a long way from simply reporting cases to gaining a deeper 
understanding based on theories. The review of the link between ICT and development 
(Sein et al., 2018 ) showed us a holistic picture that ICT4D researchers have adopted 
many theories to interpret their findings, including development theories, theories 
conceptualizing ICT and theories on transformative processes linking ICT to 
development. Still, the role of ICT in fostering development has been being debated 
(Walsham, 2017).  Many researchers have raised their concerns  on ICT4D projects and 
emphasized to learn from the lessons since most  projects have failed to meet the 
expectation or assumption of the desi gners (Heeks 2002, Kleine and Unwin 2009) . 
Likewise, more papers have urged to pay attention to the conditions under which ICT4D 
initiatives could empower the marginalized groups (Kivunike, Ekenberg et al. 2011, 
Dasuki, Abbott et al. 2014, Coelho, Segatto et al. 2015, Dasuki and Abbott 2015, 
Mariscal Avilés, Benítez Larghi et al. 2016, Poveda and Roberts 2018, Hoque 2020)  . 
For those literatures which have focused on the deman d of marginalized groups for 
ICT4D initiatives, one of the most used theories  is Capability Approach  (Sen 1999) , 
which has  had an increasing  influence  in the literature of development economics . 
According to CA, means to achieve, freedom to achieve and achievement are 
differentiated  (Zheng and Walsham 2008) , and there are several sets of factors 
influencing the conversion of a commodity to a capability, as well as the choice to act 
on the opportunity (Sen, 1992) . In the CA, ICTs are seen as a me an to an end, rather 
than an end in itself  (Zheng and Walsham 2008) , which argues for a conceptualization 
of development as a process designed to enable people to free themselves from 
structural disadvantage.  In addition, CA has also  contributed to development d iscourse 
by stressing the importance of agency and empowerment , which provides theoretical 
link between ICTs and women empowerment.  
Women empowerment is a multidisciplinary  and multidimensional concept, which 
usually has different meanings in specific cont exts. For one of classic review papers 
(Kabeer 1999) , women's empowerment is about the process by which those who have 
been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire such an ability , which 
provides an analytic framework and constitutes three inter -related dimensions: 
resources, agency and achievements. R esources are defined  broadly to include not only 
access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources; agency 
includ es processes of decision making, as well as l ess measurable manifestations of 
agency such as negotiation, deception and manipulation; and achievements are well-
being outcomes. In many literatures, agency is viewed as the essence of women’s 
empowerment (Malhotra and Schuler 2005) , but it cannot be treated as synonymous 
with empowe rment, because actors may be constrained by their opportunity structure 
which influence their ability to transform agency into action (Alsop, Bertelsen et al. 
2006) . Comparing to other empowerment subsets of society (the poor, ethnic minorities, 
and so on) , women’s empowerment has its unique concerns such as cro ss-cutting 
category and intra -household relations (Malhotra and Schuler 2005) . In the context of 
gend er consideration, the empowerment approach is further applied at individual level, 
which is needed because men and women experience development programs differently 
and are affected differently. The existing evidence suggests that ICTs  is not gender -
neutra l (Hafkin 2002, Gurumurthy 2004)  and digital tools and methodologies need to 
be fit for the purpose of challenging and ending digital divide (O'Donnell and 
Sweetman 2018) .

The role of ICT for women in agricultural production and market  
Many developing countries have been experiencing feminization of agriculture 
associated with male labor out -migration (Radel, Schmook et al. 201 2, de Brauw, 
Huang et al. 2013, Mukhamedova and Wegerich 2018, Pattnaik, Lahiri -Dutt et al. 2018, 
Upreti, Ghale et al. 2018) . Although the relationship of feminization of agriculture with 
women's social or economic empowerment has highly been discussed an d debated 
(Srivastava 2011, Pattnaik, Lahiri -Dutt et al. 2018) , ICT may still have the potentials of 
contributing to agricultural performance through technology training and market 
participation. Women farmers said that agro -advisory messaging helped them make 
more efficient use of inputs by increasing their knowledge about climate -smart 
technologies (Mittal 2016) . The transition from powerlessness to empowerment is 
possible when women control over the mobile phone as a learning tool through the 
demonstration of technologies and the low -cost technologies offer means t o accelerate 
this process in the context of social capital. The mobile phone represents a force for 
change in the market women’s economic activities such as street markets (Larsson and 
Svensson 2018) . In addition , the impact of ICT on market price is related to intra -
household allocation of mobile phones. Evidence showed that whether the household 
owns a mobile phone ha d no impact on price, but whether a farmer or spouse owns a 
mobile phone was associated with an increase in price (Lee and Bellemare 2013) . For 
potato markets in Bolivia where women are responsible for negotiating prices, making 
sales and controlling potato -generated incomes, the roles of women in marketing 
process remained s trong while access to cellular phones had expanded market choices 
(Urquieta and Alwang 2012) .  
 
The role of ICT for women ’ s off -farm employment  
Off-farm employment is one of important channels for rural women participating in 
economic activities. Research literatures have show ed that off-farm employment can 
improve t he level of rural women's empowerment  (Antman 2014, Seeberg and Luo 
2018, Maligalig, Demont et al. 2019) , but rural women’s off -farm employment choices 
are usually influenced by many caring considerations such as ch ildcare and eldercare 
(Qiao, Rozelle et al. 2015, Wang, Han et al. 2016, Ding, Dong et al. 2018, Mao, 
Connelly et al. 2018, Xie, Liu et al. 2019) . It is of crucial importance  for migrant women 
to maintain frequent c ontacts with those who are left behind. Mobile phone use allows 
migrant women to move into a new technological and geographical space where family 
relationships are significantly redefined (Vancea and Olivera 2013) . Findings presented  
that more and more  mothers have been making use of digital media to increase the 
chances of a particular desired emotional outco me with their child or children  
(Longhurst 2016) . Therefore, increas ing access to ICT, on the one hand, can relieve 
migrant women’s worries about the families to some extent. On the other hand, ICT has 
the potential to increase the equity and efficiency of female participation in the labor 
force since it facilitates distan ce work, flexi -time and location activity, making it easier 
to match skills to jobs and to maintain and upgrade skills  (Goyal 2011) , which can 
provide new opportunities for rural women to find off -farm jobs nearby.  
 
The role of ICT for women entrepreneurs  
Women  entrepreneurship is a special case of rural women’s participation in farm  or off-
farm  activities. Although more and more r ural women run their own businesses as 
entrepreneurs  along with the rural development, there are still fewer women 
entrepreneurs  than men in the worldwide. Societal prejudices, financial limitations, and 
limited entrepreneurship educational opportunities are main obstac les to restrict 
women’s chances of success  (Nguyen, Frederick et al. 2014, Sofer and Saada 2017) . 
Rural women started up their businesses making use of tacit knowledge and know -how, 
with the small and flexible scale  of the production and the family character of the 
business minimizing entrepreneurial risk (Anthopoulou 2010) . Also, women  
entrepreneurship could easily gain supports from  the society. For example, many 
development projects usually support rural women participating in entrepreneurship 
activities combined with  training  and financial services  (Preeti and Varma 2008) . It is 
encouraging to see that women's entrepreneurial activities are conducive to women 
empowerment , especially psychological empowerment  (Masur, Jadhav et al. 2017) , but 
the relationship between economic participation and empowerment is complex, and the 
increase of women's economic in come will not necessarily change the original gender 
relation (Bailur and Masiero 2017) . In the digital age, ICT  may be regarded as 
potentially reinforcing women empowerment  by offering rural women the 
entrepreneuri al opportunit ies to improve their socio -economic welfare. Evidence shows 
that ICT usage especially mobile phone plays a positive role in contributing to women 
entrepreneurs' perception that they matter (Laizu, Armare go et al. 2010, Chew, 
Ilavarasan et al. 2015) , which has influences one after another on ICT usage decisions, 
self-efficacy, social capital bonding  and women empowerment  (Crittenden, Crittenden 
et al. 2019) . With an increasing number of  women engaged in e-commerce 
entrepreneurial initiatives,  the flexible working conditions that may be a concomitant 
of self-employment and/or small business ownership often makes it possible for women 
better to reconcile famil y and work duties .  
 
Methods  
Our data were collected from the Rural China Poverty and Food Security  Household 
Longitudinal Survey, conducted by Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese 
Academy of Agricultu ral Sciences. The survey has so far been carried  out in four waves 
in 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2018.  In 2010, the survey covered six counties in three 
provinces including Shaanxi , Yunnan  and Guizhou, which  were selected from the 592 
nationally declared poor counties. Then 19 villages were randomly  selected  in each 
county using the Population Propo rtionate Sampling (PPS) method and 12 households 
were subsequently randomly selected  from each village , yielding a sample of 1368 
households.  In 2012, 2015 and 2018, one more county in Gansu province was added to 
the sample  with a total of 1,560 households each year . Households were repeatedly 
visited to construct a panel dataset. In the case that a household was no longer available, 
a household with similar characteristics to the unavailable household would be chos en 
as a “replacement”, usually recommended by village elders or officials who are familiar 
with the local circumstances.  
This study use two -year panel dataset, collected from farm household in poor rural 
China during 2015 -2018 , with a sample of 2014 househ olds in total. The household 
survey collected data on general household characteristics, agricultural production and 
marketing information, income source, food consumption, coping strategy, intra-
household decision -making , ICT adoption such as smartphone o wnership. Additionally, 
a village survey was conducted to collect information on the demographics, 
infrastructure and services, market access, main crops, land resources, investment, 
poverty reduction project s, internet access, and so on.  
 
Measuring women  empowerment  
The measurement of women empowerment has been in debate, and the most common 
indicators are to detect the extent to which women participate in intra -household 
decision -making processes  in the form of binary variable or composite constructs 
(Allendorf 2007, Hwang, Paris et al. 2011, Mishra and Sam 2016, Han, Zhang et al. 
2019) . The first well -known decision -making module was introduced in 1960 with 
Decision Power Index  (Donald, Koolwal et al. 2017) . In this index, the respondent is 
asked to indicate “who has the final say” in respect to eight family decisions, and 
response alternatives are weighted from 5 (husband always) to 1 (wife always).  The 
latest most used measure is Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) , 
jointly developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), 
the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the Oxford Poverty and 
Human Deve lopment Initiative (OPHI). This index directly capture s women’s 
empower ment in the agricultural sector and the empowerment score reflects the 
weighted percentage of dimensions in which a person has achieved adequacy (Alkire, 
Meinzen -Dick et al. 2013, Seymour and Peterman 2018) . For our case, there are initially 
fourteen questions in the decision making module. But given the household  needs to be 
dropped from a  particular domain analysis or the composite analysis whe n the  particular 
decision is not applicable , for example, there is no educational decisions when  no 
children with schoo ling age living in the household, two  empowerment measures in this 
paper are finally drawn from six out of fourteen questions . The first measure is an 
empowerment score  which is calculated using six dimensions with equal weights , 
ranging from five to thirty . In detail, this paper scored on six intra -household  decision -
making including (1) agricultural production, (2) access to and control o ver durable 
household assets , (3) access to and control over daily items , (4) access to and control 
over income , (5) access to healthcare , and (6) social connection in the community. For 
each domain, score was assigned in term of following rules: male has the final say 
alone=1, male has more final say than woman=2, male has equal final say with 
woman=3, male has less final say than woman=4, woman has the final say alone=5. 
Another method to measure women empowerment was to calculate the disempowered 
headcou nt following the main idea of WEAI (Alkire, Meinzen -Dick et al. 2013)  but 
only with decision -making module. All adequacy indicators in above six domains were 
first coded assuming that the value 1 if the individual lacked adequate achievements in 
that indicator and a zero otherwise. Then an inadequacy score was computed for each 
person, according to his or her inadequacies across all indicators. Assuming eq ual 
weighs for simplicity, set a second identification cutoff to identify who is disempowered. 
After exploring the sensitivity of the empowerment classification for different cut -offs, 
we selected the disempowerment cut -off of 20% (Alkire, Meinzen -Dick et al. 2013) . 
For those whose inadequacy score was less than the disempowerment cut -off, their 
score was replaced with zero. Then the disempowered headcount  ratio was the total 
population divided by the number of individuals who are disempowered.  
 
Empirical specification  
The main interest of this paper is to estimate the impact of ICT adoption on women 
empowerment . We use panel data to regress empowerment mea sures  and ICT adoption 
in addition to a set of control variables as fo llows  (Wooldridge  2017)  : let 𝑖 denote 
household, 𝑡 denotes the time period and the third subsc ript is a variable label.  
𝑦𝑖𝑡=𝛽0+𝛿0𝑑2𝑡+𝛽1𝐼𝐶𝑇 𝑖𝑡+𝛽2𝑥𝑖𝑡2+⋯+𝛽𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑘+𝑎𝑖+𝑢𝑖𝑡 
where 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is the final outcome variables, the measures  of women empowerment;  𝑑2𝑡 
is a dummy variable that equals zero when t=1 and one when t=2; 𝐼𝐶𝑇 𝑖𝑡 is the ke y 
variable of interest, measured by smartphone ownership at the household level; 𝑥𝑖𝑡2… 
𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑘 are the control variables including individual characteristics (the number of female 
labor at home, the number of female migrant labor); ho usehold characteristics 
(household size, the age of household head, the sex of household head, the education 
of household head, the number of children who aged between 0 and 4, the number of 
children who aged between 5 and 14, the number of elders who is o lder than 65, land 
size owned by the household , the number of income sources);  and village characteristics 
(access to internet in village, whether a village connect to the main road.  𝛽0,𝛽1…𝛽𝑘 
and 𝛿0 are parameters to be estimated, 𝑎𝑖 is called an unobserved effect a nd 𝑢𝑖𝑡 is 
an time-varying error . 
Whether a household owns a s martphone may potentially be endogenous  due to self -
selection problems. IV approach is a common technique to reduce endogeneity issues 
in impact assessment , but t he challeng e is to find a valid instrument. We use the number 
of smartphone owners  among the five nearest neighbors  in the sample based on GPS 
coordinates  (Chege, Andersson et al. 2015, Sekabira and Qaim 2017)  as a valid 
instrument for smartphone ownership in a household. The inst rument must be (1) 
uncorrelated with women empowerment  (aside from the indirect route via 𝐼𝐶𝑇 𝑖𝑡), and 
(2) correlated with smartphone ownership. To test the first requirement, there are 
several considerations: first, a household  usually live independently with other 
neighbors, and the neighbors are generally ex ogenous  to intra -household d ecision 
making in a household; second, even if neighbors are involved in the internal affairs of 
a household through the social connections such as relatives, friends or village leaders, 
there is no necessary links between the number of smartphone owners i n the 
neighborhood and the social identities of the neighbors in the context of randomly 
selected sample households; third, the correlation coefficient between intra -household 
decision making and the number of smartphone owners in the neighborhood is very 
small ( -0.05), and the only possible pathway may be through the ICT adoption in a 
household.  To test the second requirement, we can see that correlation coefficient 
between smartphone ownership in a household and the number of smartphone owners 
in the neig hborhood is 0.37, which indicates that they have a positive correlation. There 
are always various social interactions among  neighboring households , and these 
interactions through social networks could influence technology adoption.  This satisfies 
the requi rement for IV that endogenous exploratory variable is correlated with 
instrumental variables.  
 
Descriptive  statistics  
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of rural household characteristics in the sample 
and detects the differences between smartphone o wners and non -owners in 2015 and 
2018. For the age of household head, significant  differences between smartphone 
owners and non -owners can be observed in two years, which indicates younger 
household heads tend to own smartphones. Smartphone owners are also  likely to have 
higher levels of education  in two years .  
In 2018, there were more control variables with significant differences between two 
groups. This implies that the characteristics of non -owners are more different from 
owners when the smartphone pen etration is increasing. Except for the age and education 
of household  head , smartphone owners tend to have larger household size and more 
land. Smartphone owners are likely to look after  more children and elders , which is 
consistent with more female labors  as caregivers staying at home together with less 
female migrant labors. I t is more convenient for those who are staying at home to 
contact with migration workers in the household.  It is worth to notice that smartphone 
owners are more likely to have higher  decision -making score and lower 
disempowerment ratio than non -owners  in 2018, which is opposite to 2015 . However, 
both t -difference statistics are not significant.

Results and discussion  
The results of column (1)-(4) in table 2 shows the fixed effects (FE) estimator, first 
differenced (FD) estimator and instrument variable (IV) estimator  that we use to 
evaluate the impact of smartphone ownership on decision -making score . Column (1) 
presents the estimators estimated from a one -way FE model without considering time 
fixed effects . Column (2) shows FD estimators which equal to two -way FE estimators 
when T=2, considering time fixed effects. Both coefficients are not significant in 
column (1) -(2). Column (3) -(4) present IV estimators under the specifications of FE 
and FD respectively . The coefficient of smartphone ownership in column (3) is negative  2015  2018

After comparison within four specifications  (1)-(4), the FD estimator in column (2) is 
preferred, which indicates ICT may have positive but insig nificant effect on women 
empowerment. Logit model with panel data  is used to evaluate the impact of 
smartphone ownership on disempowerment  status measured using a binary dummy 
variable.  The results of column (5)-(6) in table 2 present the FE  and RE esti mators 
respectively. Hausman test statistics to compare these two  estimat ors is not significant, 
so the RE estimat or in column (6)  is preferred to the F E estimat or in column (5), which 
shows that  whether a household own smartphones or not may cause positive but 
insignificant  effect on disempowerment.  
It makes sense that male household head affect decision -making score in a significant 
negative way, and influence disempowerment status in a significant positive way, which 
could be proved under nearly all specif ications. This evidence also suggests that the sex 
of household head is highly related with women empowermen t.   
Robustness checks are designed to assess whether changes in outcome indicator or 
sample size  affect the results.  We first select another four q uestions, including off -farm 
activities, agricultural marketing, housing, access to credit, out of the decision -making 
module. Two  empowerment measures are then drawn from ten out of fourteen questions . 
The sample size turns into 768 in total, nearly half of the previous one, because a  
household  needs to be dropped from the  analysis when the  particular decision is not 
applicable . The results are almost consistent with those in table 2 except the FE 
estimat or in column (5)  is preferred to the R E estimat or in  column (6) according to 
hausman test statistics , see Appendi x A1. Another robust check is shown in table 3 with 
six specific decision -making as the measure of women empowerment separate ly, 
column (1) to (6) . The outcome indicator, disempowerment, is  coded  assuming that the 
value 1 if male has the final say alone in a particular decision -making dimension  and a 
zero otherwise.  According to h ausman test statistics , column (1) to (3) prefer RE 
estimators than FE ones, and column (4) to (6) are on the contrary.  As a result, the 
coefficients of smartphone ownership are all insignificant with different signs. But the 
sex of household head is still significant and robust to most of model specifications.

Discussion  
Actually, it is not surprising to see that there is no significant effect of ICT on women 
empowerment since women have to experience two main but complicated 
transformations to achieve empowerment goal. One is the process to turn technological 
opportunities into income generating activities. Women may first face with many 
barriers when they are ready to adopt a new technology . Subsequently, the adoption of 
a new technology may not necessarily mean women can make full use of ICT and 
maximize the potential benefit of technologies. As a result, the impact assessment 
sometimes is not significant, for example, mobile phones fails t o help farmers to access 
price information and further make marketing decisions (Tadesse and Bahiigwa 2015) . 
There are many reasons for this kind of failure, one of possible reasons is ignoring the 
literacy, skills, culture, and demands of the target users (Emeana, Trenchard et al. 2020) . 
In addition, s ome basic and important facilities and services such as financial support 
and capacity building are particularly weak in poor areas and have become the main 
obstacles for smallholders and female farmers to take participate in income generating 
activities. T herefore, it is crucial to balance the hardware -software relationship, not 
only strengthen the infrastructure construction, but also promote women’s trainings and 
provide financial services for women’s participation in economic development 
especially in po verty -stricken areas. During the empowerment process , the government 
should enable sound environment to prevent a new digital divide.  
The other process is that t he increase of women's wealth does not necessarily improve  
their intra-household decision -maki ng power, and the economic and social participation 
of rural women does not necessarily translate into political and cultural empowerment  
(Yu and Cui 2019) . New mechanisms for income generation  do not result in changes of 
societal structures: older cultural stereotypes are built around adoption of the new 
technology, and policies underlying economic activities are hardly challenged by 
digitalization  (Bailur and Masiero 2017) . In a word, the impact of ICT on women 
empowerment is not straightforward, the success of the cases need good external 
conditions combined with women’s internal resource.  
 
Conclusion  
Digital technologies are changing the wor ld and people ’s well-being . In China, ICT has 
been developing rapidly in recent years.  An increasing ICT -based applications not only 
contribute to economic growth, but also provide a new drive force for women 
empowerment. For example, with the development of e-commerce economy, more and 
more women are involved in e -commerce related activities  or services. Better 
understanding the role of ICT adoption from a gendered perspective is of particular 
importance against this background.  
This paper reviews literatu res to  examine the possible mechanism and channels under 
which ICT may contribute to women empowerment.  Based on the internal links among 
Capability Approach, ICT4D and women empowerment, we conceptualize ICT as a 
tool to empower women through three main p athway s: agricultural production, off -farm 
activities and entrepreneurship. Then we use two -year panel dataset, collected from 
farm household in poor rural China during 2015 -2018, to regress the women 
empowerment indicator and ICT adoption in addition to a  set of control variables, 
gaining a fixed effects  estimator to evaluate possible effect of ICT application on 
women empowerment . For possible endogeneity , we further identify an instrument to 
solve the issue , but fixed effects estimators are preferred aft er several tests.  
The results show that ICT have insignificant effect on women empowerment. And the 
signs of coefficients are also senstive to model specification s and outcome variable 
measures. It is not surprising to see an insignificant result since it is a chanellage for 
women to transform technologies into income geneating activities , and economic 
earnings don’t necessarily change the gender relation in a household for a short term. 
The insignificant results also provide implication s for government or ICT-project 
providers that it is necessary to identify and provide enabled environment, including 
ICT infrastructure investment, women ’ training and ICT -based services, for ICT 
adoption and application in the poor rural area.
