• The primary payment method for mobile internet usage in most developing countries is prepaid, with 
the amount tied to a specific volume of data usage. Data volume is therefore a useful yardstick to 
determine how much is needed to carry out important welfare enhancing activities online.
• 
• For foundational online activities, which include websites for public services, health information, 
shopping, learning, and news, we estimate using data from six developing countries that 660MB per 
month, per user are needed for these welfare-enhancing activities. For common recreational online 
activities – particularly social media use – we estimate that an additional 5.2GB per month, per user is 
needed, for a total of approximately 6GB per month, per user.
• 
• While the cheapest 30-day data packages in most of the countries examined exceed this minimum 
estimate, the cost of these packages exceeds more than 2% of income for the bottom 40% of the 
population, which risks widening the digital divide. 
• 
• The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the demand for data by triggering widespread use 
of video conferencing for work, learning and health among others. This increased demand, along 
with the continuous development of more data-heavy content, will continue to inflate the minimum 
data needed for welfare enhancing activities, which may further exacerbate the digital divide if more 
affordable packages or other alternatives mechanisms for facilitating connectivity are not provided for 
the most vulnerable populations.

worldbank.org/ digitaldevelopmentThe internet reached a milestone in 2018 when 
approximately half the world’s population was 
online.  Growing internet use provides opportunities 
to enhance decision making capabilities and drive 
socio-economic progress. For individuals, access 
to online multimedia educational, health and 
livelihood content has potential positive impacts on 
improving welfare. For those who used to be at the 
periphery, getting connected to the internet also 
means moving closer to the market, for instance 
through e-commerce platforms, participating in 
the gig economy or contributing to the bourgeoning 
user-generated-content sector. These gains include 
an increase in knowledge, more convenient access 
to public services, improving health outcomes 
and higher productivity. Welfare gains also accrue 
from the avoided travel and opportunity costs by 
carrying out these activities online. Lacking access to information and services is 
considered a welfare depravation.  Y ears ago, access 
was defined as having a radio or television, but 
today it has been updated to include an internet 
connection. Access to the internet is also being 
incorporated into poverty analysis. Having an 
internet connection is also included in some multi-
dimensional poverty indices such as the Material 
Deprivation Indices. 
Mobile is the predominant way most people access 
the internet in developing countries and among 
lower income groups in developed nations. The 
primary payment method for mobile internet 
usage in most developing nations is prepaid, with 
the amount tied to a specific volume of data usage. 
Data volume is therefore a useful yardstick to 
determine how much is needed to carry out welfare 12

daily calorie requirements for food,  or identifying a 
minimum threshold for household electric energy,  
the aim of this report is to present an estimate of 
minimum data consumption levels.
Global targets have been established for mobile 
data affordability based on the relative price for a 
specific amount of data. For instance, the Alliance 
for Affordable Internet (A4AI) target calls for 
prices to be less than 2% of monthly income for 1 
Gigabit (GB) of data. One GB was selected on the basis that it is an amount needed to “benefit from 
the Internet in a meaningful way. ” However, there 
was no empirical analysis identifying important 
online activities and how much data they use. 
The Broadband Commission also establishes a 
2% income threshold but without specifying an 
amount of data. This is problematic given that in 
most emerging markets, data is charged by volume 
purchased over a certain time period. This note 
estimates the amount of data needed to support 
basic life activities for an individual and discusses 
its affordability implications.
FOUNDATIONAL AND WELFARE-ENHANCING  
ONLINE ACTIVITIES?
Identifying important online activities for 
individuals is the first step towards determining 
how much data is needed to access them. These 
activities are identified through the prism of welfare 
enhancement. Online activities that save costs and 
time for consumers such as access to public services 
and shopping are deemed to be most relevant. 
Activities that add to consumer knowledge such 
as health, reference information and news are also 
recognized. Each of these activities is reviewed 
below.
Online access to public services is an increasingly 
important life quality-improving resource as it reduces travel, transport, and waiting time and helps 
lower transaction costs. For example, in Australia 
the annual savings to citizens in terms of time, 
convenience and out-of-pocket costs from online 
government services was estimated at A$787 (US$ 
591) million, equivalent to almost 1% of household 
consumption expenditure. Data from Sri Lanka 
also shows that e-services reduce the time to obtain 
a public service from 371 minutes in 2011 to 124 
minutes in 2013.  The cost to obtain a public service 
also decreased from LKR 1,553 (US$ 13.74) to LKR 
747 (US$ 5.79) during the same period.  This cost 
includes travel, opportunity cost, service fees, food, 
accommodation and any other costs associated with ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS -  NOTE 3

obtaining a public service on site. As government 
services move online, public demand is also 
increasing due to convenience and transparency. 
For example, a program teaching basic digital skills 
in Rwanda found that after social media, the most 
requested service for help was regarding how to use 
the government online service “Irembo. ”  
The internet also enables access to online health 
information, which can facilitate progress towards 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 on Good 
Health and Well-Being. Empirical evidence 
from Poland found that access to online health 
information influenced users to change lifestyles and 
encouraged interaction with doctors.  Retrieving 
information online is also convenient for those 
who live far from a health clinic. For instance, in 
Rwanda, the average time to reach a medical center 
is about 50 minutes.  This convenience also drives online shopping, 
which saves people time and money compared to 
traditional offline shopping. A survey of consumers 
in three developing Asian countries found that the 
main reasons for buying online was the ability to 
shop anytime, find cheaper prices, and save time 
from not commuting to a physical shop.  In China, 
a study of rural households in three provinces 
found the cost of living reduced by 5.5% for those 
shopping online.  Online shopping has further 
grown during COVID-19 due to store closures, 
social distancing and self-quarantine requirements.  
Beyond online shopping, a variety of online 
resources including content, platforms and tools 
provide opportunities for learning. One of the most 
popular is Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia 
which receives approximately 6,000 visitors per 
second.  A 2016 survey of Wikipedia users found 
that on average around 35% use it to look up a 
specific fact, 33% use it to retrieve an overview or 
topic summary and 32% access the site to read about 
a topic in-depth.  With reference material available 
in over 300 languages, this website receives visitors 
from across the world seeking information and 
knowledge.
In addition to online learning and reference 
resources, accessing news is another important 
online activity as the internet provides free and 
low cost news content, making it a preferred news 
source for many. In addition to low cost, accessing 
online news is also more convenient compared to ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS -  NOTE 3

worldbank.org/ digitaldevelopmentnon-digital mediums. In a 2019 Pew poll, 89% of 
Americans surveyed get at least some of their local 
news digitally, whether from news websites, apps 
or social media. A survey among undergraduate 
students in Nigeria also suggests that young people 
rely on online channels to keep updated with news 
due to its speed and often free accessibility. 
Lastly, given interpersonal connections are 
recognized as one of the important factors affecting 
happiness and well-being, it has been argued that 
social media can not only provide an efficient way 
of communicating but also help improve individual 
welfare.   Though, it’s worth noting that intensive use of social media could also have potential negative 
implications such as addiction, depression and 
anxiety.  Some social media activities such as user-
generated content also show potential in providing 
new income streams for people. For instance, local 
artists in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are 
leveraging TikTok, a video entertainment platform, 
to gain more market exposure and business 
opportunities.  These social media activities, along 
with the other aforementioned internet activities 
that help improve welfare, are applied in the 
minimum data consumption estimates presented 
in the next section.23

worldbank.org/ digitaldevelopmentDATA CONSUMPTION   
FOR FOUNDATIONAL ONLINE ACTIVITIES 
After identifying the list of important, foundational 
online activities, the next step for estimating 
minimum data consumption is determining how 
much time should be allocated to each activity. 
No research exists that estimates how much time 
people need to spend on foundational online 
activities to derive benefits. The simple approach 
taken in this paper was to consider the average 
time spent engaging in these activities in a globally 
diverse sample of six low and lower middle-income countries. These figures were then used 
to convert the total time spent into an equivalent 
data consumption amount based on the nature of 
activities, which have different data requirements. 
The objective here is to provide insight on how 
much data certain activities might be required 
for a general user, recognizing that some users 
such as students might need much more data for 
foundational online activities.
To estimate the average time individuals spend on 
different online activities, data from Alexa (www.
alexa.com), a website traffic ranking platform, 
was used. Country government portals and health 
ministry websites are used as proxies for the public 
services and health categories, while Wikipedia 
– the fifth most popular website in the world – 
is used as a proxy for learning activity.  The top 
online news and shopping sites for each country 
are also identified using Alexa, which ranks the 
most popular websites based on the amount of time 
spent and pages viewed.  An important limitation 
with using Alexa’s ranking platform is that the data 
indicates only one global time figure for all users 
visiting a respective site. Therefore, while average 
time on site per user as well as page views for local 
sites such as news or government will mainly reflect 
the traffic generated by people within a country, 
popular sites such as Wikipedia and shopping sites 
included in the analysis (such as Amazon, Jumia 
and AliExpress) reflect global averages.25

Source: Alexa (https://www.alexa.com); Extracted April 2020 The relative use of the five foundational categories 
among the six countries surveyed is presented in 
Table 1 to highlight differences. These figures were 
recorded in April 2020, in the midst of the global 
pandemic, which precipitated a surge in online 
activity in each of these countries.  For the news 
category, the top news site in each country was 
used, and as the table demonstrates, news sites 
ranked among the top ten popular sites in all of 
the countries examined except for Bangladesh. Popularity of government sites vary significantly 
across countries. Surprisingly, particularly given 
the COVID-19 pandemic, health ministry web sites 
ranked very low except in Rwanda. This could due 
to the availability and popularity of other options 
such as the Facebook page of Ministries of Health 
or public health announcements disseminated over 
WhatsApp. Wikipedia ranked relatively high in 
most of the countries as did online shopping sites. 
The identified website for each category of 
foundational online activity, as well as average 
time users spend on sites and daily page views are 
shown in Table 2. Users visiting the government public service websites of Rwanda and Honduras 
tend to spend more time browsing compared to 
those visiting other similar types of government 
sites. For instance, in Rwanda, users spent over 20 ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS -  NOTE 3

health information as well as news are shown as 
important online activities in Rwanda in terms of 
the amount of time spent on them per user. Except 
for Ukraine, shopping consumes approximately the 
same amount of time regardless of the platform. Time spent on online shopping in Ukraine is 
slightly higher than the other countries. This may 
be due to the fact that the most popular Ukrainian 
shopping site is a peer-to-peer platform rather than 
the business to consumer platforms in the other 
countries surveyed in this report.
The simple average daily time spent on the 
foundational online activities among the six 
countries was 34.5 minutes, as shown in Table 3. 
The Philippines had the lowest total daily time 
spent at 21.5 minutes while Rwanda had the highest 
due to an above average amount of time spent on the government web site. The total daily average

Besides the foundational online activities, people 
also spend a significant amount of online time 
for social media and recreation. There is naturally 
some complementarity between social uses of the 
internet and other more foundational uses, as being 
able to socialize with others online can be a first step 
towards more foundational uses such as education, 
news and government services. Facebook and 
Y ouTube are among the top sites in all six countries 
examined in this study. According to Alexa data, 
users spend on average 19 minutes on Facebook, 
13 minutes on Twitter and 9 minutes on Instagram.  
Previous studies have also found that half of the 
individuals surveyed in Africa spend an average of 
1 to 6 hours daily on social media sites.  
Based on the survey results as well as Alexa data, 
the analysis applied here assumes one hour spent 
on social media every day. For other entertainment 
activities, the average time users spend on Y ouTube 
is used as a proxy in the analysis for this sub-
category given the site’s global popularity. Alexa 
data shows that on average individuals spend 
around 15:23 mins per day on Y ouTube. This 
translates to approximately 88MB per day, given 
one hour of streaming video consumes 353MB.   In 
sum, data consumption to support social media and 
other online entertainment activities is estimated DATA CONSUMPTION

at 178MB daily, equivalent to slightly more than 
5GB per month. Adding this amount (5.2 GB) to 
the foundational amount (660 MB) results in a

almost 6GB per month.

Monthly data consumption for the five foundational 
activities is around half the A4AI target of 1GB. Even 
this lower consumption figure can pose affordability 
challenges for poor segments of the population. 
The cheapest 30-day data package in most of the 
countries surveyed includes substantially more 
data than 660MB, as shown in Table 4. Although 
the price is less than 2% of income in all the 
countries reviewed except for Honduras, that is an 
average figure for the country. The poorest will pay a larger proportion. This is estimated by adjusting 
GNI per capita for the difference between average 
income and the income of the bottom 40%. For the 
bottom 40%, the amount spent exceeds 2% of per 
capita income. While cheaper prices are available 
for data packages closer to 660 MB, such packages 
are typically only valid between 1-7 days. Hence 
in most instances, a low-income consumer would 
have to carry out all their online activities over just 
1-7 days a month.AFFORDABILITY OF DATA PACKAGES

THE IMPACT OF COVID-19  ON MINIMUM DATA CONSUMPTION
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread 
use of video conferencing for work, learning 
and healthcare among others. Some predict that 
telework and distance education will continue to 
some degree after the pandemic.  In April 2020 
about 300 million people around the world were 
using Zoom, one of many videoconferencing 
platforms.  Except for Morocco and the Ukraine, Zoom was among the top twenty sites in the other 
low- and middle-income countries analyzed in 
this study. One hour of a Zoom session consumes 
500 MB  of data.   However one hour of Zoom use 
per day in these countries would be unaffordable 
for most with the price for 10,000 MB per month 
exceeding the yardstick of 2% of income in all 
countries. 
Of course, not everybody needs to use video 
conferencing platforms. People with jobs that 
cannot be carried out online, or those without 
children in need of remote learning rely less on 
video conferencing. Even for those with children, in 
some developing countries, educational programs 
were and are continuing to be offered on television 
or radio due to limited computer and Internet 
access in homes. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 
effect demonstrates that people who can work from 
home or have children where online education is 
available require more data to make use of video 
conferencing. This was true even before the 
pandemic, highlighting the difficulty in estimating 
a one size fits all minimum data consumption 
amount. 
Strongly relevant to the higher amount of data 
needed due to COVID-19, A4AI released a new 
“meaningful connectivity” target that calls for a 
broadband connection at home, or place of work or

study with unlimited data access.   This aspirational 
goal will be difficult to attain in low- and middle-
income countries, as the amount of data required is 
not affordable for many in the countries analyzed in 
this study. Many people in low- and middle-income 
countries work in the informal sector with unlikely 
access to the internet through work. A place of 
study is also problematic; for example, in Latin 
America and the Caribbean one third of secondary 
schools and around two thirds of primary schools 
were unconnected to the internet in 2016; in South 
Asia, more than half of secondary schools were 
unconnected; and in sub-Saharan Africa, three 
quarters of secondary schools were unconnected.  
Even in countries where school connectivity is high, 
there are pockets of depravation without internet 
or where equipment is obsolete. 
One way of increasing access to the internet 
is through public venues such as libraries and 
community centers. Telecenters – public locations 
with shared internet access – have been around 
for many years but their use has declined with 
the rapid growth of mobile internet.  The need for unlimited Internet access makes them relevant 
again. Governments may also consider subsidizing 
data use for the poorest through social tariffs 
similar to food allowance or school fee schemes.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of 
governments have urged telecommunications 
operators to raise data allowances or provide free 
Wi-Fi and some consumers are calling for this to be 
the new norm.   For instance, in Germany, Vodafone 
is providing zero-rating services for customers 
to access digital education web pages. Major 
Irish telecommunication companies also signed 
a COVID-19 agreement with the government 
committing to enable zero-rating of healthcare 
resource websites identified by the government 
for all customers. Another innovative scheme to 
increase access to data is through the donation 
of excess data, as one major mobile operator in 
Australia enables for its customers. Under this 
scheme, over 200,000 customers donated more 
than 5.8 million GB data to some 13,000 young 
Australians in the period between April 2019 
and March 2020, indicating its popularity with 
consumers.

CONCEPTUALIZING DATA AS AN ESSENTIAL NEED 
WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
In the digital economy, data should be recognized 
as an essential entitlement enabling human beings 
to meet their basic needs. Consumption of data 
means engaging in foundational online activities, 
such as online education which complements in-
class education, accessing healthcare information 
or engaging with public services and government 
resources online. Information has always reflected 
a basic human need. Traditionally people relied on 
printed newspapers, radio or television broadcasts 
to obtain information. But in the digital age getting 
information online has become more important 
in order to obtain the most up to date and diverse 
sources of information, often at a lower cost than 
acquiring offline. 
This study has identified accessing public services, 
news, health information, learning and online 
shopping as five important foundational online 
activities.  Using data from Bangladesh, Honduras, 
Morocco, Philippines, Rwanda and the Ukraine, 
660 MB of data are estimated to be needed per 
month for users to carry out these activities. To 
ensure better life quality, the list of important online 
activities can be expanded to include access to 
social media and video streaming, which increases 
the estimated minimum amount of data needed to 
around 6 GB per month. Further, this report has demonstrated that the cheapest 30-day data package 
in most of the countries examined offers an amount 
of data substantially more than 660 MB. However, 
the price of such data packages exceeds more than 
2% of income for the bottom 40% population. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the 
demand for data by triggering widespread use of 
video conferencing for work, learning and health 
among others. One hour of video conferencing can 
consume 500 MB of data. This calls for unlimited 
data access to realize meaningful connectivity. 
Some measures include promoting access to the 
internet through public venues and subsidizing 
foundational data use for the poorest through 
partnerships with private sector players.
4040Given that work-related online ac -
tivities are done at workplace rather 
than relying on individual’s mobile 
data plan, it is not included in the 
calculation of the minimum data 
consumption in this note.ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS -  NOTE 316
worldbank.org/ digitaldevelopmentIt is critical for the development agenda that 
the minimum data thresholds estimated in this 
study are monitored and updated periodically to 
reflect technological advances such as data-saving 
mechanisms within devices and platforms or the 
development of more data-intensive apps, which 
will undoubtedly flourish alongside the rapid 
deployment of high-capacity 5G mobile networks. 
Future research should therefor explore and 
revise the estimated data needs for foundational online activities, which should also reflect future 
developments in fixed-internet infrastructure 
across the developing world. Future research should 
also build upon the findings presented in this 
report by expanding the list of countries surveyed, 
as well as exploring more granular-level minimum 
data estimates for different user segments, with 
an eye towards minimizing the digital divide both 
between countries and within countries.
