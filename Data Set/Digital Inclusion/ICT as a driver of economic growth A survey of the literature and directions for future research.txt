Productivity ABSTRACT  
This paper conducts a comprehensive literature survey of the papers that examine the link be-
tween ICT and economic growth. Using a rigorous screening framework, we found 208 academic 
papers that were published from 1991 to the cutoff date of October 30, 2018. 
This survey provides a robust set of insights into the distribution, research strategies, and 
findings of the surveyed papers, taking into account their geographic focus and type of ICT- 
growth links. This study also reveals the key factors that predict the citation impact by paper. 
Among the directions for future research, this paper argues that the time has come for the 
research on the ICT-growth link to shift its main focus from evidencing its positive relationship to 
advancing the understanding on why and how emerging digital technologies directly or indirectly 
affect economic performance.   
1.Introduction 
The world has undergone remarkable changes over past few decades as the ICT revolution has gained momentum, rapidly 
spreading across nations, sectors, and organizations. Although the transformational impact of ICT on the way that people and orga-
nizations, communicate, work, and spend time is vivid, quantitatively establishing the link between ICT and economic performance 
has been a challenging task. Indeed, the “productivity paradox ”, which has become prominent ever since Nobel Laureate Robert Solow 
made his famous remark in 1987 that computers can be found everywhere except in productivity statistics,1 has preoccupied many 
economists for the past three decades. As a result, a wealth of research has been produced, most of which focuses on examining the 
causal link between ICT and economic growth. 
The literature that addresses this research issue is rich and still growing rapidly. As digital technologies are continuing to progress 
by leaps and bounds and foster increasingly vibrant digital transformations across nations, conducting extensive surveys of the 
literature to understand what we have learned and what we will need to further explore in gaining a deeper understanding on the ICT- 
growth links are valuable for academics, policy makers and practitioners. In fact, a number of researchers have addressed this need 
with important literature surveys, including Brynjolfsson and Yang (1996) , Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) , Baily (2002), Dedrick, 
Gurbaxani, and Kraemer (2003) , Melville et al. (2004) , Stiroh (2005) , Draca et al. (2008) , Holt and Jamison (2009) , Kretschmer

Brynjolfsson and Yang (1996), one the earliest surveys on the topic, failed to establish a casual link between ICT and economic 
growth, implying that the “productivity paradox” remains a challenge. The authors attribute this productivity puzzle to four key issues 
namely: mismeasurement, which means that output and input data are not being properly measured by conventional approaches; lags, 
which means that it may take time for the growth effects of ICT to materialize; redistribution, which means that the benefits from ICT 
are redistributed among firms and to customers without adding to total output; and mismanagement, which means that poor man-
agement may make ICT spending unbeneficial due to incorrect choices of application or a lack of enabling support. 
Cardona et al. (2013) and Stanley et al. (2018) are the most recent comprehensive surveys of literature on this topic.2 Cardona et al. 
(2013) reviewed 150 studies and finds that the majority of them confirm the significant positive effect of ICT on productivity. In 
addition, the output elasticity of ICT tends to increase with time. However, the evidence that ICT is a General-Purpose Technology 
(GPT) remains inconclusive. Stanley et al. (2018) apply a meta-regression analysis to the estimates from 59 econometric studies on the 
ICT-productivity link using the cut-off of February 2014, confirms the growth effect of ICT, with wireless technologies being 
approximately twice as strong as landlines. In addition, developed nations have benefited more than developing countries from 
computing. However, the evidence on the growth effect of the internet is still limited. 
Given the importance of the ICT-growth link issue and its powerful implications for nations to embrace the ICT revolution for 
development, comprehensive surveys can add valuable insights by examining the issue from different angles and fresh perspectives. In 
addition, the rapid progress of the ICT revolution and continuous economic transformations across nations call for these surveys to be 
conducted more frequently. In this spirit, the objective of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, the paper provides a fresh account of the state 
of the literature by undertaking a comprehensive literature survey, which includes the most recent publications (up to October 30, 
2018). Secondly, it examines the academic influence of these papers in terms of academic citations. Thirdly, by drawing on the insights 
from the survey, this paper provides several suggestions for future research on this theme. 
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology of the survey. Section 3 presents the results from the 
descriptive analysis, and Section 4 pinpoints the main contributions of the surveyed papers. Section 5 conducts a reality check. Section 
6 analyzes the factors that predict the citation impact by paper, and Section 7 presents suggestive directions for future research. Section 
8 concludes. 
2.Survey method 
We begin with a comprehensive examination of the published academic papers on the effect of ICT on economic growth. This 
literature search was conducted in three steps. Firstly, we undertook the search for papers by using a set of predefined keywords related 
to the links between ICT and economic growth/performance. The keywords to capture ICT-related variables included “Information and 
Communication Technology” (“ICT”), “Information Technology” (“IT”), “internet”, “computer” (“software” and “hardware”), “tele-
phone”, “telecommunication”, “mobile phone”, “broadband”, and “cloud computing”. The keywords associated with economic 
growth/performance included “growth”, “productivity”, “efficiency”, “performance”, “output”, “economy”, and “economic impact.” 
We thoroughly performed this search in all the major databases of academic papers, including Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, 
JSTOR, and ProQuest. 
Secondly, we scanned the reference lists of the papers found from the first step to identify additional papers that were deemed 
appropriate for the review. We repeated this scanning process for additional papers until no significant paper was overlooked. 
Lastly, we manually screened all the papers collected in the first and second steps by using the following three selection criteria: (i) 
the paper must address the hypothesis of the causal effect of ICT on growth and fulfil its task; (ii) the paper must be a research article 
from an SSCI- or Scopus-indexed journal or a publication published by an academically reputable organization such as the OECD, the 
World Bank, and the Brookings Institute; and (iii) the paper must have been published since 1990 and not have been duplicated. With 
October 31, 2018 established as the cutoff date, the survey collected a total of 208 publications. A list of these publications are 
provided in Appendix 1. 
For each publication, the survey collected two sets of information. The first set included the year of publication, the outlet (journal), 
the impact factor of the journal,3 and the number of Google Scholar citations (GSCs) that the publication received.4 The second set of 
information was constructed based on our classification of the paper along three dimensions as follows: the research approach; the 
reasoning why ICT could cause growth; and the empirical evidence on the positive ICT-growth link. These classifications are elabo -
rated in Table 1. By “research approach”, the surveyed papers were divided into four categories based on the analytical approach: (i) a 
regression analysis (REG); (ii) growth accounting (GA); (iii) mixed (REG & GA); and (iv) others. The “reasoning why ICT could cause 
growth” was classified into three categories: (i) substantial; (ii) some; and (iii) not at all. Finally, the “evidence on the ICT-growth link” 
was classified as (i) solid evidence, (ii) some significant evidence but is not robust across measures, and (iii) insignificant evidence or 
even counterevidence. The next section provides descriptive statistics on these classifications. In addition, the dummy variables that

ultra-fast broadband investment on economic outcomes.  
3 We use the SCImago Journal Ranking (SJR) index to represent the impact factor of a journal for its general acceptance in academic institutions 
and the availability of data.  
4 The GSC is used for two reasons. First, it appears to be a simple and fair measure for quickly capturing the influence of a publication on the 
literature. Second, its data are available and continuously updated. K. Vu et al.

3characterize their categories also help reveal their predictive power on the citation received by a typical survey paper. 
3.Insights from the descriptive statistics 
3.1. Year of publication 
The publication years of the 208 surveyed papers ranged from 1991 to 2018.5 Although the number of publications per year 
fluctuated notably, there was a clear upward trend (Fig. 1). By period, the average number of publications increased from 2.7 from 
1991 to 2000 to 7.6 from 2001 to 2010 to 13.1 from 2011 to 2018. This observation suggests that the research on the ICT-growth link 
has increasingly captured the attention of researchers, which implies that this theme is not only interesting but also strategically 
important. 
3.2. Classification by research method and geographic focus 
To gain insights into the research method and geographic focus of the 208 surveyed papers, we classify them by using two di-
mensions. The research method classification includes four categories6 – Regression Analysis (REG), Growth Accounting Analysis 
(GA), Mixed (REG&GA), and Others – while the geographic focus comprises four categorizes – the US, non-US individual countries, 
region/group, and worldwide. Table 2 reports the frequency based on this 2-dimensional classification, and the figures in parentheses 
under each frequency indicates its total percentage in the column. From Table 2, the following three observations are notable. 
First, the REG method is the dominant approach, with 117 out of the 208 surveyed papers solely relying on this method, followed 
by the GA method with 46 papers. One of the reasons that the GA is less frequently used compared to the REG method is the dearth of 
high-quality data, which is essential for a solid growth accounting exercise. 
Second, 25% of the surveyed papers are focused on the US. This percentage is even higher at 41% for the papers that use the GA 
method, which implies the availability of high-quality data, and the case of the US gives this method a clear advantage. 
Third, the papers that use a mix of REG and GA methods are distributed rather equally among the following four categories: The US 
(30%); Non-US individual countries (21%); Region/Group (24%); and Worldwide (24%). Note that in this research approach and in 
the GA approach, the studies on the US claim the largest shares, which suggests the advantage of the US in providing high quality data 
for the research on ICT. 
3.3. Evidence on ICT-growth links from analytical papers 
Out of the 208 surveyed papers, 196 analytical studies7 examine different ICT-growth links. These analytical papers can be Table 1

6 The classification is defined in Table 1, Section 2.  
7 These papers use one of the following three quantitative analysis approaches as shown in Table 2: REG (117 papers); GA (46); and “Mixed ” (33). K. Vu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Telecommunications Policy 44 (2020) 101922
4classified using the two dimensions categorization, the growth variables and ICT variables. As shown in Table 3, the rows of the table 
correspond to eight categories of growth measures, while the columns of the table match with seven ICT measures. A given analytical 
paper will be classified by these two dimensions based on its main dependent growth variable and its main independent ICT variable. 
As shown in Table 3, the eight growth measures include three measures on the economy, two measures on sectors, two measures on 
firms, and one measure on community; the seven ICT measures include three measures on investment and four measures on 
penetration. 
Each cell in Table 3 contains two figures. The first figure is the number of papers that examines the ICT-growth link that corre -
sponds to this cell. The second figure, which is in brackets, indicates the proportion of these papers that find solid or some significant 
evidence in examining this link. 
Three observations stand out from Table 3. First, the literature has examined a diverse set of ICT-growth links, which span 27 out of 
7*8 �56 possible ICT-growth relationships. The three most widely examined ICT-growth links by the 196 analytical papers are overall 
ICT-GDP growth (50 papers), ICT penetration-GDP growth (30 papers), and overall ICT investment-firm performance (20 papers). 
Second, a dominant proportion, if not 100%, of the papers that examine the effect of ICT (overall ICT, telecom, and broadband) 
investment on growth find significant supporting evidence. This proportion ranges from 78% for overall ICT investment-TFP growth 
and 94% for overall ICT investment-GDP growth to 100% for broadband investment-firm performance. 
Third, the supporting evidence for ICT-growth links, however, is less robust for ICT penetration. In fact, the proportion of studies 
that finds supporting evidence on this link is 50% or even 0% for the following three relationships: internet penetration-GDP growth 
(2/4 articles); broadband penetration-employment (1/2); and ICT adoption-firm ALP growth (0/1). It is worth going deeper to better 
understand the papers that find counterevidence to these ICT-growth links. 
Among four articles that examine the internet penetration-GDP growth link, two papers, Meijers (2014) and Maurseth (2018) , do 
not find supporting evidence. On the one hand, Meijers (2014) finds that internet use does not explain economic growth directly, but its 
impact on growth is indirect via promoting international trade. On the other hand, Maurseth (2018) finds a negative link between 
internet use and GDP growth. Vu (2019) , however, shows that the counterevidence found by Maurseth (2018) is due to some 
shortcomings of the study ’s econometric model. With minor revisions, Maurseth ’s model still produces solid evidence on the positive 
link between internet use and growth. 
Out of the two articles that examine the effect of broadband penetration on community-level economic performance, the study by

6(Czernich (2014)) does not find supporting evidence. By examining county-level data for Germany, the paper finds that broadband 
availability does not reduce the unemployment rate. This finding tends to suggest that employment prospects may not improve with 
better ICT infrastructure and adoption. 
Bertschek and Niebel (2016) is the only paper that examines the ICT-use and firm-level ALP growth link, and it finds no evidence of 
this link. The study, however, reveals that ICT use boosts innovation activity. 
3.4. Publication outlets and academic influence 
The 208 surveyed papers were spread across 95 outlets (Table 4). That is, each outlet, on average, is home to approximately 2 
papers. However, the publications are concentrate in a small number of journals. Table 4, which is sorted by the number of publications 
by journal, indicates that there are 16 journals that have published at least three papers. Altogether, these journals have published 113 
papers, which is 54.3% of the 208 surveyed publications. 
In this list of outlets, Telecommunications Policy ranks first with 36 articles, followed by Information Economics and Policy (16 articles) 
and Economics of Innovation and New Technology (9 articles) (Table 4). At the same time, the top-tier journals such as American Economic 
Review (5 articles), Journal of Economic Perspectives (5 articles), and Review of Economics and Statistics (3 articles) are also among these 
16 journals (Table 4). 
To get a quick idea of the influence of a journal on the academic research in this field, one can examine the total number of ac-
ademic citations that its surveyed articles have received. For this exercise, we use the Google Scholar citation (GSC) database, which is 
straightforward and accessible to all. The list of the top 10 outlets in terms of the total number of GCSs is provided in Table 5.8 Several 
insights stand out from Table 5. 
First, the top ten outlets vary considerably in terms of the impact factor.9 The top tier outlets, including Journal of Economic 
Perspectives, American Economic Review, Review of Economics and Statistics, and Management Science, have an SJR that exceeds 5.0, 
whereas the lower tier outlets, which comprise Telecommunications Policy, Information Economics and Policy, and Economics of Inno-
vation and New Technology have an SJR below 1.0 (Table 5). The appearance of the lower tier journals on this list of top 10 outlets 
suggests the active participation of these journals in the debate and their relatively large number of articles on this topic have conferred 
on them significant academic influence in terms of the GSC scores. 
Second, the 81 papers published by the top 10 outlets altogether received 32,395 GSCs, which account for 70% of the overall 
46,043 GSCs received by the 208 surveyed articles. This indicates the dominant influence of the top 10 outlets in the academic debates 
on ICT-growth links. 
Third, the papers published in a high-impact journal, on average, are rather old, with their average lifespan ranging from 16 years 
for American Economic Review to 21 years for Management Science. This finding suggests that these journals, to a certain extent, are less 
responsive to rapid changes in the dynamics of the adoption and academic impact of the ICT revolution in the last 10–15 years. 
Fourth, Telecommunications Policy and Information Economics and Policy appear to be the most active journals among the top 10 
outlets. Although they far exceed other outlets in terms of the number of publications, their papers are also much younger than the 
articles published in other papers (with the average lifespan of 7.0 years for Telecommunications Policy and 8.8 years for Information 
Economics and Policy). However, in terms of the average GSC score per year by paper, these two journals are slightly below compared to 
the remaining 85 outlets. 
4.What have we learned from the literature on the ICT-growth link? 
The 208 surveyed papers, which examine the ICT-growth link with different approaches and focuses, have produced many valuable 
findings. These findings can be summarized into seven key insights. 
First, the magnitude of the ICT contribution to growth and the causal effect of ICT on productivity are significant and tend to 
increase over time. 
From the growth accounting papers that use data at the country level, the estimated contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth 
mostly ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points. This magnitude tends to grow after 1995 (for example, see Jorgenson and Stiroh 
(2000), Oliner and Sichel (2000), and Jorgenson (2001) for the US, Oulton (2002) for the UK, Colecchia and Schreyer (2002) for 
Europe, and Jorgenson and Vu (2005) for the world and groups of countries). At the industry level, Stiroh (2002) examines 61 in-
dustries in the US economy and finds that IT-using industries show productivity acceleration after 1995, while the gains from IT use are 
larger for IT-intensive industries than for non-IT intensive industries. 
Among the 117 surveyed papers that employ the regression analysis approach, 89 papers (76.1%) find solid evidence, and 20 
(17.1%) find mixed results. Furthermore, Cardona et al. (2013) and Tambe and Hitt (2012) show that the ICT elasticity regarding 
productivity growth exhibits a positive time trend, which implies an enlarging effect of ICT on growth. 
It should also be noted that the papers that find insignificant evidence also provide valuable insights into the potential growth 
effects of ICT. For example, Meijers (2014) challenges the finding that internet use has a direct positive impact on economic growth. 
However, he shows that internet use has a significant effect on international trade, especially in developing countries and that trade 
8 The cutoff date for the citation statistics is the same cutoff as the survey (October 31, 2018).  
9 The SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) indicator, developed by SCImago, has been widely used to capture the academic influence of academic journals 
(source: https://blog.scopus.com/posts/journal-metrics-in-scopus-scimago-journal-rank-sjr). K. Vu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Telecommunications Policy 44 (2020) 101922
7significantly enhances growth. Therefore, he suggests that the internet’s effect on growth is indirect through the channel of inter-
national trade. 
Second, there is a significant disparity among countries and regions in reaping the benefits of ICT for growth. 
van Ark, O’Mahony, and Timmer (2008) find that the European Union10 was notably lower than the US in terms of the magnitude of 
ICT contributions to growth from 1995 to 2004, while Pohjola (2002) finds that the growth effect of ICT was much weaker in most 
countries compared to the US, employing data from 1985 to 1999 for 42 developed and developing countries. At the same time, Dewan 
and Kraemer (2000), who use data from 1985 to 1993, show that developing countries were lagging behind developed countries in 
reaping the ICT-led growth effects. This disparity is also found by Shiu and Lam (2008) for the growth effect of mobile technology 
penetration across regions in China. 
Third, the long-term effects of investment in ICT-driven transformation are much larger than its short-term effects. 
Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003) finds evidence that suggest that over a longer time horizon (between 3 and 7 years), computerization, 
which means investments in ICT and the required organizational changes, makes a much larger contribution to productivity growth Table 4

10 Data for the European Union in this study refer to the ten countries of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. K. Vu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Telecommunications Policy 44 (2020) 101922
8compared to its short-term impact. The authors explain this finding by pointing out that organizational transformation takes more time 
to complete, and, therefore, the full effect of computerization is greater in the long term. 
Hong (2017) enriches the finding on the greater effect in the long term of ICT investment by showing the causal links in both the 
short and long term of R&D investment to economic growth. His study also presents a virtuous cycle on public ICT R&D investment and 
private ICT R&D investment, which suggests a greater impact of ICT investment in the long term. 
Fourth, an ICT platform can produce sizable effects on growth only when it reaches a critical mass. 
R�oller and Waverman (2001) examine how telecommunication infrastructure affects economic growth in 21 OECD countries 
during a 20-year period (1970 –1990) and find the existence of a critical threshold beyond which the growth effects of the network 
become significantly larger. Supporting this finding, Koutroumpis (2009) also identifies increasing returns on broadband investments, 
which indicates the presence of a critical mass phenomenon. At the same time, Gruber et al. (2011) show that the link between mobile 
telecommunication and growth is significantly smaller for low-penetration countries than for high-penetration countries. 
Fifth, the three main transmission channels for ICT to affect growth include the following: (i) learning, technology diffusion, and 
innovation; (ii) the quality of decision-making; and (iii) the reduction in costs and enlargement in choices that shift both the supply and 
demand curves to the right. 
Among the papers that present these transmission channels for ICT to affect growth, Vu (2011) provides a comprehensive dis-
cussion supported by a theoretical review. Because of the internet, substantial improvement in access to global knowledge, technology, 
and market opportunities is probably a major factor that has enabled many developing countries to leverage their backwardness 
advantage11 to foster economic growth. 
Sixth, complementary investments, especially in organizational transformation, are essential to enable investment in ICT to drive 
growth and productivity. 
Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) emphasize the importance of making complementary investments in organizational changes so that 
firms reap the full benefits from their investments in ICT. Among these complementary investments, the authors discuss the priorities 
related to workers ’ skills, work practices, decision-making decentralization, and interactions with suppliers and customers. They 
suggest that the total returns on ICT-driven organizational transformation could be a better measure than the returns on ICT adoption 
or investment. Dedrik et al. (2003) support this view with their findings that complementary investments in organizational capital, 
such as decentralized decision-making systems, job training, and business process redesign, can lead to additional productivity gains 
from investing in ICT. 
Seventh, there is preliminary evidence that ICT is a “General Purpose Technology ” (GPT), but more robust examinations that use 
updated data are needed to make this evidence solid and convincing. 
Many strongly believe that ICT is a GPT, which according to Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1996) , has the following three unique 
characteristics: (i) pervasiveness, which is the technology is spread extensively throughout the economy and across sectors; (ii) 
improvement, which is the technology rapidly evolves over time and continuously enhances performance and lowers costs; and (iii) 
innovation spawning, which is the technology ’s rapid penetration and improvement fosters R&D, innovation efforts, and innovative 
transformation in downstream sectors. 
Hypothesizing that ICT is a GPT implies that ICT is expected to lead to effects comparable to the effects of electrification and other 
great inventions of the past. Although a number of studies have attempted to test this hypothesis, the evidence remains preliminary or Table 5

11 Gerschenkron (1962) argues that economies that are distant from the world technology frontier have a “backwardness ” advantage, which allows 
them to reap substantial benefits from acquiring the technologies, methods of production, and management techniques that have been developed by 
advanced countries. K. Vu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Telecommunications Policy 44 (2020) 101922
9even contradictory (Cardona, 2013 ). For example, Jovanovic and Rousseau (2005a ,b) and Liao et al. (2016) find evidence that sup-
ports the “ICT is a GPT” hypothesis, while Stiroh (2005) rejects it. 
5.The ICT-growth link: a reality check 
It is useful to see whether the evidence found by the literature on the positive ICT-growth link is supported by reality. Because the 
penetration of the ICT revolution across nations, for which the Internet is the epitome, experienced a major take-off between the two 
20-year periods, 1977 –1997 and 1997 –2017,12 it is meaningful to look at these two periods for a reality check. If global growth slowed 
down from the first period, 1977 –1997, to the second period, 1997 –2017, it would be not easy to find the reasons to justify why the 
growth effect of robust ICT penetration in the second period was not tangible. In this case, the reality check will fail to support the 
finding on the positive ICT-growth link from literature. On the other hand, if worldwide growth accelerated from the first to the second 
period, this reality enhances the credibility of the finding from the literature. It should be noted, however, that growth acceleration is 
only a supporting fact for the finding from the literature rather than a piece of rigorous evidence. 
To make the comparisons meaningful, we use the data for 102 economies from the Conference Board Total Economy Dataset13 for 
which data on GDP and employment are available throughout the examined periods of 1977 –1997 and 1997 –2017. These 102 
economies accounted for more than 95% of the world ’s GDP in 2017. Table 6 reports the GDP and average labor productivity (ALP) 
growth rates for the entire sample, which represents the world economy as a whole, and for the median country. 
For the world economy, the average annual GDP growth rate accelerated from the period of 1977 –1997 to the period of 1997 –2017 
by 0.75%, specifically, from 2.95% to 3.70%. At the same time, its ALP growth rate accelerated by 1.38%, namely, from 0.99% to 
2.37% (Table 6). 
More interestingly, this growth acceleration appeared to be broad-based rather than clustered in a few economies. As Table 6 
shows, the growth rate of the median country increased by 0.78%, from 2.71% in 1977 –1997 to 3.49% in the period of 1997 –2017 for 
GDP, and by 0.35%, from 0.89% to 1.24% for ALP over the two periods. 
Furthermore, the growth acceleration from the period of 1977 –1997 to the period of 1997 –2017 can also be shown by using a 
graph, which shows some consistent upward trends. Fig. 2 describes the 20-year moving average (20-YMA) growth rates of GDP and 
ALP for the two periods: 1977 –1997 (Panel A) and 1997 –2017 (Panel B). The 20-YMA growth rates are used to capture long-term 
trends and eliminate short-term fluctuations. 
The contrast in the GDP and ALP growth trends between the two periods of 1977 –1997 and 1997 –2017 is striking. In the 
1977 –1997 period, both the GDP and ALP growth rates followed declining trends (Fig. 2, Panel A), while in the 1997 –2017 period, 
both indicators exhibited upward patterns14 (Panel B). 
The reality check presented above supports the main conclusion from the literature that ICT has a positive effect on growth. 
Although this reality cannot be considered to be a rigorous test, its results also tend to suggest that the ICT revolution is associated not 
only with the acceleration of growth from the period of 1977 –1997 to the period of 1997 –2017 but also with the reversing of the 
declining trend observed for growth in the 1977 –1997 period. 
6.Predictors of the citation impact by paper 
This section examines the factors that have been deemed to have a significant predictive power on the citation impact of a given 
paper, which can be used as a rough indicator of its influence on the academic research in this field. 
Model. 
The regression model is based on Eq. (1) below. 
Citations i�β0�β1BSJR i�β2BLifespan i�β3BSJR*Lifespan i�β4BReview i�β5BICT Tranmission i�β6BSolid evidence i�εi (1)  
where Citations i is the number of citations that paper i received, Lifespan is its post-publication lifespan measured in years, and SJR is the 
SCImago Journal Ranking index of the journal in which the paper is published. The interaction term SJR*Lifespan is included to capture 
the nonlinear effects of Lifespan augmented by the journal impact. Three dummy variables, Review , ICTTranmission , and 
Solid evidence , represent the categories defined based on the classifications presented in Table 1 (Section 2). Review represents the 
papers that belong to the “Other ” category in the classification according to the research approach, ICTTransmission denotes the 
papers that belong to the “Substantial ” category in the classification according to the discussion of the ICT-growth transmission 
channels, and Solid evidence indicates the papers that find solid evidence of the ICT-growth link; εi is the random error term. The 
summary statistics of the main variables in Eq (1) are report in Table 7. 
12 The worldwide internet penetration, which was 0% in 1990 and below 1% in 1996, increased to 1.7% in 1997 and was rapidly rising since then 
to reach 54.4% in 2017 (Data source: WDI, 2019).  
13 The dataset is downloadable from the Conference Board Website at URL: https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/ .  
14 Note, however, that the ALP growth for the average country in the second period (1997 –2017) did not follow a solid rising trend; instead, it 
leveled out and fluctuated around 1.5% from 2003 to 2013 before slowing to 1.24% in 2017 (Fig. 1, Panel B), but it remained higher than the rate 
observed for ALP growth in 1997 (Panel A). K. Vu et al.

117.Results 
The results from the OLS regressions based on the specifications in Eq (1) are reported in Table 8, which reveal several notable 
findings. First, both SJR and Lifespan are positively associated with citation rates at the 1% significance level (Column R1). These 
findings are obvious. A paper published in a higher-impact factor journal or a paper with a longer post publication lifespan tends to 
receive significantly higher citation scores. 
Second, the significance at the 5% significance level of the interaction term SJR*Lifespan indicates that publishing in a higher-tier 
journal will command an increasing citation advantage over time. That is, the marginal benefit that a paper receives from being 
published in a higher-impact journal will increase over time (Column R2). 
Third, the review/perspective papers, on average, receive substantially more citations than the analytical papers. This citation gap 
is as large as 221 when controlling for other factors (Column R3). 
Fourth, having a substantial discussion of the ICT-growth transmission channels is rewarding. This effort adds 56 citations to the 
average analytical paper (Column R4). 
Fifth, the papers that find solid evidence tend to receive higher citation scores. The papers in this category, on average, receive an 
additional 34 citations compared to the papers in other categories (Column R5). 
8.Directions for future research 
As the digital revolution of ICT is continuing its rapid progress and widespread penetration with even greater transformative power, 
research concerning its impact on economic growth will become even more important in the years to come. This section identifies 
seven directions for future research in this field. 
First, the research on ICT-growth links should shift its main focus from seeking evidence to establish this link, to advancing our 
understanding of why and how digital technologies, especially on how emerging technologies, affect economic performance, either 
directly or indirectly. In addition, it is important to go beyond the link between ICT and macro-economic indicators such as GDP 
growth to investigate the ICT effects on innovation and quality of jobs (Gomez-Barroso and Marban-Flores, 2020b ). 
Second, the measurement of the ICT and growth outcome variables should be more creative. In fact, the ICT revolution has been 
spawning technologies that are fundamentally changing the way that we do business. For example, cloud computing has made using 
cloud services far more efficient and strategic than investing in ICT assets to upgrade digital capabilities. As a result, the monetary 
measures of investment or spending may no longer be relevant. At the same time, as the ICT revolution is rapidly and profoundly 
transforming the competitive landscape, investing in ICT capabilities not only achieves gains in efficiency but also enhances strategic 
effectiveness. That is, a company makes this investment not only to increase profits but also to enhance its readiness for the future. The 
outcome of this investment may therefore not be adequately captured by short- to medium-term performance. Researchers should also 
be proactive in examining the effects of emerging smart technologies such as fintech, AI, IoT, and 5G, and they can conduct some 
natural experiments to compare the “before ” and “after ” effects. 
Third, it may not be easy to find evidence of the direct effects of ICT on growth due to the presence of many confounding factors. 
However, researchers may find it more feasible to examine the causal links of ICT by using the key determinants of growth such as 
institutional quality, openness to international trade, rethinking and reform efforts, human capital, financial market development, 
entrepreneurship, and innovation. 
Fourth, a simple but interesting question still remains unanswered: which countries – rich or poor – tend to benefit more from the 
ICT revolution? The researchers who emphasize the importance of complementary factors such as infrastructure and skills are likely to 
believe that rich countries are the greater beneficiaries. At the same time, the researchers who see the enormous benefits that poor 
nations can reap from their backwardness advantage may argue that this group reaps a larger fortune. 
Fifth, the deep penetration of social media and other sources of big data can provide valuable and rich information on the behaviors 
and transactions of people and firms. Researchers can exploit information from these sources to advance their research in distinctively 
new directions and areas. 
Sixth, policy insights deserve more vigorous efforts by researchers because they can have a substantial influence on policymakers.15 
More sophisticated policy insights are critically needed as their national digital strategies will have to go beyond traditional matters 
such as accessibility, coverage, penetration, and use costs to address the more challenging issues concerning the development of a 
robust digital ecosystem, especially with the emergence of the 5G mobile network. 
Seventh, researchers should also examine the potential negative effects of ICT on growth if the critical infrastructure system is not 
built and maintained properly, is not resilient to cyber-attacks, or is too rigid to change. For example, some major cyber-attacks can 
paralyze companies or even an economy for a significant period of time. 
9.Conclusion 
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of the literature that addresses the effects of ICT on economic performance. The survey 
covered 208 academic papers published from 1991 to 2018, of which more than 95% are from SSCI- or Scopus-indexed journals. 
15 G�omez-Barroso and Marb �an-Flores (2020a) observe that conclusions from academic studies tend to run behind what would have mostly been 
needed by decision makers. K. Vu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Telecommunications Policy 44 (2020) 101922
12The purpose of this survey is to provide an updated and comprehensive understanding of the state of the literature, with a focus on 
several subthemes, such as trends, research approaches, empirical strategies, findings, contributions, and citation impact. With insights 
from this review, this paper suggests directions for future research. 
The literature overwhelmingly confirms the significant positive effect of ICT on economic performance. A reality check is con-
ducted for this analysis to support the robustness of this finding. We demonstrate that worldwide economic performance during the 
recent two-decade period (1997 –2017), during which the ICT revolution rapidly proliferated across nations and firms, notably 
accelerated compared to the worldwide economic performance in the preceding two-decade period (1977 –1997). 
The paper also reveals the predictors of the citation impact of the papers in this research domain. When controlling for other factors, 
having a substantial discussion on the mechanism that underlies the effects of ICT on growth is rewarding in terms of citation impact. 
Changes driven by the ICT revolution are expected to increase in the decades to come. Further, the growth effects of ICT are 
becoming an increasingly popular topic for published research. The relationship between ICT and economic growth is therefore 
becoming increasingly important and demands reliable empirical study.
