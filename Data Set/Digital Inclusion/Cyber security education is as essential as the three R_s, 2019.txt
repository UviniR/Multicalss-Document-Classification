Smartphones have diffused rapidly across South African society and constitute the most dominant information
and communication technologies in everyday use. That being so, it is important to ensure that all South Africansknow how to secure their smart devices. Doing so requires a high level of security awareness and knowledge. Asyet, there is no formal curriculum addressing cyber security in South African schools. Indeed, it seems to be left to
universities to teach cyber security principles, and they currently only do this when students take computing-
related courses. The outcome of this approach is that only a very small percentage of South Africans, i.e. thosewho take computing courses at university, are made aware of cyber security risks and know how to take pre-
cautions. In this paper we found that, because this group is overwhelmingly male, this educational strategy
disproportionately leaves young South African women vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We thus contend that cybersecurity ought to be taught as children learn the essential “3R s”—delivering requisite skills at University level
does not adequately prepare young South Africans for a world where cyber security is an essential skill. Starting to
provide awareness and knowledge at primary school, and embedding it across the curriculum would, in additionto ensuring that people have the skills when they need them, also remove the current gender imbalance in cybersecurity awareness.
1. Introduction
In 1818, The Lady's Magazine included an article on “The Three R's ”
(reading, writing and arithmetic) ( Percy and Timbs, 2019 ). Schools today
still teach these foundational skills but also teach many more ( Nias et al.,
2005 ). Towards the end of the 20thcentury, information and communi-
cation technologies (ICTs) started to pervade daily lives, such that ICTs
have now become an infrastructural essential on a par with electricity
and water ( Carr, 2003 ). In addition to the three R's, schools and higher
education increasingly also teach ICT skills to children from a very young
age. The United Kingdom (UK), for example, proposes curricula for early
education to include Information and Communications Technology as a
foundational skill ( Education and Training Foundation, 2019 ). There are
also moves to ensure that children are taught about online safety (Sutton,
2011 ) and how to spot fake news ( Cockburn, 2019 ).
ICT use is now intertwined with Internet use. It then follows that
anyone using the Internet, whatever their age, also needs to know how tosecure their devices because forewarned is forearmed ( Renaud et al.,
2016 ). Safety and security are semantically different concepts ( Waldron,
2006 ) requiring different kinds of knowledge and skill sets. Smartphone
users, of all ages, should know that their phones are vulnerable to attack,
and also know how to improve device security. Because education is at
the heart of security awareness and capability ( Siponen, 2001 ), it is
imperative for cyber security education to reach all of society and all
ages.
Cyber security education has two elements: ﬁrst people need to
become aware of the need to take precautions, and then teachers need to
impart the skills they require to take the required precautions. We plan to
assess awareness, as an essential prerequisite to mastering cyber security
skills. We focus on assessing levels of cyber security awareness of uni-
versity students in South Africa, as developing country citizens i.e. the“outcome ”of the wider South African cyber security educational
approach. Moreover, we explore whether the extant awareness levels
exhibit the same gender imbalance as that evidenced in other societal

murindi and Louw, 2010 ).
We chose to focus on smartphone cyber security in South Africa, for
three reasons:
/C15Theﬁrst is that cyber-attacks increase year on year ( Fowler, 2016 ),
and developing countries are not exempt ( Olapido, 2015 ). Cyber
criminals, ﬁnding that large organisations are getting better at cyber
security and are therefore becoming more dif ﬁcult to compromise,
have now turned their attention to easier targets: small businesses and
home computer users ( Krebs, 2017 ), both of whom do a great deal of
their computing on their smartphones ( Asadullah Khaskheli and
Bhuiyan, 2017 ).
/C15The second reason is that smartphone ownership is increasing glob-
ally, offering an attractive attack surface that hackers can use to target
the unwary or unprotected ( Mayer, 2014 ). Smartphone adoption has
increased beyond expectations but, unfortunately, so have security
vulnerabilities. A lack of education and awareness is contributing to
the growing cyber-security problem ( Hanus and Wu, 2016 ). South
African smartphone ownership was 51% in 2018 ( Pew Research
Centre, 2018 ), which is higher than global computer ownership
(Newzoo, 2017 ), meaning that South Africans might be even more
vulnerable to smartphone-enabled attacks than citizens of other
countries.
/C15The third reason is that South African children own and use smart-
phones at increasing rates. Businesstech reported that 80% of sec-ondary South African school pupils owned a smartphone in 2017
(Businesstech, 2019 ), and Porter (2016) reported that 51% of primary
South African school pupils owned mobile phones. Because South
African adolescents and youth are the ﬁrst adopters of new mobile
technologies ( Beger and Sinha, 2012 ) and South African University
students are heavy users of smartphones ( North et al., 2014 ), we
cannot wait until adulthood to raise awareness of security issues and
ensure that people have the requisite security-related skills.
South African schools and universities are starting to incorporate
cyber security into many of their educational programmes ( Kortjan and
von Solms, 2014 ;von Solms and von Solms, 2014 ). According to Dlamini
&Modise, the South African government is investing in cyber security
efforts to help improve cyber resilience ( Dlamini and Modise, 2013 ).
However, there does not seem to be a formal across-the-board curriculum
for cyber security ( De Lange and von Solms, 2012 ). It cannot be assumed
that all South Africans ’awareness of cyber security issues is being
improved by these efforts. Any educational endeavour needs routinely to
assess its impact, so that interventions can be re ﬁned and improved and
made as effective as possible. We thus assess the impact of the South
African approach to raising cyber security awareness.
The main contribution of this paper is to:
1. emphasize the need to treat cyber security (and not merely ICT) as a
foundational skill, alongside other basic skills throughout the
educational system —together with the basic “three R's ”.
2. highlight the impact of the current South African approach to cyber
security education i.e. rendering young women more vulnerable to
cyber-attacks, and thereby exacerbating the gender imbalance in
South African society.

research methodology in Section 3. Section 4presents our results, with

2. Related research
The world is on the brink of a new revolution: the Fourth Industrial
Revolution. According to the World Economic Forum ( World Economic
Forum, 2017a ), this new technological revolution will fundamentallychange the way people live and work. This change, if not embraced and
anticipated, could minimize, or even derail, the potential it has for
development and innovation in developing countries.
According to ITU, Internet users (worldwide) increased from 1991
million in 2010 –3385 million in 2016 ( ITU, 2018a ). Among these users,
young people (aged 15 –24) are the most prominent users (71%), a high
number given that only 48% of the total world population uses the
Internet.
2.1. Regional differences
As shown in Figure 1 , there is a distinct within-country digital divide
in Africa.
In developing countries, the Internet is accessed mostly via mobile
phones ( Statista, 2019 ). As many as 81% of South African households in
metropolitan areas only use mobile phones at home (see Figure 2 ).
Although Internet usage increased from 30% of the world's population in
2010 to 47% of the world's population in 2016 ( ITU, 2018b ), in Africa
only 25% of the African population used the Internet in 2016. In
November 2018 the average cost of 1GB of mobile data in South Africa
was $7.19. Cable.co.uk1places South Africa 143 out of 230 countries in
terms of its mobile data cost. The most expensive country was Zimbabwe
(with an average of $75.20 per GB) and the cheapest was India (with an
average of $0.26 per GB).
A high proportion of South Africans only access the Internet at places
where they can access free Wi-Fi because data costs in South Africa
(compared to other BRICS countries) are prohibitive (see Figure 3 ).
Chigona et al. indicated, in an article about people living in disadvan-
taged communities in the Western Cape, that they visited libraries with
Wi-Fi access at least once a week and primarily used this library service to
do research and access social media sites ( Chigona et al., 2016 ).
2.2. Gender differences in Science, Technology, Engineering or
Mathematics
According to the World Bank report, the Internet usage gender gap in
Africa has increased since 2013, and not decreased as in other regions
(The World Bank, 2016 ).
Theﬁrst step in moving towards gender equality is to ﬁnd areas
where such inequality is occurring. Only then can targeted efforts be
made to address and reduce inequalities. It is clear that women, espe-
cially young girls, still face inequalities in terms of computer and Internet
access ( The World Bank, 2016 )(Livingston et al., 2017 ), as demonstrated
inTable 1 . It is interesting to note that the only place where the pro-
portion of women using the Internet is greater than that of men ( ITU,
2018b ) is in the Americas.
Women who study at tertiary institutions, in both advanced and
developing countries, are less likely than men to choose a career in Sci-
ence, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) and are paid less
than their male counterparts in the same positions once they qualify. In
the United States, less than 25% of STEM positions are ﬁlled by women
and, for every dollar a man earns in this ﬁeld, a woman earns only 86
cents ( Beede et al., 2011 ). The majority of women with a STEM degree
(56%) prefer to work either in education or health care ( UNESCO Edu-
cation Sector, 2017 ). In 2017, a report by the United Nations Educational
Scienti ﬁc and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) reported that only 35% of
students graduating world-wide in STEM ﬁelds are women ( UNESCO
Education Sector, 2017 ).
It is important to create opportunities for women to “increase the
pipeline ”of potential employees in the technology industry. Currently,
only 16% of graduates in computer science in the United States (US) are
women, with only 18% ﬁlling “tech roles ”in Silicon Valley ( World Eco-
nomic Forum, 2017b ). It is estimated by Girls Who Code (WCD) (a

2non-pro ﬁt organisation that raises interest in technology sector careers)
that women will hold only 3% of “tech jobs ”in the US by 2020 ( World
Economic Forum, 2017b ). In sub-Saharan Africa, the digital gender
divide is even more pronounced, with fewer women than men
completing tertiary education, owning a cell phone or accessing the
Internet ( Alozie and Akpan-Obong, 2017 ).According to the World Bank report, a gender gap exists at home and
in the educational system even before girls enter university —with only

35% of 15-year-old girls (compared to 18 percent of boys) in Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies
considering a career in STEM ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, 2009 ). It is important to address gender
stereo-typing early on, and to encourage girls to believe that they are able
to excel in this ﬁeld and to provide incentives for recruitment and the
graduation of women in these ﬁelds. It is also important that the work
environment be gender-friendly ( The World Bank, 2016 ;European
Platform of Women Scientists, 2016 ).
It is appropriate to pause for a moment to offer a disclaimer on how
the authors used the concept of “gender ”in this paper. While the authors
acknowledge a far wider spectrum of gender identities than the “male/
female ”and“men/women ”binary used here, we take a feminist socio-
logical stance in focusing on how the status quo has disadvantaged
women (self-identi ﬁed) in order to reveal power imbalances. This
research is in conversation with the broader quantitative data sets that
are based upon gender binaries, particularly those that highlight wom-
en's historical exclusion from the technology sector, leading to their
vulnerability in tech related domains ( Wajcman, 2010 ). Moreover,
women are more likely to be victims of a range of cybercrimes ( Marcum
et al., 2014 ;Asadullah Khaskheli and Bhuiyan, 2017 ;Bates, 2017 ), so
research into their cyber resilience cannot be neglected.
2.3. Related research on cyber security education
Students are heavy users of technologies but they do not necessarily
receive formal cybersecurity training ( Bennett and Maton, 2010 ;Bennett
et al., 2008 ). In South Africa, the curriculum makes provision for life
skills“…comprising Beginning Knowledge, Creative Arts, Physical Education
and Personal and Social Wellbeing ”(Department of Basic Education, South
Africa, 2015 , p. 8) from Grade R (before school) to Grade 3 however the
time allocated to this per week is only 6 hours(for Grade R to 3) and then
changes to 4 hours for Grades 4 –6. Life Orientation is taught from Grades
7 to 12 for 2 hours per week ( Department of Basic Education, South
Africa, 2015 ). In the Life Orientation curriculum, no speci ﬁc mention is
made of cyber security ( Department of Education, 2003 ).
2.4. Gender differences in cyber security
Anwar et al. ( Anwar et al., 2017 ) surveyed 481 company employees
to explore their cybersecurity beliefs and behaviours. They report that
women reported signi ﬁcantly lower levels of security self-ef ﬁcacy,
whereas Gratian et al. (2018) reported that women were more likely to
delay software updates and choose weaker passwords ( Gratian et al.,
2018 ).Cain et al. (2018) also revealed that women had lower security
knowledge than males in their study ( Cain et al., 2018 ).Halevi et al.
(2017) report that the women in their study had a lower sense of
self-ef ﬁcacy when it came to cyber security ( Halevi et al., 2017 ). Anwar
et al. recommended that gender sensitive training and intervention
programs be designed for cybersecurity awareness ( Anwar et al., 2017 ).This is con ﬁrmed by the outcome of a security awareness drive in a
secondary school which also detected gender differences ( Jin et al.,
2018 ).
However, Chaudhary et al. (2015) study found equal levels of
cybersecurity knowledge in their participants, who were all computer
science, software engineering or related degree students ( Chaudhary
et al., 2015 ).Halevi et al. (2017) also discovered a signi ﬁcant impact of a
Computer Science degree on cyber security self ef ﬁcacy ( Halevi et al.,
2017 ). This suggests that gender differences might well have more to do
with the gender imbalance in these degree programmes than any other
gender-related differences. This is con ﬁrmed by Ismailova and Muha-
metjanova (2016) study ( Ismailova and Muhametjanova, 2016 ).
2.5. Summary
This review demonstrates that women tend not to do computing-
related degree programmes and courses. Because most cyber security
awareness training occurs within these degree programmes, they will not
be exposed to these principles as part of their university education. This,
then, means that they feel less aware of cyber security issues, as a de-
mographic. The studies we cite above were carried out in other parts of
the world. Here we investigate the state of play in South Africa, as a
developing country.
In particular, we want to answer two questions:
RQ1: Is there a difference in cyber security awareness between stu-
dents doing a computing-related degree and those doing a different
kind of degree?
RQ2: Are there gender differences with respect to (1)?
3. Research methodology
3.1. Student project
To explore students ’smartphone security and privacy knowledge, the
2016 and 2017 cohort of third year computer science students doing acompulsory Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the University
of the Western Cape (UWC) in Cape Town were tasked to be researchers.
The students were instructed, as a research project, to envisage being
employed by a large smartphone company. The company wanted to
determine whether smartphone users were aware of smartphone security
and privacy issues. We asked the student team to carry out a small
research project the better to understand users ’security- and privacy-
related smartphone experiences. Their ﬁctional company employer “ex-
pected ”the team to write a report based on their ﬁndings. In particular,
the students were instructed to situate their ﬁndings within the current
literature and then make suggestions on how the company should design
the phone interface in order to improve awareness of security and privacy
issues.
Each student team member was asked to ﬁnd two smartphone owners
(older than 18 years and not in their class) to interview. One should not
have studied computer science or a related subject and the other had
previously or currently studied computer science. They were instructedto conduct an interview with their participants, using a prede ﬁned
questionnaire consisting of 65 questions. For the rest of this report, all
participants in the former category will be referred to as: non-Computer
Science (NCS) and the latter as Computer Science (CS) participants.
To train students in carrying out ethical research, they were instruc-
ted to ask the potential participant for their consent to be interviewed
and to sign a form to con ﬁrm that: (1) the participant had read and un-
derstood the purpose of the questionnaire; (2) he or she was free to
withdraw their participation without providing reasons; (3) he or she
would not provide any security-related information to the interviewer
andﬁnally (4) granted permission for the information they provided to
be used for research purposes (including reports, publications andTable 1. Internet penetration in 2017 by gender ( ITU, 2018b ).

4presentations) with strict preservation of anonymity. Ethical clearance
for this research was obtained from the university's research committee.
The aim of the student research project was not only to train students
in ethical research but also to make the student researchers themselves
more aware of security and privacy issues —the majority of whom are
also smartphone owners. Furthermore, since the research was team-
based, students also learned how to function within a team and, by
implication, how to collaborate, organise team meetings and write a team
report.
The data the student teams collected over the 2016 –2017 period was
combined to answer the following research questions: (1) does a com-
puter science speci ﬁc education improve cyber resilience, and (2) are
there gender differences with respect to (1)?
Quantitative analysis using SAS ®(SAS Institute Inc, 2017 ) was car-
ried out on the data set and also on the following groupings: gender and
CS background. The open-ended questions provided additional infor-
mation that was post-coded and analysed quantitatively.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive background
In 2016, the student researchers interviewed 100 students (51 CS and
49 NCS students) and in 2017, 152 students (76 CS and 76 NCS) were
interviewed. The total number of observations is thus 252.
Forty-one percent of the participants were women —24% of the CS
participants and 57% of NCS participants. Most completed their school-
leaving certi ﬁcates in cities (61%) with 39% completing their
schooling in small towns or rural areas. On average, the participants had
been using smartphones for 5.3 years in the 2016 cohort, and 6.6 years in
the 2017 cohort (minimum 0 and maximum 20 years). Most (77%) al-
ways kept their mobile phones within reach.
Signiﬁcantly more men than women took CS as a subject (Chi-sq ¼
28.06, P <0.0001). This was true for both 2016 and 2017 cohorts, and
has been the case for several years now at UWC. This tendency was also
experienced at another university in South Africa where the number of
women students studying towards a degree in IT dropped from 58 in
2000 to 14 in 2012 ( Pretorius et al., 2015 ).
4.2. Gender as well as CS exposure
When considering gender, as well as CS background separately, it was
found that signi ﬁcantly more of the CS-men (78%) versus all others (CS-
women 65%, NCS-women 58% and NCS-men 55%) felt that there were
security/privacy issues when using PayPal for payments (Chi-sq ¼19.1, p
¼0.0040). Signi ﬁcantly fewer NCS-men felt that there was no security
risk when using online shopping (Chi-sq ¼13.6, p ¼0.0346) (see
Table 2 ).
More of the CS students (CS-men 48% and the CS-women 42%), when
compared to the NCS-students (NCS-women 27% and NCS-men 25%)
were aware of privacy/security risks when using BitTorrent (Chi-sq ¼
29.88, p <0.0001). It was found that more of the CS students (CS-men
39% and the CS-women 43%) when compared to the NCS students (NCS-
women 24% and NCS-men 27%) were aware of privacy/security risks
when using Bitcoin (Chi-sq ¼22.37, p ¼0.0010).
When considering gender, as well as CS background, it was found that
more of the CS students (CS-men 51% and the CS-women 62%), as
compared to the NCS students (NCS-women 27% and NCS-men 37%)
understood what “encryption ”meant (Chi-sq ¼25.651, p ¼0.0003) (see
Table 3 ). Furthermore, it was found that more of the CS students (CS-men
64% and the CS-women 55%), as compared to the NCS students (NCS-
women 37% and NCS-men 33%), knew how to identify phishing at-
tempts (Chi-sq ¼18.18, p ¼0.0004).
It seems as if the majority of the CS-men and some of the CS-women
ﬁndsecurity advice on the Internet whereas the NCS-women tend to get the
advice by word of mouth . Both groups use the Internet, word of mouth,public media and combinations thereof to get security advice (see
Figure 4 ).
Apart from using a PIN (Personal Identi ﬁcation Number) or password,
students were in general not concerned about security around friends or
family. Most of the students were quite happy to share their passwords
with family or friends. More of the women —NCS-women (81%) and CS-
women (71%)) —compared to the men —NCS-men (59%) and CS-men
(65%) —did so and only a few regretted it (see Table 4 ).
There seems to be very little difference between the device behav-
iours of the different groups (see Table 5 ). However, slightly more
women kept records of their Phone's IMEI (International MobileTable 2. Respondent's perceived mobile phone security or privacy issues.

53% and NCS-men 53%), regularly backed up the data on their phones
(Chi-sq ¼12.2, p ¼0.0067).
Very few of the smartphone users offered security advice to fellow
users (see Table 6 ). However signi ﬁcantly more of the CS students (CS-
men 38% and the CS-women 35%), as compared to the NCS students
(NCS-women 17% and NCS-men 15%), offered security advice to other
smartphone users (Chi-sq ¼21.1, p ¼0.0018).
Some of the students knew that they could be held liable for tweets
even if it did not originate from them. More men seemed to make friends
online than women. However, when combining the CS and NCS groups,
signiﬁcantly more of the men (76%), as compared to women (56%),
reported having made a friend online (Chi-sq ¼11.45, p ¼0.0095).
In the next section the data will be discussed in terms of how it an-
swers the research questions.
5. Discussion
Theﬁrst research question posed was (RQ1) Is there a difference in
cyber security awareness between students doing a computing-related degree
and those doing a different kind of degree? It is clear that a computer science
education does indeed improve awareness of smartphone security and
privacy issues, and precautions to be taken. Table 3 demonstrates a clear
positive impact of a computing science education in this respect. More of
the CS students understood the risks of BitTorrent and Bitcoin, under-
stood the term “encryption ”, and felt able to identify phishing messages.
The majority of the CS-men, and some of the CS-women, found security
advice on the Internet and tended to offer security advice to other
smartphone users.
The second question posed was (RQ2) Are there gender differences? The
CS-women were more resilient than all students (men and women) doing
NCS degrees, demonstrating the value of a CS education, regardless of
gender. Indeed, the general awareness trends shown in Table 2 demon-
strate a clear difference between CS (left two columns) and NCS students
(right two columns) across the board. It is interesting to note that more of
the CS-women regularly made backups of the data on their phones,perhaps because they perceive that they are easier targets for theft?
Suggestions for future research could include a more qualitative
approach and doing in-depth interviews to uncover reasons. Further-
more, fewer women reported having made a friend online. This could be

6because of women's heightened sense of vulnerability. Yet, as demon-
strated earlier, being content with this situation is not an option. The fact
that fewer women do computing subjects at school, and that fewer
women study CS at university ( van Broekhuizen and Spaull, 2017 )
effectively leads to the situation where fewer women bene ﬁt from
heightened cyber security awareness.
It does seem as if a CS education improves awareness, and it does so
for both genders. This con ﬁrmsﬁndings by Darkish et al. that students
with a technology or science background were less vulnerable to phish-
ing attacks ( Darkish et al., 2012 ). Moreover, Gratian et al. found that
university students (aged 18 –25) and students majoring in the human-
ities would bene ﬁt from security training ( Gratian et al., 2018 ).
The discouraging conclusion is that upcoming generations of South
Africans who do not study CS will have insuf ﬁcient awareness of privacy
and security issues, and will, as a consequence, be more vulnerable to
cyber-attacks. Moreover, women will be disproportionately affected. The
South African educational system can no longer leave it to Universities to
raise cyber security awareness. Fundamental cyber security life skills
should be taught at primary school, delivered to all pupils, ensuring that
awareness is raised in all genders equally. Cyber security awareness and
resilience is too important for any government to leave to chance
(Renaud et al., 2018 ).
Figure 5 shows where cyber security education is currently being
delivered (at University), and where it ought to be delivered (at Primary
School). Moving it earlier will ensure that when people get their ﬁrst
smartphone they will already have suf ﬁcient awareness and skills to
secure their new devices. It is also likely to remove the gender differences
we observed in our study.
6. Conclusion
This study investigated smartphone cyber security awareness
amongst students at a South African university. We con ﬁrmed the bene ﬁt
of a CS education in this respect: a heartening yet disappointing ﬁnding.The former because this means the university is doing a great job of
improving awareness in CS teaching. The latter because anyone who is
not enrolled for a CS course at university is not getting the requisite in-
formation to be able to improve their own cyber resilience. This means
that the South African approach to cyber security awareness is failing, in
terms of producing a cyber resilient population.
Moreover, the extant imbalance between genders in CS degrees
means that South African women are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
This suggests an urgent need to teach cyber security principles much
earlier in the educational system so that the cyber resilience of all South
Africans, regardless of gender, can be assured.
