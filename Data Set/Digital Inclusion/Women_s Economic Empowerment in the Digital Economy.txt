  1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025 commits the region to promote 
more “resilient, inclusive, and people -centered community.” At the ASEAN Summit in 
November 2017, ASEAN’s leaders adopted a series of documents that made it clear 
that they saw the d igital economy as presenting great opportunities for the region 
while also calling for gender mainstreaming in the AEC. This paper brings these 
themes together and makes recommendations  on how the ASEAN Economic 
Community 2025 Consolidated  Strategic Action  Plan (AEC 2025 CSAP)  can be 
implemented to promote women’s economic empowerment.  
The challenges facing women are not new. Women in the ASEAN region  have long  
faced a range of barriers to their economic activit ies, whether they are formal sector 
workers, o wners of small and medium enterprises , or micro entrepreneurs in the 
informal sector. With the rise of the digital economy, women have new opportunities 
at work and in business , but with these new opportunities come additional 
challenges. Women who are alr eady in the workforce need access to training and 
reskilling to prepare for new jobs. Digital technology is creating new opportunities for 
accessing finance through new channels and from new sources , but women face 
several barriers to acquiring the financi al services they need. Additionally, as 
financial services are increasingly made available through ICTs, women will need 
valid forms of identification to access these. Women entrepreneurs will continue to 
need traditional business development support, incl uding access to markets and 
networks, and an enabling environment to help their businesses thrive. These 
services however need to be better tailored to women entrepreneurs’ needs and 
circumstances. All women will need digital literacy to engage with the di gital 
economy. This is particularly salient as cyber safety and privacy are becoming 
increasingly important.  
This White Paper will focus on the AEC 2025 CSAP , especially the areas relating to 
the digital economy, in order to mainstream gender in the AEC. T he proposed 
strategies and actions in the CSAP will be examined in terms of the objectives and 
aspirations of the AEC Blueprint 2025 as well as the barriers, at the regional or sub -
regional levels, to WEE in the specific context of the digital ASEAN. This provides a 
backdrop to the follow -on analysis of the specific strategic measures and key action 
lines under CSAP and, as necessary, other sectoral action plans, which should 
contain or incorporate gender empowerment measures and actions so as to initiate 
and/or promote WEE in ASEAN. In particular, what are the practical approaches that 
would facilitate gender empowerment through  various ASEAN sectoral committees 
in the AEC as well as in individual member states ? To limit the scope of analysis and 
as request ed by the ACCMSME, the emphasis will be on self -employed women 
entrepreneurs, rather than on wages and salary earners.  
Generally, addressing  gender issues and women’s economic empowerment in the 
AEC will  require both cross -cutting and sector -specific activities. At the cross -cutting 
level, three recommendations stand out. First, there is a need to institutionalize WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  2  gender issues into the planning and monitoring for the AEC . This can be done 
by establishing a unit with the ASEAN Integration Moni toring Division that would 
focus specifically on gender and women’s economic empowerment, just like there 
are current ly offices addressing trade and finance. This office would be tasked with 
ensuring that all plans implemented in the AEC address gender iss ues and that 
implementation of the impact of the AEC is monitored in a way that highlights 
outcomes for both men and women. The office would also be tasked with raising 
awareness in the other AEC directorates  of the need for incorporating women’s 
economic empowerment principles in agreements as appropriate.   
Second, to enable to gender office of the ASEAN Integration Monitoring Directorate 
(AIMD ) to do its job, it will be necessary to collect more and better data on 
economic integration that is disaggregat ed by sex . This will be difficult and will 
require significant effort on the part of statistical offices in the region, but the process 
needs to start immediately.   
Third, steps should be taken across the spectrum of sectoral bodies to encourage 
consultat ion with women’s organizations  in developing policies and agreements. 
In much the same way that the AEC Blueprint 2025 requires greater consultation 
with the business community to ensure that the private sector view is heard in 
ASEAN deliberations, there i s a need to ensure that the viewpoints of women 
workers and entrepreneurs are heard as well.  
These actions address improvements in  the ASEAN development and integration 
processes that would more effectively prioritize gender issues in the AEC , but it is 
ultimately the changes in policy at both the national and regional level that have an 
impact on outcomes in the digital economy. Fortunately, most countries have 
existing universal service funds that could be used to finance some poli cy 
responses. To the ext ent possible, it is recommended that universal service funds be 
used to promote access to the digital economy and the development of digital skills 
for women. This could include a commitment to use at least a fixed fraction of such 
funds for this purpose.  
The bulk of the paper deals with  26 specific ac tion lines within the CSAP that, if 
properly targeted, could have a positive impact on women’s economic empowerment 
in the digital economy. They can be broadly grouped into three categories: action 
lines affec ting women as entrepreneurs; action lines relating to financial inclusion; 
and action lines addressing training and reskilling of women workers. The paper  
identifies a wide range of recommendations in each of these areas. Two key 
recommendation are highlig hted here.   
A foundational requirement for expanding women’s role as entrepreneurs in the 
digital economy is that they be digitally literate. Among other things, digital literacy  
is increasingly required for access to financial services. Therefore, promotion of 
digital literacy for all ASEAN citizens needs to be a top priority of the AEC to ensure 
equitable and inclusive development.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  3  Several recommendations are made for AEC activ ities that would promote digital 
literacy in the region (see the section  on digital literacy as a prerequisite for 
promoting digital trade  in Chapter 4). These include: i nvest ing in AMS capacity 
building initiatives; e ncouraging AMS to ensure digital literacy and capacity -building 
initiatives consider women’s needs; supporting efforts to provide women with 
opportunities to develop their digital skills through different channels; supporting 
steps to make online content a nd services more accessible to women with limited 
literacy; providing guidance on minimum standards for the content of digital literacy 
curricula; promot ing female role models as internet users ; and partnering with 
existing programs that promote women’s di gital literacy.  
Supporting women -friendly telecenters  (i.e., internet access centers)  is a priority 
because it is a channel for delivering digital literacy and other activities addressed in 
this paper. As noted earlier, internet access center s need to beco me more women -
friendly to more effectively benefit women. Women -only internet access center s may 
be the best strategy in some locations. In others, capacity building in gender 
sensitization for tele center  staff may be sufficient if combined with tracking u sage by 
gender.  
At the regional level, the AEC can further the promotion of women -friendly internet 
access center s at a national level by supporting or conducting region -wide research 
to better understand the needs and preferences for internet access center s by 
different segments of women including women entrepreneurs and workers.  
One of the most widely recognized constraint s on women’s entrepreneurship is lack 
of credit. There is a sizeable gap in MSME financing in ASEAN and particularly for 
women -owned enterprises. Several recommendations are made to improve the 
enabling and regulatory environment  for women borrowers . While several 
recommendations are outlined in Chapter 5, the following are priorities: provide 
guidance to AMS to support them in asse ssing any unintended regulatory impacts 
that hinder women’s financial services; Feed the results into the financial inclusion 
strategy development process; reform legal and regulatory frameworks that hinder 
the financial inclusion of women; and, address an d harmonize the development of 
financial infrastructure such as credit bureaus. These actions would go far to assist 
women in accessing existing financial services.  
With respect to digital financial services,  it is tempting to recommend that all adults in  
ASEAN be provided with biometric identification in order to level the playing field for 
accessing digital financial services, e -government , and other aspects of the digital 
economy, but it is unclear whether there is sufficient need for these IDs at this time.  
Instead, it is recommended that ASEAN assess the benefits that could be 
experienced through using unique, biometric identification  in the region. In this 
respect, it would be important to watch the experience of the Aadh aar program in 
India for lesso ns to be learned.

  5 1 INTRODUCTION  
The ten -member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) established the 
ASEAN Community in 2015 consisting of the ASEAN Political -Security Community 
(APSC), the ASEAN Socio -Cultural Community (ASCC) , and the ASEAN Economic 
Community (AEC). The vision for the AEC is  of an integrated and cohesive regional 
economy that is “competitive, innovative, and dynamic and which has enhanced 
connectivity and sector al cooperation, and a more resilient, inclusive , and people -
oriented, people -cente red community, integrated with the global economy. ”1 The 
AEC is designed to create “a single market and production base” with free -flowing 
goods and services , among other things ,2 while  foster ing robust productivity growth 
through innovation, technology , and human resource development. At the same 
time, the AEC  is also tasked with engender ing more equitable and inclusive 
economic growth in ASEAN while putting t he region on a path to higher and more 
sustainable growth.3  
The roadmap for achieving this vision is laid out in the 2025 AEC Blueprint which 
prioritizes:  
 A strengthened  emphasis on the development and promotion of micro, 
small , and medium enterprises (MSMEs) ; and  
 Embracing  digital technology to leverage enhance d trade and investment, 
provide an e -based business platform, promote good governance , and 
facilitate the use of green technology.  
While seeking to promote inclusive growth, t he AEC Blueprint 2025 makes limited 
references to promoting gender equality and women’s economic empowerment 
(WEE ).4 For example, it recommends promoting women’s participation in science, 
technology , and innovation (STI); fostering women’s entrepreneurship ; and 
promoting women and youth entrepreneurship through MSMEs. The concrete steps 
to implement the aspirations of the AEC Blueprint 2025 are detailed in the AEC 2025 
Consolidated Strategic Action Plan (CSAP). Gender is addressed in the CSAP  
through an emphas is on fostering financial literacy and inclusion, via capacity 
building and innovative means such as digital platforms, for financially unserved and 
underserved groups , including MSMEs and women.   
According to a 2016 study “Projected Gender Impacts of the ASEAN Economic 
Community ,” the legacy of gender inequality in the region means that the policies 
and programs in ASEAN need to be gender -responsive if women and men, and the

promoting and nurturing creative and  inclusive social entrepreneurship for women.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  6  regional economy as a whole, are to reap the full benefits of equita ble and inclusive 
economic integration. 5 
In particular, the same study found that significant barriers to gender equality in the 
region have resulted in lower rates of women’s labor  force and business participation 
(especially in knowledge -driven and skil l-intensive industries and activities) and 
significant and entrenched gender disparities in wages as well as in ownership and 
management of industries and enterprises. The study called for the introduction and 
promotion of gender mainstreaming strategies i n the AEC.  
At the 31st ASEAN Summit in Manila in November 2017, ASEAN’s leaders 
addressed the issue of mainstreaming gender in the AEC by adopting  the Action 
Agenda on Mainstreaming Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) in ASEAN . In 
addition, they adopted  the ASEAN Declaration on the Gender -Responsive 
Implementation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the Sustainable 
Development Goals .6 Both of these documents call for mainstreaming gender  and 
women’s equality  under the AEC as well as the implementation of more robust 
policies to promote WEE  across three ASEAN Communities . The adoption of the 
Action Agenda at the highest level of ASEAN leadership provides the necessary 
support for mapping out and operationalizi ng WEE -driven initiatives, strategies and 
programs in ASEAN.  
The Action Agenda on Mainstreaming 
WEE in ASEAN , set out in Appendix E , 
aims to internalize WEE through 
innovation, trade , and inclusive business, 
as well as related human capital 
development. It calls on each ASEAN 
Member State (AMS) to support the five 
principal components of actions described 
in the six -component Action Agenda.   
At the same meeting, ASEAN leaders 
adopted the ASEAN Declaration on 
Innovation to emphasize the opportunities 
and benefits of innovative start -ups and 
disruptive technologies for AEC 
development and transformation. The 
declaration acknowledged that in order to spur and sustain the growth and 
competitiveness of regional industries and  enterprises under the digital economy, the 
region needs policies to foster innovation -driven entrepreneurship and new

Community,” Jakarta: Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  
6 The Declaration, led by ACW and ACWC, aims to  ensure the reali zation of a people -oriented and people -
centered ASEAN where all women and girls are able to reach the fullest of their potentials through cross -sectoral 
collaboration.  Five Principal Components of the Action Agenda 
on Mainstreaming WEE in ASEAN - 
(Components for AMS):  
1. Adopt concrete and measurable actions to 
address the barriers that impede maximizing 
women’s full economic potential in five areas;  
2. Promote women’s participation and skills 
development in science, technology, engineering, 
arts, and mathematics (STEAM),  including 
information and communication technologies 
(ICT)  
3. Invest in programs which provide enabling 
environments for women micro, small and 
medium enterprises (MSMEs) to prosper;  
4. Increase women’s representation and leadership 
in the workforce at the executive and managerial 
levels; and  
5. Encourage public and private sector collaboration 
through the ASEAN B usiness Advisory Council 
(ASEAN B AC) and ASEAN Women 
Entrepreneurs Network ( AWEN ) for advocacy, 
networking, and outreach purposes . WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY

and competencies for innovation.   
1.1 Study Objectives  
The purpose of this paper is to support the realization of gender mainstreaming and 
women -related initiatives  under the AEC Blueprint 2025, with a special focus on 
WEE  in the context of the digital economy . The paper is in direct response to the 
mandate a nd direction from the leadership of ASEAN provided in the Action Agenda 
on Mainstreaming WEE in ASEAN . It is intended to lay the foundation for moving the 
WEE agenda forward within the AEC and for embedding WEE in strategies, 
programs , and activities across the entire AEC.  
1.2 Scope  
The paper focuses on the AEC 2025 CSAP, especially the strategic measures and 
action lines relating to the digital economy. The proposed strategies and actions in 
the CSAP are examined in terms of the objective s and aspirations of the AEC 
Blueprint 2025 as well as the barriers to WEE. These barriers, particularly those in 
the industries and enterprises driven by innovation and technology, as emphasized 
in the ASEAN Declaration on Innovation, will be discussed . The paper identifies 
informed and practical opportunities for ASEAN to adopt WEE -enhancing policy and 
regulatory frameworks , with special emphasis on those that promote women -owned 
MSMEs . The identified opportunities will be capable of leveraging and maximi zing 
women’s roles and contributions as employees and managers as well as 
entrepreneurs and business persons across the AEC.  
1.3 Methods  
The paper explores these key questions:  
1. What are the key ASEAN -specific factors and forces that have:  
a. constrained or hindered women from obtaining equitable access to 
development opportunities and resources ; and   
b. prevented women from playing their full economic role as wage and salary 
earners or self -employed entrepreneurs and business persons in the digital 
economy ? 
2. What are the specific strategic measures and key action lines under CSAP and 
other sectoral action plans that should contain or incorporate gender 
empowerment measures and actions so as to initiate and/or promote WEE in 
ASEAN ? 
3. What are the range of practical approaches and specific activities that would 
allow the gender empowerment measures identified and proposed in question 2 
above  to be introduced and implemented by various ASEAN sectoral committees 
in the AEC?  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  8  To answer these  questions , the research team  conducted an extensive literature 
review and consultations with key informants at ASEAN and in the region. The 
literature review included official ASEAN documents including, strategic action plans7 
from the relevant sectoral bodies, background papers on  the AEC8, and literature on 
gender and /or WEE  related to ASEAN , on the gender digital divide , or related to the 
digital economy generally .9 The consultations took place during field visits in 
Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The research team  
met with key stakeholders of ASEAN including members of the ASEAN Coordinating 
Committee for MSMEs ( ACCMSME ), ASEAN Committee on Women ( ACW ), ASEAN 
Business Advisory Council ( ASEAN BAC), ASEAN Women Entrepreneurs Network 
(AWEN ), and the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC). Additionally, consultations were held 
with experts at U nited States Agency for  International Development (USA ID), the 
U.S. Department  of State,  and the International Labor Organi zation ( ILO). (See 
Appendix A for the Research Matrix.)  
1.4 Approach  
This paper is intended to provide support to ASEAN in its  effort to mainstream WEE  
in the AEC , within the context of the digital economy, through its existing workplan. A 
review of the definitions of WEE, mainstreaming, and the digital economy  is provided 
here to frame the discussion.  
Surprisingly, there is no single accepted definition  of WEE  at this time. The concept 
of WEE however usually includes three themes:  
1. Women’s increased access to, control over, and ownership of 
resources .  
Resources refers to property, financial tools, cell phones, quality land , and 
other key assets.  
2. Women’s increased agency, voice , and choice . 
This refers to the ability to speak up for their needs and priorities, without 
retribution. It also includes the ability to help shape polices and to have 
decision -making power within the household and in the outside world.

  9  3. Women’s improved well -being and dignity  
This encompasses  several elements  including having a better work -life 
balance, access to education , and overall improved economic opportunities.10  
For the AEC, m ainstreaming WEE will involve a process of assessing how any 
planned action or polic y affects women. The objective of mainstreaming is to make 
women’s concerns an integral part of the design, im plementation, monitoring , and 
evaluat ion of programs and policies. This requires that policy analysis and 
formulation are informed by considerations of gender differences and inequalities. 
Additionally, it implies identifying and taking advantage of opport unities to narrow 
gender gaps and promote greater equality between women and men. The ultimate 
goal is to achieve gender equality in outcomes .11 Importantly, the pursuit and 
achievement of gender equality is expected to contribute to the achievement of othe r 
social and economic achievements such as economic growth and efficiency.  
The digital economy is of specific interest to ASEAN as it seeks to promote inclusive 
economic growth and greater international integration. The world economy is being 
transformed by the interconnection of the internet globally, which has enabled an 
increasing amount of economic activity and international trade. APEC’s Policy 
Support Unit, quoted in Nathan Associates 2017a, estimated the global digital 
market to be worth $3.5 trilli on in 2015.12 Analysis by A.T. Kearny estimated that the 
digital economy has the potential to add $1 trillion to the GDP of ASEAN between 
2015 and 2025.13 The southeast Asia Internet economy (a sub -set of the digital 
economy) is projected to grow to $200 billion by 2025.14 In Indonesia , the digital 
economy is projected to add 3.7 million jobs by 2025, while in Malaysia it is projected 
to comprise 20% of the economy by that same year.15 ASEAN views the digital 
economy as a key driver of economic and social tr ansformation, through enhanced 
trade and investments, and good governance16.  
The digital economy “encompasses all sectors of the economy that rely upon or use 
IP-enabled  [internet protocol -enabled]  networks and platforms as part of the 
embedded infrastruct ure of the society. ”17 As the internet increasingly becomes a 
“fundamental input and driver of all other sectors in the economy” the line between 
the traditional economy and the digital economy will disappear.  
Women can engage with or be affected by the digital economy as economic actors  
in a variety of ways . Women are not a homogenous group. Their economic

education level, marital status, race, and location , etc.  Socio -cultural  factors are also 
at play related to religion, ethnic ity, and country.  These factors can intersect to 
further advantage or disadvantage women. For example, older, less educated 
women working in agriculture face constraints that young college educated women  
living in cities do not encounter. It is beyond the scope of this report to thoroughly 
segment and analyze the market of economically active women in ASEAN. To better 
frame the analysis presented here  and draw out the WEE issues related to the digital 
economy , four general profiles of women were identified.  
 Women  owners of MSMEs using digital technologies  
 Women  entrepreneurs  leading digital technology firms  
 Women workers engaged with digital technologies  
 Women workers impacted by digital technologies  
1.5 Organ ization  
The paper is organized as follows . Chapter 2 discusses the barriers to women’s 
economic empowerment for three types of economic actors: women owners of micro 
and small enterprises ; women who own growth -oriented, tech enterprises ; and 
women workers.  Chapter 3 presents the action lines from the AEC CSAP that hold 
some potential for advancing WEE within ASEAN  that have not been covered in 
other studies . Chapter 4 looks in more detail at the barriers facing women 
entrepreneurs . The chapter then review s the threats and opportunities for 
entrepreneurs from the digital economy . It conclude s with a discussion of how 
selected action lines can incorporate activities to promote WEE  for entrepreneurs . 
Chapter 5 reviews access to finance as a key component of women’s economic 
empowerment  that impacts all women. It concludes with ideas for including activities 
within selected action lines to promote women’s financial inclusion. Chapter 6 is 
similar to Chapter 5 but looks at gender barriers, opportunities , and th reats from the 
digital economy for women workers in ASEAN. Chapter 7 highlights actions that cut 
across sectoral bodies, strategic measures , and action lines and which have the 
potential to both increase the capacity of the AEC to mainstream gender in all  of its  
work and to promote the economic empowerment  of women . The report finishes with 
a summary and prioritization of the recommendations for improving the lives of 
working women in ASEAN. In addition, in many cases in Chapters 4 –7, following the 
recomme ndations for action by ASEAN are examples of successful programs 
implementing similar ideas in other countries as well as resources that can be used 
to design programs for the region.

  11 2 CHALLENGES TO WOMEN’S ECONOMIC 
EMPOWERMENT IN ASEAN   
Despite rapid economic growth in ASEAN over the past two decades which has raised 
living standards, there are still substantial disparities between men and women in the 
economy, as indicated by the Global Gender Gap report issued by the World 
Economic For um in 2017. ASEAN member states scored between 0.61 to 0.769 (out 
of a possible 1.0) on the Economic Participation and Opportunity sub -index which 
measures gender inequalities in the labor force participation rates, remuneration rates, 
and advancement oppo rtunities in business and political leadership (see Table 2.1).18  
Note that the scores in Table 2.1 below refer to the degree to which men and women 
within the same country differ on the Economic Participation and Opportunity Index 
and the Global Index.

The AEC Blueprint is expected to increase trade, cross -country investment , and 
skilled labor  integration through trade liberalization and economic policies. An 
analysis of the impact of these changes on women’s economic opportunities given 
existing gender inequalities in access to resources and asset ownership, found that 
existing gender inequiti es will remain unchanged in the absence of policy 
interventions.19 The AEC plan is expected to lead to higher total exports from the 
region , yet the relative female share of exports will decline in the future, due to 
“informalization, lower wages, higher labor force dropout , and external migration out 
of ASEAN.”20 While a significant number of new jobs will be created, the impact on 
the pattern of employment and wages for women will be small. The wage gender 
gap will stay the same while job gains will be high er for men than for women in both

  12  the semi -skilled and unskilled categories. The report concluded that without policies 
to address gender gaps, existing gender differentials in the share of exports, 
employment , and wages will remain the same under the AEC’ s current strategy.  
Economic disparity is an important concern because  it reduces the amount and 
quality of human resources available for economic activity and effects the 
productivity of countr ies and of ASEAN as a community. As such , it impacts the 
grow th prospects for the region.  Although all countries in ASEAN provide 
constitutional equality for men and women, this has not led to equality of outcomes  
for the sexes . There is still a gap in the level of schooling that boys and girls attain . 
In addition, women have persistently lower  labor  force participation rates than men , 
averaging 19  percent  for the region .21 Women earn less than men on average  for the 
same work . Additionally, occupational segregation  often relegates women to lower 
skilled and lower pay ing jobs . The overall wage gap between men and women is 
estimated to be 20  percent .22 Women’s choices in work are constrained by a lack of 
affordable quality child care in all ASEAN countries.  The lack of safe and reliable 
transportation is a limiting facto r for women to access work  in some countries.23 
2.1 Economic Empowerment Across Different Groups of Women  
Women’s economic empowerment is directly linked to the opportunities and status of 
women’s  paid and unpaid work. Most women , and indeed most men, in Southeast  
Asia are employed informally (78  percent ).24 For jobs outside of agriculture, the rate 
is 67.4  percent  of all jobs. In general, w omen are just slightly more likely than men to 
be working informally (78.4  percent  versus  77.7 percent ).25 For example,  women 
workers predomina te in the agricultural, garment , and tourism sectors, which 
account for a large share of exports for many AMS. While many garment sector jobs 
are in factories, there are also many informal jobs in which women work from home 
under short -term contracts from subcontractors. The quality of women’s work 
conditions is often poor.  Even in the more developed economies of ASEAN, women 
are predominantly employed in labor -intensive and vulnerable jobs. Lower -skilled  
and informal jobs  have limited opportunities for advancement or for skills training . 
Furthermore , informal workers are without social protection, income security, rights 
at work , or decent working conditions.  Although harassment of women in the 
workplace occurs, this issue is not y et recognized in the region.26 In the formal 
economy, including the private and government sectors, women are over -

the place of work of the worker. By contrast, informal employment is a job -based concept and it is defined in terms of the 
employment re lationship and protections associated with the job of the worker.” (International Labor Organization, 2018a,

Organization, 7.)

AMS.  
Migrant women make up an important segment of women workers in ASEAN. 
Women are believed to comprise 48.7 percent of the 6.9 million intra -ASEAN 
migrants in 2015.27 They account for a significant share of the workforce in ASEAN, 
making up more than 10 percent of the total workforce in Brunei Darussalam and 
from 2 to 4 percent in Thailand and Malaysia.28 Actual numbers of women migrants 
in ASEAN are likely much higher as undocumented workers are not included in the 
official statistics. These three countries, along with Singapore, are destination 
countries for m igrants, while the workers generally come from Cambodia, Indonesia, 
Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines , and Viet Nam.29 The “feminization of migration ” 
is a clear  trend in migration. In 2004, 81 percent of migrant workers leaving 
Indonesia were women.30  
Wome n migrant workers tend to be young and have low levels of education. They 
make significant contributions in the household, agriculture, manufacturing , and 
construction sectors in their host countries. Their work contributes to both the origin 
and destinati on countries, through remittances home and by increasing wages in the 
destination country.31 Women migrant workers are found in low skilled jobs earning 
low wages. In Brunei Darussalam  and Malaysia, women migrants earned less than 
half that of all employed women. They also earned 30 to 50 percent less than 
migrant men.32 When migrant women work in high growth sectors, they are 
employed at the bottom of the occupational skill ladder. There is evidence that 
“ethnic stereotypes and gender norms” interact to trap  migrant women into “general 
labor ” job categories at the bottom rung of the job ladder with no upward mobility or 
job skill opportunities.33 Migrant women workers have little access to social 
protection. Although migrants may be documented, they can easily  slip into an 
undocumented status and end up working informally , in which case they are not 
covered by national employment regulations.34 It is estimated that over one -third of 
all migrants in ASEAN are working informally.35 The UN Women and Friedrich -Ebert -
Stiftung report, Women Migrant Workers in the ASEAN Economic Community  
examines the situation of women migrant workers in ASEAN in detail and provides 
recommendations which would allow the ASEAN region to realize the full p otential of 
women migrant workers’ productivity while enabling this segment of the women’s 
workforce to benefit from the opportunities arising from ASEAN integration. This

given this previous comprehensive study.  
Many women who are informally employed are owners of micro or small enterprises. 
A large share of the MSMEs (micro, small , and medium enterprises) in the region 
are informal . The majority are very small in size with ei ther zero or 1 –5 employees. 
Women’s businesses tend to be smaller than men’s.36 The informal status of their 
businesses confronts women entrepreneurs with several disadvantages , including 
low productivity . Additionally, t hese entrepreneurs are less likely t o contribute to 
pension plans or other social insurance. There  is a belief that women prefer 
entrepreneurship because it provides the flexibility needed to balance work and 
unpaid care responsibilities.  
Women entrepreneurs face several challenges when starting and growing their 
businesses. They lack access to credit, technology , and other productive resources. 
They have limited access to business and skills training , as well as to information  
and markets . They also face expensive and difficult regulatio ns and administrative 
requirements.37While women have generally high levels of participation in economic 
activities in ASEAN , they still retain responsibility for the care of their families. The 
resulting time poverty of women is an important factor in thei r economic outcomes. 
Women’s unpaid care work can constrain their options for employment and income -
earning activities. Women workers and entrepreneurs are also subject to 
sociocultural norms, pervasive stereotypes, and a lack of family support —all factors  
that hold them back economically. The presence and recognition of customary laws 
in some countries creates legal barriers to women’s rights and economic 
participation. A lack of clarity concerning  key labor  laws puts women in relatively 
weaker position s in the labor  market.  
2.2 How the Digital Economy  Will Chang e ASEAN  
The AEC has embraced the digital economy and is working to leverage digital 
technology to enhance trade and investment, provide an e -based business platform, 
promote good governance , and fac ilitate green technology  for the region . The vision 
is for “a digitally -enabled economy that is secure, sustainable and transformative 
which can promote and develop an innovative, inclusive , and integrated ASEAN. ”38 
The ASEAN ICT Masterplan  articulate d the role of information and communications 
technologies ( ICTs ) (i.e., digital technology) in each element of this vision:  
 Digitally -enabled economy : Programs for continual education and 
upgrading  to equip ASEAN citizens with the latest infrastructure, 
technology, digital skill sets, information, applications , and services.  
 Secure : A safe and trusted ICT environment  in ASEAN, providing

transactions via a robust infrastructure ; 
 Sustainable : Responsible and environmentally friendly use of ICT;  
 Transformative : A progressive environment for the disruptive use of 
technology for ASEAN’s social and economic benefits;  
 Innovative : A supportiv e entrepreneurial environment that encourages 
innovative and novel uses of ICT; and  
 Inclusive and integrated : Empowered and connected citizens  and 
stakeholders .39 
 
Embracing the digital economy entails an economy -wide transformation that will 
impact all sectors. Digital technology provides many benefits. It is estimated to boost 
GDP across ASEAN by: increasing broadband penetration; raising worker 
productivity; and c reating new digital industries (e.g., e -commerce).40 In addition to 
boosting productivity, the digital economy achieves efficiency gains while allowing 
global reach. It facilitat es faster, easier , and cheaper trade within ASEAN and with 
external partners. It enables individual and small business es to reach market s 
anywhere in the world. Digital trade is bringing previously unconnected MSMEs to 
regional marketplaces for cross -border retail trade and is linking  them  to global value 
chains. Digital finance has the potential to extend financial services to the unbanked, 
underbanked , and MSMEs. Digital technologies are expected to support smart cities 
to address the challenge of rapid urbanization in ASEAN.  
Two recent studies that have looked at how ASEAN  will change as it transitions to 
the digital economy found reasons for optimism as well as caution . While new 
technologies drive higher productivity and are the foundation for better paying jobs 
and economic growth, automation could cause widespread job loss , particularly in 
certain sectors and certain types of jobs . Improvements in t echnology used by global 
value chains (GVCs) have been accompanied by lower employment levels across all 
sectors (agriculture, manufacturing , and services), except in the Ph ilippine s and Viet 
Nam .41 (See the section in Chapter 6 on retraining and reskilling women workers for 
more on how the development of the digital economy in ASEAN is expected to 
impact jobs for women. ) 
The changing economy will have differential effects depending on how women 
engage with the economy. Below we briefly introduce the benefits and challenges 
that the digital economy poses for : women entrepreneurs using digital technologies ; 
women entrepreneu rs leading digital technology firms ; and women working within 
the context of the digital economy . This paper  goes into more detail on each profile 
in the chapters that follow.

  16  2.3 Challenges for Women Owners of Micro and Small Enterprises   
The AEC is putting great emphasis on the development of MSMEs to generate 
employment and economic growth in the AMS . The use of digital and ICT 
technologies can allow women entrepreneurs to : reach out to customers ; 
communicate better with others in their value chain ; and access government e -
services, information , and online trainings. ICT is now a necessary tool for running a 
business. The digital economy has also created demand for services related to 
information technology ( IT), the internet, mobile phones , and digital finance. In 
addition, it has created an opening for technology -based start -ups.   
E-commerce provides new opportunities and many potential benefits for women 
entrepreneurs. Yet, women who wish to start up an e -business encounter many 
hurdles. Misconceptions about the nature of e -commerce keep some entrepreneurs, 
including women, from entering this type of business  (see Chapter 4 for more 
details) .  
To take advantage of the benefits that are possible with digital technology  and to 
engage in e -commerce,  women entrepreneurs need effective access to technology . 
For micro and small entrepreneurs, this begins with mobile phones , but it also 
requires the infrastructure for effective use of the phones , including reliable network 
coverage and electricity.  
Women face several barriers to the uptake  and use of ICTs such as mobile phones 
and the internet. These include the capacity to afford handsets and data plans, the 
ability to use the technology (which is in some cases hindered by d ifficulties in 
reading and writing) , and the perception that these technologies are not relevant to 
their lives. Concerns about safety and security, both offline and online, also prevent 
some women from using  mobile phones or the internet.  
In addition to the barriers to women’s uptake of ICTs, women entrepreneurs who 
want to engage in e -commerce face external challenges to conducting business 
online. E-commerce activity is curbed to some extent by the l ack of digital payment 
systems that would allow seamle ss payments, limited logistic s infrastructure for 
delivering goods to customers, and a lack of demand due to customer s being 
unfamiliar with or lacking trust in e-commerce to varying  degrees.  Where digital 
payment services exist, women may have difficulty accessing existing digital 
financial services due to a lack of official identification which is required for KYC 
(know your customer) purposes.  
A global survey of e -commerce entrepreneurs for example, found that cash on 
delivery was a more important paymen t method for women than for men (13  percent  
versus  9 percent ). Cash on delivery was the prominent method in developing 
countries , with 20  percent  relying on this method for their transactions. The main 
reason is the lack of access to e -payment solutions. L ack of trust in e -payments may 
limit uptake for both consumers and businesses. Cash on delivery reliance reduces WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  17  the ability to do cross -border sales. Customers may also lack online payment 
abilities (cards, etc.). 
2.4 Challenges for Women Entrepreneurs Leadin g Digital 
T echnology Firms   
The AEC emphasis on the development of MSMEs is also expected to enable 
ASEAN to become more globally competitive, innovative, inclusive , and resilient.  
Women entrepreneurs who aspire to start up and grow tech firms have the potential 
to create significant value and contribute to the achievement of the AEC vision. Very 
few entrepreneurs in any country are growth -oriented. Estimates are that only 3 to 
10 pe rcent of all entrepreneurs actually grow their business. Women -owned 
businesses rarely grow from micro to small or medium -sized companies.42 Yet, 
promotion of women -owned , growth -oriented enterprises is important as these firms 
are more likely to create job s.43  
In addition to the many challenges facing typical women -owned MSMEs , growth -
oriented entrepreneurs are hampered by the fact that almost all interventions to 
promote women -owned businesses are focused on low -income or poor women with 
micro businesses . Few entrepreneurship development programs work with women 
who have higher human and social capital .44 Growth -oriented entrepreneurs also 
need other types of support. For one, growth -oriented business women are less 
likely to benefit from traditional classro om-based business trainings. They need 
programs tailored to the type and stage of their business and which can provide the 
information and skills needed to support business growth.  
Business incubators and accelerator  programs increasingly emphasize grow ing 
tech-oriented businesses. Women’s organizations in ASEAN have recently set up 
women’s business incubators and accelerators , but these are limited and small , 
resulting in only a few women -owned start-ups gaining access  to them . Women tend 
also to be under-represented in the larger, government -supported accelerator 
programs .  
A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific  (ESCAP ) found that technology -focused firms in ASEAN face barriers related 
to “poor protection and promotion of intellectual property rights ; lack of broadband 
infrastructure ; underdeveloped science/industrial parks and competitive cluster 
arrangements; and insufficient financial incentives for technology development and 
research and development.”45 Additionally, at the policy level, the  study  found that 
there is a “lack of strategic innovation policies for SMEs ; poor innovation support

  18  services ; a lack of technology support in universities, research and development labs 
and incubators ; and weak linka ges between these and SME s.”46 From the policy 
side, promoting women -owned tech businesses in ASEAN may be challenging. 
ASEAN entrepreneurs in a survey by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor  were 
found to have fairly low levels of capacity for innovation .47  
2.5 Challenges for Women Workers in the Digital Economy  
The impact of technology and ICTs will fall disproportionately on  employed  women 
as they are in sectors and occupations that are at high risk of displacement from 
automation. The ILO reports that w omen i n the Philippines and Viet Nam  are twice 
as likely to be in an occupation that is at high-risk of displacement as their male 
counterparts. In Indonesia and Thailand, women’s jobs are 1.5 times as likely as 
men’s jobs to be at high-risk of displacement.48 The groups that will be left behind as 
the economy transitions will be those with weaker basic skills, older workers, the 
poor, those in rural areas , and women.49  
New jobs will require skills and education that many workers do not have. To 
successfully navig ate this changing environment, women workers will need skills 
development and retraining, as well as social protection to provide a safety net in 
case of unemployment. It is most likely that displaced workers who have low skills 
and low levels of education  will join the informal sector and pursue entrepreneurship 
or less secure and less remunerative jobs. In five of the ASEAN countries, 
vulnerable jobs50 are estimated to make up one -half of the projected new jobs under 
the AEC Blueprint.51  
At the same time t hat more traditional jobs are disappearing due to  automation, 
there is an increased demand for jobs that require ICT skills. However, women in 
general will not be able to fill these jobs. Several factors hold back women who wish 
to pursue careers or busine sses which require significant ICT or digital technology 
skills. These include lack of educational preparation for an ICT career, a lack of 
digital literacy, and barriers to entry and advancement in the ICT industry .52 Social 
and cultural norms and stereotypes affect women’s access to both education and

They are less likely to have formal work arrangements, and are therefore more likely to lack decent working conditions, 
adequate social securit y and ‘voice’ through effective representation by trade unions and similar organizations.” These jobs 
are characterized by inadequate earnings, low productivity, and difficult work conditions.  (“Vulnerable Employment And

  19  ICT careers. Role models and mentors who could inspire and support women in their 
studies and careers are lacking. Companies, which could provide flexible working 
arrang ements to accommodate women’s schedules, are not doing so. The digital 
economy also demands increasingly advanced technical abilities that require 
workers to continually upgrade their skills. Women face disadvantages when it 
comes to training and skills up grading due to a bias toward investing in men’s 
education before women’s.  
The actual situation of women in  the ASEAN nations and the magnitude of the 
challenges facing them are not entirely known. In consultations with key informants, 
the limitations due to a lack of sex -disaggregated data for a number of variables  
were raised several times. As one key informant put it, the lack of data makes it 
difficult to have a targeted policy or program. The analysis of the literature revealed 
that it was difficult to  find complete datasets across all AMS, for particular indicators. 
This report provides data and statistics to the extent that they were identified and it 
raises the need for sex -disaggregated data on a number of issues, as a priority for 
ASEAN.  
2.6 Summary  
Women in the ASEAN region face a range of barriers to their economic activit ies, 
whether they are formal sector workers, owners of small and medium enterprises , or 
micro entrepreneurs  in the informal sector. With the rise of the digital economy, 
women have n ew opportunities at work and in business , but with these new 
opportunities come additional challenges. Women who are already in the workforce 
need access to training and reskilling to prepare for new jobs. Digital technology is 
creating new opportunities for accessing finance through new channels and from 
new sources , but women face several barriers to acquiring the financial services 
they need. Additionally, as financial services are increasingly made available through 
ICTs, women will need valid forms of  identification to access these. A n eKYC -
compliant means of identification would allow women to not only access financial 
services but also a host of online government services including cash transfers . 
(eKYC is the acronym for paperless know -your-customer  [KYC] process .) Women 
entrepreneurs will continue to need traditional business development support, 
including access to markets and networks , and an enabling environment  to help their 
businesses thrive . These services , however , need to be better tailored to women 
entrepreneurs’ needs and circumstances. They will also need to use digital 
technologies to remain competitive, whether they are in  e-commerce or a traditional 
business . Women who seek to establish tech start -ups will require tailored support , 
acce ss to tech incubators and accelerators, as well as more supportive government 
policies. All women will need digital literacy  to engage with the digital economy . This 
is particularly salient as cyber safety and privacy are becoming increasingly 
important.  
 WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  21 3 PROMOTION OF W EE THROUGH THE AEC CSAP   
In order to more effectively implement the AEC Blueprint 2025, ASEAN developed 
the AEC Blueprint Consolidated  Strategic Action Plan. The AEC CSAP is organized 
along the lines of the ASEAN AEC Blueprint 2015. There are five characteristics that 
are targeted for strengthening or reinforcing during the 2016 –2025 strategic period:  
1. A Highly Integrated and Cohesive Ec onomy;  
2. A Competitive, Innovative, and Dynamic ASEAN;  
3. Enhanced Connectivity and Sectoral Cooperation;  
4. A Resilient, Inclusive and People -Oriented, People -Centred ASEAN; and  
5. A Global ASEAN . 
Each Characteristic has an Objective with several elements. Each Elem ent has its 
own sub-Objective which has several Strategic Measures that are intended to 
achieve the sub -Objective. The Strategic Measures are to be operationalized by key 
Action Lines undertaken by relevant ASEAN sectoral bodies through their 
corresponding  sectoral workplans. Each Action Line also has a timeline during which 
the action is expected to be taken.53 
In order to effectively integrate WEE into the implementation of the AEC Blueprint, 
this paper focuses on identifying actions that can be taken to s hape specific CSAP 
strategic measures and actions lines to better address the needs of women in the 
roles identified in the previous chapter . To do this, t he full CSAP was reviewed to 
identify action lines that could promote WEE given the barriers to t he equal and 
equitable participation of women in the digital economy. After an iterative process, a 
short list of action lines was selected that have the potential to address three types 
of challenges for women. Pursuing solutions to these challenges through  action line 
activities will go far to promote WEE through the AEC. These three solution  areas 
are:  
 Development and growth  of women -owned MSMEs;  
 Financial inclusion of women , including digital financial inclusion ; and  
 Training and reskilling women worke rs.  
The selected action lines are presented below, organized by solution. In addition to 
these solutions, desk research and interviews with key informants surfaced 
opportunities to strengthen the capacity of the AEC to mainstream WEE, as well as 
cross -cutting solutions that relate to multiple action lines. These solutions are 
presented in Chapter 7. The complete list of the selected CSAP action lines are 
presented in Appendix  B, in the order they appear in the CSAP.

  22  3.1 Development and Growth of Wome n-owned MSMEs  
The importance of the development of MSMEs for ASEAN is evidenced by the 
element of the  AEC Blueprint  (Blueprint)  dedicated to “Strengthening the Role of 
MSMEs. ” In addition to the dozens of action lines included under this element, there 
are several action lines addressing aspects of MSME development within other 
elements of the Blueprint . For example, the C2 Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) element contains the action line, “Develop an  ecosystem 
conducive to support start-ups and strengthen enterprises.”

  23  The O rganization for Economic Co -operation  and Development (O ECD ) and ASEAN 
Coordination Committee on MSMEs  (ACCMSME)  provided a comprehensive report , 
Strengthening Women’s Entrepreneurship in ASEAN , which presented a detailed 
discussion of the barriers facing women entrepreneurs in ASEAN. 54 It concluded with 
an extensive list of program and policy recommendations  for both ASEAN and AMS. 
55 (These recommendations are presented in Appendix C.) The OECD 
recommendations were mapped out against the AEC action lines that address 
MSME development or eng age MSMEs. (These results are presented in Appendix 
D.) Action lines that are not addressed by OECD recommendations  or those which 
affect women MSME owners in the context of the digital economy were selected for 
this analysis and are presented in Table 3.1 above .  
3.2 Financial Inclusion  
The CSAP items that were selected relating to financial inclusion include action lines 
that directly address financial inclusion and access to finance , as well as action lines 
related to addressing the digital divide, a prerequisite for accessing digital finance . 
Additionally , action lines related to financial literacy  were selected as financial 
literacy is a prerequisite for effective and appropriate use of financial services . These 
action lines fall under the strategic measures: A4 Financial Integration, Financial 
Inclusion and Financial Stability; C2 Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT); D1 Strengthening the Role of MSMEs; and D4 Narrowing the Development 
Gap. (See Table 3.2 for the complete list.)

3.3 Training and Reskilling Women Workers  
There are few action lines which address the need to train and reskill workers . Below 
is a list of four action lines which provide opportunit ies to promote the economic 
empowerment of women workers  (Table 3.3). These are focused on building the 
capacity  of workers and awareness raising for industry and policymakers. Retraining 
women a nd providing them with  new technology -related skills is an area of WEE  that 
requires more attention  by the AEC.

The next three chapters examine the challenges and potential remedies for WEE 
which can be applied through the selected action lines discussed above . The 
chapters are organized by the three solution areas: the development and growth of 
women -owned MSMEs; t he financial inclusion of women; and the training and 
reskilling of women workers. Each chapter examines these challenges in more detail 
and provides policy guidance for promoting WEE through specific action lines.  Also, 
where available, best practice examples and references to useful resources are 
provided.   
 WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  25 4 DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN -OWNED MSMES IN THE 
DIGITAL ECONOMY  
The development of MSMEs to generate employment and economic growth in AMS  
is a str ong focus of the AEC Blueprint . This emphasis reflects the dominance of 
MSMEs in the ASEAN economy and their importance in terms of poverty reduction. 
MSMEs provide from 51.7 percent to 97.2 percent of all employment  in ASEAN 
Member States , consist of betw een 88.8 percent and 99.9 percent of all 
establishments, produce 30 percent to 53 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ), 
and contribute between 19 percent and 31 percent of exports.56 Female ownership of 
firms is believed to be relatively high in ASE AN, with an estimated 61.3 million 
women entrepreneurs across the region. For example, the share of firms that have a 
wom an owner or co -owner was estimated to be 69 percent in the Philippines, 59 
percent in Viet Nam , and 43 percent in Indonesia in 201 5.57  
4.1 Bene fits of ICTs and Digital Technology for Women 
Entrepreneurs  
The digital economy provides several benefits and opportunities for women 
entrepreneurs. The use of digital and ICT technologies can allow women 
entrepreneurs to reach out to customers ; communicat e better with others in their 
value chain ; and access government e -services, information , and online business 
trainings. Digital technology als o gives  entrepreneurs new ways to promote their 
business, including reaching international audiences, and to deve lop new marketing 
channels.  They can provide new opportunit ies for women in rural areas  and women 
who stay at home.  ICTs are now a necessary tool for running a business. MSMEs 
owners can achieve lower transaction costs, improve efficiency and outreach, and  
earn higher profits by using new technologies. Evidence from Europe found 
significant productivity gains for businesses using ICTs, with the effects being larger 
for small enterprises.58 Other research has found a correlation between the growth of 
women -owned microenterprises and ICT use.59  
Technology can also help women overcome some of the challenges they face as 
entrepreneurs. For example, mobile money can enable women to more easily 
access financial services. Mobile phones and the internet can a ssist women who 
have less mobility due to household responsibilities. The g rowth of mobile 
broadband, smartphone ownership , and social media activity is driving the growth of 
e-commerce in the ASEAN region. Internet uptake now averages 40  percent  across

  26  the region .60 Women can engage in e -commerce from their homes through social 
media. Access to government services through the internet can save women time.  
Technology itself has created business opportunities. This includes the demand for 
mobile information agents, mobile phone sales and technical support, mobile money 
agents, women -friendly IT service provision, and women -friendly IT tutoring and 
training. Technology has enabled other businesses , such as  outsourcing of IT 
services and freelance microwork. Mi crowork, supported through online platforms, 
enables individual entrepreneurs to find work with clients based around the world.61 
The digital economy  has also created an opening for technology -based start-ups. 
E-commerce represents a potentially huge opport unity for women MSME  owners. It 
is growing rapidly in ASEAN, providing MSMEs with access to new opportunities and 
new markets. Micro and small bus iness could become “micro -multinationals” through 
digital platforms that connect them to outside markets .62 Globally, cross -border e -
commerce in 2016  accounted for 12  percent  of global goods traded . It is expected to 
grow at twice the rate of domestic e -commerce.63 Global e -commerce, domestic and 
cross -border, totaled $25.3 trillion in 2015 .64  
A survey of e -comme rce providers, conducted by the International Trade Center  
(ITC), found that in developing countries, these firms are mainly micro and small 
enterpris es. Forty -one percent were micro, with 5 or fewer employees, and 31  
percent  were small, with 6 to 20 emplo yees. The study also found that a very high 
proportion of respondents that were only involved in cross -border e -trade  were micro 
or small in size.65 Of the surv ey respondents who had not engaged in e -commerce 
yet, women -owned or led firms were 1.5 times more likely than male -led firms to 
have considered doing e -commerce.66 Anecdotal evidence from consultations with 
ASEAN stakeholders throughout the region suggest that currently women prefer to 
conduct business through social media such as Facebook, WhatsAp p, and 
Instagram rather than an internet platform, such as Alibaba, limiting their ability to 
engage in cross -border trade.  
4.2 Challenges to Women Using Digital Technologies as 
Entrepreneurs  
To take advantage of the new possibilities and to engage in e -commer ce, women 
entrepreneurs need effective access to technology. For micro and small

  27  entrepreneurs, this begins with mobile phones, but it also requires the infrastructure 
necessary to be able to use phones effective ly, network coverage , and reliable 
electrici ty. Limited resources, lower levels of literacy and digital literacy, and social 
norms have limited women’s access to mobile phones on a global basis.  
Gender disaggregated and consistent data on the actual uptake and use of mobile 
phones or the internet a re difficult to find for the ASEAN countries. With the dynamic 
growth in the uptake of mobile phones, and particularly smart phones, up -to-date 
data is critical to understanding the status of women’s ownership and use of these 
technologies. The data that i s available does not distinguish between entrepreneurs 
and other groups. Evidence on the barriers to women’s uptake and use of mobile 
phones and the internet in AMS is also limited. (See Chapter 7 for more on the need 
for gender -disaggregated data.)

Women’s access to mobile phones : Table 4.1 above  presents data on access to 
mobile phones and internet for survey respondents in seven AMS in 2016. Access to 
a mobile phone was relatively high, ranging from 73  percent  to 94  percent  of 
respondents. The average gender gap in mobile phones ownership was 2  percent  in 
the East Asia and Pacific region, but varies widely across the region, according to a 
separate survey.67 This is not a large difference and it is unclear how closely these 
results reflect the situation in ASEAN. Globally, the gap between men and women’s 
use of mobile phones is wider than that for mobile phone ownership.  
Women in Indonesia, Myanmar , and the Philippines have reported that affordability, 
usability and skills, and relevance are the top three reasons for not owning a mobile 
phone. In these countries, women were more likely than men to report that not 
knowing how to use a mobile phone or that reading and writing difficulties a re 
barriers to owning a phone .68 The reasons for women’s lower usage of mobile

  28  phones are unclear. They may well be related to affordability, not knowing how to 
use a mobile phone that well and/or reading and writing d ifficulties.  
Women’s a ccess to the internet : Data for seven of the ASEAN countries 
demonstrate that mobile internet use varies considerably across the region (see 
Table 4.1 above ). Access to a phone and to the internet ranges from 26 percent to 
85 percent of survey respondents. The total share of respondents with access to the 
internet ranged from 27 percent in Cambodia to 87 percent in Singapore. Five 
percent to 27 percent of respondents are totally excluded from having a phone and 
access to the internet. The level of exclusion is roughly related to the stage of 
development of the country.  
As a mobile first region, most  women entrepreneurs will need a n internet -enabled  
mobile phone (a smart phone) to engage in e -commerce. Data from the G SMA, a 
global association of mobile network operators,  demonstrate that mobile internet use 
varies considerably across ASEAN. The gender gap in mobile internet use is 4  
percent  in the East Asia and Pacific region, which is small compared to the global 
average of 26  percent.69  
Data from Myanmar and the Philippines show that the top reasons women mention 
for not access ing the internet from their mobile phones are affordability and 
perceived relevance. Lack of know -how and inaccessibility, including lack of network 
coverage , were other important barriers .70 In addition to the barriers to women’s 
uptake of mobile internet, women entrepreneurs face external challenges to 
conducting business online. Lack of digital payment systems that would allow 
seamless payments, limited logi stic infrastructure for delivering goods to customers, 
and lack of customer familiarity and trust constrain e -commerce to varying degrees.  
Barriers to participating in e -commerce : Aside from barriers to the uptake of 
mobile internet, women owners of MSMEs who engage in e -commerce face more 
barriers than men, particularly when scaling up their e -business. Women 
entrepreneurs engaged in cross -border e -commerce export to fewer markets than 
men ( nine versus  fifteen ).71 Misconceptions about e -commerce prevent some 
entrepreneurs from participating. These misconceptions include the beliefs that: e-
commerce is only for goods, not for services; it is only for B2C (business -to-
consumer), not B2B (business -to-business) models;  it entails mass production; and 
there are more counterfeits online (that is , entrepreneurs fear hav ing their unique 
designs copied).  
The barriers that entrepreneurs face when setting up or operating an e -business 
include the following, among others: lack of technical skills (specifically related to 
setting up and maintaining an online presence and other skills specific to e -
commerce) and business knowledge ; difficulty in registering or complying with

  29  platform requirements ; lack of digital payment systems t hat would allow for seamless 
payments ; and limited logistics infrastructure. Entrepreneurs in e -commerce also 
face lower demand due to lack of customer familiarity and lower levels of consumer 
trust in e -commerce.  
Affordability : The costs of connectivity a nd handset devices pose relatively higher 
barriers to internet access for women than men  because  women hav e relatively 
lower incomes and less financial independence. Women who can only access the 
internet through public access facilities or telecenter s fac e even more challenges . 
Other factors that restrict women’s access to ICTs include l imited operating hours, 
distant location, personal safety when traveling , and public tele center s in which 
women feel unwelcome or unc omfortable in the center .72  
In countries where public tele center s are the only place s with internet access,  
women’s access to ICTs may be restricted by  the existence of an environment which 
is not women -friendly or gender -sensitive,  or in which  women are subject to 
harassment ; their acc ess may also be limited social norms that see women’s use of 
such centers or engagement in such activities as  inappropriate.  
Digital literacy/ usability and skills: Low levels of digital literacy can hinder women 
from benefiting from mobile phones and the internet. With lower levels of literacy and 
overall education than men, women often have lower levels of digital literacy. 
Importantly, they tend to have lower levels of confidence in their technical abilities.  
Weak digital literacy leads to other challeng es. Without access to the internet, 
women cannot  access online information or trainings that would enable them to build 
their technical capabilities. Additionally, they cannot  effectively access online 
government e -services or government procurement sites,  thus precluding them from 
opportunities .73 Lower confidence levels may lead women to be reluctant to use the 
internet , or may lead them to use only a few trusted sites, due to fears about cyber 
safety or loss of privacy. A t the same time , those women who d o go online  but lack  
digital skills can be at risk for these same reasons. The lack of digital literacy will 
prevent women in ASEAN from fully participating in the digital economy and poses 
several risks to their online well -being.  
Relevance including ava ilability of local content : Women are more likely than 
men to believe that mobile phones and the internet are not relevant for them (see 
Appendix G ).74 Other studies have found that the lack of relevant content is second 
only to infrastructure as the most important barrier  to the adoption  of mobile 
internet .75 The lack of content in the local language s contributes to the lack of overall

taking into consideration women’s n eeds , preferences  or capabilities.77 
Threats to access and use of mobile phones and the internet : Safety and 
security when using mobile devices or the internet was ranked lower as a barrier to 
accessing mobile phones or t he internet. However, for the most part, women were 
more concerned than men about safety and security when accessing these 
technologies.  
GSMA research has revealed a “paradoxical relationship ” between mobile phones 
and women’s perceptions of safety. This research found that “68 to 94  percent  of 
female respondents in 11 low - and middle -income countries reported feeling safer 
with a mobile phone or that they would feel safer if they owned one.”78 Yet studies 
consistently show  that safety concerns are an impor tant barrier to women’s 
ownership of mobile phones.  
Research that has looked more closely at safety and security issues found several 
aspects to this concern. Women fear being vulnerable to theft and physical violence 
related to having  a mobile phone. The y are also concerned about receiving  
harassing and unwanted texts or phone calls. Online, women fear “intimidation, 
harassment, violence, surveillance and/or illegal data retention.”79 Women who are 
active online and experience problems find it difficult to  report o nline abuse.80  
Women who engage in e -commerce face real threats when using the internet. In 
addition to the danger of fraud, women entrepreneurs who sell goods on a COD 
(cash on delivery)  basis are known to provide their bank account information to 
buyers, over the phone , putting themselves at risk . 
Quality of business development support services : Business development 
support (BDS) services comprise a wide range of nonfinancial services designed to  
strengthen the capacity of small enterprises to enter and survive, increase 
productivity, grow, and compete in the market. This includes: training, advisory 
services, marketing assistance, information, technology development and transfer, 
mentoring , and business linkage promotion. The OECD report Strengthening 
Women’s Entrepreneurship in ASEAN  addressed the need for more gender -
responsive BDS services for women. That report pointed to examples of BDS 
programs that incorporated trainings on ICTs, but it did not directly review the 
relationship betwe en BDS and ICT.  
Mainstream BDS does not adequately take into consideration the multitude of 
constraints facing women entrepreneurs . As a result, the uptake of BDS by women

  31  entrepreneurs has been rather low. Gender -sensitive BDS services would take into 
account the specific needs of women entrepreneurs and provide services without 
any gender bias. ICTs can be combined with BDS in two ways. First, making use of 
ICTs could increase women entrepreneurs ’ participation by enabling more flexible 
services that meet  their needs.  Example s include  trainings and services delivered 
via mobile phones or online, and text alerts about upcoming trainings. In the same 
vein, ICTs can complement or substitute for classroom trainings ; mentoring and 
coaching can be delivered by S kype. Second , training on the effective use of ICTs 
can be tailored to women’s specific needs and delivered alongside business 
trainings. BDS trainings for women, including ICT trainings, should be designed 
taking into consideration restrictions on women’s  mobility and time availability. ICTs 
offer the potential to provide BDS services on a much wider scale, reaching many 
more women entrepreneurs. The ASEAN SME Academy , an online service  run by 
ASEAN, is one promising example .  
Programs that have used ICT t o support women entrepreneurs in low - and middle -
income countries have found that the following approaches helped overcome 
challenges women face, including those related to low levels of literacy and technical 
skills:  
 Paying attention to the specific infor mation needs of women entrepreneurs 
and involving them in content generation;  
 Using audio and multimedia to overcome low levels of literacy;  
 Tailoring training locations and timings to suit female beneficiaries;  and 
 Ensuring that trainers are gender -sensitive in terms of the training 
methodology : for example, giving participants in -group assignments rather 
than individually oriented training.81 
4.3 Challenges to Women Entrepreneurs Leading Digital T echnology 
Firms82 
There is little evidence concerning  the s pecific challenges facing women -owned tech 
start-ups in ASEAN. However, data on women -owned growth -oriented firms may be 
instructive to understanding many of the specific challenges facing women -owned 
tech firms. The World Bank piloted a program to increas e the capacity, confidence , 
and networks of growth -oriented women leading small businesses in Cambodia, Lao 
PDR , and Viet Nam . The women entrepreneurs participating in this program faced a 
number of  hurdles in growing their businesses. These included:  
 Limited exposure to innovative practices , resulting in poor product 
differentiation , which  in turn  led to poor positioning  that hinder ed 
competitiveness and success ; 
                                                           
81 International Institute for Communication and Development as quoted in United Nations Publications 2017, 19.  
82 That is, women entrepreneurs owning digital technology firms.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  32   Few opportunities to upgrade business and technical skills due to lack of 
formal business training for company directors, managers , and staff ; 
 Limited access to business networks outside of family and friends, and more 
critically, lim ited access to successful, women role models;  
 Lack of capital for expansion a s well as  lack of financial management skills 
and systems ; and  
 Low levels of confidence in taking calculated risks  plus lack of flexible thinking 
to adapt to market demands.83 
A study of U .S. business incubators found that bias in recruitment and selection of 
participants acted as barriers of entry for women. It also found that program design 
and culture issues put women off from joining incubator programs.84 The OECD 
found that “it also appears that the more high -technology the incubator’s focus, the 
fewer women participate.”85 
4.4 CSAP Actions Lines that Can Promote WEE through the 
Development of Women -owned MSMEs  
There are several action lines that relate to MSMEs and provide opportunities to 
advance the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs. These action lines 
fall under the responsibility of the ACCMSME and other sectoral bodies . In the 
Strategic Action Plan for SME Development 201 6–2025 , the ACCMSME recognized 
that “one -size-fits-all policy measures” are not appropriate given the diversity of 
MSMEs in the region. The Strategic Action Plan identified two pathways for MSME 
development: one focused on global competitiveness (the Competitive Pathway) and 
the other on social inclusion (the Inclusive Pathway).  The selected action lines are 
categorized along these  lines. The Competitive Pathway initiatives are to support 
urban, medium -sized enterprises in developed AMS , while the Inclusive Pathway 
initiatives are “to facilitate the transition from the traditional economy through 
industrialization .”86 Micro and small  enterprises are targeted for the Inclusive 
Pathway. These categories were reinterpreted for this analysis. The Competitive 
Pathway action lines are assigned to entrepreneurs who own technology companies , 
and the Inclusive Pathway action lines are assigned  to micro and small 
entrepreneurs who use technology. The remaining action lines were categorized 
according to assumptions about the size and type of  business  affected . 
Action lines related to all women entrepreneurs

The following subsections take a closer look at possible steps to realize each of the 
action  lines mentioned above. The discussion is organized  by action line categor y 
(e.g., action lines related to all women entrepreneurs) . For each category the 
discussion reviews the relevant issues and then lists measures that could be taken 
to advance WEE on that issue, and , where possible, highlights some examples of 
existing programs  and provides related resources . 
4.4.1  Action lines related to all women entrepreneurs  
4.4.1.1  Action line: Promote digital trade in ASEAN  
This action line is quite broad and the text below inherently addresses three other 
action lines:

available to MSMEs to minimize the information gap (ASEAN SME Service 
Center ) 
 WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  34  Digital literacy as a prerequis ite for promoting digital trade: Lack of know -how 
or digital literacy has been  one of the top two reasons that women are not taking up 
ICTs. To enable women to fully benefit from technology, capacity building in the 
basic ICT  skills  or digital literacy needs to be scaled up across the region. Digital 
literacy is a foundational skill that all women,  and in fact all citizens, need to  
participat e fully and safely in the digital economy. As such, all women need digital 
skills and capabilities. Digital literacy  is included in this section because  it is most 
urgently needed by women who own micro and small enterprises, especially those 
who may be engaging in limited e -commerce through social media , at this time .  
The exact nature of the digital capabilities programming will vary  because  the 
challenges women face are not homogenous across all AMS. For women to benefit 
from digital literacy capacity building , curricula need to be relevant to women’s lives  
and should not promote stereoty pes or gender bias that will put women off . For 
digital training efforts to be effective, it is best if w omen have access to ICT 
resources .87 
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
Based on best practice guidance for promoting digital literacy, the following actions 
could be undertaken at a regional level:  
 Invest in AMS capacity  building initiative s which pay particular attention to 
increasing women ’s digital literacy and confidence . Includ e women across all 
levels of education, income , and familiarity with ICT and the internet . 
 Encourage AMS to ensure digital literacy and capacity -building initiatives 
consider women ’s needs, interests , circumstances , and local contexts  during 
the design phase,  in order to encourage meaningful use of mobile phones 
and the internet in ways that maximi ze the value and minimize the risks for 
women . 
 Support efforts to provide women with opportunities to develop their digital 
skills and confidence through different channels, including by accessing public 
facilities, leveraging existing initiatives and networks , and supporting women 
to learn on their own . 
 Support steps to make online content and services more accessible to women 
with limited literacy, language , ICT-related skills , and confidence , and also 
ensure that women with lower literacy levels are included in the pilots and 
user testing of these services .  
 Provide guidance on minimum standards for the content of digital literacy 
curricula to ensure that safety, security , and privacy are adequately 
addres sed. 
 Support and promote female role models as leaders and internet users within 
communities .88

  35   Partner with existing programs that promote women’s digital literacy.  
Examples  
 The Telecentre Women (TCW) program of Telecentre.org Foundation (TCF) provides tailored 
learning solutions for women through the telecenter network. The Telecentre.org Foundation and 
the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) developed trainings and activities to empower 
disadv antaged women and girls including Telecentre Women: Digital Literacy Campaign and the 
ICT and Entrepreneurship training. Key components of the program include: content that is 
developed with input from the target users to ensure it meets their needs; devel opment of peer 
learning networks among women learners; and involving women as leaders of the programs on the 
ground. Together, the ITU and TCF trained over 1  million  women to be digitally literate.89 Started 
as a donor -sponsored initiative, TCF is now a par t of the Philippines Commission on Information 
and Communications Technologies (CICT).90  
 Women ICT Frontier Initiative (WIFI) of the UN Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information 
and Communication Technology for Development (UN -APCICT) . This program , launched in 2016, 
seeks to create “socially and economically -empowered women ” through ICT -enabled 
entrepreneurship. It has two tracks. The first trains women entrepreneurs to use ICTs in support of 
their businesses. The second trains policymakers and gov ernment leaders to create an enabling 
environment for ICT -empowered women entrepreneurs.91 The program was launched in ASEAN in 
August 2017.92 (This program is collaborating with the Philippines Women’s Center to deliver 
entrepreneurial training to women at 2,000 Technology for Education Centers in municipalities and 
rural areas.)  
 Microsoft has worked with the Myanmar Book Aid and Library Preservation Foundation  to train 
young women throughout the country in digital literacy and technology.93 They are current ly 
working with Tag International Development to provide basic digital literacy to rural youth in this 
country.94  
 ASEAN Foundation and SAP  have a strategic collaboration in ASEAN to provide programs that 
equip youth to thrive in the digital economy and hav e the skills to tackle society’s problems. Among 
these programs, the ASEAN Data Science Explorers competition  trains students in SAP’s 
Analytics Cloud software through webinars and seminars. The competition solicits data -driven 
insights on urgent social is sues facing the region.95 While not directed solely to women, this 
program trains youth in higher level digital skills.  
 Helping Women Get Online  is an initiative of Google India started in 2013. The program teaches 
women to use the internet through awarenes s efforts and hands -on training. Videos are used for 
online training. Google partners with local organizations to disseminate the trainings. The program

  36  has three strategies: inspire, engage , and enable. An important element of these strategies is the 
use of local content. See https://hwgo.com/.  
 She Will Connect  launched by Intel in 2012 is a program to empower women and girls through 
technology. One objective of this program is to close the internet gender gap in Africa, through 
digital literacy. The initi ative partners with local NGOs in several countries to integrate digital 
literacy into existing development programs for women and girls. In some locations , it partners with 
organizations that provide income -earning opportunities for women. For example, it partners with 
business process outsourcing (BPO) firms that can provide jobs to graduates of the digital literacy 
program. The face -to-face training includ es tailored content for women and girls and also 
emphasizes peer networks. Free access to the internet is provided to participants during and after 
training.  
 UN Women, working with the Mozilla Foundation, has established digital literacy clubs  for 
women t o train them in participatory digital literacy skills. It has also piloted a digital enterprise 
platform for women farmers and is in the process of piloting dedicated platforms for digital skills 
through a virtual skills school.96  
 
Resources  
 ITU has a range of initiatives that focus on digital skills and digital literacy. It has developed the 
Digital Skills Toolkit, which although not targeted strictly to women, does address women’s needs 
as one of several excluded groups. The toolkit supports efforts t o assess, design, and implement 
national digital skills strategies.97  
 GSMA has developed a Mobile Internet Skills Training Toolkit which is available on their website 
(https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/ connected -society/mistt/ ).98 Although not targeted 
exclusively for women, it teaches the basics of using the internet and common applications. The 
module was used in Rwanda where it was offered by a mobile network operator. Over three 
months, 80,000 customers were trained.99  
 
Business development support services  to promote digital trade : As the OECD 
report points  out, there is a dearth of gender -sensitive BDS services in the ASEAN 
region. There are also few examples of BDS providers that also provide training in 
the effective use of ICTs. One exception is the Women’s ’ Development Centres in 
Cambodia . These centers combine entre preneurial training and business 
development services wi th access to ICT and digital literacy training .100

  37  BDS service centers are also important for providing access to market information 
and networking opportunities, which are particularly vital for women  entrepreneurs . 
Scaling up access to BDS is challenged b oth by the cost and by the difficulties 
entrepreneurs have in  finding the time to attend. ICTs could be used to overcome 
these challenges.  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
In the context of promoting digital trade, there are several  solutions that could help 
disseminate business support services to a wider range of women.  
 Provide guidance and/or support to expand the availability of gender -sensitive 
BDS service centers which provide digital literacy and ICT training alongside 
traditional business development support .101 The BDS providers should also 
provide trainings and other support to promote both domestic and 
international digital trade. This does not necessarily mean developing new 
BDS centers , but rather support ing existing  BDS suppliers to become more 
gender -sensitive in the services they provide and the means by which they 
provide them.  
 Promote the use of technology to provide women -focused training, coaching, 
mentoring , and other enterprise -support services —whether through ASEAN 
hubs, the SME  Academy, access to massive open online courses ( MOOCs ), 
or other services.  
 Assess the experience with and impact of the Philippines 2013 Go Negosyo 
Act which mandated that women be represented in the delivery of counselling 
and advisory services at the Negosyo MSME support cent ers.102 If promising, 
disseminate the results and lessons learned among the AMS.  
4.4.1.2  Action line: Develop a best practices guide for local content 
development and support  
As noted by the GSMA, “Most online content is directed at men and designed by 
men.”103 Women are more likely to feel that mobile and internet services are not 
relevant to them. In some cases, this is due to a lack of awareness of the availability 
of content and services that would be useful t o them. It can also be a result of the 
fact that most content on the internet is in English. ( Fifty-two percent  of content is in 
English ; by comparison , only 1.8  percent  is in Chinese and 0.2  percent  is in Thai.104) 
But it is also the case that women’s needs  and preferences are not sufficiently taken 
into account when products are developed. During the design and testing of 
applications and services, not enough attention is paid to potential female users.

  38  The relevance of internet content could be improved b y incorporating a better 
understanding of how and why women use the internet while designing  products and 
services. This would be particularly beneficial for applications such as e -government 
services and business support programs. More  content needs to be  in the local 
language and accessible to people with low literacy levels.  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
Additional activities related to three action lines c ould support the empowerment of 
women and at the same time, support the promotion of digital trade:  
 When implementing the action lines to develop best practices for e -service 
delivery and to develop a best practices guide for local content development 
and support, include guidance that will encourage and support AMS and their 
stakeholders to i nvolve women entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds in 
the design, testing , and development of government and local content, 
applications , and services . This effort sho uld include low-income  micro 
entrepreneurs, growth -oriented digital entrepreneurs , and those who do not 
currently use ICTs. It should also include women with lower levels of 
education and literacy to ensure that the content, applications , and services 
are accessible for all.  
 When implementing the action line supporting the creation of an interactive 
online  platform on a range of financial support  [services]  available to MSMEs 
to minimize the information gap, involve women entrepreneurs from diverse 
backgrounds  in the design, testing , and development of the content and 
application.  
 Encourage the development among AMS of an ecosystem of quality, non-
stereotypical services, applications , and content relevant to different types of 
women entrepreneurs.105 
Examples  
 The TCW program  (mentioned above) obtained information on women’s content preferences 
through surveys and local workshops, as well as by collecting data from women using 
telecenters.106  
 The HWGO website  in India, provides links to relevant websites for women , such as sites related 
to health, education, and livelihoods.107

  39  4.4.1.3  Action line: Develop and foster cyber wellness through 
guidelines, education , and outreach programs  
The issues and some of the remedi es for this action line are also related to the 
action line concerned with consumer protection:  integrate e -commerce 
considerations into the ASEAN High -level Consumer Protection Principles . 
Women’s fears about online threats  may have been of lesser concern than 
affordability in the survey referenced above, but it is likely that fears about engaging 
with the internet have increased lately with the news of data breaches at Facebook. 
For example, 1.175 million users in the Phil ippines may have  been affected by th e 
breaches at Facebook .108 Online threats pose a real challenge to women 
entrepreneurs, especially those engaged in e -commerce. Raising women’s 
awareness of online risks as well as mitigation and remedial measures should be 
high on the li st of supports for women entrepreneurs. At the same time, the ability of 
the internet to help women grow and manage their businesses should be 
emphasized. Further research is needed on how women handle problems that they 
experience on their phones or online in order to ensure that dispute resolution 
methods will work for them.  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
 Support or conduct research on the threats that prevent women from 
accessing and using the internet in different settings in the region.  
 Support or conduct research on the consumer protection issues that impact 
women entrepreneurs who engage in e -commerce.  
 Increase awarene ss of the threats that prevent women from using the 
internet , and how th ose threats  can be addressed through awareness and 
advocacy campaigns, digital literacy program s, and entrepreneurship training 
programs.  
 Partner with internet platforms to develop and provi de awareness campaigns.  
 Encourage the development of applications and services that make it safer for 
women to use the internet, addressing issues of harassment  and abuse, while 
ensuring that other fundamental rights are upheld. Include t he consumer 
protection of women as buyers on e -commerce sites.  
 Develop guidelines for legal and policy frameworks that will protect women 
against internet -related abuse , harassment, and fraud, and guidelines for 
measures that promote access to justice.  
 Develop guidelines for mechanisms that m ake it easy and safe for women to 
report online abuse (and ensure that such reports are responded to quickly 
and effectively).109

  40   Develop guidelines on consumer protection for buyers and sellers in an e -
commerce environment. Ensure that women’s needs and preferences are 
incorporated in the design and devel opment of guidelines.  
 Encourage AMS to strengthen measures at the national level to protect 
women against ICT -mediated abuse  and fraud.   
 Encourage AMS to partne r with women’s business associations, civil society 
organizations , and microfinance institutions to disseminate cyber wellness 
education.  
Examples  
No examples were found during this research that directly relate to cyber security for women. 
However, ther e are ongoing initiatives and materials regarding cyber security for children.  
 The ITU has a program for child online protection. It has developed guidelines for parents, 
children, industry, and policymakers on child online protection (see 
https://www.itu.int/en/cop/Pages/guidelines.aspx ). The ITU site has an extensive list of programs 
from around the world that address cyber safety. Not all of them are solely focused on children  
(see https://www.itu.int/en/cop/Pages/resources.aspx ). As part of this initiative, ITU conducted 
consultations with children and youth online.  
 
Resources  
No resources were found that focused solely on women and cyber  security or women and consumer 
protection online. However, several resources address consumer protection in a digital environment. In 
particular, a 201 7 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNC TAD) 
emphasized the need to give special attention to the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers when 
developing consumer education for e -commerce.110 The following resources may be useful:

  41  4.4.2  Action lines related to inclusive entrepreneurs (i .e., owners of 
micro and small enterprises)  
4.4.2.1  Action line: Reduce development disparities in access  and 
affordability to broadband access and improv ing ICT 
interoperability  
Affordability is one of the top two barriers keeping women from accessing mobile 
phones and the internet. Many of the factors that govern affordability reside at the 
nationa l level, such as spectrum policy, infrastructure sharing , and policies for 
broadband and competition , which affect everyone . At the consumer level, access to 
broadband most often depend s on access to an internet -enabled mobile phone or 
smartphone. The fact ors that impact smartphone affordability, aside from the 
component parts, include import duties, taxes , and transportation charges. For 
consumers in remote locations, prices include the higher transportation and 
inventory costs incurred by merchants.111 Although market prices for smartphones 
are declining, they are not expected to decline to the extent that all low -income 
people will be able to afford them in the foreseeable future.112 Several steps could be 
taken at a regional level to address  observed  disparities in affordability and access.  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
 Encourage and support AMS to develop strategies for achieving affordable 
internet and broadband access that prioritize measures that improve 
affordability for  underserved women . 
 Along these lines, s upport research to better understand how different 
segments of the women’s market are impacted by affordability issues.  
 Encourage AMS to support efforts : to ensure that the cost s of data and 
devices for accessing the internet are affordable to lower -income women; to 
increase network coverage, capacity , and quality, particularly in underserved 
areas such as rural areas where many women live; and to provide safe and 
accessible publi c access facilities ( telecenter s) to serve women  (see 
below) .113 
Examples  
 Botswana has used Universal Service and Access Funds (USAF) to support the development of 
Wi-Fi hotspots  in public locations. Individuals are able to access 30 minutes of free internet each 
day with unlimited access to government websites. Municipal governments in South Africa have 
also set up facilities for the public to access Wi -Fi.114

  42   The Connected Homes p roject  in Costa Rica, uses USAF to subsidize the cost of devices and 
broadband for low -income households.115 
 The Philippines government intends to extend its public Wi -Fi program beyond Manila. The 
service is accessible in public sites such as schools, hospi tals, and parks.   
Improving affordable access to smart phones : Research conducted by the GSMA 
suggests that the consumer market for smartphones in emerging markets consists of 
four segments: the extreme poor , for whom smartphones are unaffordable; the 
working poor , who can afford phones if they pay for them in instalments; the higher -
end low -income market , that can afford to save for a phone; and middle -income 
consumers , who are cost -conscious but can afford a phone through a lump sum 
payment. T hree business models can be used to assist t he last three segments: 
direct payment, asset financing , or third-party payment. Government has a potential 
role to play in the third -party payment model in which “third party actors who derive 
value from increased access, subsidize or offset device costs.”116 In this model, costs 
are “aggressively” reduced for handsets. The model may or may not address data 
costs, distribution or access, and customer digital literacy. The sustain ability of this 
model is unclear but there are obvious ly significant upfront costs.  
Examples  
 In Pakistan, the government has used USAF monies to  provide smartphones  to 30,000 low -
income women nationally.  
 The Malaysian government launched the Youth Communication Package  program to enable 
low-income youth (21 to 30 years old) to buy 3G smartphones at a subsidized price. Beneficiaries 
were required to register with the government. They then purchased a phone with a 40 percent 
subsidy (a $65 discount on  a $165 phone) and the mobile network operator was reimbursed by the 
government for the rebate. At least 60,000 young people bought subsidized smartphones.  
4.4.2.2  Action line: develop best practices for next generation 
telecenter s 
Telecenter s (also known as internet cafés  or internet access centers)  are one 
strategy to provide affordable and accessible internet for women. However, some 
women report feeling uncomfortable and unsafe in male -dominated spaces, which 
many internet access center s are.117 The development of the next generation of 
telecenter s is an opportune time to consider what services women entrepreneurs 
and workers will need in the future. For low -income , women  entrepreneurs, whether 
they engage in e -commerce or traditional businesses , the current need is for internet 
access center s to provide affordable access to the internet . To be effective for 
women, internet access center s will need to become more welcoming to them. For 
example, Azerbaijan  has a growing number of women -only internet access center s 
where women can work on a computer and use the internet. These were developed

  43  in response to women’s reluctance and discomfort in using public internet access 
center s.118  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
 Support or c onduct research to better understand the needs and preferences 
of different segments of women owners of MSMEs for internet access 
center s; and  
 Share findings with AMS.   
4.4.2.3  Action line: promote the development and u se of e-
commerce platforms to encourage expansion of SMEs  
There is little systematic information available about women’s engagement with e -
commerce platforms. E -commerce is very dynamic and it is likely that data on the 
level of use of e -commerce platforms w ill have a short shelf life. Nevertheless, basic 
research on how women are conducting e -commerce, at what scale, and what their 
challenges and opportunities are would assist in shaping interventions to promote e -
commerce for MSMEs. Additionally, to promote  women -owned micro and small 
businesses, the emphasis should be on B2C , which is  where women -owned 
businesses are most active .119  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
 Support or conduct research to better understand how different segments of 
women entrepreneurs in different settings are using and benefitting from e -
commerce. Research women’s needs and preferences for e -commerce 
platforms which would allow them to grow their businesses.  
 Disseminate information on women’s engagement with e -commerce among 
the AMS.  
 Develop guidelines on how to involve women entrepreneurs in the design, 
testing , and development of any e -commerce platforms developed, in order to 
ensure that women can effectively use the platforms.  
4.4.3  Action lines related to competitive entrepreneurs (i .e., 
Leaders of Tech Firms)  
4.4.3.1  Action line: Develop an ecosystem conducive to support 
start -ups and strengthen enterprises  
As the OECD notes , many more males than females are participating in technology -
focused accelerato rs and business incubators.120 The promotion of gender diversity 
in government -sponsored incubator and accelerator programs is expected to grow 
businesses and create jobs.121 The following actions are recommended to support 
women’s access to these services:

  44   Promote development  throughout the region  of accelerators and incubators 
which are focused on women entrepreneurs  to ensure women have access to 
these services  
 Promote gender diversity in other incubator and accelerator program s 
 Establish regional targets for the number (or proportion) of women who will 
benefit from the ecosystem and other support to start-ups 
 Share good practices across the region on government -sponsored incubators 
and accelerators focused on women  
 Share good pra ctices on how to target  growth -oriented women tech 
entrepreneurs with more innovative and higher potential business ideas .122  
Examples  
The OECD reviewed incubators that support women -owned start -ups in ASEAN and found only a 
small number which support women entrepreneurs in general . These include:  
 SHE Incubator Program in Cambodia : This is a six -month program which aims to scale up 
women -owned microenterprises. Monthly 2 -day workshops are combined with support and skills 
building. The program tries to c onnect graduates with investors at the end of the program.123 
 Project -W incubator : This was started in Myanmar in 2013 when it was recognized that women 
were not joining the first incubator program set up in 2012. This women -only incubator was 
intended to cr eate a more supportive environment. The six-month program helps women refine 
business ideas, design business models , and launch new ventures. The women entrepreneurs 
attend weekly workshops and monthly meetings with local business leaders for advice. They are 
provided with resources and work space. At the end of the program , they pitch their projects to 
investors. This program is supported by international donors and the private sector.124 
There is little evidence of accelerators or incubators in ASEAN to support women -owned tech start-
ups. The OECD also found few programs that support women to start ICT -based businesses. These 
include : 
 Gorgeous Geeks’ “ Women Netpreneur ” series (Malaysia) ; 
 Ooredoo Geek Girls Myanmar  project; and  
 Singapore Women Start -up Weekend  (Athena Network, Singapore).125 
Further, there is little evidence or information on best practices or successful models of incubators or 
accelerators that focus on growing women -led start-ups. An example of one accelerator that has a 
women’s program component comes from Chile:  
 In Chile, Start -Up Chile  is a successful program launched by CORFO, a corporation charged with 
promoting economic development. Among the programs offered, Start -Up Chile has the “S 
Factory” which provides women entrepreneurs, who are still in the ideation phase, a $14,000 
grant. For all entrepreneurs, $30,000 of seed guidance funding can be provided over 6 months. 
Companies that are ready to scale can get $90,000 to help them raise more funds or grow their 
market share. Chile hosts several large conferences each year and has a number of co -working

  45  spaces. The support for tech start -ups has helped build an ecosystem and attracted venture 
capital funds to establish offices in the capital city.126  
4.4.3.2  Action line: establish support mechanism s such as 
mentorship and incentive program s to suppo rt and nurture 
STI enterprises from start -up to the next competitive level of 
development  
Networking and mentoring are especially important and have more impact for 
growth -oriented women entrepreneurs . Having a mentor increases a woman’s 
chance of success , especially for women working in male -dominated fields such as 
the tech industry. Growth -oriented women entrepreneurs also need training in soft 
skills .127  
 Ensure that women participate  in and benefit from these support programs  by 
establishing regional ta rgets for the number (or proportion) of women that 
participate.  
 Consider establishing  women -only programs.  
4.4.3.3  Action line: engage dialogue and other strategic partners in 
joint undertakings on appropriate and commercially viable 
STI initiatives  
This is an action line that calls for a cross -cutting response. See section 7.4 Increase 
Women’s Representation in Policymaking Processes.  
4.4.3.4  Action line: establish and promot e a digital service hub that 
will enhance trade supply chain s and also improve the 
competitiveness of ASEAN SMEs in a low -cost manner  
Support or conduct research to better understand the needs and preferences for a 
digital service hub of growth -oriented women tech entrepreneurs from different parts 
of the region.   
Involve growth -oriented  women tech entrepreneurs in the design, testing , and 
development of the digital service hub to ensure it caters to the needs of women 
entrepreneurs and that the content, applications , and services are relevant and 
accessible for them.

  47 5 ACCESS TO FINANCE  
Financial inclusion —the access and use of affordable, appropriate financial 
services —promotes sustainable and equitable development. Women’s financial 
inclusion may also promote gender equity. There is now evidence to suggest that 
women can better control their income and make personal and productive purchases 
when they have access to bank accounts, savings , and other financial services. The 
impacts go beyond women’s financial lives. Financial inclusion may help women 
make more choices ab out how to use their time and give them more autonomy over 
decision making that affects their lives. Importantly, they can better grow their 
businesses, increase their productivity , and reduce their poverty through access to 
financial services. However , a large portion of women globally , and in ASEAN , have 
little to no access to formal financial services .128  
Measured globally, women’s access to financial services trails men ’s access  by 7 
percent (65 percent v ersus  72 percent) .129 According to the Global Findex  database , 
financial inclusion in ASEAN does not follow the global pattern. In Cambodia, 
Myanmar , and Viet Nam  there is no appreciable gender gap. Indeed, in Indonesia, 
Lao PDR , and the Philippines, women are more likely than men to have an account 
at a fi nancial institution. Only in Malaysia does the gender gap in access to a 
financial institution account come close to the world average, at 6  percent . Women 
are more likely than men to have borrowed from a financial institution in Cambodia, 
the Philippines,  and Thailand. In Myanmar and Singapore, men and women ha ve the 
same rate of borrowing, while in Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Malaysia , men are only 1  
percent  to 2 percent  more likely to have borrowed from a financial institution. Only in 
Viet Nam  is the gap between men and women in borrowing as high as 5  percent .  
Although in ASEAN countries women do not have a lower rate of access to formal 
financial services than men, the levels of financial inclusion for both men and women 
are quite low. Account ownership for women stands at 17  percent  (Cambodia), 32  
percent  (Lao PDR), 26  percent  (Myanmar), 35  percent  (the Philippines) , and 29  
percent  (Viet Nam ). Only in Singapore (96  percent ), Malaysia (82  percent ), and 
Thailand (79  percent ) are the rates relatively high. Rates for women’s borrowing 
from financial institutions are even lower, in the range of 11  percent  to 20  percent .130  
5.1 Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion  
In ASEAN, there is a gender gap in the use of financial services. A study of four 
large financial service providers in Cambodia conducted by the United Nations 
Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) found that women had on average $600 less in 
savings than men (about $400 v ersus  $1,000) while their average loan size was

Know? Washington, D.C.: International Center for Research on Women. 4.

Revolution, World Bank, 4.  
130 Ibid. WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  48  approximately half that of men’s (just under $1,200 v ersus $2,400) .131 The lower loan 
amounts taken by women reflect, in part, that men access SME loans while women 
access microloans. Additionally, men predominantly take individual loans while 
women take group loans.  
Other evidence suggests that there is significant unmet demand for financial 
services in the women’s market. In Viet Nam , women -owned SMEs have an unmet 
demand for credit, both formal and informal, estimated to be as high as 12  percent  of 
GDP. The credit gap for women -owned SMEs is estimate d to be $172 million in 
Cambodia and $6 million in Indonesia .132  
The availability and types of financing mechanisms available for MSMEs varies by 
the level of economic development of the country. Bank loans and microfinance are 
prevalent in the less develop ed ASEAN nations , while alternative finance like 
crowdfunding, angel investing , and venture capital are more common in the more 
developed nations such as Malaysia and Singapore. Public and public -private 
funding programs targeting SMEs and early stage star t-ups are also available in the 
more developed ASEAN economies. Despite the availability of these various forms 
of financing, there is still a sizeable gap in MSME financing in ASEAN. In 2011, this 
was estimated to total $45.4 billion (across the ASEAN -8)133 or $184,000 per 
enterprise .134  
This gap is particularly wide for small enterprises compared to medium enterprises 
(49–59 percent  versus 1 8–22 percent ).135 Small enterprises and even larger 
microenterprises are too large to qualify for microfinance loans and too small to 
obtain funding from  commercial banks , comprising the “missing middle.”  Most 
ASEAN governments have put in place various financing mechanism s, loans, grants , 
and equity investment schemes to address this shortfall in MSME financing . 
However, there is no evidence on the extent to which these programs are filling this 
need. Furthermore, while alternative financing is expected to be a viable mech anism 
for filling the missing middle, it is too early to tell whether these mechanisms will help 
fill the gender gap in financing.136 Women entrepreneurs are particularly affected by 
the missing middle as their enterprises tend to be smaller than men’s. It i s unclear to 
what extent alternative financing vehicles are targeted to the market segments in 
which women are prevalent or whether women will be able to access these sources 
of finance.  
In a 2017 report, t he OECD concluded that mainstream financial insti tutions in the 
ASEAN region do not give priority to women borrowers and there is a lack of

and 44  percent  respectively .137

The Alliance for Financial Inclusion  (AFI)  contends that mainstreaming gender will 
not be enough to address structural inequalities in women’s access to finance. What 
is required is a proactive , tailored approac h that considers the unique needs and 
behaviors of women. The creation of enabling environments through smart policies 
and regulation is necessary in order to increase women’s access to quality and 
affordable financial services.138 These policies are address ed below. A more gender 
inclusive  financial system will address the barriers faced by women on both the 
demand - and supply -sides as well as legal and regulatory barriers (see Table 5.1).  
Women’s access to official identification : Challenges to women MSME  owners in 
the digital economy intersect with traditional challenges such as access to finance. 
To access a digital financial services account, customers are required to provide 
valid proof of identity to meet the know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Globa lly, 
women can face more hurdles to accessing valid identification documents. For the

is a barrier for less than 10 percent of women.139

Furthermore , analysis of the Global Findex Database 2017 (Global Findex) dataset 
showed  that, with the exception of Lao PDR and the Philippines, 89 percent or more 
of the adult population in ASEAN countries had a national identity card (see Table 
5.2 above ). The data are not disaggregated by sex so there is no information on 
differences between men and women in access to ID cards. Yet the Global Findex 
dataset  also shows a wide range in the percentage of individuals who reported that 
they have no financial account because of a lack of necessary documentation. Of 
the individuals without a financial institution, from 12  percent  to 45  percent  reported 
that not having the necessary documents, was a barrier to having a financial 
account. This mixed finding , combi ned with the lack of data on women , suggests that 
more research is needed on this subject. It is particularly unclear whether the 
national identity cards that individuals possess are sufficient for meeting banks’ KYC 
requirements.  
5.2 Digital Financial Services  
Digital financial services (DFS) are considered a potential solution to  women’s 
financial inclusion. Digital finance addresses physical access, convenience , and 
affordability issues, while also increasing transparency and privacy , a particular 
concern for women. The convenience of mobile money makes it an attractive

  51  channel for time -constrained women to access a broad range of financial services 
including remittances, payments, savings, loans , and managing financial risks. By 
capturing data on transactions histories, DFS can reduce information asymmetries 
between financial institutions and consumers. This then opens up new finance 
opportunities for unbanked women. Mobile money is becoming increasingly 
important to financial inclusion. In the East Asia and Pacific region for example, 
registered mobile money accounts were up 9.3  percent  from 2016 to 2017 (36.5 
million , up from 33.3 million out of a total population of 523 million) .141 
Women’s access to mobile phones : Despite the obvious benefits for women, 
obstacles to accessing mobile money remain. It is reported that on a global level , 
women have less access to mobile phones than men, constituting a gender digital 
divide and resulting in women having less access to digital finan cial services. The 
most recent Global Findex data show that mobile phone ownership for all adults in 
the ASEAN nations was relatively high, ranging from 72  percent  in Cambodia to 94  
percent  in Singapore. Data on women’s ownership was not available .142 Anothe r 
recent survey , however , found that in the East Asia and Pacific region, 87  percent  of 
women own their own phone (Gallup poll 2016), one of the highest rates among all 
regions .143 Not surprising ly, mobile phone ownership was found to be significantly 
higher  among women who were younger than 35 years of age (94  percent ) than 
women 35 and older (84  percent ). In Indonesia, the mobile phone ownership gap 
between older and younger women was even larger (83  percent  versus  66 percent ). 
Mobile money is thus consider ed to have great potential for the female youth market , 
especially because they may face more limited  social and cultural barriers when it 
comes to accessing technology.    
Women’s use of mobile phones : High ownership of mobile phones has not yet 
translate d into significant use of a phone or the internet to access a financial 
account , except in Singapore. In Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, 
and Viet Nam , the share of women using a mobile  phone  or the internet to access an 
account varied from 1  percent  to 8 percent , while in Singapore, Malaysia, and 
Thailand the shares were 49  percent , 30 percent,  and 15  percent  of women , 
respectively. However, t hese relatively low figures do not reflect a gender gap in the 
use of mobile phones or internet to access an account. In fact, in several countries, a 
slightly higher share of women than men had done this .144  
Perceived barriers to women’s use of mobile money, aside from barriers in 
accessing phones, are believed to include: cost and affordability; techni cal literacy 
and confidence —women with low literacy rates find it  challeng ing to  use basic

  52  phones to perform complex functions; trust in operators or agents —women’s fear of 
being cheated or harassed limits their engagement; legal, regulatory , and basic 
infrastructure requirements —identification requirements may constrain women’s 
uptake of mobile money as women face greater difficulties in obtaining official 
identification; and local legal, social , and cultural norms —the attitudes of men and 
the larger commu nity may hinder women’s use of mobile money .145 However , the full 
picture of women’s use of digital financial services  throughout ASEAN  is not 
available due to the lack of data.146.  
At the global level, mobile money is evolving. Last year, mobile money begun to 
branch out into other financial services such as interest earning savings accounts.147 
Twenty percent of surveyed mobile money deployments are offering savings, 
pension , or investment products in partnership with banks or third parties . Another 
39 percent  intend to offer these products in 2018.148  
Women’s access  to and use of the internet : In the ASEAN region, accelerating 
growth in smartphone ownership has driven access to the internet and with it , 
growing use of e -commerce. In 2016, there were millions of  active e -commerce 
users across Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Phil ippines, Thailand , and Viet 
Nam , driving revenues of $6.4 billion —and those revenues  are projected to double 
by 2020 .149  
Use of the internet to pay bills or buy something varies across the region, depending 
on the soci o-economic level of the country. However, in all countries , it is higher than 
the use of a mobile phone or the internet to access a financial institution account. 
Additionally, women have a slight ly higher rate of using the  internet to pay bills or 
buy something than men, in all countries except Thailand where the rates are equal. 
Women’s use of the internet in this way ranged from 3  percent  to 21  percent  in most 
countries, to 39  percent  in Malaysia and 57  percent  in Singapo re.150  
The evidence on paying online for an internet purchase is limited to only a few 
countries and is not disaggregated by sex. Of those who used the internet to 
purchase something, in Singapore 89  percent , in Malaysia 49  percent , and in 
Thailand 52  perce nt of purchasers, respectively , had paid online. By contrast , in Viet 
Nam , only 10  percent  of online buyers had paid online. Purchasers who did not pay 
online, paid with cash on delivery (COD).151 This shows that there is  huge scope for 
expan ding online payments —particularly in Viet Nam , which is probably indicative of 
the situation in other less developed ASEAN countries. This finding aligns with that 
from the GSMA that over 74 percent of e -commerce payments in the Southeast Asia

  53  region still inv olve COD payment processes .152 These payments are expensive, 
inefficient, and time -consuming for both entrepreneurs and buyers, and pose 
financial and possibly safety risks for entrepreneurs.  
While mobile money has not yet been broadly adopted in ASEAN, the  region’s 
financial services industry is on the verge of being disrupted by financial technology  
companies ( fintechs). These companies, “are radically innovating the finance 
industry [through]  disruptive  innovations such as artificial intelligence, machine  
learning, blockchain technology, biometric identification, cloud computing , and use of 
big data. ”153 Fintechs are offering technology -enabled solutions that better address 
customer needs and preferences by offering enhanced accessibility, convenience , 
and tailored products.  
5.3 Superplatforms  
The internet giants, Facebook, Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings, Amazon , and 
Google are expected to lead this transformation  of the financial services industry.154 
What distinguishes these “superplatforms ” is that they all have “digital platforms 
dominant across more than one sector.”155 Their size, innovation , and focus on 
customer centricity, along with their continuous growth and use of massive amounts 
of customer data position them to be the “single most powerful force s shaping digital 
ecosystems” going forward. They have the ability to “fundamentally change  … the 
entire existing financial ecosystem. ”156  
In China, for example, the financial services industry is already being disrupted by 
financial services offered by sup erplatforms like Alipay —with the result that the 
traditional retail banking industry is experiencing lower margins and depositor 
attrition. At the same time, this trend has driven large growth in financial inclusion in 
China. The Chinese superplatforms that are taking the lead in this area have been 
expanding to other Asian countries . In 2017, Facebook Messenger Pay was 
launched in the Philippines and Google Tez, a mobile payments service, was 
launched in India.157 Google plans to expand the service to Indone sia, Thailand , and 
Viet Nam . 
It is likely that the growth of superplatform financial services will be “pulled” by the 
growth of their e -commerce models that require users have access to seamless 
digital payment options. But the products on offer will not be limited to payment 
services. The Ant Financial Services Group, owner of Alipay, has already entered

  54  into SME lending with a new private bank called My Bank.158 From this perspective, 
the superplatforms could be the most important channel for women’s fin ancial 
inclusion in ASEAN.  
For ASEAN, the most important issue related to superplatforms is that the potential 
for consumer risk , which is not yet fully known and which will challenge the capacity 
and authority of national -level regulators. This has prompt ed some observers to 
suggest that financial regulators will need to become or cooperate with data 
regulators .159 For women, financial products and services provided by superplatforms 
will pose new and difficult consumer protection challenges, including , but not limited 
to, data privacy issues.  
In China, the payment and financial services offered by superplatforms were able to 
grow quickly and profitably due to the financial regulators taking a wait and see 
attitude to support the industry .160 Ant Financial and  Tencent have been quickly 
replacing cash and bank cards as the most popular payment method s in China .161 
The regulators have now imposed a series of measures to curb the industry due to 
concerns about the way the e -payment platforms managed user deposits an d 
introduced new payment methods. Additionally, new regulations are intended  to cut 
down on fraud and to control the interest rates charged. It is expected that in the 
future, regulators will look at the way these superplatforms collect and manage user 
data.162 Similarly to China, regulators in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, have 
established regulatory sandbox environments to allow for mutual learning among 
regulators and the fintech  (financial technology)  industry.  
5.4 Need for Identification to Access Digital Forms of Finance  
Mobile technology looks to become the dominant channel for ASEAN citizens to 
access financial services and a range of other services in the digital age. At a global 
level, a gender gap in access to valid, official identifi cation  (ID) is one of the hurdles 
for women to access mobile phones. In the ASEAN region, the data does not 
indicate a gender gap in ID. However, the uptake of mobile money is still relatively 
so low that barriers to access due to lack of ID may not yet be apparent . 
All countries in ASEAN, except for the Philippines, now have mandatory KYC 
policies that require mobile network operators to capture personal information and 
identification details from customers purchasing prepaid SIM cards. There are three 
variations of this mandatory policy. At the most basic level, mobile network operators

  55  (MNOs) must “capture and store ” customers’ ID information. In some countries, 
MNOs are required to “capture and share ” customer’s identification information with 
the government. In the third variation, MNOs are required to validate a customer ’s 
biometric ide ntification details against a government database to verify th at person’s  
identity.163 In ASEAN, Indonesia , Malaysia , and Thailand  require that MNOs “capture 
and validate ” identification information. With the exception of the Philippines, the 
other countries  in ASEAN require MNOs to “capture and store ” customers’ details.164  
Furthermore, financial institutions have KYC identification requirements that are 
imposed typically by central banks or finance ministries, and that may be in additio n 
to SIM registration requirements ( imposed by telecommunications r egulators ).165 
Banks may also have KYC requirements in order to comply with anti -money 
laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) policies ( i.e., AML/CFT).  
Without a valid ID that is recognized by the government, an individual will not  able to 
obtain a mobile phone  or access  mobile money. Within ASEAN, only Thailand has a 
national biometric identification system. The smart ID card program was started in 
2005 and is mandatory fo r all individuals older than 7 years of age. The card, 
provided free of charge, incorporates the owners’ fingerprints. Over 97  percent  of the 
population now has a smartcard. When purchasing a SIM or a mobile phone 
subscription, customers must submit finger prints or facial scans , which are then 
compared to the smartcard information on file with the government.166  
The world’s largest , and perhaps best known,  biometric identification system is in 
India.167 Aadhaar is a 12 -digit unique identity number for Indians based on biometric 
details. The Aadhaar program is available to every citizen at no cost. The program, 
administered by the Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI), had signed up 1.1 
billion peopl e by the end of 2017 . To access a mobile subscription in India, 
customers are now required to provide their Aadhaar number and have their 
fingerprints or iris scanned with a biometric reader. This information is then validated 
against the UIDAI database.168  
The Aadhaar number provides Indians with access to a n expanding number of 
services. Individuals can now use their Aadhaar card to open bank accounts, get a 
driver’s license , or obtain a passport. The Aadhaar card now allow s access to 
government welfare pa yments which can be sent directly to a bank account 
accessible by mobile phone. The Government of India has also licensed mobile 
phone providers to be “payment banks ,” thus providing individuals with easily 
accessible and cost -effective financial accounts.  The number gives citizens access 
to important services , such as healthcare and education , and identifies them as 
having the right to participate in elections.169 As a result, financial inclusion, 
particularly of women, has grown tremendously in India. Further, the possession of

  56  the Aadhaar card can enable a customer to open a physical bank account by 
providing their number and having their fingerprint scanned. This is an example of an 
eKYC (electronic know -your-customer) process.170  
Digital identificatio n is poised to be a key element of the digital economy  in the 
future . By lowering transactions costs and eliminating barriers to a wide range of 
financial, social , and government services, digital identification can contribute to the 
empowerment of women. The requirement that all adult citizens have a digital or 
biometric identification could level the playing field for women and men in terms of 
access to appropriate identification, as demonstrated by the experience in India.  
5.5 CSAP Action Lines that Can Prom ote Women’s Financial 
Inclusion  
Committees and working groups under the ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central 
Bank Governors’ Meeting (AFMGM) , the ACCMSME , and the Initiative for ASEAN 
Integration ( IAI) Task Force have identified several action lines under the CSAP 
which provide opportunities to promote women’s financial inclusion and , 
subsequently, WEE . These include:  
 Formulate financial inclusion strategy and implementation plan  
 Facilitate AMS to develop credit rating system  
 Support access to finance  for MSMEs by, inter alia, establishing and 
strengthening credit bureaus, and further developing credit guarantee 
systems  
 Implement a public awareness campaign for insurance  
 Promote innovative financial inclusion via digital platforms  
 Elevate capacity buil ding of AMS  to enhance financial inclusion ecosystem  
5.5.1  Action line: formulate a fin ancial inclusion strategy and 
implementation plan 
This action line represents an all-encompassing  action that will also cover the action 
lines:  
 Facilitate AMS to develop credit rating system  
 Support access to finance for MSMEs by, inter alia, establishing and 
strengthening credit bureaus, and further developing credit guarantee 
systems   
A gender -sensitive financial inclusion strategy will allow ASEAN and the AMS to 
promote WEE  through access to financial services and products. A gender -sensitive 
approach does not solely focus on women ; it is an approach that also takes into 
consideration the dynamics of relationships between women and men.

  57  When considering the ASEAN financial inclusion strategy and implementation plan, it 
is good to remember that the ASEAN countries are quite diverse. There are three 
distinct groups of countries in ASEAN based on their approaches to financial 
inclusion policy , depending on whether  financial inclusion policies are: (1) peripheral 
to their financial sector (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar , and Viet Nam ); (2) part of 
their overall financial sector development (Ind onesia, Malaysia, the Philippines , and 
Thailand) ; or (3) fully integrated into the mainstream policy approach  (Brunei 
Darussalam and Singapore) .171 As explained by Hussain et al. (2015), t he range in 
stages of development of financial inclusion policies across the region, provides the 
opportunity for “regionally integrated financial inclusion policies that connect more 
developed financial sectors with less developed ones within the region.”172   
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
The following are based on recommended good practices when developing national 
strategies for women’s financial inclusion. While t hey have been adapted to work at 
a regional level , further adaption may be required.173 
Set explicit policy objectives and sex-disaggregated quantitative targets for 
access and use of financial services :  Decision makers should d efine targets and 
objectives specifically for women and men  that acknowledge their respective 
differ ing levels of financial service access and usage.  
For ex ample, in an analysis of 12 national financial inclusion strategies, AFI found 
that five strategies addressed women’s financial inclusion explicitly. For example, 
“Indonesia’s national financial inclusion strategy refers to women across target 
income group s and the differences in access, needs and preferences for financial 
services  …”174 Four country strategies had quantitative targets for women’s financial 
inclusion. These countries include Burund i (a target of 48.7  percent  of all clients); 
Papua New Guinea (50 percent  of the newly banked) ; Malawi (60  percent  of all 
clients) ; and Rwanda (80  percent  financial inclusion for all by 2017 and a narrower 
gender gap).175  
Collect, analyze , and report sex -disaggregated financial data :  Sex-
disaggregated data can be used to reflect on whether certain policies are working 
equally for women and men or having any unintended gender differential impacts. 
Elevating the collection and analysis of sex -disaggregated data to a policy priority 
demon strates a commitment to gender -sensitive and evidence -based policymaking. 
Supply side data on financial access and use originated with the national level 
financial institutions and mobile money operators. It may be necessary to encourage

establish common standards of measurement and indicators for financial inclusion in 
general , as well as for women’s financial inclusion to allow for comparative analysis 
across countries.177   
Set standards and provide guidance to the AMS regarding collecting, 
analyzing , and using demand and supply -side sex -disaggregated data  for 
financial services : This should include d etermin ing what data are to be reported to 
the ASEAN level. At both the regi onal and national levels, this data can be used both 
for diagnostic purposes and for the policymaking process during implementation of 
the financial inclusion strategy.  
Examples  
 Five national financial inclusion strategies, among the 12 surveyed by AFI, include data collection 
and surveys as part of the strategy. Of these, two require gender -specific tracking. For example, in 
Rwanda, the national bank works with the government’s monitoring office to conduct data 
collection and research. Papua New Guinea i s the second country that requires specific tracking. 
In a related vein in Burundi, the government is encouraging financial institutions to provide data on 
loans and deposits by gender.178  
 In Nigeria, which was not included in the survey of 12 countries, th e central bank developed a 
template to collect data from the financial services industry actors. The country disaggregates data 
by gender in both targets and data collection.179  
 The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM ) in Nigeria has begun to track finan cial inclusion in 
the insurance sector using sex -disaggregated indicators.180  
 In Tanzania, the government has collected sex -disaggregated supply -side data related to health 
insurance and pension uptake.181  
 Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) included a plan to expand  outreach and increase the insurance 
penetration rate in its financial inclusion framework. BNM collected sex -disaggregated demand -
side data on insurance through national surveys in both 2011 and 2015. It is also possible in 
Malaysia to analyze insurance i ndustry data by gender through the use of national ID numbers. 
This would provide sex -disaggregated supply -side data on insurance policyholders.182  
 The Philippine Insurance Commission (IC) is using the 5 percent gender budget (see discussion of 
the Magna Ca rta of Women in “ example of gender mainstreaming”  below ) to set up a gender and 
                                                           
176 AFI’s Financial Inclusion Data (FID) Working Group has two resources to support AFI members with this process: (1) 
a factsheet: Leveraging Sex -disaggregated Data to Accelerate Progre ss Towards Women’s Financial Inclusion; and (2) a

data and analysis. It has worked on establishing the differences in access and usage of insurance 
between men and women and has identified specific gender barriers. The working group is also 
exploring the feasibility of collecting sex -disaggregated supply -side data from insurance 
companies on policyholders.183  
Reform legal and regulatory f rameworks that hinder the financial inclusion of 
women : Laws and regulations are usually gender neutral , but they may still result in 
different outcomes for men and women, including unintended and negative impacts 
on women’s financial inclusion. As mention ed above, from 12 to 45  percent  of 
unbanked adults in ASEAN lacked the necessary documentation  for a financial 
account .184 Globally, women and girls disproportionately lack official forms of 
identity —in part due to the legal disparities between women and men. Tiered KYC 
requirements can address this significant barrier to financial inclusion. Tiered 
requirements mean allowing for different KYC account opening requirements for 
different types of account s. For example, other forms of identification, such as 
having a third -party identify the individual, may be substituted for formal, official 
identification for those individuals opening basic, no -frills accounts.  
Other reforms can allow for products that are tailored for specific market segments.  
Provide guidance to AMS to support them in assessing any unintended 
regulatory impacts that hinder women’s access to financial services. Results 
can feed into the financial inclusion strategy development process  and 
prioritize which regulatory reforms to address : National financial inclusion 
strategies that have a strong focus on digital financial inclusion  will benefit women 
even if women  are not explicitly targeted. For example , in Indonesia, policies to 
promote basic accounts and savings for migrant workers will, by design , be more 
attractive to women. In Rwanda , the focus on mobile money, agent networks, and e-
money deposits is women -inclusive. In Tanzania , the emphasis is on promoting 
branchless banking, risk -based tiered KYC processes, the national ID database , and 
enhancing the protection of small and unsophisticated borrowers. All these 
strategies have the potential to increase women’s access.  
Examples  
 In Bangladesh, a simplified KYC requirement for mobile bank accounts and “no frills” bank 
accounts enables access to accounts for women.185  
 In Nigeria , the central bank introduced regulations to allow off -site ATMs and to increase ATM 
deployment in rural areas.186

  60  establishing and strengthening credit bureaus, and further developing credit 
guarantee systems ): Inadequate financial infrastructure, such as a lack of credit 
bureaus or collateral registries, can create  barriers to  financial inclusion. The CSAP 
has already identified the development of credit bureaus and credit guarantee funds 
as an action line under  strategic measure  141: building business opportunities for 
growth and employment, as well as increasing access to financial services. The 
discussion below is focused on credit bureaus only.  
Integrated credit bureaus that access microfinance credit histori es and small loans 
can increase access to finance. Additionally, credit bureaus should collect positive 
histories —as when loans have been paid back successfully —in addition to negative 
histories. Building credit histories is particularly beneficial for wom en who often lack 
access to traditional collateral. Currently in ASEAN, the following  countries do not 
require microfinance institutions ( MFIs ) to provide information to credit agencies: 
Brunei Darussalam , Lao PDR,  the Philippines, Singapore , and Thailand. In ASEAN, , 
only Malaysia requires retailers to provide information to credit bureaus and only 
Brunei Darussalam  and Malaysia require utilities to provide information to credit 
bureaus.187  
At the regional level, the development of cr edit agen cies could be enhanced by a 
harmonization of approaches across AMS. Good practices for expanding the  number 
of customers who can benefit from credit bureaus include expanding the credit and 
payment history data collected by credit bureaus. Data on MFI repayment history , 
and positive credit histories as well as negative histories  should be collected by 
credit bureaus . These two steps will greatly improve the ability of ASEAN women to 
document their repayment records and subsequently to access credit.  
Collateral registries and secured transaction systems (or movable collateral 
systems) are other forms of infrastructure that would disproportionately benefit 
women whose assets are more likely to be movable .188 Guidance on strategies for 
overcoming women’s l ack of access to collateral, and , in turn , credit , could be 
includ ed within the financial inclusion plan.  
A good practice is to initiate and sustain collaboration and coordination among the 
relevant committees —in this case, between the ACCMSME and the AFM GM.  
Examples  
Of 12 countries surveyed by AFI, Indonesia, Malawi, and Namibia have included the development of 
credit bureaus in their national financial inclusion strategies. Three countries out of the 12 included 
payments infrastructure activities. Papua New Guinea intends to make progress with digital 
payments platforms and interoperability.189

  61  Burundi, Malawi, Namibia, and Nigeria included the issue of moveable collateral in their strategies.190 
The Central Bank of Nigeria is supporting SME finance by  setting up a Secured Transaction and 
National Collateral Registry. The registry will facilitate the use of movable assets and collateral for 
either business or consumer credit, expanding the scope of eligible assets. The Tanzanian national 
financial inclu sion strategy includes options for alternative collateral, such as warehouse receipts 
which are important for improving financial access for smallholder farmers.  
Often with the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), several countries have  
introduced practices to permit the use of movable collateral. Examples include, China, Ghana, 
Mexico, and Viet Nam.191 Since 2015, Costa Rica has had a law that supports the use of movable 
collateral. It provides the legal basis for the establishment of a f acility allowing alternative forms of 
collateral. Nontraditional assets are now accepted as collateral for loans. These assets include: 
copyrights, intellectual property, and inventories, among others. The law also established the 
Registry of Movable Guara ntees to support the use of movable collateral for obtaining loans.192 
Refine and strengthen financial consumer protection regulation to address 
concerns of women clients : There is evidence that women are more vulnerable  
than men  and at  great  risk of abuse in the financial system. Unequal power 
dynamics between women and men in society can contribute to this vulnerability. 
Women’s access to mechanisms for consumer complaints and redress can be 
constrained by their lower levels of literacy and educatio n, and by safety issues.  
The financial inclusion strategy would be strengthened by attending to the consumer 
protection needs of women. Financial consumer protection of women can be 
strengthened by adopting gender -sensitive complaint mechanisms that specifically 
address their awareness and access barriers. Identifying the differential consumer 
protection needs for women and men can be important for a regulator to meet its 
consu mer protection responsibilities . ASEAN is well placed to conduct diagnostic 
studies across the region. This is more important than ever,  given  the rapid growth of 
mobile money and fintech , which are giving rise to new consumer protection 
concerns.  
Examples  
Consumer protection is one of the six pillars of Indonesia’s national financial inclusion strategy. The 
objective is to provide a guarantee of security for consumers when they are interacting with financial 
institutions. The consumer protection pillar in cludes: (1) product transparency, (2) handling of 
consumer complaints, (3) mediation, and (4) consumer education.193  
In order to develop, implement, and monitor a consumer redress mechanism for financial services, 
Tanzania is reforming its Deposit Insurance  Regulatory Framework.194  
Financial education and financial literacy : Good practice calls for addressing 
financial education and financial literacy  within a financial inclusion strategy. This is 
the opportunity to identify gender differences in financial l iteracy levels and to devise

  62  gender -sensitive strategies that can meet the specific needs of different sub -group s 
of women and men. Financial literacy is believed to be a significant barrier to 
women’s financial inclusion . Evidence shows that women have lower levels of 
financial knowledge, have less confidence in their financial skills , and exhibit 
different financial behaviors  than men.195 Financial  literacy levels are lower among 
women than men in each of the ASEAN countrie s and are particularly low in Brunei 
Darussalam , Lao PDR, Myanmar , and Viet Nam.196 Gender differences in men’s and 
women’s societal roles have implications for both the content and delivery of 
financial educati on programs if they are to be effective for wom en.  
The importance of financial education and financial literacy cannot be overstated , 
especially w hen an economy is rapidly becom ing more digital ized. Digital finance 
has the potential to include vast numbers of people who were previously unserved  
by the financial system . The newly included will find a range of products and 
services available to them —whether from their mobile network operator , the 
superplatform that hosts their e -commerce business , or peer -to-peer lending 
operations . Entrepreneurs,  workers , and consumers will all need the knowledge and 
skills to navigate a complex and evolving financial services landscape . They will 
need to know how to select and use appropriate products from appropriate sources, 
and they will need to know how to pr otect themselves from both over -indebtedness 
and fraud. Technology can also provide some of the solution. By leveraging 
technology, financial literacy can be disseminated on a large scale and through a 
range of channels such as websites, online games, SMS messages, videos, radio , 
and television. ASEAN has one action line that specifically addresses financial 
education.  It focuses on insurance education.  
Examples  
All 12 national financial inclusion strategies surveyed by AFI ha ve financial education and financial 
literacy components. For example:  
 Papua New Guinea: The national strategy include s national surveys to improve understanding the 
behaviors of low -income customers; programs for rural -based informal workers were created in 50 
percent of districts ; and a pilot mobile phone financial literacy program.   
 Burundi: The national strategy inclu ded creation of a financial literacy program for women.  
 Malawi: The national strategy included a baseline survey, the development of a strategy, and the 
creation of national financial literacy network.  
Countries beyond those surveyed by AFI also have finan cial education and financial literacy 
strategies:  
 In the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Economic and Financial Learning 
Program integrates all of BSP’s education outreach activities, enabling households and business 
to make better econo mic and financial decisions.

  63   The strategy in Paraguay includes a target in terms of  the share of adults who will receive financial 
education: “[to] increase from 10 percent to 20 percent the percentage of adults who have received 
financial literacy trainin g, technical assistance, or support to manage their personal finances.”197   
5.5.2  Action line: Implement a public awareness campaign for 
insurance  
Women are recognized now as a potentially valuable market for insurance. Women’s 
loyalty as customers, their roles in making trusted referrals, and their relational rather 
than transactional approaches to financial services make them valuable to the 
insurance industry. Additionally, women are more risk aware and are concerned with 
protectin g their families, not just th emselves. Along with rising levels of education 
and incomes, women are having more influence over household decision making , 
making them an attractive market for insurance .198  
Women , however, face several barriers to the uptake of insurance, with the lack of 
insurance literacy and the related lack of trust in insurance and insurers  ranking  
among the top challenges. Studies have shown that women lack awareness and 
knowledge of the relevance and concept of insurance and associated products.  
Women dif fer from men in several ways that are relevant to insurance education. 
They are less confident in their decision  making and less trusting of insurers. Men 
and women have different learning preferences relate d to the delivery channels, 
timing , and duration of the learning activity. The women’s market consists of several 
different segments, which also have differen t preferences for learning. To be 
effective, the content of insurance education campaigns need s to better focus on 
women’s needs and preferences , and on their financial risk management behaviors. 
Additionally, insurance education interventions need to meet women’s needs and 
accommodate their constraints in accessing the channels used for disseminating 
education and campaign messages .199  
Women often have less access to financial education due to constraints on their 
mobility or time availability. In some setting s, safety concerns limit women’s 
attendance at financial education activities. High illiteracy rates can also be a barrier 
to accessing insura nce education. Delivery channels that can reach large numbers 
of women and overcome some of these constraints include: print, TV, radio, mobile 
phones and the internet.  
The lack of relevance of insurance education content can also bar women from 
benefittin g fully from financial education . To be successful, insurance education for

  64  women should address their se lf-confidence and trust issues . It should raise 
awareness of the risks facing women and their families at different life stages and for 
different marke t segments. It should teach women about the potential outcomes of 
various risk mitigation strategies , including those they are currently using. An 
effective program must also  enable women to identify with the information provided 
through the use of female characters or role models.  
Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
Tailor insurance education messages to women’s needs and gaps in their 
knowledge, skills , and attitudes toward insurance : Women’s financial inclusion 
can be suppor ted through insurance education campaigns that incorporate women’s 
perspectives  and that are designed to meet their needs . Segmenting the market is 
particularly important for insurance education purposes. This requires undertaking 
needs assessments (or market research) and consultations with women to establish 
their level of financial capabilities related to  insurance and their awareness of diverse 
product types. Consultations can inform how women prioritize their financial risk 
management needs, indicating rel evant content and the channels that reach women 
effectively .200  
Recommendation  
 The needs assessments and consultations with women in selected markets  could 
be coordinated at a regional level to promote the sharing of lessons learned 
across ASEAN and promote more effective insurance education campaigns .  
Examples  
There are several examples of insurance education that has directly targeted women or that  has 
been disseminated through channels that are readily accessible by women. The following are 
examples of efforts that could be gathered and shared across the AMS:  
 In Peru, the Sarita la Segurita  comic used pictures and plain language to explain how 
insurance could protect a community from the effects of the El Niño weather pattern.  
 In South Africa and in Kenya, the insurance industry associations used radio programs to 
educate listeners about the importance and features of insurance.  
 In the Dominican Re public, insurance messages were embedded into the telenovela 
ContraCorriente . 
 In Mexico, financial literacy is embedded in the popular soap opera, Mucho Corazón . To 
increase its effectiveness, each episode is followed by a talk show that discusses related 
financial topics and provides the opportunity for audience questions and answers. 201 
 In Singapore, the Tsao Foundation provides financial education for mature women, ages 40 to 
60, to enable them to remain financially independent in old age through better financial

messages.202

Tackle legislation and regulations that address the social norms constraining 
women’s financial inclusion and which are beyond the scope of the financial 
sector : The financial inclusion strategy should emphasize and a ddress 
discriminatory laws and societal constraints that directly or indirectly  limit women’s 
access to financial services . Although all countries in ASEAN have laws that allow 
women to sign contracts, register a business , and open a bank account, several 
countries including Brunei Darussalam , Indonesia, Malaysia , and Singapore also 
recognize personal law ;203 moreover, Indonesia, Malaysia , and Myanmar recognize 
customary law .204 Both of these types of laws  can supersede  constitutional law. 
Additionally, discrimination in access to credit based on gender or marital status is 
not against th e law in Brunei Darussalam , Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, 
Singapore, or Thailand. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam , discrimination in access to credit 
based on marital status is not against the law. By harmoniz ing laws and regulations 
that remove constraints to women’s financial access at a regional level, financial 
inclusion across ASEAN will be improved.   
5.5.3  Action line: Promote innovative financial inclusion via digital 
platforms205 
The literature on mobile money, digital financial services , and fintech provides many 
policy recommendations for policies which , if implemented, will provide for safer and 
more inclusive access to finance through digital means.

203 For example, Muslim personal law is a subset of Sharia law that applies to personal matters such as marriage, di vorce 
and adoption (Tehreem Baht, “Is the Muslim Personal Law a Form of Sharia Law?” Quora (blog), 
https://www.quora.com/Is -the-Muslim -Personal -law-a-form-of-Sharia -Law). In Singapore, a Syariah (i.e., Sharia) legal 
system co -exists with a common law system. The “Syariah court applies special laws enacted exclusively for Singapore’s 
Muslim population.” This legal system is fully government -funded yet administered separatel y. (Black, Ann, 2012, Lessons

205 The CSAP has an action line that should fall under the umbrella of formulating a financial inclusion strategy, so  we 
include it here.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  66  Actions that would advance WEE at the ASEAN regional level  
Mobile money : Mobile money c ould be supported by implement ing biometric SIM 
registration. Favorable  regulation s and government initiatives have allowed for the 
adoption of streamlined, technology -enabled eKYC ( electronic know -your-customer) 
processes  that remov e barriers to opening  accounts .206 
Biometric identification for all adults : The provision of unique, biometric 
identification to all adults across ASEAN would greatly improve access to financial 
products, e -government , and a range of other services. The Aadhaar program in 
India is just one example. The AEC could play a role in researching and establishing 
best practices and developing guidelines for the AMS.  
Fintech: Good practice suggests bringing together experienced regulators and ones 
who are new to fintech for policy dialogue and sharing of experiences.207 This 
dialogue would be especially beneficial if it includes investors, policymakers , and 
fintechs  as well as representatives from countries both in and out of ASEAN. 
Collaboration across different sectoral groups within the AEC  could accelerate this 
work and make it more effective (see the section Coordination and Collaboration 
Across Sectoral Bodies for more  details and recommendations ). Further, 
coordin ation and collaboration between sectoral bodies within the ASEAN 
Secretariat  would undoubtedly lead to collaboration of the respective ministries at 
the national level. For fintech coordination , regulatory domains such as between 
financial regulators, tel ecommunications  regulators , and ministries of internal affairs  
(which  are oftentimes in charge of ensuring data security and protection ) will become 
the norm rather than exception  in the future.   
Recommendations  
The following measures , proposed by the Alli ance for Financial Inclusion, c ould be 
considered  for adoption at the ASEAN level :208 
o Build a knowledge repository for financial regulators with relevant material 
on “fintech for financial inclusion” technological innovations that are 
transformative and relevant for financial inclusion  including closing the 
gender gap.  
o Facilitate peer lea rning, knowledge sharing , and capacity building on best 
practices in fintech for financial inclusion among regulators to support 
implement ation of policy measures that wi ll reinforce digital financial 
services. Share lessons on how to balance financial innovations with 
financial inclusion.  
o Build the capacity of policymakers and regulators on practical exposure to 
fintech innovations ; and  train regulators in collaboration w ith technical

regulatory issues.  
 
Incorporate fintech into national financial inclusion strategies : The AFI also 
suggested that when considering  fintech innovations , ask: “which innovation can be 
transformative” that  is, which one  can provide financial services to the previously 
financially excluded.  For the AEC, it is fitting to ask which  ones hold promise to close 
the gender gap in financial inclusion.  
Examples of transformative fintech to date include :210 
o Biometric SIM card registration – enabling millions  of people  to open new 
mobile accounts safely  in Pakistan.  
o Tiered KYC systems – enabling women to set up accounts without 
documentation or minimum balan ce requirements  with mobile bank agents 
in Nigeria.  
o eKYC implementation of AML/CFT measures in India through the national 
biometric ID program Aadhaar  
o An iris recognition solution in Jordan to assist vulnerable and unbanked 
Syrian refugees with food and c ash-based assistance.  
Regulators in ASEAN need to be well informed about how women engage with 
payment and other financial services available on superplatforms such as Alipay or 
Facebook, and what their specific consumer protection issues are.  
Recommendations  
In addition to these policy measures, the processes by which the policy measures 
and the financial inclusion strategy are formulated and then implemented should be 
conducted  in a gender -sensitive way. The following are recommended good 
practices for developing a financial inclusion strategy that promotes women’s 
financial inclusion :  
 To ensure an effective and gender -sensitive policymaking process, set up a 
dedicated financial inclusion unit within the AEC and ensure that it has a 
gender di verse membership.  
 Develop and document a vision for women’s financial inclusion in ASEAN. It 
is recommended that th e vision  be: to transition women from informal to 
formal forms of financial inclusion .211 Many women rely on informal financial 
services ; this  is believed to have negative implications for women and the 
economy as a whole.

  68   During the development of the strategy, have a mechanism to consult with 
men and women representatives of each type of institutional stakeholder, 
including women’s community g roups. Encourage women’s participation in 
any stakeholder consultations. There is evidence that engagement with 
women’s business associations is beneficial for gender -sensitive policy 
reform .212  
 Support or develop diagnostic studies to establish the current  state of 
financial inclusion for men and women in the region, barriers to inclusion , and 
policy priorities. Women are not a homogenous group. Diagnostic studies 
should define the financial inclusion profiles of different types of women, for 
example, based  on age, geography, income level , and educational 
background. Each segment will have different financial needs and beha viors 
and may require different policy approaches. Gender gaps in both the 
demand and supply sides should be documented in the strategy.  
 Support efforts to conduct capacity building for financial service providers on 
the need for women’s financial inclusion.  
 Develop a monitoring and evaluation framework for the strategy that has sex -
disaggregated objectives and targets requiring the ongoin g collection, 
analysis , and tracking of sex -disaggregated data.  
The CSAP has an action line related to the processes for developing and 
implementing the financial inclusion strategy.  
Examples  
 In Zambia, existing FinScope research on financial inclusion was analyzed to assess women’s 
financial inclusion. The study looked at the state of women’s financial inclusion overall and how it 
compared to male financial inclusion.213 A second study focused more closely on access to finance 
of women smallholder farmers . 214 The studies highlighted how women’s disadvantaged position 
generally leads to their greater financial exclusion. The findings motivated the Bank of Zambia to 
mainstream gender in the financial sector.  
 In the Solomon Islands, consultations were conduct ed with women -focused savings clubs and 
MFIs, a women’s business association, and the Ministry of Women, to inform the financial 
inclusion strategy.215  
5.5.4  Action line: Elevate capacity building of ASEAN Member 
States to enhance financial inclusion ecosystem  
This provides another opportunity to promote women’s financial inclusion. ASEAN 
should ensure that this capacity building includes the sharing of evidence of the 
business case for targeting the women’s market and good practices in advancing 
women’s financi al inclusion. The lack of sex-disaggregated data and low levels of

  71 6 RETRAINING AND RESKI LLING WOMEN WORKERS  
The employment projections for women in  the ASEAN region  are mixed. One  
analysis of ASEAN economic integration through trade liberalization and supportive 
economic policies found that it is expect ed to leave the existing gender gap intact.217 
In the absence of policy changes to address gender inequality, the AEC Blueprint is 
expected to lead to a lower relative female share of exports, due to informalization, 
lower wages, higher labor  force dropout , and external migration out of ASEAN . It is  
expected to produce  few changes in employment or wages for women.218 Two other 
studies looked at how the economy and jobs will change in reaction new 
technologies. In 2018, t he Asian Development Bank ( ADB) examined how 
technology affects jobs in their 2018 Outlook report. The I nternational Labor 
Organization (ILO)  also examined the impact of new technology on jobs and firms in 
ASEAN , but with a focus on a few specific sectors .219 These studies  found significant 
negative impacts on women workers.  The following discussion  review s these  studies  
and then considers  the implications for women.  
New technologies are the foundation for better paying jobs and economic growth. 
Nevertheless, there is growing anxiety that ne w technologies will cause widespread 
job loss.220 The ADB report includes a n extensive analysis of the changes to be 
expected from technology and the Fourth Industrial Revolution  across Asia and 
found reasons for both optimism and caution.221 
On the positive s ide, the ADB 2018 Outlook report states  that:   
 “New technologies often automate only some tasks of a job, not the whole 
job.” Thus, technology will make workers more productive.  
 “Job automation goes ahead only where both technical and economically 
feasible. ” In several countries, the cost of labor  is still low enough that 
investment in technology is not economical, at this time.  
 “Rising demand [will] offset job displacement driven by automation .” 
o Rising domestic demand will more than compensate for  jobs 
displaced by technology.  
o Production returning to advanced economies may not threaten 
employment in Asia . 
 “Technological change and economic growth create new occupations and 
industries .” 
o New types of jobs have emerged to handle new technologies in th e 
past, and it is expected this will happen in the future .222

  72  There are also several worrying trends. The report questioned whether 
manufacturing will remain an engine of growth creation in Asia. Even as new 
technology creates jobs, automation will hurt wor kers in certain types of jobs. In fact, 
technology improvements within global value chain s have been accompanied lower 
employment in all sectors (agriculture, manufacturing , and services), except for in 
the Ph ilippines  and Viet Nam .223  
The technical feasibility of automating tasks, combining machines and computing 
power, is  often greater  for routine and manual tasks such as repetitive physical 
operations (e.g., tasks of sewing machine operators) and routine and cognitive tasks 
(e.g., tasks performed b y accountants, bank tellers, and some BPO workers). These 
are the types of task that will be displaced by automation. Job demand will be 
strongest for nonroutine cognitive, social, and ICT tasks. In fact, the ADB found that 
in Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam , jobs less intensive in ICT and nonroutine 
cognitive task s, and jobs that heavily involve  manual tasks are already 
disappearing.224 
The ADB report examined the impact of introducing new technologies in a few 
selected sectors in Asia, including agricultu re, retail , and financial services. The 
International Labor Organization  (ILO) , in a separate report also examined the 
impact of new technology on jobs and firms in ASEAN. Th e ILO  focused on five 
priority sectors for ASEAN: electrical and electronics ; textiles, clothing and footwear ; 
business process outsourcing ; retail ; and automotive and auto parts. The ILO found 
that technology will increase productivity  across all sectors,  making some 
occupations redundant but also creating new ones225.  
The findings of both reports are summarized here by sector.  
Agriculture . This sector is  the top employer in several ASEAN countries. By 2030, if 
current trends continue, 43  percent  of the workforce in Lao PDR and 28  percent  in 
Myanmar will still be employ ed in the agricultural sector.226 Currently, in the group of 
countries that includes Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, women’s 
engagement in agriculture ranges from 48  percent  in Viet Nam  to 69  percent  in 
Myanmar. If inequality in the region is to be  successfully addressed, agricultural 
productivity and incomes must rise. Productivity can be enhanced by extending the 
use of proven technologies such as irrigation, pesticides , or high -yielding varieties 
and by using Fourth Industrial Revolution technolo gies such as bioinformatics  and 
precision agriculture , and by using drones and automatic controls for watering. 
Cheap and accessible ICT technologies can benefit smallholder farmers by 
connecting them with markets and extension information. For farmers to benefit, they

  73  must have  affordable access to mobile phones and the internet, as well as a reliable 
network.227  
Electrical and electronics . This is a prominent sector in ASEAN with more than 2.5 
million workers employed. Young women are dominant in this indu stry, particularly in 
labor -intensive assembly line jobs.228 Three technologies are poised to disrupt the 
sector: robotic automation, 3D printing , and the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet 
of Things represents an opportunity for the industry due to strong demand. Currently, 
people are more cost -effective than robots , but lower skilled jobs, such as assembly  
work , may be at risk. There is a pote ntial to lose 60  percent  of salaried workers in 
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam . 
Textiles, clothing , and footwear . This is a highly competitive sector shaped by 
large multinational brands and retailers. It traditionally has been a conduit for 
individuals transitioning to formal wage employment. The sector provides over 9 
million jobs, most of which are held by young women. The female share of 
employment exceeds 70  percent  in Cambodia, Lao  PDR , the Philippines, Thailand , 
and Viet Nam . It is one of t he most labor -intensive industries and therefore at the 
highest risk of automation. Robotic automation poses the biggest risk for jobs 
through production moving closer to end markets. The shares of workers that are at 
high risk of displacement range from 6 4 percent  in Indonesia to 88  percent  in 
Cambodia. Lower skilled workers will be strongly and negatively impacted , while the 
demand for higher skilled technicians and engineers will increase.  
Business process outsourcing  (BPO) . This sector has experienced amazing 
growth in the Phil ippines where it employs about 1 million workers. The introduction 
of cloud computing, software automation, and knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) 
will have a large impact on workers in call center s. The shift to KPO, which is a 
higher value service, has serious implications for the 600,000 workers in  the 
Philippines who are at high risk due to automation. At the same time, KPO services 
will require higher skilled workers, including those with credentia ls in medicine or 
law, for example. The impacts on women could be significant as they make up 59  
percent  of the BPO workforce, and a slightly higher share in call center s.  
Financial services.  Financial services are facing disruption from different types o f 
technology.  One of these is blockchain (or distributed ledger technology [DLT]), and 
it said to have the potential to revolutionize the financial sector and the microcredit 
sector especially. In microfinance, DLT functions as an open accounting system 
eliminating the need for audits or documentation. It allows unbanked clients to build 
personal credit histories and thus a bankable reputation. Pilots of DLT to support 
microfinance suggest that operational costs can be cut down to 10  percent  of 
traditional costs while providing faster transaction times. Some believe that: “DLT 
                                                           
227 ADB, 2018, 111.   
228 It is estimated that the share of women workers in electronics factories ranged from 60 to 90 percent in Malaysia,  Viet 
Nam,  and Thailand, respectively, in 2011 (Laura Villadiego, “The Gender Gap in Electronics Fact ories: Women Exposed to 
Chemicals and Lower Pay,” Equal Times (online), December 22, 2017).  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  74  could be a real game changer by lowering costs and doing away with paperwork and 
bureaucratic hurdles that preclude access for SMEs. ”229 
Trade finance is another area in which the ADB sees the potential  for disruption. The 
global trade finance gap was $1.5 trillion in 2016 , and that gap was particularly acute 
in Asia. MSMEs face various barriers in accessing trade finance , including lack 
information about available financial services an d a lack of collateral or a 
documented history of past transactions.  
Large, global e -commerce platforms, or superplatforms, have established payment 
systems to provide a seamless experience for users. A nt Financial Group is 
providing lending  (catering mos tly to SMEs ) as well as  training and tailored advice. 
These services have not yet made deep inroads into Southeast Asia. (This subject is 
further discussed in Section 5.3  earlier on page 55 .) 
Retail.  The outlook for this sector is rosy as it is poised for growth with an expanding 
consumer market that currently includes  632 million people. The retail sector is the 
largest provider of jobs in ASEAN , with 44.6 million workers, or about 16  percent  of 
total employment and 44  percent  of total services jobs. These jobs are the least 
threatened by technology. Disruptive technologies in retail include, among other 
things , mobile and e -commerce platforms , but th ose technologies  have yet to be 
taken up widely in the region.  
However, a s technology becomes more pervasive through investments by larger 
retail outfits, there will be a high risk of automation. The biggest barrier to technology 
uptake in this sector is local, traditional retail which comprise s 80 percent  or more of 
the region’s outlets. However, modern retail outlets are expanding and increasing 
their market share. Potentially, over three -quarters of workers in this sector across 
the region could be at risk of being displaced: 68  percent  Thailand,  71 percent  
Cambodia , 85 percent  Indonesia , and 86  percent  in the Philippines.  
In theory, mobile and e -commerce platforms could massively displace conventional 
retail establishments . However, retail outlets continue to be popular , because  
ASEAN consumers in general, do not trust online or mobile shopping. As of now, e -
commerce has only a small share of the retail market , with less than 1 percent of 
sales. Less than one-third of companies have a website and only about half use 
email to communicate. Yet, dev eloping economies in ASEAN are leading the world 
in social commerce in which sales are online but payments are offline (cash on 
delivery).  
The popularity of social media has turned these sites into free e -commerce 
platforms. In 2016  in Thailand, the large st of these markets, 51  percent  of online 
shoppers reported buying something on social media, while 31  percent  of online 
shoppers in Malaysia did the same. By comparison, the global average was 16  
                                                           
229 ADB 2018, 23.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  75  percent  for that year .230 Social media sales account for 30  percent  of e-commerce 
transactions in Southeast Asia. In the ASEAN region, 47  percent  of the population is 
active on social media with 42  percent  accessing it from mobile devices. Facebook is 
widely used in Viet Nam  (64 million users), Indonesia (130 million users) , and the 
Philippines .231 In fact, Indonesia has the fourth -largest number of Facebook users 
globally .232 At the same time, enterprises seeking to intensify their e -commerce and 
mobile shopping presence are exp ected to recruit people with strong digital 
marketing and social media skills in addition to data analysis, programming , and 
supply chain management experience.  
6.1 Challenges to Women Workers in the Digital Economy  
The above analysis shows that women  are in sectors and occupations that are at 
high risk of displacement from automation. Women in the Philippines and Viet Nam  
are estimated to face more than twice the probability of being in a high -risk 
occupation than their male counterparts. In Indonesia and Tha iland, the relative 
probability for women to occupy a high -risk job compared to men is approximately 
1.5 times higher. ASEAN’s textile, clothes , and footwear sector, electrical and 
electronics  sector , BPO sector , and retail sector all face high risk from a utomation, 
jeopardizing employment opportunities for millions of the region’s female workers. 
The ILO has found that technology improvements within global value chains have 
already resulted in lower employment across all sectors in Asia, except for in the 
Philippines  and Viet Nam .233 Others have  projected that globally “gender, inter-
regional, inter-generational and income inequalities” will likely widen further as the 
economy transitions .234  
The trends indicate an increase in jobs that require proficiency in nonroutine 
cognitive and ICT tasks and a decline in opportunities in volving  intensive manual 
work. Workers with weaker basic skills as well as older workers, the poor, those 
living in rura l areas , and women will be left behind .235  
Many workers will not have the skills and education that new jobs will require. The 
skills that will be in high demand include the ability to do cognitive, social interaction , 
and ICT tasks. Workers will need to ha ve completed high school or have some 
tertiary education. The bright spot in this picture is that wages for these types of jobs 
are twice as high as wages for low -intensity jobs.  
The advance of the digital economy means that women workers will need skills 
development and retraining, as well as social protection to provide a safety net in 
case of unemployment. It is predicted that globally, workers will have to engage in

  76  lifelong learning if they are to remain employable. In ASEAN, it is likely that 
displace d workers who have low skill and education levels will join the informal 
sector and/or pursue less secure and less remunerative jobs. It is projected that 
under the AEC Blueprint, sectors that involve informal and vulnerable employment 
will gain jobs. In f act, in five of the ASEAN countries, vulnerable jobs are estimated 
to make up one -half of the projected new jobs .236  
Women workers are further challenged by a lack of attention at the policy level within 
the region. The focus of attention is largely on deve loping MSMEs, most of which are 
unlikely to  create  large volumes of  jobs. In the area of women’s employment, most of 
the policy focus is on developing women’s leadership.  
6.2 Digital Economy Jobs  
While more traditional jobs disappear due to automation, demand  is increasing  for 
jobs that require ICT skills. Although there is a shortage of skilled ICT workers, 
women in general are unable to fill these jobs.  
Jobs that use ICTs or digital technologies have the potential to benefit women 
workers in several ways. They offer t he possibility of flexible hours and work 
locations, which would allow women to better juggle work and home responsi bilities. 
Jobs that involve working with ICTs are better paid and the skills are often 
transferrable. Digital technologies opera te in a borderless world, allowing workers to 
provide services or products to international markets through online platforms.  
A study that found that when businesses in Viet Nam  increased their use of ICT, it 
had positive effects for women in the labor  market. The research found that college 
educated women made up a greater proportion of employees at firms that had 
higher ICT use. The impact was greater for women who were skilled. But the effect 
was weaker for women working in complex industries where a hi gher proportion of 
male employees had highly technical skills. The report  found  that this supports the 
observation that ICT use increases relative demand for non -routine, interactive tasks 
raising the relative share of women employed.237 
The authors of the r eport also  contend that business use of ICT has been a boon to 
women. And they concluded that the uptake of ICT has more potential to generate 
growth of high -quality employment for women, when compared to programs focused 
on providing capital and training.238 
6.3 Challenges to Women Taking Up Digital Economy Jobs  
Several factors pose challenges to women who wish to pursue careers or 
businesses that require significant ICT or digital technology skills, starting with 
                                                           
236 United Nations 2017, 17.  
237 ADB, 2018, 72.  
238 Ibid. WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  77  education. Girls and young women are less likel y to study and graduate in the 
subjects that are necessary for these careers. Access and use of technology builds 
up digital literacy. With less access to technology in general, women have lower 
levels of digital literacy.  
Women face barriers to entry and  advancement in the ICT industry. The tech 
industry is globally perceiv ed to be male -dominated. In the U nited States  in 2015, 
only 25  percent  of ICT specialists were women , while in the E uropean Union in 
2011 , only 16  percent  were women.239 Traditional gender hierarchy patterns are 
prevalent with women in low -skilled, lower wage jobs.240 Social and cultural norms 
also hold women back. Stereotypes can keep girls from pursuing studies in 
computer science and engineering. Role models and mentors who could inspire and 
support women in their studies and careers are lacking. Companies are not 
structuring their work in a flexible way that could accommodate women’s schedules, 
even though this is technically feasible. Furthermore, the digital economy de mands 
increasingly advanced technical abilities that require workers to continually upgrade 
their skills. Women face disadvantages when it comes to training and skills 
upgrading. There is a bias toward investing in men’s education before women’s. 
When wome n take time out of the workforce for family reasons, their skills erode.  
6.4 CSAP Actions Lines that Can Promote WEE for Women 
Workers  
There are surprisingly few action lines within the CSAP that directly relate to helping 
workers prepare for and adjust to t he digital economy, let alon e action lines related 
to women workers. All areas of the CSAP were reviewed carefully to identify 
opportunities for actions that will promote the capabilities of workers to productively 
contribute to the digital economy. Four a ction lines were identified:  
 Intensify the engagement of academia, private sector , and relevant partners 
in the planning, implementation , and assessment of joint undertakings in 
human resource development, and research and development  
 Continue ongoing efforts to narrow the gaps between demand and supply in 
ICT human resources  
 Develop best practices for next generation tele center s 
 Promote dialogue and induce awareness on global megatrends and emerging

  78  and assessment of joint undertakings in human resource 
development, and research and development  
The question of reskilling and training  workers  to prepare for the jobs of the future is 
receiving increased attention recently. This includes the establishment of the Global 
Commission on the Future of Work in August 2017 .241 At this time, there are more 
questions than answers about what  it will take to scale up reskilling to meet the 
challenges posed by technology -based disruption of the labor  market.   
What is clear is that countries will need to encourage continuous reskilling and 
lifelong learning in order to develop and maintain huma n resources with the 
capabilities necessary to fuel inclusive economic growth .242 Skills development 
systems will need to accomplish two things simultaneously: deliver basic skills that 
allow people to embrace evolving technological opportunities; and facili tate dynamic , 
lifelong learning so that workers can keep up with digitalization .243 
A global survey of executives in large companies found that a good share of them 
see addressing the skills gap as a top priority and a competitive imperative. 
However, o nly 1 6 percent of them reported that their company is prepared to 
address this skills gap. At the same time, the private sector believes that it should 
take the lead on reskilling workers, although in partnership with other stakeholders 
including governments, e ducators , and workers .244  
While the private sector has expressed the desire to the take the lead, other 
commentators have stressed the need for governments to take a proactive role .245 
Collaborating with academia, the private sector , and other stakeholders to  learn 
together, collaborate , and pool resources will be key to success and a good first step 
for the AEC. There is scope for policymakers to support analyses to inform worker 
reskilling initiatives, for government programs to provide reskilling and worker  
training, and for governments to offer incentives for workers and firms to upgrade 
their skills or develop new ones.

  79  Forecasting future skill needs: Traditional  worker training programs have been 
criticized for not resulting in the sufficient 
uptake of new jobs. One of the factors was a 
lack of understanding of the changing 
requirements of the market. The ability to 
predict and plan for job transitions would 
allow policymakers, companies, and 
workers to prioritize their actions and 
investments. This could reduce the strain on 
companies, public finances , and social 
safety nets. The World Economic Forum 
has developed a practical tool that can identify 
job transition  opportunities and thus the 
required reskilling. It is a data -driven tool 
that was first applied to the U .S. labor  
market to predict job transition pathways. 
The methodology can be extended 
to other countries and it might  be used 
to promote gender inclusiv e workforce 
planning , among other applications .246

Programa Valentina  
An expanding technology sector in 
Guatemala has been creating jobs since 
2005. The critical need for appropriate 
training and job placement programs led 
to the establishment of the Programa 
Valentina of the Sergio Paiz Andrade 
Foundation, FUNSEPA. This program 
trains disadvantaged young 
Guatemalans for employment in the 
technology sector. It was designed with 
the employers’ needs  in mind and seeks 
to emulate the experience of working in 
technology companies. When finished, 
certified participants are equipped to 
work in entry level jobs in the tech 
industry. Programa Valentina aspires to 
be the “leading open -source training and 
placement program for the tech industry 
in Latin America by 2025.”

  80  Access to lifelong learning and retraining can be provided by government or facilitated through 
financial incentives for firms or individuals. Examples of such programs include the following:  
 Singapore has recognized that with the faster pace of technological change, skills upgrading is 
critical to maintaining a competitive economy. The SkillsFuture initiative  was introduced in 2015, 
offering educational credit to Singaporeans above 25 years to  encourage individual ownership of 
skills development and lifelong learning.  
 Another example comes from Sweden which has established Job Security Councils  across the 
country. These are nonprofit organizations governed by representatives of employers and 
employees and financed by employers. The goal is to encourage a seamless transition for laid -off 
workers by planning ahead and by providing guidance and training, if necessary. This program has 
resulted in over 85 percent of workers being re -employed within  a year.247   
 The Republic of Korea’s Employment Insurance Fund  provides direct funding for SME workforce 
training.  
 In Malaysia, the Human Resources Development Fund , funded by contributions of employers in 
the manufacturing and service sectors, aims to develop quality human capital and a world class 
workforce. Training grants are open to all employers that are both registered and paying the levy 
that underwrites all or a major portion of the costs of employee trainings.248

6.4.2  Action line: Continue ongoing efforts to narrow the gaps 
between demand and supply in ICT human resources  
This action line is under the human capital development strategic measure. It is 
about strengthening the professional development of the ICT workforce in the region. 
The first area of focus for improving a nation’s ICT skills is usually the formal 
education system. This report does not address the formal education system. 
Rather, the emphasis  here is on enhancing the ICT abilities of adult women who are 
out of school , which is a greater challenge . 
The public sector has a role in ensuring that all people have the basic ICT skills 
needed to work in the digital economy. This starts with digital literacy (see section 
above on digital literacy).  
Narrowing the gap between the demand and supply of ICT s kills in the workforce 
involves three types of actions: (1) forecasting the digital skills which will be in 
demand in the future; (2) disseminating information on these needs to job seekers

  81  and firms; and (3) making training systems more responsive to mark et needs. WEE 
can be promoted through the latter two actions.  
Policymakers have a role  to play  in sharing as widely as possible the information on 
demand for digital skills. This includes disseminating the information as widely as 
possible, particularly to education and training providers, to provide guidance to 
jobseekers and to workers who are co nsidering upgrading or adding new skills that 
will be in demand.  
Extra efforts could be made to ensure the information reaches women , for example 
by disseminating it to women’s organizations as well as women -focused training 
institutions. At the policy le vel, steps can also be taken to promote role models of 
successful women with ICT skills to make ICT careers more attractive to girls and 
women.  
Good practice in building ICT skills entails  making training systems more responsive 
to industry needs through improved governance, requiring close coordination 
between the ICT industry, training institutions and the government. This also 
includes targeting funding for training programs based on the skills that are expected 
to be in demand in the future. The public  sector can also play an important role in 
assessing the quality of private and public training institutions. This can assist in 
ensuring that the curricula offered are aligned with current and projected industry 
needs.  
Work experience is an important elem ent in the production of human capital. The 
nature of the job shapes the knowledge and skills that an employee learns .249 
Therefore, work experiences need to be included as a means of  transferring ICT 
skills to women. This could include apprenticeships, inte rnships , and job placements 
that allow individuals to build skills on the job.  
Ensuring that skills training works for women : Both action lines above are 
related to skills training for women : whether specific reskilling for job transition in 
general or skills training to prepare for a job in ICTs. Women’s training needs differ 
from men’s in important ways. Actions that can improve the outcomes of training and 
reskilling for women are listed bel ow.  
When it comes to the mismatch between the supply of skills and labor  market 
demand, women are often one of the most affected groups .250 Training for women is 
often supply -driven and focused on female -dominated sectors.  
Demand -driven . Women are able to r each a wider range of jobs and 
occupations and even enter into male -dominated sectors, when skills training 
is demand -driven. As such, skills training can be a key component of breaking 
down occupational segregation.

  82  Comprehensive approach . Skills training  for women needs to be part of a 
comprehensive approach. It is most effective when accompanied by job -
search support, opportunities for work experience , and mentoring and 
guidance. Skills training should also include so-called soft skills such as 
communica tion techniques and problem -solving. These have been shown to 
be very valuable to women’s employment outcomes. For example, the youth 
employment program  Juventud y Empleo in the Dominican Republic, targeted 
young women with more than just technical skills, and found that the soft skills 
component significantly enhanced their employment prospects .22 
Adapt to women’s circumstances . Effective  skills training programs for 
women ta ke into account women’s care responsibilities and provide flexible 
pedagogies. They also include: appropriate scheduling times for training; 
provision of transport or grants/subsidies; and additional basic skills where 
necessary (e.g. , literacy and numerac y training).  
Set targets . Participation of women in trainings has been shown to increase 
when there are targets and quotas for gender balance.  
Remove bias . Gender sensitization of training staff and management as well 
as the removal of any bias or stereo types in the curricula also are beneficial 
for women’s participation and outcomes.  
Consider apprenticeships . In addition to training, apprenticeships can 
increase women’s labor force opportunities —even in sectors dominated by 
men, such as ICTs. Setting ta rgets, quotas and providing financial incentives 
to both trainers and women can help break down barriers to participation .251 
Opportunities for  the AEC  
As part of a coalition focused on human resource development, the AEC is well 
placed to ensure that a gender perspective is applied to the planning, 
implementation , and assessment of the joint undertakings. Specific actions that 
would contribute to WEE in this area include  the following : 
 Develop guidance on the methodology to forecast future skill needs an d job 
transition pathways that promotes gender inclusive  workforce planning. 
Provide support to AMS for implementation of the skill forecasting tool . 
 Develop guidance on how to set gender targets and quotas and then track 
them, for reskilling programs. Inc lude consideration of incentives.  
 Develop guidelines on how to review and revise curricula to remove gender 
bias and stereotypes.  
 Implement a pilot program to test how gender -sensitive training programs can 
build skills and capacities of women workers. Th is would include providing 
gender sensitization training and revising curricula.  
                                                           
251 Ibid., 32 –33. WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  83   Ensure that representatives of women workers ’ interests are included in the 
engagement of all stakeholders. This could include union representatives 
from industries in which women form the majority of workers, from women’s 
associations , and from women’s rights organizations, among others. 
Additionall y, representatives of women’s groups within ASEAN could be 
included in the dialogue.  
Interventions to narrow the gap in the supply and demand for ICT skills provide an 
excellent opportunity to promote WEE. In addition to adapting the points mentioned 
abov e to the ICT setting, the following actions would also advance women’s uptake 
of ICT skills:  
 Promote successful women workers or employers in ICT jobs as role models.  
 Provide awards for and create publicity around women who successfully 
complete a high -quality ICT training program and transition to ICT jobs.  
6.4.3  Action line: Develop best practices for next generation 
telecenter s 
This action line was addressed under the MSME section (see  the Affordability 
section in Chapter 4, Development of Women -owned MSMEs in the Digital 
Economy) .  
6.4.4  Action line: Promote dialogue and induce awareness on 
global megatrends and emerging trade related issues in 
ASEAN  
This action line relates to engendering and maintaining an industrial relations 
environment that facilitates investing in workers and in firms as learning centers for 
industrial upgrading and managing labor adjustments as the ASEAN  community 
becomes more i ntegrated . Including representatives of women workers, particularly 
from the industries in which women workers are dominant , such as garments and 
electronics, would ensure that women’s perspectives and concerns are included in 
the dialogue. A more inclusiv e ASEAN would be promoted by addressing women’s 
specific needs, preferences , and constraints in dialogues regarding industrial 
upgrading and managing labor adjustments. This is also an opportunity for several 
sectoral bodies within the AEC to work together  and collaborate to better understand 
the projected trends in employment in the digital economy and the implications for 
women.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  85 7 CROSS -CUTTING ISSUES   
The purpose of this project has been  to identify specific action lines within the AEC 
CSAP that provide opportunities for  measures  that can  promote WEE. The review of 
literature and , more importantly , interviews with key informants, also highlighted 
actions which can promote WEE but are applicable to many action lines and 
strategic measures . One of these cross -cutting issues is the need for sex-
disaggregated data. This need applies to every area of WEE address ed in this 
paper. Similarly, the need for women and their perspectives to be represented in all 
policy dialogues and formulations cuts  across almost all CSAP s trategic measures 
and action  lines.  
Another issue that emerged, which is not as obviously linked to WEE, is the need to 
work more collaboratively within the AEC itself, but also across ASEAN 
communities,  particularly across the AEC and the ASCC . This is imperative, not only 
due to the nature of the challenges facing women’s equality in ASEAN, but also, and 
perhaps more importantly , due to the changes and challenges that are emerging 
with the growth of the digital economy.   
Finally , the primary research revealed that the understanding of gender equality and 
the status of WEE in the ASEAN region varies widely among  ASEAN stakeholder s, 
including ASEC staff. For this reason, the first recommendation for cross -cutting 
actions is for tra ining and sensitizing ASEC staff on gender mainstreaming.  
7.1 Institutionalizing Gender Mainstreaming in the AEC   
“Women’s needs must be at the heart of policy and program design, not incidental or 
supplementary to it. ”252 
Mainstreaming WEE will involve a process of assessing how any planned actions or 
policies of the AEC affect women. The objective is to make women’s concerns an 
integral part of the design, implementation, monitoring , and evaluating of programs 
and policies. This requires that policy analy sis and formulation are informed by 
considerations of gender differences and inequalities. Additionally, it implies 
identifying and taking advantage of opportunities to narrow gender gaps and 
promote greater equality between women and men. The ultimate goa l is to achieve 
gender equality in outcomes .253 Importantly, the pursuit and achievement of gender 
equality will contribute to the achievement of other social and economic 
achievements such as economic growth and efficiency.  
Mainstreaming women’s economic e mpowerment into the work of the AEC  implies 
that gender equality become one of the targeted policy outcomes for the AEC along 
with resilient and inclusive economic growth. Mainstreaming  WEE  will require

  86  assessing how planned policies or actions will impact  both men and women, given 
underlying gender differences. Such analysis will promote more informed and 
evidence -based policy options. It will enable policymakers to identify actions that can 
narrow gender gaps.  
Mainstreaming will involve the inclusion of gender perspectives at several points in 
the policy process, including:  
 Formulation of the policy issue/question to be addressed . 
 Definition of the information need ed to assess policy options . 
 Assessment of the implications or impacts of different options,  by gender 
because they might have different costs and benefits for men and women. 
Using gender analysis tools to assess strategies, policies , and frameworks 
can ensure that gender equality considerations are included.  
 Determination of who will be consulte d and how. Consult with gender equality 
advocates and experts from the beginning to ensure that policy development 
incorporates and reflects women’s perspectives, circumstances, preferences , 
and capabilities. Consider consulting with women in local communi ties. 
 The formulation of recommendations for policy choices. These should be 
based on the information and analyses on gender equality resulting from the 
earlier steps. Where possible , set targets for gender equality  and track and 
report progress against th ese targets regularly . 
Recommendations  
 A program of internal capacity -building on gender sensitization and 
mainstreaming WEE will support AEC sectoral bodies to build the knowledge, 
skills , and attitudes required to mainstream WEE throughout the workplan. 
Training and capacity building on gender sensitization will lead to a shared 
vision within the AEC of the meaning and objectives of gender 
mainstreaming. It will also result in a shared lan guage around this subject.  
 Effective gender mainstreaming will require resources, ongoing attention , and 
political capital as experience has shown that gender mainstreaming can be 
difficult to implement.  
 Coordination of mainstreaming efforts would be aide d by the establishment of 
an office within the AEC Department in the ASEAN Secretariat  to build 
capacity, provide resources, and serve as a point of contact . This office 
should also track progress of gender mainstreaming activities  by means of a 
robust mon itoring and evaluation program. As this office will not be associated 
with a specific ministerial meeting, it could be established as a new division 
within the ASEAN Integration Monitoring Directorate (AIMD) .  
Examples  
A good example of gender mainstreaming comes from the Philippines. The Philippines government 
adopted a “ Magna Carta of Women ” in order to translate the Convention on the Elimination of All WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  87  Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) into national law. The objective of the Magna  
Carta of Women is to eliminate discrimination against women and clearly articulate women’s rights in 
the Philippines. Importantly, this law mandates that all government offices, at all levels adopt gender 
mainstreaming as the strategy for implementing the  law.  
Implementation of programs and policies is supported by a mandatory gender budget consisting of 
five percent of all government budgets. Additionally, the law requires:  
 Planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation for gender and development;  
 Creating and/or strengthening gender and development focal points; and  
 Generating and maintaining gender statistics and sex -disaggregated databases to aid in planning, 
programming, and policy formulation.254 
To communicate the importance of this law, the Phi lippine Commission on Women (PCW), a 
separate office reporting to the president of the country, is charged with primary policymaking and 
coordinating responsibilities as well as ensuring that government offices have the capacity to 
effectively implement th e law. The PCW has developed tools to support gender mainstreaming 
throughout government agencies (see http://www.pcw.gov.ph/  for more details).

7.2 Developing Gender Disaggregated Data  
Across all topics related to WEE  touched on in this paper , whether financial 
inclusion, access to the internet, or the status and number of women entrepreneurs, 
there is a lack of gender disaggregated data that are consistent across all ASEAN 
countries and up -to-date. The limited availability of sex -disaggregate d data on 
different topics obscures gender gaps. This is a particular constraint to 
understanding women’s access  to, use  of, and barriers to the internet, social media ,

decis ions will not be fully informed.  
Recommendations  
Policy proposals to address the gap in data and thereby improve policymakers ’ 
understanding of women’s status and issues, include the following elements:  
 Collect, analyze , and track sex -disaggregated data . The data should be 
accessible to others, collected according to international guidelines , and done 
in a manner to allow regular comparisons over time.  
 Conduct research to understand women’s needs, circumstances, and 
preferences in different local contex ts, as well as  the factors limiting WEE, 
including cultural and social norms. This is critical in enabling policy and 
strategies which can address women’s needs, priorities , and preferences in 
the diverse local contexts in which they live.  
 Publish and share data. The pace of development of the digital economy 
means that adaptive policies and strategies are needed. Accurate and up -to-
date information is required to support evidence -based policymaking.  
In order to do this, capacity may need t o be built at the ASEAN and national levels 
for collecting and analyzing  sex-disaggregated data. The AEC is well positioned to 
play a coordinating role in this area. The gender mainstreaming division within the 
AIMD could take the lead on coordinating this  with the relevant sectoral bodies as 
well as statistical offices in the AMS. This office could:  
 Support member states in the collection, analysis, and tracking of sex -
disaggregated data and encourage them to include indicators of WEE into 
their existing d ata collection requirements.  
 Collect, analy ze, and track sex -disaggregated data in all relevant activities 
and include indicators of WEE in existing data collection requirements.  
 Support and conduct robust, reliable, accurate , and up -to-date research 
conce rning specific topics in WEE  (for example, use of social media or access 
to internet) to better understand the needs, circumstances, and preference of 
women and girls in different local contexts, and the factors limiting women ’s 
and girls’ economic empower ment (including cultural and social norms).  
 Publish sex -disaggregated data in a safe and secure manner and within the 
limits of data protection requirements  and privacy considerations.  
 Support efforts to ensure  that national and regional  WEE  data are coll ected in 
accordance with international guidelines.  
 Facilitate regular comparisons over time and between countries within 
ASEAN257.  
                                                           
257 Based on Broadband Commission Working Group on the Digital Gender Divide 2017a, 20.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  89  The indicators of WEE, based on the topics covered in this report, would include, but 
not be limited to:  
 Participation in econ omic activity —a range of indicators including employment 
status (formal and informal) , size of enterprise, enterprise status, sector, and 
access to social protection, among others ;   
 Access and use of mobile phones, internet, and social media ; and  
 Access  to and use of financial services, including digital financial services, 
other alternative financial sources , and the full range of financial services 
(credit, savings, insurance, etc.) . 
Examples  
 In 2011, the Solomon Islands set sex -disaggregated financia l inclusion objectives and targets as 
part of the country’s first financial inclusion strategy. The motivation for this was the perception 
that women are better household managers and evidence that women’s economic empowerment 
would benefit the whole famil y as well as the community.258 
 
Resources  
 A4AI (Alliance for Affordable Internet), the World Wide Web Foundation, the GSMA, and the 
Association for Progressive Communications collaborat ed to develop a set of baseline indicators 
on the gender digital divide: “Women and Internet Research” toolkit.259  
 ITU collects and publishes gender disaggregated data on internet penetration and internet users 
and estimates the gender gap in internet use.260 
7.3 Coordination and Collaboration Across Sectoral Bodies  
The barriers to gender equality and WEE are complex, varied , and interrelated. 
Addressing women’s equitable and full participation in the ASEAN digital economy 
requires a systemic approach that consider s all the factors that impact women’s 
economic status. Improving women’s standard of living and quality of life will require 
that all stakeholders work together. This is all the more important given the scale and 
complexity of the changes occurring with th e digital economy.  
The degree to which WEE requires the coordination and collaboration of different 
sectoral bodies is illustrated by this example. Women entrepreneurs who are 
engaged or wish to be engaged in e -commerce have multiple needs including: 
acce ss to digital finance, access to mobile phones and internet services, ICT skills,

  90  entrepreneurship skills, and access to both domestic and international markets. They 
also need reliable infrastructure to ensure good mobile  and internet coverage and 
they ne ed reliable and affordable logistics. No one sectoral body can address all 
these issues. Cooperation among  the sectoral bodies and ASEAN stakeholders will 
be critical to enable the development of coherent policies that can effectively 
improve the status of  women in ASEAN.  
Recommendations  
 A gender mainstreaming division within the AIMD  that has authority to advise 
on and track implementation of gender mainstreaming actions would be well 
positioned to convene dialogues and other opportunities that would promote 
coordination and collaboration across the individual sectoral bodies within t he 
AEC.  
 Additionally, this division  should have the authority to liaise with the relevant 
sectoral bodies in the other two ASEAN Communities , in order to promote 
joint activities and further coordination throughout ASEAN on WEE 
mainstreaming.  
 This divisio n could identify or develop and share tools, guidelines, case 
studies , and other materials which can support AEC efforts to promote WEE.  
7.4 Increase Women’s Representation in Policymaking Processes  
Throughout the CSAP , there are opportunities to include wome n’s voices in the 
formulation and implementation of AEC activities. The s trategic measures and action 
lines listed  in Table 7.1 are just three examples of a number of ways  women’s voices 
and perspectives can be included in the policy dialogue process.

UNCTAD has found that women have often been absent from policy dialogues 
related to ICT .263 To ensure that women participate fully and equally in the digital 
economy,  it will be critical that women, and their needs and perspectives, are 
represented in the policymaking process. A better awareness of women’s issues, 
whether they are related to displaced women workers, to micro entrepreneurs , or to 
women tech executives, w ill improve the policymaking process and result in more 
relevant and more effective policies.  
Depending on the policy and the types of women who will be affected by it, different 
kinds of women’s groups as well as individual representatives should be invo lved. 
Women’s organization s including w omen -based entrepreneur associations, women’s 
e-business associations, women’s civil society associations, women’s rights groups , 
and industry associations and trades unions that represent occupations or industries 
where women are predominant could be included in the dialogue process.  
Examples  
 As mentioned in Chapter 5, the Solomon Islands government conducted consultations with 
women -focused savings clubs and MFIs, a women’s business association and the Ministry of 
Women, to inform the national financial inclusion strategy.  
7.5 Explore the Use of Universal Service and Access Funds to 
Support WEE Initiatives  
Many of the proposed initiatives and interventions in this report, such as training and 
reskilling workers or providing digital literacy to women entrepreneurs, need to be 
scaled if they are to be effective. However, scaling up programs requires resources. 
Universal Service and Access Funds (USAF s) may provide part of the solution. 
USAFs are pool s of money finance d through mandatory contributions from 
telecommunications services providers. These funds were established to incentivize 
countries to expand internet services  to underserved areas and address gaps in 
access and use of the internet. In ASEAN, Indonesia and  Viet Nam  have used their 
funds to expand both public access to the internet and connectivity to rural villages 
and public institutions such as schools and libraries. However, not all countries in

263 Fredriksson, Torbjorn, Sicat, and Nguyen 2014, 24.  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  92  ASEAN have set up USAFs. The limited information that is av ailable on USAFs in 
ASEAN suggest s that there may be significant amounts of these monie s left 
unspent. For example, in Malaysia , spending has been below 20  percent  since 
2008.264 
It is important to consider a gender -sensitive  approach to the use of USAF fund s for 
a number of reasons, as mentioned above.  
Additionally, it is assumed that mobile data plans and content that is subsidized by 
mobile network operators are equally appealing to both men and women. However, 
research by the World Wide Web Foundation found that men are more likely than 
women to save money by purchasing service -specific data bundles and larger full -
cost data plans. The  foundation  suggest s that greater insight into women’s access 
and content needs would support mobile network operators t o offer plans tailored to 
women’s preferences, including more desirable content.265  
Universal Service and Access Funds could be used to support programs that expand 
access to the internet and to digital skills. For example, the funds could i nvest 50  
percent  of their money  in programs targeted to women and girls. This would require 
setting gender -specific disbursement targets and monitoring progress. It would also 
involve making the project design and implementation more gender -responsive by 
including women’s  perspectives in the development process. In addition to including 
representatives of the targeted women’s groups in initial studies, this can also be 
done by including women’s organizations in the process. Aligning USAF use to 
address women’s access to th e internet would further involve making sure USAF 
data related to  fund disbursements and project investments are disaggregated by 
gender and made openly available to the public.  
Internet access centers in ASEAN have reportedly struggled with sustainabilit y. The 
expansion of USAF funding for these centers in AMS beyond Indonesia and Viet 
Nam would help to bolster their sustainability. In addition, USAF funds could be used 
to support the creation of local content that is of more interest and relevance to 
wom en, as well as  to support training women in ICT skills and in ICT 
entrepreneurship. In Africa, USAFs are being used in Benin, Ghana, and Rwanda to 
address the gender digital divide in various ways.266  
Examples  
 In Rwanda, the funds are used to support the  Ms. Geek Africa program, a competition that 
seeks  to encourage girls to participate in STEM fields. Winners receive prizes of cash and 
equipment plus training and mentorship.  
 In Ghana, the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications, used the USAF  to 
support  ICT skills training  for hairdressers and other services industry workers. Funds were

  95 8 SUMMARY   
This report has identified 26 action lines within the AEC CSAP that have the 
potential to mainstream women’s economic empowerment within the AEC’s 
activities. The report categorized these action lines depending on whether they affect 
women entrepreneurs or women workers or whether they are cross -cutting. While 
the proceeding chapters provide many recommendations for policies, policy 
frameworks , and activities,  a few stand out as having the capabili ty to have a 
significant, positive impact on mainstreaming WEE within ASEAN.   
The priority recommendations are for both : (1) activities and policies to be 
undertaken within the AEC or preferably ASEC ; and (2) activities and policies  those 
that would be conducted across the region or with the AMS, i.e., external to ASEC. 
The recommendations internal to the AEC  are cross -cutting actions and include:  
 Mainstream g ender across the AEC pillar  by embedding gender impact 
analysis in the des ign, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of all 
activities  
 Collect, analy ze, and track sex-disaggregated data  
 Coordinat e and collaborat e across sectoral bodies and across pillars within 
ASEC  
The recommendations external to the AEC  pillar  include:  
 Digital literacy and financial literacy —look for opportunities to combine them 
when possible  
 Digital/biometric national identification cards  
 Expanded and improved women -friendly tele center s. 
8.1 Institutionalize Gender Mainstreaming  across the AEC  
This recomme ndation is listed first because without it, it will be difficult for the AEC 
to make progress on gender mainstreaming in a comprehensive and consistent way 
across all sectoral bodies. The process of gender mainstreaming within the AEC 
should start with an internal capacity -building effort on gender sensitization. The 
objective should be to build the knowledge  and skills required to mainstream gender 
in the work of the AEC and to develop a shared vision and common language 
around women’s economic empowerment. The process of mainstreaming women’s 
economic empowerment would be furthered by creating an independent division 
within the AIMD tasked with building capacity and tracking progress, among other 
things. To be effective, the gender mainstreaming effort will require dedicated 
resources , in addition to ongoing attention and support from top leaders. It will also 
require a robust monitoring and evaluation component. The experience with gender 
mainstreaming within the Philippines government , based on the Magna Carta of 
Women, is a good model that the AEC could draw on (see the examples discussion 
in section 7.1 for mor e details).  WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  96   
8.2 Collect, Analyze, and Track Sex-disaggregated Data 
The lack of data on  different aspects  of women’s economic status is a major barrier 
to developing and refining effective policies to promote WEE. The need for data on 
women’s economic participation is particularly relevant as their opportunities and 
constraints within the economy are evolving quickly with the digital economy. This is 
particularly apparent with respect to women in certain sectors of the workforce and 
those who are involved in e -commerce.  
In the previous chapter, several recommendations were made for collecting sex-
disaggregated data and improving the capacity within ASEAN to do this. Within the 
AEC, priority should be put on developi ng a framework for collection, analyzing, 
tracking , and reporting sex -disaggregated data for all relevant AEC activities. 
Indicators of WEE should be incorporated in all existing data collection efforts at the 
AEC. To support the AMS in incorporating sex -disaggregated indicators and WEE 
indicators in their data collection efforts, the AEC is well -placed to play a capacity 
building role and to provide guidance on international standards in indicator design 
and data collection ( see the Gender Disaggregated Data section in Chapter 7 for 
more d etails).  
At the international level, the AEC could work with multilateral  and bilateral agencies 
as well as  other international actors to coordinate approaches to collecting sex -
disaggregated data. The objective would be to ensure consistent and standard data 
collection approaches that would result in complete data sets, across the ASEAN 
member states, that could be used by ASEAN for policymaking purposes.  
In addition to collecting data, the AEC can set targets or provide guidelines for 
targets  concerning  the level of female inclusion across many dimensions  such as  
financial inclusion, and financial and digital literacy.  
8.3 Coordinate and Collaborate across Sectoral Bodies and across 
Pillars  
The previous  chapter touched on how important coordination and collaboration 
across the AEC sectoral bodies and with the other two pillars is , given the complexity 
of changes occurring with the digital economy. The need for a holistic approach to 
women’s economic empo werment reinforces this need for coordination and 
collaboration. There are already indications within the CSAP of sectoral bodies 
working together to achieve specific strategic measures , but there is scope for 
broader coordination. One area in which severa l sectoral bodies could collaborate is 
on forward -thinking efforts. An example is the action line on promot ing dialogue and 
induc ing awareness on global megatrends and emerging trade -related issues in 
ASEAN. Within this a focus on the future of the workforce, including women workers 
is an area that can use coordinated attention. By positioning a gender WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  97  mainstreaming division within AIMD it is possible that cross -sectoral collaboration 
could be reviewed by an apex group under the Foreign Ministers.  
8.4 Promote Digital Literacy  
Digital literacy is a prerequisite for participating in the digital economy. Among other 
things, digital literacy is increasingly required for access to financial se rvices. 
Therefore, promotion of digital literacy for all ASEAN citizens needs to be a top 
priority of the AEC to ensure equitable and inclusive development.  
Several recommendations were made for AEC activities that would promote digital 
literacy in the re gion (see section on  digital literacy as a prerequisite for promoting 
digital trade  in Chapter 4). These include: invest ing in AMS capacity building 
initiatives ; encourag ing AMS to ensure digital literacy and capacity -building initiatives 
consider women’s needs ; suppor ting efforts to provide women with opportunities to 
develop their digital skills through different channels ; supporting steps to make 
online content and service s more accessible to women with limited literacy ; providing 
guidance on minimum standards for the content of digital literacy curricula ; 
promot ing female role models as internet users ; and partnering with existing 
programs that promote women’s digital lite racy.  
8.5 Support Expanded and Improved Women -friendly Internet 
Access Center s 
Supporting women -friendly tele center s (i.e., internet access centers)  is a priority 
because it is a channel for delivering digital literacy and other activities addressed in 
this paper. As noted earlier, women may be uncomfortable entering or using internet 
access center s for a variety of reasons. These centers need to beco me more 
attractive to women to more effectively benefit them . Women -only internet access 
center s may be the best strategy in some locations. In others, capacity building in 
gender sensitization for tele center  staff may be sufficient if combined with tracki ng 
usage by gender.  
At the regional level, the AEC can further the promot ion of w omen -friendly internet 
access center s at a national level by supporting or conducting region -wide research 
to better understand the needs and preferences for internet access center s by 
different segments of women including women entrepreneurs and workers.  
8.6 Promote a Proactive and Tailored Approach to Women’s 
Financial Inclusion through the Financial Inclusion Strategy  
There is a sizeable gap in MSME financing in ASEAN that is particularly wide for the 
larger micro and small enterprise  categories and therefore has disproportionate 
effects on women . Addressing female entrepreneurs ’ need for credit requires 
alleviating barriers on the demand, supply , and regulatory sides. ASEAN can best 
promote women’s financial inclusion by taking actions that improve the enabling and WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
  98  regulatory environment. These actions could be promoted by supporting the AMS , or 
ASEAN could take actions to promote the harmonizatio n of financial inclusion 
regulations across the region. While several recommendations were outlined in 
Chapter 5, the following should be prioritized: provide guidance to AMS to support 
them in assessing any unintended regulatory impacts that hinder women’ s financial 
services; feed the results into the financial inclusion strategy development process; 
reform legal and regulatory frameworks that hinder the financial inclusion of women; 
and address and harmonize the development of financial infrastructure suc h as 
credit bureaus.  These actions would go far to assist women in accessing existing 
financial services.  
With respect to digital financial services, ASEAN should assess the benefits that 
could be experienced from using unique, biometric identification th roughout the 
region. This would include following the experience of the Aadha ar program in India  
for lessons to be learned . It is tempting to recommend that all adults in ASEAN be 
provided with biometric identification . It is likely that these forms of ide ntification will 
be a necessity for participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, they could level 
the playing field for women for accessing digital financial services , e-government , 
and other aspects of the digital economy . However, it is unclear whe ther there is 
sufficient need for these IDs at this time.

  141 APPENDIX D. SUMMARY OF POLICY REC OMMENDATIONS 
PROVIDED BY STRENGTHENING WOMEN’ S 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ASEAN: TOWARDS INCRE ASING 
WOMEN’S PARTICIPATIO N IN ECONOMIC ACTIVI TY  
The OECD/ASEAN Coordination Committee on MSMEs report provided a 
comprehensive set of policy and policy action recommendations for supporting 
women’s entrepreneurship development across the region. These policies are 
primarily targeted for implementation at the national level. We list them here for easy 
reference.  
Polic y improvement :  
 Strengthen the emphasis on/ inclusion of WED [women’s enterprise 
development] in the ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for SME Development, 
placing more emphasis on addressing the needs of women entrepreneurs 
across all five strategic goals of th e plan.  
 Improve the level of gender inclusiveness in national MSME development 
strategies, and their cognisance of the potential economic gains from 
ensuring greater participation of women in their various support programmes 
and services. Ensure alignment  of SME policies and measures with the 
relevant strategic priorities laid out in the national women’s 
empowerment/gender equality strategy and action plan.  
 Ensure alignment of MSME policies and measures with the relevant strategic 
priorities laid out in t he national women’s empowerment/gender equality 
strategy and action plan. This may require closer linkages between the 
ministries responsible for women’s affairs and the ministries responsible for 
MSME development and more effective implementation of gende r 
mainstreaming in MSME policies and measures.  
 Develop systems for collection and comprehensive reporting of sex 
disaggregated data on MSME ownership, including a gender analysis of the 
characteristics of MSMEs and their performance, in order to better in form 
policy development (Cambodia is a good model to examine, especially its 
comprehensive gender analysis of the 2011 Economic Census).  
 Commission studies on the barriers to WED (country -level), including on the 
challenges women entrepreneurs face in sta rting, managing and growing a 
business, with a view to assessing the extent to which these barriers affect 
different groups of women entrepreneurs and how these are being addressed 
through remedial measures. The purpose is to better inform the development 
of appropriate policies, measures, and programme interventions.  
 Appoint an inter -ministerial committee, with private sector representation, to 
oversee the production of a national WED strategy to call a higher level 
attention to the specific quantitative targets, policies and programmes 
essential for increasing and strengthening women entrepreneurs and women -WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
 142 owned enterprises in the country. As the foundation for development of the 
strategy/action plan, conduct an assessment review of the framework 
conditi ons and support environment for WED in the country (i.e. a national 
WED assessment study).  
Enhancing the institutional structure for WED  
 Appoint an advisory committee or establish a mechanism on women’s 
entrepreneurship development, such as a Women’s Business Council, to 
advise the government on appropriate policy directions.  
 Establish a clear focal point for WED inside government to impro ve the 
leadership and co -ordination of WED policies and programmes across 
relevant ministries and agencies and promote joint and complementary 
actions in support of WED. Establish WED focal points or desks in the 
economic ministries, including in the minis try responsible for MSMEs.  
 Establish a network of women’s enterprise centres in the country with a view 
to providing business development support to women entrepreneurs and 
meeting their needs in a women -friendly environment.  
 Strengthen the role of women  entrepreneurs in business and industry 
associations by encouraging chambers of commerce and SME associations 
to establish businesswomen committees or women entrepreneur working 
groups, such as in the examples in Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam .  
 Establish  formal mechanisms for conducting policy dialogue with women 
entrepreneurs and their representative organisations and mainstreaming their 
concerns and issues; ensure that women entrepreneurs are represented in 
public private policy dialogue fora and consul ted on legislative and policy 
reforms.  
Policy implications  
For countries that have not already done so, a comprehensive set of policies for 
strengthening enterprise support programmes for women entrepreneurs is derived 
below for consideration by policymak ers in Southeast Asian countries:  
Improve women entrepreneurs’ access to financing   
 Raise the ceiling on micro -credit loans so women entrepreneurs have more 
room to access microfinance to expand their microenterprises.   
 Implement programmes that help transition women micro entrepreneurs from 
micro -credit to bank financing as they grow their businesses.   
 Strengthen policy actions to improve women entrepreneurs’ access to bank 
financing, such as by issuing instructions to banks to allocate a certain 
percentage of their loan portfolio to women -owned SMEs; providing gender -
sensitivity training to bank managers and credit officers and orientation on the 
positive gains from lending to women entrepreneurs; offering technical 
assistance in designing products and services to better meet the needs of WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
 143 women, and/or negotiating low interest credit lines for relending to women -
owned enterprises.   
 Consider making special guarantee provisions for women -owned MSMEs in 
government -backed S ME credit guarantee schemes and designing guarantee 
products especially for women’s SMEs. As a foundation for this, identify the 
gender gap in participation levels of women in existing credit guarantee funds 
by collecting sex -disaggregated data on the SME guarantee clients.   
 Partner with women’s organisations and training institutes to deliver financial 
literacy training to aspiring and existing women entrepreneurs.  
Facilitate better access of women entrepreneurs to BDS services   
 Establish women’s enterp rise centres as entry points for women to access a 
range of business support services.   
 In designing entrepreneurial skills training programmes, consider the targeting 
of different market segments of women entrepreneurs (e.g. young educated 
women, disadva ntaged rural women, homemakers, etc.). Ensure young 
women have equal opportunity to participate in Start -up Weekends and other 
entrepreneurship challenge competitions.   
 Integrate entrepreneurial skills training with delivery of vocational and 
technical sk ills training programmes to women.   
 Develop more regularised training opportunities for women entrepreneurs to 
improve their management skills. Focus more of this training on helping 
women develop growth plans/strategies for their businesses.   
 Reach wome n entrepreneurs in rural areas with BDS services, perhaps 
through mobile delivery. (The village business incubation programme in 
Jordan could be another example to follow.)  
 Provide gender -sensitivity training to counsellors and advisors in government -
supp orted SME support centres to increase the level of gender awareness in 
dealing with women clients; provide technical assistance in modifying the 
content, delivery, and facilitation approach to be more gender -responsive.   
 Promote gender diversity in govern ment -funded and sponsored mixed 
incubator and accelerator programmes to bridge the gender gap in access to 
the supports available in these facilities to help businesses grow and create 
jobs. Funding for incubation and acceleration activities (in cases wher e this 
exists) could be tied to the gender diversity approaches and outcomes 
realised by these incubators and accelerators. In some cases, it may be 
advisable to introduce women -focused business incubators to help women 
entrepreneurs with high -potential bu siness ideas scale -up their businesses.   
 Scale up existing mentoring schemes (training women as mentors, 
matchmaking of women entrepreneurs with the mentors).   
 Ensure that the recently announced ASEAN Mentors -Entrepreneurs Network 
(AMEN) of the ASEAN BAC  is inclusive of women mentors and that every WOMEN’S  ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT  IN THE  DIGITAL  ECONOMY  
 144 effort is made to create awareness among women entrepreneurs of the 
service and to engage their participation in the offer of mentoring matches.  
Improve access to markets for women -owned enterprises   
 Develop export -readiness programmes targeting women entrepreneurs, 
learning from the models in Malaysia and the Philippines, but with a view to 
scaling them to build the export capacity of a larger number of women 
entrepreneurs.   
 Seek guidance from the UN International Trade Centre on good practices in 
gender -responsive public procurement policies, regulations and procedures 
with a view to increasing the participation of women -owned SMEs in public 
procurement offers.   
 Develop and roll-out supplier development programmes for women -owned 
MSMEs, which could be accelerated in ASEAN countries with support from 
governments and donor organisations.   
 Develop programmes that enable women -owned MSMEs to take advantage 
of corporate supplier diversity policies and programmes.  
Develop initiatives to build the ICT skills and capacity of women entrepreneurs   
 Develop dedicated programmes to build and strengthen the ICT skills and 
capabilities of women entrepreneurs, including the application of ICT-enabled 
technologies to improve their efficiency and broaden their market access.   
 Strengthen efforts to ensure women are fully integrated in government -
supported programmes and initiatives aiming to facilitate ICT -based start -ups.  
 Provide support to  women entrepreneurs’ association in their efforts to 
support women entrepreneurs is using ICTs to improve the performance of 
their enterprises.   
 Enter into discussions with the United Nations Asian and Pacific Training 
Centre for Information and Communic ation Technology for Development 
(UNAPCICT) to implement the “Women ICT Frontier Initiative” (WIFI) 
programme in the country as a vehicle for building the ICT capacity of women 
entrepreneurs. ” 268

WOMEN’S ECONOMIC EMP OWERMENT (WEE) IN AS EAN  
 
The Action Agenda aims to mainstream Women’s Economic Empowerment through 
innovation, trade and inclusive business, and human capital development by 
encouraging each A SEAN Member State to support the following actions:269 
1) ADOPT CONCRETE AND MEASURABLE ACTIONS to address the barriers 
that impede maximizing women’s full economic potential in the areas of: finance, 
information access, and markets; human capital developmen t and leadership; and 
innovation and technology;  
2) PROMOTE women’s participation and skills development in science, 
technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (S.T.E.A.M.), including information 
and communication technologies (ICT) by providing, for ex ample, incentives for 
women innovators, allocating more foreign investments in science research institutes 
and foundations, and by creating an enabling environment for ICT -empowerment of 
women entrepreneurs and to promote ICT as enabling tools for the adva ncement of 
women and their economic empowerment;  
3) INVEST in programs which provide enabling environments for women micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to prosper through ease of doing business 
initiatives, incentives and favourable tax regulation s, helping them participate in 
inclusive and innovative businesses whether as consumer, seller, supplier, 
distributor, and worker, and by addressing the constraints that limit their integration 
in the international markets and global value chains (GVCs);  
4) INCREASE women’s representation and leadership in the workforce at the 
executive and managerial positions by intensifying human capital development and 
capacity building programs that empower women to bear equal roles in all sectors as 
men do and, enhanc e gender equality policies and strategies to close the gender 
pay gap;  
5) ENCOURAGE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR COLLABORATION through 
the ASEAN BAC and AWEN for advocacy, networking, and outreach purposes to 
create more opportunities for women in business; A WEN shall echo the voices of 
women MSMEs as its representative in the ACW under ASCC and in the ACCMSME 
under AEC; and  
6) CONSIDER organizing an annual ASEAN Women’s Business Conference led 
by AWEN in coordination with other relevant sectoral bodies under the ASCC and 
the AEC where ASEAN Member States’ public and private sector representatives,
