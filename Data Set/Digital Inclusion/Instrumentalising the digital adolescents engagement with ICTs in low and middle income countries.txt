Instrumentalising the digital: adolescents ’engagement with ICTs
in low- and middle-income countries
Shakuntala Banaji, Sonia Livingstone, Anulekha Nandi and Mariya Stoilova
ABSTRACT
In development agendas regarding children in low-income communities,
both older and emerging media are typically ignored or assumed to
have beneficial powers that will redress social and gender inequality.
This article builds on a recent rapid evidence review on adolescents ’
digital media use and development interventions in low- and middle-
income countries to examine the contexts of children and adolescents ’
access to, and uses of, information and communication technology(ICT).Noting that only a handful of studies heed the significance of social
class and gender as major axes of inequality for adolescents, the article
scrutinises the gap between the rhetoric of ICT-based empowermentand the realities of ICT-based practice. It calls for a radical rethinking of
childhood and development in light of the actual experiences, struggles,
and contexts.

Introduction
The communication strategies which accompanied modernisation interventions in the field of devel-
opment from the 1940s onwards were top-down, decontextualised, and technologically determinist.
One of the assumptions on which they were premised was that dissemination of information alonecan lead to substantial change and, more specifically, that technical innovation can radically trans-
form remote rural communities in developing nations by pulling them towards Western, urbanised
modernity, and comparable economic prosperity (Manyozo 2012 ). When large-scale, expensive
development interventions consistently failed to provide these intended results, instead exacer-
bating economic and social inequalities in their target areas, the premise and foundation of their
design and implementation were questioned (Escobar 2011 ; Friere 1978 ; Melkote and Steeves
2001 ). While some critiques of modernisation rationales and practices for using mass media such
as television have gained purchase among media and development practitioners, resulting in theemergence of more participatory approaches (Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda 2014 ), many of the
assumptions of the modernisation paradigm persist.
In relation to children and young people, expectations regarding the promise of ICTs are often at
their highest, building on the hugely appealing rhetoric of the “digital native ”(Banaji 2011 ; Brown
and Czerniewicz 2010 ). Many policymakers and practitioners hope that the proliferation of ICTs
and digital media in developing countries can expand the participatory potential of communicationfor development (C4D) programming. But others argue that the rhetoric around ICTs has provided anew and alluring guise for technocentric modernisation thinking in development (Mazzarella 2010 )
and is becoming ever more entrenched as the notion of a “digital imaginary ”(Third and Collin 2016 )
gains purchase. Given this contested context, this article addresses two overarching questions:
(1) What does the available evidence reveal about adolescents ’access, use, and everyday contact
with media and digital technologies in low- and middle-income countries, including about devel-
opment programmes ’use of digital media to target adolescents?
(2) Does the available evidence also indicate how problematic practices and modernising assump-
tions of development projects using digital media with adolescents in low- and middle-incomecountries could be addressed and transformed?
These questions concern the intersections among several domains of knowledge –ICTs and digital
media, and adolescence (both domains heavily led by research in the Global North), and C4D and
ICT4D programmatic interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Each is contested,
even with regard to terminology. In this article, we identify the central terms, debates, and findingsthat have shaped these fields in the past decade, and examine the gaps between what is known
about adolescents ’everyday media/digital usage in LMIC contexts and the messy realities of devel-
opment interventions using ICTs with adolescents.
To answer our research questions, we draw on a rapid evidence review of the literature on ado-
lescence, media use, ICTs, and C4D interventions in a range of low- and middle-income countries (see
Livingstone et al. in press ) undertaken as a part of the Overseas Development Institute ’s longitudinal
research project Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE). We include material from sub-DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 433Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with some insights from
Latin America and East/South East Asia. The experience of undertaking this review in itselfbrought us face to face with intellectual and political tensions between the perspectives of scholars
and practitioners familiar, on the one hand, with international development discourses or, on the
other hand, with digital media and ICTs or, again, with childhood and adolescence.
Methodology
We searched databases for research published from 2006 to 2016. The original focus was on girlsaged 10– 14, but this was widened to include girls and boys aged 6 –18 when initial searching revealed
a paucity of research on young girls and ICTs. For reasons of quality control, priority was given to
research published in peer-reviewed journal but, recognising that much of the research in this
field derives from NGOs, government reports, and industry sources, we also included non-peerreviewed “grey literature ”and unpublished reports.
Our search terms were: (1) internet OR online OR digital OR “mobile phone ”OR app OR comput* OR
“cell phone ”OR ICT OR “social networking ”OR platform OR broadband OR connect* AND (2) child* OR
young OR youth OR teenage* OR adolescen* OR minor OR kid OR girl OR boy OR student AND (3)
“developing countr* ”OR “low and middle income countr* ”OR “low income countr* ”OR “middle
income countr* ”OR Africa OR Asia OR MENA OR “Middle East and North Africa ”OR“Middle East ”OR
“North Africa ”. These were tested on pre-identified databases, with the results limited to English and
to the period 2006 –16. This resulted in a total of 5,181 studies, which was supplemented by consulting
international experts (of whom 20 replied), as shown in Table 1 . The total of 5,181 studies represents the
cumulative total of hits on each database prior to the exclusion of duplicates. Some expert recommen-dations were also captured in the database searches. The overlap and duplicates between the expert
recommendations and database searches were removed. The 5,181 studies were then screened on thebasis of titles and abstracts to judge their relevance to the inclusion criteria about children, media, tech-
nologies, development and LMICs, which led to a streamlined batch of 481 studies. The majority of the
results that were excluded pertained entirely to adults or university students over the age of 18. This canbe explained by the different definitions of adolescence in different countries. Despite the filters and
the search terms, many results still pertained to countries in the Global North; some of these results
were retained where they provided useful insights on the digital media uses of adolescents from mar-ginalised populations in those countries, and could thereby provide an indication of access and uses
and practices of digital media of adolescents from underserved communities. The 481 studies were
screened down to 188 studies by reviewing the sections on methodology and study design of eachfull text article in order to check their compatibility with the inclusion criteria.
We included a few studies from high-income countries (HICs) on the grounds that they captured
transnational phenomena or relevant conditions for digital media use in LMICs. We read and codedfull texts of these 188 studies according to: type of study; type of data; design of evaluative studies;
geographical distribution; and income classifications (as applied by DFID UK). We coded each study
thematically in terms of a focus on digital access, skills and practices, opportunities, online risks andmediation (by parents, educators, and peers). Finally, we selected the 62 studies employing robust

template that identified the research questions, place/geographical location, method (includingsample and age group), claims/findings, study evaluation, and a critical and discursive comment
on epistemology, framing of ICTs, and adolescence. We complemented the resulting insights with
selected case studies of ICT-related programme interventions targeted at the capability developmentof children in LMICs.
We note, in reflecting on this process, that it was disappointing to find so little empirical research on
children and adolescents ’experiences of ICTs in LMICs, given the optimistic hyperbole in many inter-
national policy statements regarding their being supposedly at the forefront of adoption and creative
appropriation. It was also disappointing to find ourselves documenting –as below –the limitations in
conception, design, and quality of the available research far more often than we could celebrate inspir-
ing studies or programmes with insightful implications for future research and good practice. Despite
the wealth of sophisticated literature on children in education studies and childhood studies (see
Ennew 2003 ;K a t z 2004 ;S e n 2014 ), we suspect this situation reflects the relative invisibility of children ’s
experiences for development researchers and policymakers, it being easier to impose adult-centric
assumptions than to engage seriously with children themselves. It may also reflect the sense,
endemic in the study of ICTs in development, that technology and, indeed, children ’s uses of it, is chan-
ging too fast for in-depth investigation or, especially, longer-term evaluation of interventions. Last, it
was often the case that, although a study was included in our review for its relevance to ICTs, for
the researchers or practitioners involved, the ICTs were often black-boxed as merely a convenientand up-to-date means of distributing resources, so that the specific relation between children ’s litera-
cies-in-context and the affordances of the ICTs deployed would go unnoticed.
Unseen children: messy realities beyond the official statistics
Given that children (up to 18 years old) comprise one third of the population in “less developed ”
countries (UN 2015 ), it is surprising –but indicative of children ’s low status –that neither the Inter-
national Telecommunications Union nor any other source (e.g. UNICEF) is able to document children ’s
internet access in terms of official statistics for more than a handful of countries. Best available esti-mates suggest that children are also around one third of the world ’s internet users (Livingstone, Carr,
and Byrne 2015 ), going online roughly in the same proportion as adults (albeit fewer when very
young and up to twice as much as adults when adolescent (ITU 2013 )). This makes it impossible to
break down the category of “children ”in terms of gender, age, household income, or any other
factor, although for adults (often misleadingly described as “individuals ”or“the population ”)
plenty of sources document persistent forms of inequality within as well as between countries(e.g. GSMA 2016a ; ITU 2016 ; World Bank 2016 ). It is also, of course, difficult to break down the cat-
egory of ICTs using official statistics –ICTs take different forms, including online, networked,
mobile and also more established media (radio, television, film, press, and so on, all of which areincreasingly accessible via online platforms); “online ”itself includes diverse internet services includ-
ing information, gaming, social media, streaming, and other services.
But even if the statistics were available, qualitative research reveals the many reasons why bald
percentages should be scrutinised, qualified, and contextualised. It charts the manifold ways in
which access and use depend on resolving a host of challenges associated with electricity, connec-
tivity, cost, digital skills, social acceptability, spatial privacy, and adult permission at the communityand individual levels, as well as with commercial viability, investment, and government regulation
at the level of the state or region (Chigona, Kamkwenda, and Manjoo 2008 ; Hilbert 2010 ). For
many children, access is absent, limited, sporadic, or otherwise problematic, and it varies by age,
gender, socio-economic status, caste, and other important sources of inequality (Banaji 2015 ,2017 ;
Bosch 2008 ).
For example, in their sizeable multi-method study of 9- to 18-year-olds ’mobile phone use in
Ghana, Malawi, and South Africa, Porter et al. ( 2012 ) found that mobile phone ownership/usageDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 435varies according to the income level of each country, with Malawi scoring the lowest, followed by
Ghana, then South Africa. There is the same pattern across locations in each country, with theremote rural being the lowest. Distinctively, certainly by comparison with children ’s experiences in
much of the Global North:
“many young people across Africa obtain work and live off resources provided by social contacts: kin and friend-
ship networks are crucial in this respect …This requires careful nurturing of social relationships over time and
mobile phone contact is extremely valuable. ”(Porter et al. 2012 , 149)
Porter et al. ’sﬁndings caution against the assumption of a linear progression between the spread of
ICTs and mobile devices across the globe and access as optimistically assumed in industry and policyreports (e.g. GSMA 2016a ,2016b ). They demand recognition of the crucial distinction –ever less
meaningful in the Global North –between access and use. In their research, most young people
did not own personal phones and so had to ask for or borrow them, most commonly from afamily member, with phone ownership sometimes facilitated as a gift from urban-based family
members. But such phone ownership can be transient, since young people ’s phones are also sold
to obtain daily essentials when in need. Moreover, borrowing is inﬂ ected by family status (e.g.
foster status), household resources and livelihood patterns, and intergenerational relationships. Forexample, restrictions on borrowing are widely reported in Ghana and Malawi (Porter et al. 2012 )
and also in India (Banaji 2017 ).
Even when access is feasible, care should be taken in presuming use. In their small-scale compari-
son of two cases with South African youth –one with low-income older urban teens, and one with
younger boys (11 –13) from an affluent suburb –Walton and Pallitt ( 2012 ) provide a nuanced sense of
digital media in everyday life. For the poorer adolescents, it emerged that poverty constrains mediause in key ways. One boy listened to his neighbour ’s music through the wall, and he rationed daily
game playing to 15 minutes to save his phone battery (as he pays to charge it). It seems, too, that he
only used some phone functions, again, to save money. Another boy used such an old phone that his
peers ridiculed him, so he tried to use it in ways that his friends wouldn ’t notice (e.g. on silent/vibrate)
to avoid being shamed. Furthermore, the boys in this study selected their games because they were
free or very cheap, and they were ingenious in locating free/cheap downloads and in avoiding com-
mercial tactics to “steal ”their prepaid airtime. The older teenage girls, too, had developed strategies
to manage their stringent lack of resources –for instance, deleting their games to make phone space
for messages from boyfriends (saved to cherish intimate memories). Between the older boys and
girls, a local instant messenger app permitted playful and flirtatious interactions, offering a way toshow off by competing to collect contacts. Walton and Pallitt observe that “gaming is a popular
local appropriation of mobile phones …Unlike expensive console games, they do not require specialised
hardware or negotiations with other household members ”(2012 , 353). Significantly, this led them to
explore how “game literacy ”permits young people to articulate and re-appropriate their lived experi-
ences of gender, class, and ethnicity with energy and creativity (although the consequence is thereproduction of existing inequalities –for example, boys using gaming to reassert the value of mascu-
line subcultures and the exclusion of girls from this).
Good intentions backfire: struggles to deploy ICT to overcome inequality
Particularly problematic, as amply illustrated in our corpus of research studies, are those policy andprogrammatic interventions which focus on access alone as the “solution ”to inequality without due
attention to context and consequences, intended and unintended. For example, Hansen et al. ( 2012 )
examined whether provision of a laptop for educational purposes enabled the cognitive develop-ment of 10- to 15-year-olds in Ethiopia, comparing them after six months of use to children
without such provision. Perhaps surprisingly, “there were no systematic increases in student perform-
ance due to laptop use ”(993). But this overall finding was, on more detailed examination, qualified
by finding that use of laptops did benefit the performance of students –on measures of abstract436 S. BANAJI ET AL.reasoning –in higher grades but not in lower ones, possibly because the older children used the
laptops more, and for more activities. In other words, providing access without attention to pre-exist-
ing skills and social contexts can result in exacerbating rather than ameliorating inequality.
While this problem is known in ICT4D circles, the troubling case of One Laptop per Child being
the most telling instance (James 2010), recent literature remains replete with studies that see-
mingly discover anew that merely providing access is unlikely to deliver intended goals; quite
the contrary. A benign interpretation suggests tha t this reflects insufficient knowledge-sharing
among the different expert fields that infor m intervention programmes, the dual myths of
potent new technologies and digitally savvy children holding sway for many even when evidencecontradicts them. A less benign interpretation points to the political and economic interests behind
interventions, focused on the highly visible and newsworthy distribution of expensive and shiny
technologies while under-investing in much-ne eded accompanying programmes for literacy and
training and, saliently, failing to consult the views of the supposed beneficiaries, especially whenthese are “merely ”children.
Sometimes it simply seems beyond the scope of a study to examine why a well-intended interven-
tion fails. For instance, consider Pfeiffer et al. ’s(2014 , 183) puzzlement when providing 15- to 19-year-
olds in urban Tanzania with health information. They found that even though the adolescents weremedia-savvy:
“almost none of [them] made use of sexual and reproductive health information on the sites targeted at youth.
Instead, they went into search engines such as Google, where they entered keywords and screened the websites
that came up. ”
A similar instance is Nwalo and Anasi ’s(2012 , 93) study of adolescent girls ’access to, and use of,
reproductive health information in Nigeria: they found that “interpersonal means of communication
and mass media were the sources through which the respondents accessed reproductive health infor-
mation ”, notwithstanding the availability of more reliable, in-depth, and con ﬁdential information
online. While these studies presumed that digitally savvy young people would bene ﬁt if resources
were simply provided, for Gouws ( 2014 ), Banaji ( 2011 ), and Brown and Czerniewicz ( 2010 ), the
digital native discourse has more pernicious consequences in compounding existing inequalities
by directing learning resources uncritically towards those who are already at home in digital environ-
ments even though they are often already privileged. This is not to argue against the importance and
value of support for digital resources and skills, but rather to urge attention to empirical research on
how such resources and skills are distributed unequally and, then, to ask critical questions aboutwhich should be fostered, with whom, and to further which (or whose) goals.
To counter the problematic emphasis on access alone, Larghi et al. ( 2015 ) frame their study of
Argentinian teenagers in terms of the digital divide, distinguishing the first-order digital divide (inaccess to hardware and connectivity as a function of age, gender, and social class), the second-
order digital divide (in digital media appropriation within families and the development of digital
skills and literacies), and the third-order digital divide (in terms of actual practices of use and,thereby, the benefits that might accrue). In the Global North, attention to the first-order divide is
fading as access becomes taken for granted, although the importance of the second and third-
order divides remains important. In the Global South, all three are important, demanding distinctbut interrelated research on access, social contexts, and consequences of use.
But addressing such challenges demands nuanced and contextualised research. For instance,
Lemphane and Prinsloo ’s(2014 , 738) ethnographic comparison of the digital literacy practices of
8- to 14-year-olds living in wealthy (white) and poor (black, “slum ”) households outside Cape
Town, South Africa acknowledged the ways in which these resources have become part of a rhetoricof progress and modernity in order to grasp how and why provision of digital tools entrenched ratherthan overcame social and economic inequalities:
“digital media [were] at least partially complicit in a ‘widening of the gap ’to the extent that the differential uses
and availability of resources across social classes produce different imaginings of self, social ambitions andDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 437investments, and differing ways with social semiotics. Such differences translate into and contribute to the main-
tenance of social inequalities in school settings that coincide with language and social class divides. ”
In short, in the context of South Africa, where English is the language of a privileged white elite,
merely going online was implicated in reinforcing hierarchies of power:
“While the [privileged] Bolton children are learning to think of themselves as legitimate participants in local,
online, globally connected middle-class English language-based culture, the [poor] Mahlale children are acquiring
linguistic resources that are localised, indexical of their sub-elite status and not associated with success in school-
ing.”(Lemphane and Prinsloo 2014 , 750)
Lemphane and Prinsloo ( 2014 ) are critical of calls for digital out-of-school interventions that use
mobile phones or multiplayer games but pay little attention to the way in which limited access
and unsympathetic surroundings (lack of food, time, parents with little interest in digital media)
can frame and alter poor, non-white children ’s experiences of pleasure and learning online. As one
of the few studies designed to examine these differences in qualitative and comparative ways, Lem-
phane and Prinsloo ’s work suggests a template for other future studies in different locales. In other
words, if insights from wealthy homes are to be applied in less privileged contexts, considerable cri-ticality and adaptation will be vital.
Countering “adultism ”: the importance of child-centred, contextualised, and
participatory approaches
InGirls Speak Out , based on a “fast-talk ”process with 33 girls aged 12 –18 from 13 countries in Asia,
West Africa, and Latin America across a mix of rural and urban locations, de Pauw ( 2011 ; see also
Raftree and Bachan 2013 ) found that, on the one hand, the girls faced substantial problems (including
teen pregnancy, child labour, health risks, poor sanitation, and sexual violence), but they nonethelesshave “big dreams for their future careers ”and “see education as the foundation for their success in life ”.
Asked specifically about ICTs, they were eloquent about both the difficulties of access (adding new
insights on, for instance, how domestic chores took up all their time, and how boys edged them away
from the computers in school, while cyber-cafés could be a site of sexual harassment) and also theopportunities they hope for. They talked about valuing ICT to research issues they care about, includ-
ing their rights, community development, physical and mental health information, economic oppor-
tunities, news, gaining job skills, or finding work. They wanted to share experiences, discuss problemsor use ICTs for activities related to awareness-raising, campaigning, civic engagement, and student
mobilisation.
Girls ’proposed solutions to increasing their access to ICT are also noteworthy –they highlighted
the need to address gender-based inequalities, injustice and stereotypes, both in general and inrelation to technology. They thought it would be necessary to educate parents, teachers, and com-
munities on the importance of girls ’access to digital media, as well as to make access to ICTs better.
Girls were also interested in ICTs being better integrated in the curriculum, having technology
content and curricula in their own languages, and in more opportunities for peer-to-peer learning.
Yet, in our rapid evidence review, we found few studies exploring these topics or seeking ways toempower girls in the ways they themselves wish for.
A good example of an initiative seeking to empower adolescents to discuss the issues that concern
them while informing local governance policies is UNICEF ’s mobile-based platform U-Report. This text
messaging communication platform was launched in Uganda in 2011 (Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda
2014 ) as a local initiative allowing young people to contribute ideas to governance and decision-
making processes that impact on their local communities. Users have an average age of 24 and
those who sign up share opinions on topics ranging from job skills to disaster management
(UNICEF 2015 ), and respond to questions sent out by UNICEF staff twice a week. These are then aggre-
gated and shared with media and policymakers. Since its inception, U-Report has spread to several
other countries and has reportedly reached a million active users (UNICEF 2015 ). Although in some438 S. BANAJI ET AL.countries the platform is also used by policymakers, crucially for our argument, evidence that young
people ’s voices expressed on the platform have any impact on or response from policymakers is slim
in the evaluations, and children are not included either in evaluation or policy-making.
In another case, the Kenya-based non-profit organisation AkiraChix partnered with large develop-
ment organisations and the corporate sector to address the under-representation of women and girlsin ICT-related fields. Its programmes target girls of different ages and backgrounds and include kids ’
camps, week-long intensive boot camp training sessions for high school girls, and a year-long trainingin programming, design, and entrepreneurship for young women from under-privileged back-grounds, followed by placements in different tech organisations at the end of the programme.
Since 2010, 61 young women trained by AkiraChix have gone on to get internships, jobs, or to
start their own businesses (AkiraChix n.d.). The programmes raise the capabilities of these young
women, equip them with employability skills, open up opportunities of a possible career in ICTs,
and bring them into contact with highly skilled women ICT mentors, all of which are in themselves
huge opportunities. However, the intensive effort required to reach this relatively small number ofgirls over several years makes such an initiative difficult to sustain or implement at scale.
Other challenges and criticisms also exist. One is that the widespread fascination with digital tech-
nologies risks that the focus and analysis becomes media-centric, losing sight of the bigger picture ofthe contexts and meanings of children ’s lives within which digital media may or may not find their
place and contribute constructively (or otherwise). This problem seems particularly evident in thefield of health and information seeking, where the convenience and confidentiality of digitalmedia is particularly appealing to practitioners. There is little doubt that adolescents want such infor-
mation –Global Kids Online found that around a fifth of 12- to 14-year-olds and 43% of 15- to 17-year-
olds in South Africa looked for health information online at least every week (Byrne et al. 2016 ). But
initiatives often promote narrow adult-defined forms of information rather than responding to ado-lescents ’interests, or they provide generic access to the internet with little check on the types of
information gleaned in terms of accuracy or relevance. No wonder they chart less-than-hoped for
success, while their target audience sought the required information from peers, parents, or the
more-familiar mass media (Livingstone et al. in press ). Relatedly, and keen to benefit from the fact
that adolescents ’access to digital media is growing significantly in many low- and middle-income
contexts, Mitchell et al. recommend not an either/or approach but, rather, that “education programs
delivered face-to-face, such as in school or religious settings could be enhanced with SMS reminders and
additional information about program content ”(2011 , 778).
An example of a programme designed for flexible delivery is the World Starts with Me (WSWM), a
computer-based interactive sex education programme developed in 2002 –03 for secondary school
students (aged 12– 19) in Uganda, and implemented in over 150 schools since (Rijsdijk 2013 ). It
aims to promote sexual and reproductive health by educating young people to make independent
decisions about sexual practice. The programme supports the efforts of Ugandan educators to inte-
grate ICTs into the school curriculum. Evaluation of the WSWM programme involved a quasi-exper-imental design, including pre- and post-test, intervention and comparison groups, and was
conducted using a school-based self-administered questionnaire. Outcomes varied based on the
way the WSWM programme was implemented at each school, but overall, students from the inter-vention group who had considerable exposure to the programme (completed at least the first 10
out of 14 lessons) had better outcomes on several indicators, including awareness of pregnancy pre-
vention methods, intention to delay sexual intercourse and to use condoms, and self-efficacy indealing with sexual violence. Yet, the evaluation also found that the limited number of available
working computers, sporadic lack of electricity and insufficient teacher training were major
implementation problems faced by most of the schools.
In her ethnographic account of children in Western India, Banaji ( 2015 , 14) urges research, policy,
and practice to look “behind the hi-tech fetish ”. Only then, too, can one recognise how children use
and value (or not) ICTs in practice –for instance, seeing that “knowledge and skills in apps, games,
scams, jokes and memes constitutes one evident facet of media literacy ”(Banaji 2015 , 16). OtherDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 439qualitative studies tell a similar story of creative re-appropriations in the face of high-pressure norma-
tive expectations from adults regarding children ’s ICT use. Pathak-Shelat and DeShano ( 2014 , 984)
explain how “Indian families in rural areas and small towns experience a clash of expectations
between how digital media technologies are promoted and how they are experienced ”(our emphasis).
Thus, while families explicitly associate digital media with work, educational opportunity andinformation:
“this perception seems to come from the media and other external sources, rather than directly from personal
experiences with new media technologies because when they talked about their own practices, playing
games on computers and cell phones was the most frequent response. ”(989 –990)
This is not entirely a matter of children ’s preferences: “digital technologies are marketed as youth-
oriented technologies giving ‘power ’to youth (youth agency), but we observed a web of school and par-
ental controls surrounding their use ”(992).
Other studies critique the tendency to underestimate children ’s capabilities to negotiate and navi-
gate digital environments. For instance, systematic formal educational initiatives to teach younger
children about the complex risks and opportunities in digital environments in low-income commu-nities of the Global South are few and far between, and significantly hampered by norms governing
the discussion of sexuality, pornography, and other sexual content with children. Further, focusing on
young people living in marginalised contexts in South America, Europe, and Australia, Snyder andPrinsloo ( 2007 ) argue that subtle cultural disjunctures between school, home, and community
often mean that knowledge and experiences about ICTs, health, or sexuality gained in one site donot transfer or are not recognised and valued in another. Yet Cook et al. ( 2012 ) challenge the wide-
spread tendency to infantilise children as incapable of understanding the risks involved, their study
showing that not only are some children aware of the risks, but they deal with them on a daily basis.
Conclusion
ICTs are often intended and even assumed to act as an enabler or facilitator of equity and partici-
pation: but often they do not. Given the paucity of evidence about adolescents ’digital media uses
between and among regions in LMICs, international development policy informing programmes tar-
geting adolescent capability development need to be critical and cautious in how ICTs are harnessed
to promote child rights. While ICT4D interventions have some limited successes (e.g. ITU 2011 ; Sachs
et al. 2015 ), their engagement with issues pertaining to adolescent capability development and child
rights is particularly wanting. Our review suggests a problematic divergence between what adult sta-keholders expect children (particularly those from low-income areas) to do with digital media andwith what they actually do, as well as between development interventions’ assumptions about the
potential and the realities of many children ’s access to, skills with, and interest in ICT-related interven-
tions. Too often, interventions have tended to focus on the supply side while ignoring dynamics thatstructure demand and use and, therefore, condition practices; they thereby risk perpetuating hierar-
chies of gender- and age-related power.
In this article we have tried to highlight promising studies of interventions, respecting the good
intentions of many of those working to improve children ’s lives through the use of ICTs. However,
few if any cases show evidence of long-lasting social change, even though it is crucial that development
interventions are sustained beyond the rudimentary achievement of programme objectives in order tolearn the significance of ICTs for adolescents ’capability development, especially their potential to con-
tribute towards social justice by expanding the equity, participation, and agency of young people indetermining their futures. Most worryingly, some fear that through the fascination with ICTs:
“the global corporate players (through new gadgets, schemes, and advertisement), as well as the government,
through rhetoric and development schemes, are raising normative expectations to be part of global markets
that are impossible to meet in their rural location with infrastructural limitations. ”(Pathak-Shelat and DeShano
2014 , 998, emphasis added)440 S. BANAJI ET AL.In one study, 15- to 19-year-old students in urban Brazil concluded that they had grown up “under the
inﬂuence of the Internet and under the logic of cultural consumption associated with it ”(Ferraretto et al.
2011 , 393). This logic was barely addressed in the literature reviewed, and yet ICTs are usually proprie-
tary, leaving programme providers dependent on the terms of service of the ICT provider (cost, data
security, user privacy, commercial exploitation of data, etc.). Further, ICTs are regulated by statebodies either directly or through corporate franchises, and quite often in a restrictive manner involving
censorship, and can be used as tools for surveillance (Chattopadhyay 2011 ;G o m e z 2004 ). It is therefore
important to ask critical questions in the face of growing enthusiasm for the use of ICTs within program-
matic interventions in LMICs (Banaji 2015 ,2017 ; Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda 2014 ).
We have shown how maximising the positive potential of ICTs requires a grounded understanding
of how technology interacts with social, political, and economic factors important for development(Banaji 2017 ; World Bank 2016 ). While this conclusion is already established in the field of ICT4D, it
seems that each generation of researchers, policymakers, and practitioners must rediscover suchfindings if they –and we –are to sustain a critical lens on the much-hyped and yet reasonably
hoped-for prospects for new forms of online learning and information, for the exposure or protection
of children from online risks, and in relation to children ’s rights to participate in community, leisure,
civic, and political realms (Livingstone and Bulger 2014 ). Such efforts must include attention to the
lifeworld and its pre-existing inequalities also to find participatory strategies to recognise the particu-lar meanings and practices that shape the lives and concerns of the children who are, after all, the
intended beneficiaries. Given the continued innovation and adoption of ICTs and digital mediaacross LMICs, it is no longer possible to conceive of development without ICTs. At the same time,
the role of ICTs needs to be critically assessed, rather than assumed, and evaluated alongside the
non-digital development opportunities relevant to children and their life contexts.
