Abstract
Job search costs are high in rural labor markets in developing countries. Conse-
quently, the ﬂow of information on jobs and wages is limited, and wages tend to be
dispersed. To lower search costs, I develop an SMS-based messaging app that con-
nectsagriculturalworkersandemployers. Thetreatmentreduceswithin-villagewage
dispersion by 16-40 percent. Wage compression occurs from both sides of the wage
distribution,leavingtheaveragewageunchanged. Consistentwithreducedwagedis-

1 Introduction
Jobsearchcostsarehighinrurallabormarketsindevelopingcountries. Mostfarmersdo
not have access to the internet and there are no online job markets for agricultural daily
laborers. There is rarely a central place where workers are gathered. Employers tend to
rehire the same workers whom they had hired in previous seasons. As a consequence,
the ﬂow of information on jobs and wages is imperfect, and the law of one price may fail
to hold. In my study area of rural Tanzania, I ﬁnd evidence that there exists substantial
within-village wage dispersion. Figure 1 presents the percent deviation of an individual
daily wage relative to the village average. Only about half the reported wages are within
a 25 percent deviation from the village average wage, which is surprising given how jobs
are relatively homogeneous for manual farm work.1

I study the eﬀect of reducing search frictions on wage dispersion through a ﬁeld ex-
periment in Tanzania. To reduce job search costs, I develop an SMS-based messaging
app that connects agricultural workers and employers. The app was designed to mimic
an online job portal like monster.com , except that ads are announced over feature phones
withoutinternetdata. Employerspostajobadtoagatewayphoneandtheadissenttoall
registered workers in the village. Once a worker replies to the job ad, the worker’s infor-
mationisinstantlyforwardedbacktotheemployerwhoinitiatedtherequest. Thisservice

eﬀectively connects all employers and workers at near-zero user cost, increasing the size
of labor markets.2Treatment villages were oﬀered to use the app service throughout the
2019 agricultural season, while control villages received nothing.
I ﬁnd that the app has a sizeable eﬀect. It reduces within-village wage dispersion by
16-40 percent (depending on how dispersion is measured).3The results are robust to
controllingforwageseasonalityaswellasjobcharacteristics. Labormarketsearchtheory
predicts that lower search cost may raise wage by creating more jobs (Pissarides 2000;
Van den Berg and Van Vuuren 2010). However, while there is a clear reduction in the
wage dispersion, I ﬁnd no eﬀect on job creation or the average wage.
Toreconcilethewagecompressionresultalongwiththenulleﬀectontheaveragewage,
I look at heterogeneity in the initial level of wage paid by employers. I ﬁrst identify the
employers who paid a higher wage relative to other employers in the same village before
the intervention. I ﬁnd that the treatment induces initially high-paying employers to re-
duce the wage. On the other hand, lower-paying employers increase the wage. These
competing eﬀects cancel each other out, resulting in little change to the average wage.

2SMS costs are borne by farmers. An SMS voucher costs as little as 22 cents for 1000 messages, while
an average daily wage is $3.1. Additionally, most talk-time vouchers already come with free text messages.
From the project side, the annual cost of keeping the messaging app is $950 (= A subscription fee of a 3rd
party platform ($610) + SMS and mobile data plans ($72) + operation cost ($268)).
3The measures include standard deviation, coeﬃcient of variation (i.e., the standard deviation divided
by the mean), p50-p10 percentile wage ratio, and mean-min wage ratio. The magnitude is in the range
of estimates found in the price dispersion literature. For comparison, Aker (2010) ﬁnds a 10-16 percent
reduction in grain price dispersion and Jensen (2007) ﬁnds a 75 percent reduction in ﬁsh price dispersion
after the introduction of mobile phone service.SEARCH FRICTIONS IN RURAL LABOR MARKETS 3
on prevailing market wages. If information frictions are prevalent, the size of the update
can be large, inﬂuencing market wages.
I isolate the channel of search frictions from the change in bargaining behavior and
wage signaling by randomizing the disclosure of wage information. In a random subset
of treatment villages, I remove the wage information from job ads and/or job applica-
tions before sending out a message. In those villages, the app does not carry any explicit
wage signal and therefore there is no bargaining eﬀect through the information channel.

Moreover, I ﬁnd modest evidence that the overall treatment induces initially high paying

ﬁndingssuggestthattheappimprovesthecompetitivenessoflabormarkets,andsharing
job availability alone is suﬃcient to improve the functioning of labor markets (without
explicit wage information).
One consequence of wage dispersion is that employers face diﬀerent prices for labor
due to market imperfections, which contributes to the dispersion in labor demand. By
reducingwagedispersion,myinterventionispredictedtoreducedispersioninlaborinput
for farmers in the same labor market. Consistent with this prediction, dispersion in per-
acre labor input across farms is lower in treatment villages by 20-30 percent, suggesting
that labor allocation has improved.
My paper is the ﬁrst study to examine the role of search frictions on wage disper-
sion in rural labor markets. While there exist many studies on the eﬀect of information
communication technologies (ICTs) on price dispersion, they mostly focus on commod-
ity prices (Aker 2010; Aker and Fafchamps 2014; Allen 2014; Goyal 2010; Jensen 2007).4
More recent studies on labor markets in developing countries use experiments to reduce
frictions in urban labor markets by organizing job fairs (Abebe et al. 2018 ; Beam 2016),
oﬀering monetary incentives to travel to job sites (Abebe et al. 2019; Franklin 2017; Bryan

labor market outcomes improve when villages are connected to outside markets through
the construction of roads or footbridges (Aggarwal 2018; Brooks et al. 2019; Shamdasani

Another contribution of this paper is to document the extent of wage dispersion at-
tributed to search frictions through a well-identiﬁed experiment. Early search-theoretic

1983, Mortensen 1988, and Burdett and Mortensen 1998). Notably, these papers show
that wage dispersion may arise even in settings where workers and employers are identi-
cal.6However, search models do not agree empirically on the contribution of search fric-

through models, my paper takes a diﬀerent approach and experimentally reduces fric-
tionswith themessaging app. Myﬁndings supporttheidea thatsearch frictionaccounts
for a sizable variation in wage dispersion.
This paper is also related to a recent development literature that focuses on imper-

My paper adds to this literature by documenting another source of rural market ineﬃ-
ciency, i.e., search costs to ﬁnd workers and jobs, which has not been studied extensively
in a rural setting in developing countries.

2 Experimental Design
A key motivation of the intervention in this paper is to make hiring and job search much
easier than traditional methods allow. While smart phones are still rare, feature phones
shown in Appendix Figure A1 are almost universal. In the study regions of Tanzania,
mobile phone ownership rate is 93 percent. Furthermore, the literacy rate is 84 percent,7
making an SMS-based messaging app a feasible solution for digital labor markets.
I develop an app which works autonomously on a mobile messaging platform called
Telerivet, a third party API that was integrated with JavaScript.8See Appendix Figure A2
for an example of the backend development. When farmers send a message to a gateway
phone,thesystemﬁrstidentiﬁeswhetherthefarmerisaregistereduserandwhetherthe
person is an employer or a worker. To register, an individual responds to six messages
one by one to answer basic questions (e.g. name, location, age, gender, and whether the
person intends to be an employer or worker).
A registered employer can post a job by answering a few questions about the job, e.g.,
thetypeoftask,crop,startingday,andthewage(SeeAppendixFigureA4forthefullmes-
sage interactions). Once posted, the ad is sent to registered workers located nearby. The
messaging app allows employers to reach a large number of workers instantly, reducing
searchcostsdramatically. Auniquejobcodeisattachedtoagivenjobad,andworkerscan

insearchcost,byrandomizingthedisclosureofwageinformation. Thewageinformation
could be displayed either in the job ad or in the job application. I cross-randomized the
non-disclosure of wage information as shown in Table 1 and the example messages are
in Appendix Table A1. Overall balance between control and treatment group at baseline
is shown in Appendix Table A2 at a farmer level.9Another balance table using the recall
data from the phone survey and endline survey for the pre-period is shown in Appendix
Table A3 at a village level. At both farmer and village level, almost all of the diﬀerences
between the treatment and control group are insigniﬁcant.

eryone interestedin hiring andworking wasinvited. They were alsotold to bringmobile
phones. During the intervention period, ﬁeld enumerators visited each treatment village
to conduct two meetings. The ﬁrst meeting was in the center of the village and the sec-
ond was in a more remote part of the village. During the meetings, ﬁeld enumerators
conducted a hands-on training session to demonstrate how the messaging app works.
At the meeting, potential employers and workers were given instructions on how to

cluded from the analysis because not enough farmers reported hiring. In particular, I require at least three

fore, the analysis involved 30 control villages and 36 treatment villages. To be consistent with the analysis

lages. Within each village, those farmers who did not participate in rural labor markets
at the time of the baseline survey were excluded from the study. The ﬁnal study sample
comprises 650 farmers from 70 villages. However, when constructing wage dispersion
measures, I require at least three reported wages within a village-production stage. This

village boundary, spillover eﬀects between control and treatment villages are extremely
unlikely. Furthermore, the registration for the app was declined if the user is not from a
treatment village.

treatment villages (59 percent vs. 62 percent in control), but the diﬀerence is statistically
insigniﬁcant. The compliance rates for in-person endline interviews are quite similar (91

durations are short, typically lasting 2-3 days. In a given hiring event, seven workers are
typically hired at a time. Another feature of rural labor markets is that employers rarely
hire workers outside the village. Only 8 percent of workers are hired outside the em-
ployer’s own village.15Eighty-one percent of workers are those whom the employer had
already hired in previous seasons.

which include food and transportation payments.
3.3 Empirical Speciﬁcation
The main outcome of the study is wage dispersion. Wage dispersion is measured within
village because the intervention treats everyone in the labor market at the village level.
I use commonly used measures of dispersion in the literature: standard deviation, co-
eﬃcient of variation, mean-minimum wage ratio, and p50-p10 percentile ratio. Because
of seasonality in the agricultural production (See Panel B of Appendix Figure A10), the
wageinleanseasonandthewageinpeakseasonreﬂectdiﬀerentlabormarketconditions.
Therefore,Idivideagriculturalproductionstagesasfollows: 2018planting,weeding,har-
vesting, dry season, 2019 planting, weeding, and harvesting. The stages are chosen by
the most popular job tasks reported in the farmer surveys in a given time period. I con-
struct dispersion measures within village and agricultural production stage using wages
reported by employers only. The main regression uses a simple diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences
speciﬁcation where the source of exogenous variation is the randomization of the treat-
ment:

the sum of the wage and food and transportation payments. The result shows that there
is a large and signiﬁcant reduction in the standard deviation. As explained in section 3, I
require at least three reported wages within a village-production stage when calculating
standard deviation and coeﬃcient variation, and this drops four villages. To avoid this
exclusion, I collapse all pre- and post-treatment time periods and run a Analysis of Co-
variance (ANCOVA) estimation as in McKenzie (2012). Appendix Table A7 shows that
the results are qualitatively similar.

winsorized at p5 and p95 to make sure that results are not driven by a few outliers.

4.4 The Eﬀect of The Wage Bidding
One feature of the messaging app is the ability to disclose wage information which may
change the bargaining behaviors as well as the belief on the distribution of wage oﬀers.
To isolate these channels from the reduction in search cost, the wage disclosure was ran-
domized in a subset of treatment villages. I explore the diﬀerence in the treatment eﬀect
between villages with and without wage disclosures in Table 10 by estimating regressionSEARCH FRICTIONS IN RURAL LABOR MARKETS 21

In the table, the coeﬃcient of TREAT_BIDPostmeasures the additional treatment ef-
fectofthebiddingfeaturerelativetothevillageswherethewageinformationwasnotdis-
closed. The evidence suggests that displaying the wage information in the job ad and/or
in the worker application does not contribute more to the wage compression. Appendix
Table A8 also shows the results at the farmer-hiring event level. Again the additional
bidding feature does not reduce wage dispersion more than the regular treatment group
without the bidding feature. Overall, the results seem to suggest that announcing the job
availability among a large number of workers alone is suﬃcient to compress the wage.

imperfections implies that employers face diﬀerent prices for labor which contributes toSEARCH FRICTIONS IN RURAL LABOR MARKETS 23

Thissectionexploresthisdownstreameﬀectonharvestoutput. Onechallengeofestimat-
ing the eﬀect on harvest level is that many farmers reported that their entire crops were
wasted due to various shocks including low rainfall, resulting in zero harvest. About 16
percent of farmers indicated that they cultivated and ended up harvesting nothing in a
given season. To retain the farmers with zero harvest output, I convert the output using
an inverse hyperbolic transformation.
Since some farmers grow multiple crops, the value of each crop is evaluated at the
prevailing market price and aggregated across crops to compute the total harvest output24 DAHYEON JEONG

6 Conclusion
Understanding the sources of ineﬃciency in labor markets is crucial to improving mar-
ket outcomes. Labor is the most abundant input factor in rural economies of develop-
ing countries. More importantly, misallocation of labor implies that some farmers use
too much or too little labor on their farm relative to what is optimal in a frictionless en-
vironment. Therefore, simply correcting the misallocation of labor can improve aggre-
gate output without any technological innovations. In this paper, I ﬁnd evidence that
search frictions are a constraint for eﬃcient labor allocation even in tightly connected ru-
raleconomies. Oﬀeringacost-eﬀectiveSMSapptechnologycanconnectalargenumberof

tips on farming and ﬁnancial management via SMS.20In particular, WeFarm formulates
a farmer-to-farmer digital network where farmers can ask and answer questions through
text messages, just like an online forum for farmers in developed countries.
The messaging app I developed to create digital rural labor markets is an example
of this trend. Feedback survey presented in Appendix Table A10 suggests that there is
enough demand for the app and scope for the proﬁtability of this service. Among the
study sample app users, 93 percent indicated that the app service was useful. Most of
them reported that they were able to ﬁnd workers and jobs faster and it required less
eﬀort and lower costs. Furthermore, 50 percent of treatment farmers indicated that they
plan to use the app in the next season. 74 percent of those who plan to use the app are
willingtocontributeanaverageof1.5USDperseason. Aback-of-the-envelopecalculation
implies that the payments from 630 users are enough to cover the cost of the service to
Among the study sample, six farmers won the phone during the village meeting, and seven farmers won
the 10 USD. This is 2 percent of the study sample (13/584 = 0.02).

to be scaled up to beneﬁt a large number of farmers.

Notes: The balance test is done using the phone survey and endline survey. These surveys were
implemented afterthe intervention, but the data for the pre-intervention period was also collected
by recall as part of the surveys. See Appendix Table A2 for the balance table using the baseline data
implemented beforethe intervention. Last column shows the p-value of the t-test for the equality of

Notes: Theattritiontableincludesthosefarmersforwhichwedonothaveaphonenumber. Theyarecoded
as non-compliance. Phone numbers of some treatment farmers were updated during the recent village
meetings. In other words, we would have not been able to reach them if we did not hold village meetings.
Sincecontrolvillagesdidnothavevillagemeetings,Iassumethatthosewhosephonenumbersgotupdated
during the meetings are also non-compliant to ensure the balance between control and treatment villages.
Round 2 and 3 asked farmers’ all hiring/working events from the most recent survey date. For example, if
