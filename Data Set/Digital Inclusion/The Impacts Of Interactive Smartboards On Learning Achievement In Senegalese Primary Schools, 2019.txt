Synopsis
Technology is believed to hold the key for improving the quality of education, but empirical evidence on the 
success of technology interventions, including interactive whiteboards, at improving student outcomes is 
mixed. This study evaluates the impact of Project Sankoré a digital classroom with an interactive whiteboard 
consisting of the whiteboard, a computer, a data projector and digital resources for grades 1 and 2 of 
primary schools in Senegal on student learning outcomes. These outcomes were measured by test scores 
in French, mathematics, and education for life sciences and for life in society. The study also investigated 
heterogeneous treatment effects of the project by the gender and grade of the students and by the location 
of the school.
Context
Though a lot of progress has been made in enrollment in sub-Saharan Africa, the quality of education 
remains low. Different types of ICT interventions have been proposed as possible ways of improving quality 
of education outcomes. Interactive whiteboards have been suggested as a way of increasing student and 
teacher motivation. They may also enhance the benefits of other ICTs, such as computers and projectors, 
by adding interactivity. However, there is very little evidence on interactive whiteboards in developing 
countries.
Research questions
The primary research questions are:What is the evidence that interactive whiteboards improve learning 
outcomes? To what extent do students' test scores improve?How cost-effective is the model of interactive 
whiteboards?What evidence exists of improved access to and usage of interactive whiteboards in 
participating schools, by teachers and students?How can similar future projects be improved using lessons 
that have been learned from this project?

See SourceIntervention designThe Sankoré project equipped selected classrooms with an interactive whiteboard 
connected to a computer and a projector. Through interactive software and a tactile screen, the teachers 
and learners had access to text, moving images and sound. About 370 interactive whiteboards were 
distributed to schools that met safety, accessibility, and electricity requirements for usage in grade 1 and 
grade 2 classes. The teachers involved in the implementation of the project were trained as technicians in 
order to support installing and repairing of equipment when required. The kits were distributed to the 
schools during the middle of 2014 and teaching with the whiteboards began in January/February of 
2015.Theory of changeThe intervention was expected to improve the ICT-literacy and confidence of 
students, as well as overall performance in all subjects due to a combination of more effective instruction 
and sharpened learning abilities.Evaluation designThe authors used the difference-in-difference evaluation 
strategy and compared changes in the outcome of interest, i.e. test scores, before and after the intervention 
between students who benefited from the SankorÃ© intervention and those that did not.Primary data 
collection was from 50 Sankoré schools and 72 comparison schools. Of the 50 Sankoré schools, 26 were 
from an urban area, five from a peri-urban area and 19 from a rural area. The 72 non-Sankoré schools 
included 32 urban schools, 13 peri-urban schools and 27 rural schools. In tandem with the quantitative data 
collection, qualitative studies were conducted to understand the implementation of the project, and 
perceptions of its effectiveness and impacts. Interviews were conducted with principals, teachers, district 
inspectors and Ministry of Education officials who were members of the Sankoré technical committee.
Main findings
The difference-in-difference and instrumental variables results showed positive changes in test scores for 
both mathematics and education for life sciences and for life in society in general. However, these positive 
results were largely driven by urban schools. For grades 1 and 2 together, the difference-in-difference 
results showed a statistically significant increase in math test scores by 0.186 standard deviations for all 
treatment schools, and an increase of 0.404 standard deviations for the urban schools.The study pointed to 
the challenges in rolling out the whiteboard programme in rural areas, with the research team 
recommending extending the programme to peri-urban and rural schools only with additional changes to 
training, infrastructure, or other complementary learning inputs.
