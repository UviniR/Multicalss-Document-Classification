Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 2	Digital	and	Social	Media		for	Social	and	Behaviour	Change	Communication	Linda	Raftree	for	iMedia	Associates		Executive	Summary		As	access	to	mobile	phones	and	the	Internet	has	expanded	over	the	past	decade,	so	too	have	efforts	to	incorporate	new	media	channels,	digital	platforms	and	social	media	into	social	and	behaviour	change	communication	(SBCC)	efforts.	In	the	Global	South,	access	and	use	are	still	not	synonymous,	however.	Although	young	people	in	low-income	settings	indeed	access	mobile	phones,	theirs	is	not	an	experience	of	“always	on,	always	connected.”	For	most,	the	online	experience	is	mobile-	rather	than	computer-based.	While	there	is	no	such	thing	as	homogeneous	mobile	or	Internet	access,	many	young	people	in	lower-income	contexts	share	and	borrow	phones	from	friends	and	relatives	rather	than	owning	a	phone.	These	phones	may	be	low-end	phones,	second-hand	phones,	or	pirated	phones	that	do	not	offer	consistent	reliability	and	whose	features	are	behind	the	market.			Despite	the	challenges,	young	people	the	world	over	do	find	ways	to	navigate	financial	and	social	constraints	so	that	they	can	participate	in	adolescent	and	teen	social	life	and	youth	culture.	Education-entertainment	programming	can	tap	into	these	urges	and	capitalize	on	multi-modal,	transmedia	approaches	to	reach	and	engage	with	young	people.	The	key	is	to	understand	youth’s	interests	and	needs,	their	socioeconomic	contexts,	and	their	media	and	technology	habits	and	preferences	and	to	have	a	strong	understanding	of	social	and	behaviour	change	theories	and	practices.		This	paper	explores	the	ways	in	which	digital	and	social	media	channels	can	be	used	successfully,	appropriately,	and	responsibly	to	drive	behaviour	change	in	young	men	and	women	from	lower	socioeconomic	groups.	We	examined	peer-reviewed	literature,	grey	literature,	NGO	research	and	evaluation	reports,	industry	framework	and	guidance	documents,	and	articles	and	blog	posts	in	order	to	explore	relevant	SBCC	theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches;	to	uncover	learning	from	current	and	past	digital	SBCC	initiatives;	to	identify	good	practice	and	common	pitfalls	in	digital	SBCC	design,	to	lay	out	good	practices	for	digital	safeguarding;	and	to	provide	a	few	examples	of	how	monitoring	and	evaluation	and	learning	can	be	designed	for	SBCC	initiatives.		SBCC	theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches	Most	SBCC	frameworks	have	emerged	from	the	health	sector,	and	existing	theories	are	often	inadequate	for	mobile	or	digital	SBCC	due	to	their	interactive	and	adaptive	nature.	Digital	SBCC	interventions	should	be	grounded	in	theory,	and	they	may	be	more	applicable	if	they	are	co- 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 3	designed	with	users	and	aligned	with	their	media	usage	preferences	and	their	information	seeking	habits	and	behaviours.			Theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches	that	have	some	relevance	for	digital	SBCC	include:	• Trans-theoretical	(Stages	of	Change)	Model	• Social	Cognitive	Theory	• Behavioural	Economics	and	Nudge	Theory	• Mental	models	• Ecological	Models	of	Behaviour	Change	• Social	Norm	Theories	• Narrative	Persuasion	Theories	• Diffusion	of	Innovation	Theory		Despite	lending	themselves	to	new	ways	of	reaching	and	engaging	with	target	groups,	some	of	these	theories	raise	ethical	issues	due	to	their	potential	for	misuse	or	manipulation,	and	prompt	questions	such	as	‘who	decides	what	is	desirable	behaviour?’		What	do	current	and	past	digital	SBCC	initiatives	tell	us?	Several	studies	conducted	over	the	past	decade	have	found	that	teens	and	youth	are	open	to	text	messages	for	health	promotion,	and	they	find	them	appealing	and	culturally	acceptable.	Benefits	of	digital	and	social	media	for	SBCC	include:	• increased	interaction	with	others;		• more	available,	shared,	and	tailored	information;		• increased	accessibility	and	widening	access	to	health	information;		• peer/social/emotional	support;		• public	health	surveillance;	and		• potential	to	influence	health	policy.			Behaviour	change	interventions	appear	to	be	most	effective	when	people	are	engaged	on	multiple	levels.	Reminders	can	be	successful	for	simpler	behaviours,	and	there	is	varied	evidence	on	whether	virtual	behaviour	change	efforts	are	equally	as	successful	as	offline	ones,	or	if	blended	approaches	that	combine	online	and	offline	approaches	work	best	and	when.	Users	are	largely	unaware	of	data	privacy	and	confidentiality,	data	security	and	the	dangers	of	disclosing	personal	health	information	online	or	over	via	insecure	means	such	as	text	message.	Privacy	is	particularly	challenging	in	environments	where	mobiles	are	shared	or	borrowed.			Some	entertainment-education	examples	to	explore	further	include	16	and	Pregnant,	which	may	have	influenced	the	rate	of	teen	pregnancies	in	the	US;	East	Los	High,	which	was	successful	at	reaching	American	Latina/o	youth	with	sexual	and	reproductive	health	messages;	the	Voices	for	Change	broad	program	that	aimed	to	change	social	norms	around	gender	in	Nigeria;	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 4	SKAM,	a	Norwegian	program	dealing	with	teen	girls’	day-to-day	challenges	which	became	a	cult	hit	among	global	teens.		Good	practice	and	common	pitfalls	in	digital	SBCC	design	A	number	of	good	practices	are	highlighted	in	published	literature	and	in	documentation	from	practitioners	and	organizations,	including:		Ground	efforts	in	theory	and	find	ways	to	understand	and	respond	to	the	complexity	of	underlying	determinants	of	behaviour.		Understand	the	target	population	and	the	social	context.	Successful	approaches	are	context-specific	and	rooted	in	an	understanding	of	behaviour,	its	social,	environmental,	economic	and	motivational	determinants,	and	obstacles	to	change.	Programs	should	address	wider	economic	and	cultural	barriers	to	behaviour	change.		Understand	and	design	for	user	habits,	preferences,	and	interests.	This	includes	the	devices,	channels,	media	sources,	influencers,	data	packages,	network	strength,	and	other	elements	that	are	directly	related	to	whether	and	how	people	access	and	use	digital	devices,	services	and	platforms.			Watch	out	for	cost	and	data	limitations.	Low-income	users	tend	to	have	frugal	access	habits.	SBCC	programs	should	carefully	consider	how	to	minimize	data	consumption	by	designing	specifically	for	those	who	have	limited	minutes	or	text	messages	allowed.			Carefully	think	about	language	and	literacy.	Text	messages	for	health	information,	motivating	individuals,	and	encouraging	self-management	is	popular,	however	these	do	not	work	where	there	is	low	literacy.	Language	can	also	be	a	politicizing	factor,	and	language	choices	should	be	made	carefully	to	avoid	creating	conflict	or	exclusion.		Determine	the	right	frequency	of	messaging	or	engagement.	Though	SMS-based	reminders	trigger	individuals	to	think	about	topics	they	might	not	otherwise	consciously	consider,	or	only	consider	at	certain	times,	if	messages	are	seen	as	‘nagging’	they	will	not	be	effective.			Build	trust	and	find	the	right	voice	and	messenger(s).	To	maximize	likelihood	of	behaviour	change,	the	recipient	needs	to	believe	the	sender	of	the	message	is	a	credible	source	of	information.		Finding	trusted	messengers	and	influencers	and	the	right	tone	is	a	known	good	practice	from	pre-Internet	days,	and	it	holds	true	for	digital	SBCC.			Prepare	with	signposting	and	ensure	capacity	to	respond	to	demand	generated.	SBCC	programs	should	plan	for	how	they	will	respond	to	any	demand	created	by	increased	awareness.	Reliable,	trustworthy,	vetted	online	and	offline	support	systems	and	services	should	be	in	place	to	which	users	can	be	signposted.		 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 5		Budget	for	moderation	of	content	and	comments.	Both	Facebook	and	WhatsApp	have	been	used	to	spread	false	and	misleading	information	that	many	believe	has	influenced	election	processes,	fueled	hate	and	violence,	and	led	to	wider	divisions	on	topics	like	race	and	gender.	Good	moderation	can	help	to	stem	false	or	misleading	information	from	spreading	on	social	channels.		Don’t	be	fooled	by	vanity	metrics.	Vanity	metrics	are	those	that	focus	on	large	numbers	of	reach	or	engagement:	for	example,	page	views,	clicks,	or	likes,	yet	say	little	about	the	quality	of	engagement	or	the	wider	impact	on	behaviour	change.			Digital	Safeguarding	good	practices	The	umbrella	of	“Digital	Safeguarding”	includes	a)	safeguarding	when	people	use	digital	devices	or	engage	with	digital	services	or	platforms,	b)	protecting	data	and	data	privacy,	and	c)	securing	data.	Women	and	girls	are	especially	vulnerable	to	online	violence,	harassment	and	abuse,	as	well	as	LGBTQ	identifying	persons	and	lower	societal	strata,	such	as	the	Dalit,	in	some	cases.			There	are	multiple	safeguarding	areas	to	consider	when	engaging	adolescents	in	digital	initiatives,	including:		• big	picture	ethical	and	risk	review	(is	embarking	on	this	effort	ethical?);		• safeguarding,	informed	consent,	privacy	and	security	of	data	collected	during	formative	or	ongoing	research	activities;		• building	privacy	and	data	security	into	platform,	product	or	outreach	design;		• ensuring	that	the	benefits	of	collecting	personal	or	sensitive	data	outweigh	the	privacy	risks;		• following	applicable	country	and	global	legal	frameworks	related	to	data	privacy	and	transmission	across	borders;		• protecting	and	securing	data	collected	or	generated	throughout	the	engagement	process;	• ensuring	clarity	on	how	and	where	data	flows	and	reviewing	how	partners	will	manage	data	privately	and	securely;	and	• considerations	around	the	online	experience	itself	such	as	safe	and	appropriate	content,	comments	and	moderation,	and	protection	from	online	abuse,	bullying,	harassment,	hate	speech,	violence,	scams	or	grooming.		Monitoring,	evaluation	and	learning	for	digital	SBCC		The	evidence	base	on	digital	SBCC	is	still	weak	and	it	is	recommended	that	future	studies	adopt	rigorous	designs	and	endpoints.		Creative	approaches	to	monitoring,	evaluation	and	learning	(MEL)	of	digital	SBCC	include	those	found	in	the	following	programs:	16	and	Pregnant,	East	Los	High,	Voices	for	Change,	Springster	and	HNI’s	3-2-1.	Some	digital	tools	and	emerging	methods,	including	interactive	voice	response	(IVR),	Internet	messaging	platforms,	and	big	data	can	enable	interactive,	engaging	and/or	innovative	evaluation	processes.

Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 9	Digital	and	Social	Media		for	Social	and	Behaviour	Change	Communication	Linda	Raftree	for	iMedia		Introduction		As	access	to	mobile	phones	and	the	Internet	have	expanded	over	the	past	decade,	so	too	have	efforts	to	incorporate	new	media	channels,	digital	platforms	and	social	media	into	social	and	behaviour	change	communication	efforts.	In	the	‘Global	South,’	access	and	use	is	still	not	the	same	thing.	Young	people	do	access	mobile	phones,	however,	unlike	their	counterparts	in	the	Global	North,	theirs	is	not	an	experience	of	“always	on,	always	connected”	and	for	most,	the	online	experience	is	fully	mobile	phone-based.	While	there	is	no	such	thing	as	homogeneous	mobile	or	Internet	access,	it	is	common	for	young	people	in	lower-income	contexts	to	share	and	borrow	phones	from	friends	and	relatives	rather	than	to	own	their	own	phone.	These	phones	may	be	low-end	phones,	second-hand	phones,	or	pirated	phones	that	do	not	offer	consistent	reliability	and	whose	features	are	several	years	behind	the	market.	Girls	in	some	contexts	enjoy	lower	levels	of	access	and	use	than	boys,	and	youth	with	less	disposable	income	also	experience	lower	levels	of	access	and	use.			Young	people	the	world	over;	however,	find	ways	to	navigate	financial	and	social	constraints	so	that	they	can	participate	in	adolescent	and	teen	social	life	and	youth	culture.	Education-entertainment	programming	can	tap	into	these	trends	and	capitalize	on	multi-modal,	transmedia	approaches	to	reaching	and	engaging	with	young	people.	The	key	is	to	understand	youth’s	interests	and	needs,	their	socio-economic	contexts,	and	their	media	and	technology	habits	and	preferences	along	with	a	strong	understanding	of	social	and	behaviour	change	theories	and	practices.		This	paper	explores	the	ways	in	which	current	and	emerging	digital	and	social	media	channels	can	be	used	successfully,	appropriately,	and	responsibly	to	drive	behaviour	change	in	young	men	and	women	from	lower	socioeconomic	groups.	We	examined	peer-reviewed	literature,	grey	literature,	NGO	research	and	evaluation	reports,	industry	framework	and	guidance	documents,	and	articles	and	blog	posts	in	order	to	explore	relevant	social	and	behaviour	change	communication	(SBCC)	theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches;	to	uncover	learning	from	current	and	past	digital	SBCC	initiatives;	to	identify	good	practice	and	common	pitfalls	in	digital	SBCC	design,	to	lay	out	good	practices	for	digital	safeguarding;	and	to	provide	a	few	examples	of	how	monitoring	and	evaluation	and	learning	can	be	designed	or	SBCC	initiatives.		 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 10	1.		Mobile	access	and	use			A	2018	Pew	Research	Center	study	shows	a	rise	in	the	number	of	people	who	use	the	Internet,	a	smart	phone	or	social	media	in	emerging	economies/developing	economies.		Over	the	past	five	years,	global	Internet	use	has	risen	from	42	to	64	percent,	smartphone	use	from	24	to	42	percent	and	online	social	networking	from	34	to	53	percent.	Internet	and	social	media	use	continue	to	lag	in	some	developing	economies,	however.	In	India	in	particular,	35	percent	of	people	age	18-36	reported	occasionally	using	the	Internet	or	owning	a	smartphone	(as	opposed	to	just	13	percent	of	those	over	37	years	old).	53	percent	of	those	with	a	higher	education	level	reported	Internet	and	/	or	smartphone	use	versus	11	percent	of	those	in	lower	education	brackets.	Overall,	just	one-in-five	adults	in	India	use	social	networking	platforms	such	as	Facebook,	and	a	gender	divide	exists,	with	28	percent	of	adult	males	using	social	networking	platforms	as	compared	to	11	percent	of	women.	Sub-Saharan	Africa	is	also	behind,	as	one	of	the	least	connected			parts	of	the	globe.	Developed	nation	use,	on	the	other	hand,	has	plateaued	over	the	past	few	years	(Poushter,	Bishop	and	Chwe	2018).		A	2018	Vodafone	Foundation	and	Girl	Effect	study	that	included	over	three	thousand	girls	in	twenty-five	countries	emphasizes,	“There	is	no	such	thing	as	homogenous	access.”	In	particular,	the	mobile	gender	gap	is	highly	context	dependent,	with	a	number	of	intersecting	factors	and	implications.	Since	girls	often	gain	access	by	borrowing	and/	or	sharing	friends	and	relatives’	phones,	they	may	be	less	likely	to	have	their	own	accounts	or	enjoy	privacy	of	usage,	so	they	tend	to	use	phones	more	cautiously.	When	girls	can	access	phones,	they	use	them	as	much	as	possible.	Over	half	of	the	girls	included	in	the	study	said	they	use	a	phone	every	day	or	multiple	times	a	day,	and	a	32%	said	they	use	a	phone	at	least	once	a	week.	The	study	highlights	that	while	both	boys	and	girls	face	cost	barriers,	girls	also	have	safety	concerns	related	to	mobile	use,	and	so	do	their	parents	(Vodafone	Foundation	and	Girl	Effect	2018).		The	distinction	between	access	and	use	is	critical	(Banaji,	Livingstone,	et	al.	2018)	and	should	be	considered	when	designing	digital	or	social	media	outreach	because	phone	ownership	and	usage	can	be	transient.	In	the	Global	North	there	is	no	meaningful	difference	between	mobile	access	and	use,	but	in	the	Global	South,	this	is	not	the	case.	Young	people	often	borrow	rather	than	own	mobiles.	Youth	may	sell	their	phones	if	they	need	cash,	and	mobile	phone	borrowship1	is	influenced	by	factors	such	as	family	status	(e.g.	foster	status),	household	resources	and	livelihood	patterns,	and	intergenerational	relationships	(Porter,	et	al.	2012)	(Banaji	2017).	Young	people	use	different	tactics	used	to	overcome	constraints	that	affect	their	media	use--rationing	phone	use	to	save	battery	life,	limiting	phone	functions	to	save	data	costs,	finding	free	or	cheap	games	or	applications,	deleting	games	to	free	up	storage	space,	and	avoiding	commercial	tactics	to	eat	into	airtime	(Walton	and	Pallitt	2012).	These	realities	and	behaviours	need	to	be	considered	when	designing	digital	social	and	behaviour	change	communications.																																																														1	The	term	“borrowship”	is	commonly	used	in	the	mobile	space	to	distinguish	between	those	who	are	owners	(mobile	phone	ownership)	and	those	who	share	or	borrow	mobile	phones	(mobile	phone	borrowship).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 11	2.		Relevant	theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches		Most	SBCC	frameworks	and	evidence	have	emerged	from	the	health	sector.	Reviews	of	mobile	health	behaviour	interventions	have	concluded	that	they	would	benefit	from	greater	application	of	behavioural	theories,	yet	existing	theories	are	often	inadequate	for	informing	mobile	SBCC,	which	is	more	interactive	and	adaptive	(Riley,	Rivera,	et	al.	n.d.).	Even	when	interventions	are	initially	informed	by	theory,	they	do	not	always	reflect	a	theory-based	approach	throughout	their	implementation.	Additionally,	available	theories	do	not	always	mesh	with	the	dynamic	nature	of	mobile	devices	and	social	media	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017)	(Painter,	Hynes	and	Glanz	2008)	(Riley,	Rivera,	et	al.	2011).	The	field	is	still	learning	how	to	manage	the	complex	mix	of	ingredients	in	a	mobile	effort.	In	other	words,	those	designing	mobile	SBCC	initiatives	must	consider	the	capabilities	and	affordances	of	a	particular	device	(basic	phone?	smart	phone?);	the	nature	of	the	channel	(SMS?	Call?	Internet	Messaging?);	what	can	be	carried	on	the	channel	(Text?	Voice?	Video?);	and	the	interests,	habits,	incomes,	needs	and	characteristics	of	the	target	population	(Health	Communication	Capacity	Collaborative	(HC3)	2013).			In	a	literature	review	conducted	for	Girl	Effect,	the	behaviour	change	research	group	New	Knowledge	explored	possibilities	and	limitations	related	to	knowledge,	attitude,	and	practice	(behaviour)	change	that	can	be	supported	on	digital	platforms.	They	found	that	digital	interventions	that	link	theory	and	practice	to	change	norms	are	uncommon	and	that	existing	efforts	are	still	in	early	stages.	They	recommend	a	holistic	approach	that	goes	beyond	a	focus	on	just	knowledge	and	confidence	and	that	also	finds	ways	to	address	potential	barriers	to	behaviour	change.	There	is	also	consistent	agreement	that	digital	behaviour	change	interventions	designed	for	adolescents	should	be	co-designed	with	young	people,	fun	and	engaging,	and	aligned	with	how	they	use	media	/	social	media	and	their	information	seeking	habits	and	behaviours.	The	literature	that	follows	digital	behaviour	change	interventions	over	an	extended	period	of	time	is	limited,	and	much	of	the	literature	is	context-specific.	This	makes	it	difficult	to	compare	across	multiple	interventions	due	to	the	variation	found	among	digital	platforms.	For	this	reason,	questions	remain	about	sustainability	and	duration	of	change	and	about	how	much	change	needs	to	happen	over	how	long	for	it	to	be	durable	for	the	long-term	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).		Below	we	list	some	of	the	theories,	models,	frameworks	and	approaches	that	are	most	relevant	for	digital	social	and	behaviour	change	communication	work:		The	Trans-theoretical	(Stages	of	Change)	Model	(TTM)	features	a	scale	for	measuring	an	individual’s	self-efficacy	(confidence	in	one’s	own	ability	to	achieve	a	desired	action	or	change)	and	outlines	five	stages	of	change:	pre-contemplation	(no	intention	to	take	action	within	the	next	six	months),	contemplation	(an	intent	to	take	action	within	the	next	six	months),	preparation	(an	intent	to	take	action	within	the	next	30	days	and	has	taken	some	behavioural	steps	in	this	direction),	action	(changed	overt	behaviour	for	less	than	six	months),	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 12	maintenance	(changed	overt	behaviour	for	more	than	six	months).	The	subsequent	stage,	characterized	by	no	temptation	to	relapse	and	complete	confidence	in	one’s	ability	to	maintain	the	changed	behaviour	pattern,	is	the	termination	phase.			When	it	comes	to	TTM,	interventions	with	high	levels	of	utility	and	impact	have	the	most	potential	for	change.	It	may	be	useful	to	establish	both	a	utility	criterion	that	can	demonstrate	efficacy	in	changing	a	given	behaviour,	and	an	impact	criterion	that	can	demonstrate	intervention	effectiveness	in	terms	of	measurable	change	among	the	target	population	(Prochaska,	Wright	and	Velicer	2008).	TTM	does	not	consider	social	context	and	its	influence	on	individuals;	rather	it	assumes	individuals	make	logical	decisions	at	each	stage.	Additionally,	the	TTM	must	address	each	stage	separately	to	be	most	effective.	TTM	has	been	applied	to	tailored	health	behaviour	change	interventions	such	as	dietary	change	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).		Max	St.	John	offers	a	formula	for	using	TMM	with	social	media	SBCC	(St	John	2011).	It	includes	phases	of	insight,	intervention	and	evaluation.	At	the	insight	phase,	he	recommends	doing	research	and	talking	with	users	to	understand:	Who	is	the	audience?	Where	do	they	go	and	what	do	they	do?	Where	do	they	hang	out?	What	are	their	attitudes	and	language?	Who	do	they	listen	to?	Who	are	their	influencers?			At	the	intervention	phase,	he	recommends	tying	gaming	and	game	theory	into	TMM.	During	the	pre-contemplation	(“I’m	unaware	that	I	have	a	problem”)	a	soft	introduction	of	the	issues	is	introduced	via	game	play.	At	the	contemplation	phase	(“I	need	to	do	something	about	this”)	use	education	through	community	engagement	via	a	Facebook	page.	At	the	preparation	phase	(“I	know	what	I’m	going	to	change”)	provide	recipes	and	other	takeaways	to	make	change	easy.	At	the	action	phase	(“I’ve	recently	changed	my	behaviour”)	encourage	the	audience	to	self-report	through	comments.	And	during	the	maintenance	phase	(“I	haven’t	relapsed”)	use	long-term	contact	through	Facebook	to	help	maintain	behaviours.			During	the	evaluation	phase,	one	should	look	for	contribution	and	indicators	that	demonstrate	success	since	change	is	hard	to	attribute.	Possible	metrics	include:	awareness	(exposure	to	messaging,	game	plays),	contemplation	(engagement	through	a	page,	likes	and	comments),	and	preparation	(uptake	of	tools,	downloads	of	recipes).	To	measure	social	return	on	investment,	online	and	offline	qualitative	and	quantitative	surveys	can	be	used.	Social	media	can	be	used	to	measure	social	capital	in	terms	of	community	make-up	(size	and	segmentation	by	behaviour),	intensity	of	use	(regularity	and	depth	of	engagement)	and	network	data	(number	and	strength	of	connections)	(St	John	2011).		Social	Cognitive	Theory,	originally	called	Social	Learning	Theory	this	is	a	non-static	and	non-linear	model	showing	how	beliefs	operate	together	with	goals,	outcome	expectations,	and	perceived	environmental	impediments	and	facilitators	in	the	regulation	of	motivation,	behaviour,	and	the	state	of	wellbeing.	It	posits	that	behavioural	change	is	embedded	within	the	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 13	perception	of	a	person’s	belief	that	they	can	accomplish	a	goal	(Bandura	2002)	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).			Social	Cognitive	theory	can	be	approached	on	social	media	in	the	following	way.	For	reciprocal	determinism	(what’s	telling	me	to	change?)	one	should	find	the	right	partners,	the	best	ways	to	drive	people/traffic	to	a	site,	and	the	right	social	media	channels.	For	behavioural	capability	(am	I	able	to	make	this	change?)	it’s	important	to	provide	tools,	advice,	training	and	information.	Self-efficacy	(can	I	really	do	this?)	can	be	seen	as	building	confidence	through	the	ability	to	create	new	online	networks.	For	observational	learning	(if	they	can	do	it,	so	can	I),	it’s	important	to	promote	realistic	role	models	that	prove	it’s	possible.	Finally,	to	reinforce	(how	can	I	celebrate	my	achievement)	feedback	mechanisms	can	provide	encouragement.	He	notes	it’s	important	to	use	role	models	who	are	credible	experts,	celebrities,	individual	stories	of	achievement,	wisdom	of	the	crowds	(weight	of	numbers),	and	wisdom	of	friends	(people	you	know	and	trust	in	real	life)	in	the	process	(St	John	2011).		Social	Cognitive	Theory	has	strong	theoretical	links	to	behavioural	economics,	as	Bandura	was	one	of	the	early	theorists	around	identity,	which	has	grown	to	hold	an	important	space	in	behavioural	economic	theory.	The	World	Bank’s	World	2015	Development	Report	on	‘Mind	and	Society’	is	evidence	of	the	growing	role	of	behaviour	economics	in	development,	the	importance	of	behaviour	change	in	development,	and	the	importance	of	identity	in	both	(World	Bank	Group	2015).		Behavioural	Economics	and	Nudge	Theory	emerged	in	2008	from	the	economics	field.	It	proposes	that	“higher	order	positive	pursuits	drive	change	more	productively	than	contemplating	the	elimination	of	risk	or	threat.”	This	theory	posits	that	people	employ	simplifying	models	to	consider	opportunities	that	use	grouping	or	schemas	which	identify	generalized	models,	past	practice,	and	recommendations.	A	‘nudge’	directs	a	person	toward	a	specific	choice	by	changing	the	default	option,	description,	anchor,	or	reference	point.	According	to	this	theory,	social	change	can	be	achieved	using	a	commercial	model	of	choice	direction	while	preserving	a	person’s	individual	freedom	of	choice	(Thaler	and	Sunstein	2008)	(Thaler,	Sunstein	and	Balz	2014).			The	structure	and	mechanisms	of	social	media	have	proven	ideal	for	‘nudging’	because	social	media	sites	collect	and	analyze	the	personal	data	of	their	users	(often	unbeknownst	to	them).	This	data	(in	the	case	of	massively	population	sites	like	Facebook	and	on-line	dating	platforms	for	example)	can	reveal	a	user’s	attitudes,	opinions,	purchases,	habits,	frequented	locations,	political	leanings,	sexual	orientation,	religion	and	more.	Even	when	one	site	does	not	hold	a	huge	amount	of	data	about	an	individual	person,	because	individuals	are	tracked	across	multiple	platforms,	the	combined	data	allows	them	to	be	targeted	and,	in	some	cases,	manipulated	by	malicious	or	nefarious	actors.			 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 14	Mental	Models	can	be	helpful	for	situating	the	cultural	determinants	of	behaviour	and	the	decision-making	process.	People	draw	on	concepts,	categories,	identities,	prototypes,	stereotypes,	causal	narratives,	and	worldviews	from	their	communities	when	they	frame	and	respond	to	experiences.	These	mental	frameworks	help	make	sense	of	how	the	world	works	and	one’s	their	role	in	the	it.	Mental	models	differ	from	social	norms	because	they	do	not	need	to	be	enforced	by	direct	social	pressure	and	do	not	necessarily	focus	on	specific	behaviours.	People	can	hold	onto	multiple,	harmful,	and/or	even	contradictory	mental	models,	and	the	one	they	draw	on	depends	on	how	a	given	context	triggers	a	specific	way	of	understanding	the	world.	Exposing	target	groups	to	experiences	that	broaden	their	mental	models	may	trigger	a	change	in	beliefs	about	what	a	person	is	capable	of	(World	Bank	Group	2015)	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).				Ethical	challenges	have	been	raised,	however,	with	regard	to	nudging	and	mental	models.	These	can	be	seen	as	paternalistic	approaches	which	assume	that	development	agencies,	governments,	or	the	private	sector	should	be	nudging	people	towards	particular	behaviours.	New	Knowledge	highlights	that	nudge	theory	is	seen	by	many	as	paternalistic	in	its	belief	that	people	want	to	follow	their	desires	but	are	content	to	limit	their	choices	to	pre-established	options	and	that	people	are	easily	swayed	towards	solutions	that	others	have	prioritized	for	them.	They	note	the	undue	influence	of	those	who	determine	and	set	the	options	and	how	those	options	are	structured	to	achieve	particular	ends	and	perceived	‘choice’	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).			Examples	like	that	of	Cambridge	Analytica’s	influencing	of	the	US	elections	and	Brexit	in	the	UK,	and	the	accusations	of	Russian	meddling	in	global	democracies	using	social	media	tactics	that	were	perfected	in	the	Ukraine	can	give	pause	for	thinking	about	the	actions	of	any	kind	of	behaviour	change	communication	campaign	that	is	not	fully	transparent.	Choice	architecture	can	be	used	to	oppress	and	manipulate	by	encouraging	a	behaviour	before	a	person	might	willingly	choose	it	on	their	own,	in	other	words,	moving	someone	from	pre-	contemplation	to	action	without	their	having	exercised	agency	or	self-efficacy	in	that	domain.	When	user	profiling	is	conducted	based	on	data	and	people	are	targeted	with	nudges	or	social	media	content	that	pushes	them	to	change	without	their	knowledge,	the	lack	of	transparency	can	be	unsettling	(World	Bank	Group	2015).	The	EU’s	General	Data	Protection	Legislation	(GDPR)	has	specific	legal	orientation	about	what	is	acceptable	profiling	on	social	media	and	other	digital	platforms,	and	stricter	guidance	when	that	profiling	is	on	children	under	the	age	of	13	(and	in	some	EU	countries	the	age	of	16)	(European	Union	2016).			Ecological	Models	of	Behaviour	Change	recognize	multiple	levels	of	influence	(intrapersonal,	interpersonal,	organizational,	community,	and	policy	level)	on	individuals’	behaviours	and	thus	recommend	strategic	interventions	which	address	these	multiple	levels	as	they	influence	individuals	within	their	specific	context.	If	any	layer	of	the	context	includes	substantial	barriers	to	behaviour	change,	an	individual	may	be	less	likely	to	make	that	change,	even	if	motivated	and	regardless	of	whether	they	have	the	necessary	skills	to	make	the	change.	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 15		Ecological	models	are	most	effective	when	informing	behavioural	interventions	and	targeting	very	specific	behaviours	(e.g.,	condom	use),	but	it	can	be	difficult	for	researchers	and	practitioners	to	make	sense	of	how	broader	levels	of	influence	interact	with	levels	more	proximate	to	the	individual	(Sallis,	Owen	and	Fisher	2015).			Social	Norm	Theories.	This	group	of	theories	consider	norms	to	be	the	beliefs	held	about	which	behaviours	are	appropriate	in	a	specific	group.	Social	norms	establish	behaviour	expectations	and	these	in	turn	affect	a	person’s	decisions,	either	by	shuttering	possibilities	or	opening	opportunities.	As	New	Knowledge	point	out,	norms	do	not	influence	actions	in	a	static	way	because	an	individual’s	choices	can	reflect	subtle	or	deep	changes	in	beliefs	and	attitudes	that	occur	because	of	social	interactions.	These	shifting	normative	perceptions	influence	behavioural	change,	and	since	adolescents	are	highly	influenced	by	their	peers,	it	is	important	to	consider	social	norms	and	their	role	in	behaviour	change.			A	2011	study	cited	by	New	Knowledge	assessed	how	offline	perceptions	of	peer	norms	could	influence	whether	adolescents	participate	in	risky	sexual	behaviours	online.	The	findings	indicate	that	both	injunctive	and	descriptive	peer	norms	predicted	whether	an	adolescent	engaged	in	risky	online	sexual	behaviour.	Descriptive	peer	norms	were	more	likely	to	predict	the	risky	behaviour	over	time	(Baumgartner,	Valkenburg	and	Peter	2011).	Adolescents	may,	then,	be	more	influenced	by	how	they	believe	their	peers	actually	behave	than	by	their	peers’	approval	of	a	particular	behaviour.	New	Knowledge	recommends	that	digital	interventions	targeting	adolescents	consider	opportunities	to	illustrate	how	peers	behave	in	ways	that	challenge	or	disrupt	systems	and	social	norms	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).	New	Knowledge	goes	on	to	note	research	showing	that	small	groups	are	often	incubators	of	social	change	and	that	the	formation	of	small,	safe	groups	might	be	a	good	strategy	for	encouraging	collective	identity	development	for	young	people	that	starts	in	a	small	group	and	then	expands	beyond	it,	thus	creating	a	safe	space	for	individual	behaviour	change	and	adoption	of	new	norms	(Fine	and	Harrington	2004)	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).		Narrative	Persuasion	Theories	explain	the	factors	and	processes	that	facilitate	changes	in	audience	members’	knowledge,	attitudes,	and	behaviours.	They	are	commonly	used	in	edutainment	programming.	Elements	of	narrative-based	entertainment	can	help	an	audience	suspend	disbelief,	in	turn	reducing	resistance	to	counter-arguments	(Slater	and	Rounder	2002)	(Moyer-Guse	2008).	Edutainment	programs	often	use	social	cognitive	theory	along	with	direct	exposure	to	media	models	and	indirect	social	learning	through	interpersonal	discussions	(Bandura,	A.	2004).	Narratives	resonate	especially	well	when	the	audience	perceives	the	stories	to	be	realistic	and	relates	with	the	characters	because	of	similarities	or	because	of	their	desirable	attributes	(Moyer-Guse	2008)	(Murphy,	et	al.	2011).	Additionally,	narratives	built	with	familiar	cultural	markers	are	especially	effective	when	targeting	minority	populations	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016)	(Larkey	and	Hecht	2010)	(Lee,	Fawcett	and	DeMarco	2015).			 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 16	
Two	meta-analyses	demonstrated	advantages	of	using	narratives	in	health	interventions,	finding	that	narratives	can	produce	a	sizably	significant	impact	on	combined	changes	in	attitudes,	intention,	and	behaviour,	even	when	they	have	a	relatively	small	effect	on	individual	outcomes.	Narratives	provoke	affective	audience	response,	and	those	delivered	through	audio	and	video	have	been	found	to	be	more	effective	than	those	delivered	through	print.	(Shen,	Sheer	and	Li	2015)	(Zebregs,	et	al.	2015).	Narrative	persuasion	theories	were	used	for	acclaimed	East	Los	High	program	development	for	character	building	and	content	production	and	they	also	guided	evaluation	of	the	programs	in	terms	of	key	measures	and	hypotheses	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).		Diffusion	of	Innovations	Theory	(Rogers	2003)	explains	how	individuals	and	organizations	adopt	innovations—such	as	ideas,	products,	or	services—over	time	and	examines	how	adopters	communicate	and	promote	innovations.	Successful	innovations	typically	spread	gradually	from	a	few	early	adopters	to	the	larger	population.		The	theory	distinguishes	between	5	different	types	of	adopters:	innovators,	early	adopters,	early	majority,	late	majority,	laggards).	It	includes	five	factors	that	determine	adoption	or	rejection	of	a	new	behaviour:	perceived	complexity,	compatibility,	observability,	trialability	and	relative	advantage.	Those	using	this	theory	are	recommended	to	identify	type	of	adopters	to	reach,	develop	a	strategy	(knowledge,	persuasion,	decision,	implementation,	confirmation),	and	design	knowledge	management	products	and	services	to	reach	them.		Right:	The	diffusion	process,	adapted	by	(Ohkubo,	Limaye	and	Harlan	2015)	from	(Rogers	2003).		As	the	graph	shows,	a	curve	plotting	the	cumulative	percentage	of	a	population	adopting	an	innovation	over	time	typically	has	an	S-shape.	Some	innovations	have	a	rapid	rate	of	adoption	(Innovation	1)	and	others	have	a	slower	rate	(Innovation	3).	Critiques	of	the	theory	include	concerns	that	it	does	not	consider	individual	resources	or	social	support	for	behaviour	change	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).		Brand	and	Commercial	Frameworks.	In	recent	years	such	frameworks	have	sometimes	been	adopted	for	SBCC.	One	simple	model	used	by	the	market	research	company	TNS	is	called	the	AIDA:	Awareness,	Interest,	Desire,	Action	model,	where	awareness	refers	to	creating	awareness	of	a	brand,	product,	or	service;	interest	refers	to	getting	people	interested	in	knowing	more	about	it;	desire	refers	to	demonstrating	the	brand	has	benefits	to	the	consumer,	so	that	people	want	to	own	it;	and	action	refers	to	prompting	people	to	take	the	final	step	and	commit	to	purchasing	the	product	(TNS	2016).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 17		The	Nike	Foundation	used	a	“branded	media”	approach	for	its	SBCC	work,	noting	that	brands	have	been	inspiring	people	to	change	behaviour	for	decades.	The	idea	is	that	brands	are	critical	tools	for	achieving	sustained	change	at	scale	because	they	serve	as	integrators	and	unite	a	wide	range	of	actors.	Brands	develop	intangible	benefits,	understanding	and	motivations	and	are	able	to	persuade	people	with	promises	that	draw	them	into	products	or	services	that	are	meaningful	and	that	inspire	people	to	act.	Brands	also	create	communities	around	them	that	people	want	to	be	a	part	of,	and	use	influencers	that	people	want	to	be	like	(Nike	Foundation	2013).		Another	commercial	model	is	the	‘customer	journey’	used	for	discovery	and	use	of	digital	products	and	services.	In	this	model,	five	steps	are	considered:	non-aware	(users	have	potential	to	access	the	service	but	are	not	aware	of	it);	aware	(users	have	become	aware	of	the	service);	cursory	(users	have	not	accessed	the	content	but	have	had	a	superficial	interaction	with	the	service);	occasional	(users	have	engaged	with	the	service	a	limited	number	of	times);	and	repeat	(users	who	have	used	the	services	several	times	and	accessed	content	repeatedly)	(Wills,	Morain	and	Baudeau	2016).	The	customer	journey	model	is	useful	to	understand	if	and	how	users	arrive	to,	interact	with,	and/or	drop	off	of	different	parts	of	a	digital	platform,	service	or	site.	This	in	turn	can	help	designers	to	improve	the	technical	side	(user	interface),	content	or	user	experience	to	ensure	that	users	are	able	to	easily	navigate	through	the	platform	and	so	that	they	stay	there	long	enough	to	interact	with	the	content	(a	necessary	step	along	the	road	to	achieving	impact).		Social	Media	and	‘Transmedia’	Approaches	have	become	increasingly	common	as	mobile	and	Internet	use	has	grown.	In	transmedia	storytelling,	narrative	elements	are	creatively	coordinated	across	different	media	platforms	to	build	a	story	world,	engage	a	broader	audience	and	provide	them	an	enriching	experience	that	goes	beyond	pure	entertainment.	Because	youth	are	increasingly	comfortable	navigating	multiple	digital	platforms,	transmedia	edutainment	holds	promise	as	a	health	promotion	and	education	interventional	tool	(Singhal,	Wang	and	Rogers	2013).	Starting	with	an	underlying	SBCC	theory,	those	using	transmedia	approaches	can	create	a	multi-pronged	approach	by	choosing	a	media	channel	and	messaging	combination	that	is	most	applicable	to	the	desired	type	of	behaviour	change.	This	must	be	based	on	a	thorough	study	of	the	media	habits	and	uses	of	the	target	audience,	however,	or	messages	will	be	flowing	on	channels	that	are	not	accessible	to	the	core	audience	or	that	are	not	conducive	to	the	message	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).	Certain	media	channels,	for	example,	appear	to	work	better	for	one-way	communication,	others	for	interactive	engagement,	and	others	for	complex	learning	(Health	Communication	Capacity	Collaborative	(HC3)	2013).		The	global	human	rights	organization	Breakthrough	implemented	what	they	referred	to	as	a	‘360	degree’	campaign	as	early	as	2008.	Bell	Bajao,	as	the	program	was	called,	was	aimed	at	ending	domestic	violence	in	India.	It	is	an	early	example	of	how	a	multi-pronged,	multi-level	campaign	was	used	to	encourage	social	and	behaviour	change	at	various	levels	of	the	ecological	model.	The	campaign,	developed	by	the	branding	company	Ogilvy-Mather,	worked	through	a	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 18	blog	and	social	media	as	well	as	through	traditional	media	channels	like	TV,	print,	radio	and	a	video	van.	Coupled	with	the	‘air	cover’	(as	they	referred	to	the	mass	media	efforts),	Breakthrough	also	used	a	‘ground	cover’	approach	through	community-based	programming	aimed	at	women’s	right	and	prevention	of	domestic	violence	and	engagement	of	men	and	boys	to	‘ring	the	bell’	against	domestic	violence.	The	campaign	engaged	survivors	of	domestic	violence	themselves,	male	members	of	society	(as	primary	agents	of	change	among	peers	and	networks),	and	wider	society	through	broad	multi-media	education	and	awareness	programs	(Chakraborty	2010).		The	BBC	Media	Action	Ananya	program	in	India	used	a	similar	‘360	degree’	strategy	to	tackle	the	high	levels	of	maternal	and	child	mortality	in	Bihar	state.	Local	community	health	workers	were	equipped	with	‘Mobile	Kunji’	a	deck	of	cards	with	advice	about	maternal	and	child	health.	Each	card	sports	a	unique	code	that	the	community	health	worker	used	to	access	an	audio	message	on	her	phone	that	was	voiced	by	the	character	‘Dr.	Anita’.	The	same	character	appeared	again	in	a	radio	show	called	Khirki	Mehendiwali	(Mehendi	Opens	A	Window)	which	aired	three	times	a	week	and	reinforced	many	of	the	health	messages	through	drama	and	comedy.	In	addition,	a	mobile	information	service	called	Kilkari	allowed	families	to	receive	recorded	messages	from	the	same	Dr.	Anita.	Lastly,	the	campaign	featured	a	televised	social	advertisement	called	Ek	Teen	Do	(One,	Three,	Two)	which	stressed	the	importance	of	leaving	a	three-year	gap	between	pregnancies	(Swarup	2012)	(Bachan	2016).		3.		What	do	current	and	past	digital	SBCC	initiatives	tell	us?			Although	access	to	smart	phones	is	increasing,	as	noted	in	Section	1	above,	those	in	lower	income	brackets	or	who	are	in	other	ways	marginalized	or	restricted	(due	to	location,	gender	or	culture)	may	not	have	access	to	the	Internet	or	to	a	smart	phone.	For	this	reason,	we	cover	available	literature	on	programs	using	low-end,	basic	mobile	phones	(e.g.,	those	that	can	only	call	and	text)	as	well	as	that	on	efforts	designed	for	a	more	robust,	Internet-enabled	approach,	and	multi-media	or	‘transmedia’	approaches.	Much	of	the	earlier	literature	on	low-income	countries	is	focused	on	mHealth	and	the	use	of	SMS,	whereas	the	early	literature	on	Internet-enabled	approaches	tends	to	focus	on	middle-	and	high-income	countries/contexts.			As	access	to	the	Internet,	especially	mobile	Internet,	has	expanded	to	more	youth	in	low-	and	middle-income	countries,	the	literature	has	followed	suit.	However,	there	are	still	strong	barriers	to	access	and	use	of	smart	phones	and	the	Internet	for	many,	perhaps	most,	of	the	poorest	and	most	vulnerable	youth,	especially	youth	in	rural	areas	and	girls	living	in	restrictive	homes	or	socially	controlled	environments.	The	challenge	for	MTV	Nishedh	will	be	to	explore	ways	that	basic	digital	channels	can	be	coupled	with	more	traditional	channels	such	as	television	and	radio,	and	to	future-proof	its	interventions	by	testing	responsible	ways	of	using	emerging	channels	like	WhatsApp,	Facebook	Lite,	or	chatbots	to	enhance	engagement	and	impact.		 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 19	Some	of	the	main	challenges	in	developing	and	evaluating	digital	interventions	for	behaviour	change	in	health	and	health	care	were	summarized	in	a	recent	article,	including:	the	rapid	pace	with	which	technology	changes	and	the	need	to	continually	update	and	adapt;	engagement	with	digital	interventions	often	being	too	limited	to	support	behaviour	change	-	or	the	engagement	is	multidimensional	and	cannot	be	evaluated	simply	by	digital	means;	engagement	may	be	unequal	and	reinforce	disparities	or	inequalities;	there	is	a	theoretical	lack	of	clarity	around	the	mechanisms	through	which	digital	behaviour	change	interventions	have	an	effect;	it	is	difficult	to	specify	meaningful	controls	or	comparators;	the	complex	multi-component	nature	of	digital	interventions	requires	an	iterative	design	and	testing	cycle;	cost-effective	evaluation	models	and	techniques	are	lacking;	funding	mechanisms	are	not	aligned	with	digital	cycles;	there	are	competing	commercial	and	ethical	demands	on	data	ownership	and	intellectual	property;	quality	and	ethical	standards	are	generally	unclear	or	undefined	(Michie,	et	al.	2017).		SMS	for	health	behaviour	change	Several	studies	over	the	past	decade	have	found	that	teens	and	youth	are	open	to	text	messaging	for	health	promotion.	In	one	study	on	whether	SMS	messages	with	reproductive	health	information	were	acceptable	to	Australian	youth,	the	surveyed	youth	said	messages	provided	new	information,	a	reminder	of	existing	information	and	reduced	their	apprehension	around	testing	for	sexually	transmitted	infections	(STIs).	A	randomized	controlled	trial	from	2006-2007	found	those	receiving	SMS	and	email	messages	about	sexual	health	improved	their	knowledge.	In	the	same	study,	females	who	received	messages	were	more	likely	to	get	tested	for	STIs	than	those	who	did	not	receive	any	messages	(Lim	,	et	al.	2011)	(Gold	and	Lim	2010).			Prevention	information	via	text	message	was	found	to	be	effective	with	young	people	aged	10	to	24	in	San	Francisco	(the	SEXINFO	project,	which	targeted	at-risk	African	American	adolescents	with	sexual	health	text	messages)	as	well	as	in	the	Democratic	Republic	of	Congo	(the	Ligne	Verte	hotline,	which	provided	confidential	information	on	family	planning	and	contraceptives	along	with	referrals	to	clinics)	(Toth	and	PSI	DR	Congo	2008).	Text	to	Change	trialed	an	SMS	behaviour	change	approach,	including	an	SMS-based	multiple-choice	quiz,	in	an	effort	to	synergize	communication,	link	with	existing	prevention	campaigns	and	offer	services	for	HIV/AIDS	in	Uganda.	Findings	indicated	that	it	is	critical	to	have	an	extensive	marketing	campaign	(including	radio,	billboards,	and	newspapers),	an	introductory	message	with	an	explanation	of	the	program	and	how	anonymity	is	guaranteed,	a	shorter	program	duration	so	that	people	will	not	lose	interest,	and	various	technical	improvements	(Text	to	Change	2008)	(Mecheal,	et	al.	2010).	(Ippoliti	and	L'Engle	2017).		A	global	brief	on	mHealth	for	adolescent	sexual	reproductive	health	(ASRH)	by	Ippoliti	also	found	that	that	ASRH	information	provided	via	mobile	is	appealing,	feasible,	and	culturally	acceptable	to	youth;	and	that	it	can	positively	influence	youth	SRH	outcomes	by	improving	knowledge,	reducing	sexual	risk	behaviour,	and	increasing	utilization	of	health	services.	mHealth	programs	also	offered	cost-savings	as	compared	to	other	types	of	scaling	models.	Examples	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 20	reviewed	suggest	that	SMS	can	enable	innovative	health	messaging,	including	direct	text/SMS	messages,	role-model	story	lines,	psychosocial	support,	and	counseling.	In	a	different	approach,	in	Ethiopia,	Marie	Stopes	International	sent	electronic	vouchers	(e-vouchers)	directly	to	a	user’s	phone.	The	vouchers	could	be	redeemed	at	an	affiliated	health	facility	for	free	counseling	sessions	on	contraceptive	methods	as	well	as	medical	abortion	and	post-abortion	care	services.	In	terms	of	age,	older	adolescents	(ages	15	and	above)	tended	to	be	the	main	users	of	these	mHealth	interventions,	with	lower	program	uptake	among	younger	adolescents.	(Ippoliti	2017).		Fundamental	and	common	challenges	with	mHealth	for	ASRH	include	access,	security,	infrastructure,	functionality	and	language.	These	need	to	be	addressed	in	design	and	pilot	stages.	Content	should	reflect	both	the	primary	languages	spoken	and	the	vernacular	with	which	youth	feel	most	accustomed.	Because	basic	SMS	is	limited	to	text,	it	can	inhibit	robust	content	provision	and	fall	short	in	engaging	users	in	two-way	communication.	Poor	network	connectivity	is	a	major	issue	affecting	continuity,	reach,	and	quality	of	SMS-based	interventions.	Maintaining	the	security	and	confidentiality	of	user	information	and	data	is	a	major	challenge	for	mobile	and	digital	interventions.	Mobile	phones	are	often	shared	among	family	members	in	lower-income	contexts,	reducing	privacy.	This	is	especially	important	to	consider	when	addressing	sensitive	or	taboo	health	topics	(N.	Ippoliti	2017).		Social	media,	multi-media	and	transmedia	A	2013	review	looked	at	98	research	studies	on	social	media	for	health	communication.	The	methodological	quality	of	the	studies	was	deemed	as	low	-	most	were	exploratory	and	descriptive	rather	than	focused	on	methodology.	Six	key	benefits	of	social	media	were	found:	increased	interaction	with	others;	more	available,	shared,	and	tailored	information;	increased	accessibility	and	widening	access	to	health	information;	peer/	social/	emotional	support;	public	health	surveillance;	and	potential	to	influence	health	policy.	Limitations	included	those	related	to	quality,	lack	of	reliability,	confidentiality,	and	privacy.	Users	are	largely	unaware	of	data	privacy	and	confidentiality,	data	security	and	the	dangers	of	disclosing	personal	health	information	online	or	over	via	insecure	means	such	as	text	message	(Moorhead,	et	al.	2013).		A	2014	study	on	social	media	and	transmedia’s	influence	on	child	health	covered	10	studies,	most	of	which	were	focused	on	multiple-media	platforms	that	were	not	strictly	transmedia	or	social	media	per	se.	There	were	limited	findings	that	could	point	to	multimedia	platforms	on	healthy	behaviours	directly	influencing	child	survival.	However,	the	authors	did	find	studies	that	showed	a	positive	impact	on	changes	in	attitudes,	awareness,	and	knowledge.	Wider	findings	included	that	behaviour	change	interventions	were	most	effective	when	people	were	engaged	on	multiple	levels;	in	other	words,	when	initiatives	included	“behavioural	(performance-based	techniques);	social	(interpersonal	and	small	media);	sensory	(mass	media,	materials);	cognitive	(problem	solving)”.	It	could	not	be	determined	from	the	existing	studies	the	extent	to	which	one	technique	was	more	effective	than	another	(Higgs,	et	al.	2014).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 21		Cases	to	explore	further	Four	recent	entertainment-education	initiatives	aimed	at	young	people	that	incorporated	social	media	and	digital	engagement	for	SBCC	are:	MTV’s	16	and	Pregnant,	East	Los	High,	Voices	for	Change’s	Purple,	and	the	Norwegian	Broadcasting	Company’s	SKAM.	These	are	worth	examining	further	because	although	they	are	not	a	perfect	fit	for	MTV	Nishedh,	they	offer	various	insights	on	using	SBCC	theory	in	the	development	of	EE	for	youth	with	a	gender	focus,	incorporating	digital	aspects	into	multi-media	and	transmedia	approaches,	and	gathering	feedback	and	measuring	results	through	digital	channels.	16	and	Pregnant		This	program	followed	the	lives	of	pregnant	teenagers	in	the	United	States	in	the	final	months	of	their	pregnancy	and	their	first	experiences	of	motherhood.	A	2015	study	matched	Vital	Statistics	birth	data	to	Nielsen	television	ratings	data	to	determine	whether	exposure	to	the	show	had	an	impact	on	teen	childbearing	rates.	Results	implied	that	the	show	led	to	a	4.3	percent	reduction	in	teen	births	in	the	18	months	following	its	initial	airing.	The	authors	believe	this	can	account	for	24	percent	of	the	overall	decline	in	teen	births	in	the	US	during	that	period.	They	supplemented	their	findings	with	data	from	Google	Trends	and	Twitter,	which	suggested	that	the	show	led	to	increased	interest	in	contraceptive	use	and	abortion	(Kearney	and	Levine	2015).			The	show	garnered	mixed	reactions,	with	critics	believing	that	the	show	glamorized	teen	pregnancy	by	making	the	women	featured	into	reality	stars.	A	study	for	the	National	Campaign	to	Prevent	Teen	and	Unplanned	Pregnancy	(Albert	2010)	reported	that	82	percent	of	teens	who	watched	the	show	said	it	helped	teens	better	understand	the	challenges	of	pregnancy	and	parenthood	whereas	only	17	percent	said	it	glamorized	teen	pregnancy.			Researcher,	Jennifer	Aubrey,	questioned	these	earlier	findings,	noting	that	“conclusions	are	based	on	correlational	results	of	aggregate	data	–	there	was	a	bigger	drop	in	teen	pregnancy	in	areas	where	teenagers	were	watching	more	MTV	programming,	not	only	the	16	and	Pregnant	series…	They	are	looking	at	data	at	the	aggregate	level	but	making	assumptions	about	what	is	happening	at	the	individual	level,	saying	that	16	and	Pregnant	is	effective	sex	education	for	teens"	(Harwood	2014).	Aubrey’s	own	study	suggests	that	those	who	identified	the	least	with	the	mothers	on	the	show	had	the	most	negative	attitudes	upon	viewing	it,	whereas	those	reporting	the	highest	level	of	affinity	and	homophily	had	more	positive	attitudes	toward	teen	pregnancy.	These	researchers	also	found	that	teens	who	thought	they	were	similar	to	the	pregnant	teens	were	more	likely	to	have	a	lower	perception	of	their	own	risk	for	pregnancy,	higher	acceptance	of	myths	about	teen	pregnancy	and	a	more	favorable	attitude	with	regard	to	teen	pregnancy,	and	that	teens	who	felt	a	‘friendship	relationship’	with	the	teen	moms	also	had	a	decreased	behavioural	intention	to	avoid	pregnancy	(Behm-Morawitz,	et	al.	2017).		 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 22	East	Los	High		This	was	a	transmedia	education-entertainment	program	aimed	at	young	Latina/o	Americans.	The	program	embedded	educational	messages	in	entertainment	narratives	across	digital	platforms	to	promote	sexual	and	reproductive	health.	East	Los	High	was	developed	to	reach,	engage	and	influence	young	Latina/o	Americans	on	the	topic	of	adolescent	pregnancy	and	better	sexual	reproductive	health.	One	in	three	Latina	adolescents	in	the	US	become	pregnant	before	they	are	20	years	old	(1.5	times	the	national	average),	yet	there	are	very	few	effective	health	interventions	aimed	at	Latina/o	youth	in	the	US.	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).			East	Los	High	aimed	to	create	a	culturally	sensitive	intervention.	It	was	designed	to	subvert	the	stereotypes	of	Latina/o	characters	as	gardeners,	maids	and	gang	members.	The	plot	covered	realistic	issues	that	young	Latinas/os	face	and	offered	multiple	entry	points	for	Latina/o	youth,	who	avidly	consume	drama	and	digital	entertainment,	through	their	preferred	platform	(Jenkins	2006)	(Castro	2013)	(Lopez,	Gonzalez-Barrera	and	Patten	2013).	The	team	took	a	strategic	approach	based	on	existing	media	habits.	Latinas/os	are	40	percent	more	likely	than	the	general	population	to	watch	television	and	videos	online	or	on	a	smartphone,	and	3	times	more	likely	to	check	(via	social	media)	what	programs	their	friends	are	watching	(Razzetti	2012).			East	Los	High	was	available	on	the	Hulu	web-streaming	site,	and	at	the	end	of	each	episode,	viewers	were	encouraged	to	visit	the	website	where	they	could	access	additional	transmedia	narrative	extensions,	for	example,	an	extended	scene	where	a	character	talked	with	a	health	counselor	about	condom	use,	or	a	set	of	video	logs	from	one	of	the	main	characters.	From	any	of	the	extension	materials,	viewers	could	visit	a	resources	page,	find	local	health	clinics	based	on	their	location,	or	click	other	links	for	more	information.	The	transmedia	extensions	were	promoted	on	Facebook,	Twitter	and	Instagram.	Engagement	with	the	show	and	other	materials	were	tracked	through	web	analytics,	viewer	surveys,	social	network	analysis	and	content	analysis	to	understand	social	dynamics,	message	framing	and	user	generated	content	on	East	Los	High’s	social	media	sites	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).	Voices	for	Change	(V4C)		V4C	was	a	very	broad	program	geared	towards	strengthening	the	enabling	environment	for	gender	equality	in	Nigeria.	It	applied	social	norms	theory	at	scale	and	aimed	to	address	structural	barriers	to	gender	equality,	in	particular,	discriminatory	and	harmful	attitudes,	behaviours	and	social	norms.	V4C	sought	to	change	three	normative	areas:	women’s	voice	and	leadership,	women’s	role	in	decision	making,	and	violence	against	women	and	girls.	The	program	targeted	young	women	and	men	aged	16-25	years	old	and	operated	in	four	states	in	Nigeria	for	some	activities	and	for	others	it	covered	the	whole	country.			Believing	that	change	needed	to	happen	at	scale	(e.g.,	at	individual	level	and	also	within	wider	society),	the	program	worked	at	multiple	levels:	individual	(providing	girls	and	young	women	with	the	skills,	knowledge	and	confidence	to	challenge	discriminatory	social	norms	and	create	change	in	their	colleges,	homes,	workplaces	and	communities);	community	(engaging	men	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 23	boys,	religious	and	traditional	leaders,	and	networks	of	women	and	girls	to	create	a	critical	mass	of	support	for	gender	equality,	accelerating	change	and	shifting	negative	norms);	and	social-structural	level	(changing	discriminatory	laws,	creating	better	policies,	directing	assets	towards	women	and	girls,	sending	a	message	about	changed	social	norms	through	political	and	legal	structures)	(Fraser,	Ekeoba	and	Feather	2017).		V4C	was	underpinned	with	a	Theory	of	Change	(ToC)	expressing	a	long-term	(20	year)	vision	for	gender	equality.	Three	domains	(Self,	Society	and	Formal	Institutions)	were	the	core	sites	at	which	change	was	sought.	The	domain	of	the	‘Self’	is	the	personal	transformation	foundation	for	diffusing	changes	more	widely.	The	‘Society’	domain	is	aimed	at	changing	social	norms	at	scale	and	laying	foundations	for	a	gender	equality	movement.	The	‘Formal	Institutions’	domain	is	where	legal	and	policy	changes	can	support	and	create	population-wide	social	changes.	The	ToC	envisions	changes	towards	gender	equality	in	each	domain	that	work	together	to	amplify	and	strengthen	the	broader	enabling	environment	for	gender	equality	(Milward	and	Nelson	2017).		V4C’s	program	strategy	worked	at	two	levels	–	‘scale’	(which	targeted	young	people	society-wide	in	the	four	states	with	a	branded	communications	campaign),	and	‘focused	intensive’	(which	created	intensive	learning	opportunities	in	both	face-to-face	and	online	spaces	for	key	individuals	selected	for	their	potential	to	amplify	and	promote	the	change	once	they	had	gone	through	their	own	personal	transformation).	Different	interventions	were	designed	for	each	level	and	these	drew	on	two	models	of	change:	a	‘scale	model,’	which	centralized	an	idea	of	the	diffusion	of	new	attitudes	and	behaviours	concerning	gender	equality,	and	social	norms	change	as	the	catalyst	for	this;	and	a	‘stages	of	change’	model	where	individuals	go	through	different	steps	of	Pre-	Contemplation;	Contemplation	or	Awareness	Raising;	Planning	the	change	/	Persuasion;	Action;	and	Maintenance,	and	which	centralized	an	idea	of	self-transformation	as	the	foundation	(Voices	for	Change	2017).		The	selection	of	participants	for	intensive	programming	was	based	on	the	diffusion	model	(Who	would	be	best	placed	to	drive	diffusion?)	The	stages	of	change	model	drove	the	content	and	immediate	objectives	for	the	intensive	inputs.	A	branded	communications	campaign,	‘Purple’,	worked	alongside	these	to	stimulate	initial	stages	of	change	among	a	wider	population,	and	prepare	that	population	for	the	diffusion	effects	carried	forward	by	key	influencers,	while	also	creating	a	sense	of	society-wide	approval	for	the	changes,	as	part	of	the	social	norms	approach.	The	strategy	used	a	wide	range	of	communications	channels	with	the	aim	of	achieving	a	layered	experience	in	which	individuals	were	addressed	with	similar	messages	through	different	media	/	interventions.	Some	areas	were	‘saturated’	with	multiple	messages,	so	that	a	changing	population	would	be	supported,	and	changes	reinforced,	from	different	sources.	In	short,	the	media	campaign	aimed	to	create	the	conditions	for	diffusion.	The	Purple	brand	aimed	to	spread	the	ideas	widely	so	that	diffusion	by	key	influencers	would	be	amplified	and	accelerated	at	scale	by	diffusion	via	new	social	norming.	Lastly,	legal	and	policy	change	buttressed	these	areas,	and	evidence	generation	aimed	to	stimulate	discussion	and	debate.	V4C	used	a	range	of	quantitative	and	qualitative	tools	to	track	results,	create	an	evidence	base	for	strategic	mid-program	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 24	adjustments,	and	lay	a	foundation	for	understanding	outcomes	(Voices	for	Change	2017).			A	study	to	determine	brand	awareness	of	Purple	showed	that	it	was	highest	in	post-secondary	institutions	where	Purple	activities	were	taking	place.	Awareness	among	those	outside	post-secondary	institutions,	whose	contact	with	Purple	was	through	media	sources	alone,	was	superficial	and	understanding	of	the	message	was	vague.	Awareness	of	the	Purple	website	was	very	low,	at	2%	of	the	total	sample,	which	was	problematic	given	the	centrality	of	the	online	campaign	in	the	strategy.	There	was	a	lack	of	clarity	around	the	Purple	“Call	to	Action.”	Young	people	did	not	know	what	a	next	step	towards	action	would	be	for	them.	Though	the	site	offered	examples	of	actions	(talking	to	a	friend,	encouraging	a	relative	to	speak	up)	the	site	needed	to	be	much	clearer	about	what	people	were	supposed	to	do	after	exposure	to	the	campaign	(TNS	2016).		An	endline	report	(Denny	and	Hughes	2017)	on	the	V4C	program	found	that	large	scale	changes	in	young	people’s	gender	attitudes	and	behaviours	took	place	in	the	four	target	states	over	the	2014-2017	period;	however	the	exact	contribution	V4C	made	to	improved	attitudes	and	behaviours	was	difficult	to	ascertain.	There	is	compelling	evidence	that	the	Purple	brand	was	an	important	(and	likely	underestimated)	driver	of	change	in	almost	all	areas.	V4C	actions	in	the	self	and	society	domains	had	a	positive	effect,	irrespective	of	cultural	context	or	the	original	starting	point	in	a	state.	Physical	Safe	Spaces	were	found	to	be	particularly	effective,	especially	given	their	ability	to	mobilize	young	people	to	diffuse	new	attitudes	and	behaviours	to	others.			Radio	was	one	of	the	most	effective	methods	of	promoting	positive	gender	attitudes	and	behaviour,	especially	outside	of	media-saturated	Lagos,	and	radio	was	the	most	successful	in	reaching	poorer	groups.	V4C	intentionally	took	forward	a	multi-media	campaign	to	saturate	young	people	with	consistent	messages	from	different	sources,	giving	a	sense	of	society	wide	support	for	new	norms.	The	program,	however,	had	limited	effect	is	in	changing	young	people’s	attitudes	and	behaviours	to	violence	against	women	and	girls.	Reasons	for	this	were	not	clear	but	could	involve	people	being	more	aware	of	what	constitutes	violence	and	therefore	reporting	violence	where	previously	they	would	not,	or	it	could	be	that	factors	other	than	social	norms	were	strong	influencing	factors.	Online	spaces	were	not	as	impactful	as	hoped.	They	require	careful	moderation	to	be	effective,	and	even	when	that	is	happening,	online	users	are	likely	to	be	accessing	other	websites	or	social	media	platforms	that	are	not	regulated	in	the	same	way,	meaning	that	they	are	also	exposed	to	counterproductive	views	and	this	can	undermine	the	results	achieved.			Key	learnings	from	V4C	include:	that	brand	can	move	young	people	to	change	attitudes	and	behaviours,	and	potentially	take	action.	The	Purple	brand	also	provided	the	“glue”	for	program	interventions	and	created	a	layered	effect	that	was	infused	throughout	all	communications	and	digital	content.	The	diffusion	model	can	be	a	useful	as	a	way	to	frame	behaviour	adoptions,	and	knowledge,	skills	and	self-confidence	are	important	for	supporting	diffusion	of	new	behaviours.	Working	with	men	and	boys	was	central	to	achieving	change	at	scale.		Intensive	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 25	program	effects	seemed	to	be	strongest	among	men	as	they	were	associated	with	dramatically	higher	rates	of	change	and	positive	beliefs	compared	to	men	in	the	general	population,	suggesting	that	carefully	constructed	education	about	gender	in	safe,	supportive	environments	has	transformative	effects	particularly	among	men.	Men	sometimes	responded	to	messaging	more	strongly	than	women,	notable	in	early-stage	change	dimensions	such	as	contemplation,	and	this	suggests	that	differences	in	the	‘starting	point’	of	people	engaging	with	Purple	influenced	the	scale	of	change.	In	challenging	contexts	(for	example,	religiously	conservative	ones),	getting	messaging	‘right’	can	unlock	an	even	greater	scope	for	change	than	in	less	challenging	contexts.	(Denny	and	Hughes	2017).		The	V4C	endline	found	that	digital	approaches	significantly	helped	to	get	issues	of	gender	equality	into	public	debate,	adding	visibility	and	reach	to	intensive	programming.	The	depth	of	engagement	with	the	content	was	a	critical	component,	with	implications	both	for	how	these	tools	are	used	as	well	as	for	measurement	of	their	impact.	In	moderated	spaces,	attitudes	and	behaviours	changed	–	likely	because	people	had	the	opportunity	to	reflect	and	debate	online.	Social	media	use	in	general,	however,	is	correlated	with	less	positive	individual	change	related	to	violence	against	women	and	girls,	possibly	due	to	other	harmful	gender	messages	and	imagery	accessed	online.	Together	these	findings	suggest	the	need	for	close	moderation	of	on-line	platforms	and	the	need	for	combining	digital	approaches	with	other	more	intensive	communications	approaches,	including	safe	spaces	and	moderated	radio	discussions	to	achieve	more	consistent	changes	in	attitudes	and	practices.	Another	point	related	to	digital	is	that	using	a	variety	of	media	tools	was	important	in	responding	to	different	targeting	objectives.	Online	spaces	had	some	bias	towards	a	better	educated	population	–	and	a	more	socially	connected	one.	Radio	had	the	widest	reach,	and	was	also	effective	at	reaching	lower-educated,	poorer	parts	of	the	population	(Denny	and	Hughes	2017).	SKAM		SKAM	was	a	character-driven	online	drama	series	produced	by	the	Norwegian	Broadcasting	Company	(NRK)	that	aired	in	Norway	and	garnered	a	teen	following	in	the	rest	of	the	world.	The	SKAM	storyline	was	placed	‘so	close	to	reality	that	it	could	be	true’	(Nyborg	2012).	The	story	was	revealed	daily	and	in	‘real	time’	on	a	blog	using	video	clips,	chat	messages	and	pictures	and	the	audience	was	encouraged	to	comment	and	engage.	SKAM	took	its	lead	from	digital	and	transmedia	storytelling,	integrating	multiple	texts	to	create	a	narrative	where	‘each	medium	does	what	it	does	best’	(Jenkins	2006)	and	inviting	the	audience	to	be	part	of	the	process.	SKAM	built	on	an	earlier	online	drama	series	that	tried	to	tackle	serious	issues	and	to	give	teen	girls	authentic	examples	of	how	to	cope	with	life.	The	Norwegian	Broadcasting	Company	picked	up	the	idea	and	decided	in	2014	to	develop	a	similar	concept	for	an	audience	of	16-year-old	Norwegian	girls.	The	tighter	audience	target	served	to	more	specifically	tailor	content	(Nyborg	2012)	(Fladalen	2016).			The	team	did	extensive	audience	research	with	teens	all	over	Norway,	including	interviews,	reports	and	statistics,	social	media	scanning,	and	school	visits	with	the	goal	of	understanding	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 26	Norwegian	teens	and	identifying	how	a	new	online	drama	concept	could	serve	their	needs	(Magnus	2017).	The	point	was	to	create	content	that	was	catchy,	relevant	and	authentic	for	teens,	said	the	SKAM	producer;	‘It	had	to	have	truth	and	honesty	about	their	own	culture,	something	they	hadn’t	seen	anywhere	before	and	couldn’t	get	anywhere	else.	They	had	to	relate	to	it	and	identify	with	it	more	than	any	other	series’	(Pickard	2016).	The	resulting	show	was	an	online	drama	series	following	a	cast	of	teenagers	at	a	High	School	in	Oslo	as	they	navigated	life	both	at	home	and	school.	Elements	from	television	drama,	sitcom	and	soap	opera	were	combined	to	tell	the	stories	(Fladalen	2016).			SKAM	was	produced	and	published	across	multiple	media	platforms	selected	to	fit	Norwegian	teens’	natural	media	habits.	The	main	place	was	the	SKAM	website	(skam.p3.no)	which	had	video	clips,	chat	messages	and	pictures	published	on	a	daily	basis	during	each	season.	The	key	characters	also	had	Instagram	accounts.	These	were	used	as	intermediaries	between	the	fictional	universe	and	the	audience,	allowing	a	‘fictional	slide	into	reality’,	which	was	the	signature	feature	of	the	series	(Magnus	2016).	On	Fridays,	video	clips	were	combined	into	a	full	episode	that	was	made	available	on	NRK’s	mobile	app	and	their	youth	channel.	SKAM	worked	both	as	an	online	drama	told	across	multiple	platforms	and	as	traditional	television.	All	essential	information	went	into	video	clips,	and	other	platforms	fleshed	out	the	storylines	and	characters	to	keep	them	relevant	and	in	sync	with	current	events’	(Furevold-Boland	2016).			The	storyline	was	published	“in	real	time”	so	that	it	had	a	continuity	that	was	different	from	weekly	television	shows	or	from	binge-watching	(popular	on	Netflix).	The	story	blended	into	viewers’	real	lives,	which	enhanced	the	reality-fiction	blurring,	and	the	scheduling	was	also	driven	by	the	story	and	characters.	For	example,	in	one	episode,	a	character	sent	another	a	text	message	at	17:32,	the	message	was	uploaded	to	the	SKAM	site	at	the	same	time	(Magnus	2017)	This	also	means	that	the	publishing	was	irregular	and	unpredictable,	making	the	audience	check	back	more	often	for	news	or	updates.	Users	engaged	to	debate	the	storyline	in	multiple	places,	but	of	most	interest	to	the	producers	was	the	comments	section	where	discussions	took	place	after	every	update.	The	SKAM	team	used	the	audience	comments	to	adjust	the	storyline	(Magnus	2017).	Fans	also	discussed	SKAM	on	social	media.	Fan	activity	ranged	from	serious	discussions	of	key	themes	to	speculation,	selfies,	fan	fiction,	art,	memes	and	gifs.	Fan-generated	content	helped	fill	in	gaps	between	the	updates	and	allowed	SKAM	to	be	an	ongoing	and	immersive	experience	(Atkinson	2016)	(Schanke	Sundet	2017).	(Nyborg	2012).		Virtual	versus	in-person	behaviour	change		An	unpublished	report	for	Girl	Effect	from	the	Behavioural	Insights	Team	(BIT),	a	group	that	applies	behavioural	science	and	nudge	theory	to	social	and	governmental	problems,	explored	a	series	of	questions	related	to	the	effectiveness	of	virtual	reference	groups	for	behaviour	change.	They	found	that	there	is	limited	evidence	on	whether	online	groups	for	behaviour	change	work,	but	that	the	evidence	that	does	exist	suggests	that	online	groups	can	be	effective,	though	engagement	and	retention	may	need	to	be	addressed.	Offline	groups,	peer	influencers	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 27	buddies	do	have	power	to	influence	behaviour,	though	this	may	be	more	likely	for	behaviours	that	are	visible,	and	it’s	not	entirely	clear	how	this	might	transfer	to	the	online	environment	(The	Behavioral	Insights	Team	2018).		BIT’s	findings	include	that	although	participants	don’t	need	to	know	one	another	to	make	an	online	group	effective,	behaviour	change	interventions	may	be	more	effective	if	individuals	in	the	group	are	more	demographically	similar	(e.g.,	are	part	of	the	same	in-group)	(The	Behavioral	Insights	Team	2018).	This	finding	is	supported	by	the	earlier	example	in	this	paper	of	East	Los	High’s	resonance	with	Latina/os,	however,	it	would	be	important	to	consider	messaging	–	in	the	case	of	16	and	Pregnant,	the	young	people	who	most	related	to	the	teenage	moms	tended	to	embrace	the	non-desired	behaviours.	BIT’s	review	of	the	literature	found	four	meta-analyses	that	directly	compared	digital	and	in-person	interventions	for	behaviour	change.	These	covered	only	health	interventions	and	online	learning,	but	based	on	those	limited	studies,	BIT	suggests	that	both	in	person	and	digital	interventions	can	be	impactful,	and	blended	interventions	are	very	promising.	This	aligns	with	earlier	suggestions	in	this	paper	that	multi-media	and	transmedia	approaches	are	more	effective	than	single	pronged	ones.			A	study	in	Chile	compared	in-person	peer	support	and	SMS	reminders	and	showed	that	digital	reminders	can	be	just	as	effective	as	in-person	ones.	In	this	study,	savings	increased	among	members	of	groups	who	met	once	a	week	and	had	to	publicly	announce	their	savings	commitment.	In	a	follow	up	study,	text	messages	about	savers’	progress	and	the	aggregate	behaviour	of	their	peers	was	as	effective	as	savings	groups	and	adding	in	a	‘savings	buddy’	for	face-to-face	meetings	had	no	additional	effect.	The	researchers	hypothesized	that	accountability	and	reminders	were	important	ways	to	encourage	certain	behaviours	(Kast,	Meier	and	Pomeranz	2012).	BIT	concludes	that	when	online	and	in-person	methods	are	directly	compared,	success	is	probably	due	to	overall	program	and	not	attributable	to	a	distribution	channel	(Behavioral	Insights	Team	2018).	This	finding	aligns	with	a	wide	body	of	research	and	practice	regarding	technology	interventions	across	sectors	and	countries	–	in	other	words,	a	single	technology	intervention	is	usually	not	enough	to	claim	direct	attribution,	and	there	are	normally	multiple	factors	in	the	external	environment	as	well	as	in	program	design	that	influence	how	effective	a	particular	channel	is	in	terms	of	behaviour	change.		BIT	posits	that	social	media	allows	for	public	commitments,	and	that	these	can	be	useful	for	holding	people	accountable	to	each	other.	In	addition,	they	note	that	behaviour	and	social	norms	often	change	because	of	iterative	social	referencing.	Because	digital	communication	makes	reminders	and	quick	communication	easy,	reminders	have	proven	to	be	an	important	aspect	of	behaviour	change	programs	(including	when	they	are	incorporated	alongside	other	interventions).	BIT	recommends	that	they	should	be	incorporated	often	into	online	groups.	Reminders	are	most	effective	when	they	provide	feedback	on	performance,	remind	a	person	of	their	goals,	highlight	positive	social	norms,	or	are	signed	by	a	person	that	recipients	know	and	trust	(e.g.	a	job	center	coach,	friend	or	teacher)	(Behavioral	Insights	Team	2018).		 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 28	Other	aspects	covered	by	the	BIT	literature	review	include	the	importance	of	supporting	introverts	or	people	who	may	be	shy	or	timid.	Digital	groups,	they	note,	might	allow	introverts	to	engage	more	actively	than	they	would	in	person.	They	also	note	that	people	are	more	likely	to	engage	when	it	is	easy.	Moving	certain	activities	online	may	cut	out	significant	friction	costs	and	barriers	and	allow	people	to	engage	from	the	places	and	at	the	times	that	are	most	convenient	to	them.	Lastly,	they	suggest	that	people	might	be	more	honest	about	their	own	negative	behaviours	in	an	anonymous	setting,	as	they	feel	less	judgment.	This	can	backfire	however,	if	anonymity	leads	to	less	social	restraint	and	more	negative	engagement	(e.g.	bullying,	hate	speech	trolling	or	harassment)	on	an	online	site	(Behavioral	Insights	Team	2018).			4.	Good	practice	and	common	pitfalls	in	digital	SBCC	design		Design	of	digital	SBCC	programs	must	take	into	consideration	a	number	of	aspects,	including:	users’	media	and	technology	habits,	engaging	and	effective	messaging,	and	appropriate	and	accessible	channels	for	messages.	Good	practices	are	summarized	below.		Ground	efforts	in	theory	SBCC	programs	should	be	grounded	in	appropriate,	relevant	and	updated	theory.	Often	in	SBCC	programming,	there	is	limited	or	no	attention	to	behaviour	change	theory	or	a	reliance	on	outdated	or	simplistic	theory).	Behavioural	determinants	need	to	expand	beyond	the	individual	level	to	consider	context,	environment	and	inter-personal	determinants.	Implementers	should	find	ways	to	understand	and	respond	to	the	complexity	of	underlying	determinants	of	behaviour	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).		Understand	the	target	population	and	the	social	context	(social	norms/gender	norms)	It	is	critical	to	understand	the	target	population	(including	their	willingness	to	change).	More	successful	approaches	are	context-specific	and	rooted	in	an	understanding	of	current	behaviour,	its	social,	environmental,	economic	and	motivational	determinants,	and	potential	obstacles	to	change.	Interventions	that	are	more	deeply	embedded	in	context	may	be	perceived	as	more	relevant	and	thus	may	be	more	effective	in	triggering	behaviour	change.		Knowledge	and	awareness	are	usually	insufficient	for	change	to	occur,	and	programs	need	to	address	wider	barriers	to	behaviour	change	such	as	economic	and	cultural	factors	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).	In	a	program	encouraging	voluntary	testing	and	counseling	uptake,	for	example,	contributions	of	mobile	health	messaging	were	found	to	be	counterbalanced	by	the	persistence	of	blaming	attitudes	and	emergence	of	new	sources	of	stigma	associated	with	anti-retroviral	provision	(Mecheal,	et	al.	2010).			Research	conducted	by	2CV	and	Girl	Effect	with	adolescent	girls	in	several	countries	was	aimed	at	better	understanding	girls’	information	needs,	the	researchers	created	a	set	of	24	cards	with	topics	on	them	and	girls	worked	collaboratively	in	small	groups	to	sort	the	cards	into	piles	of	“I	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 29	am	not	interested	in	this/don’t	want	this	information”	“I	am	interested	in	this	but	I	already	get	it”	and	“I	am	interested	in	this	and	I	don’t	know	where	to	find	it.”	The	girls	then	discussed	the	cards	and	prioritized	them	into	their	top	interests.	The	researchers	were	also	able	to	ask	probing	questions	in	an	aim	to	determine	whether	any	topics	in	the	“I’m	not	interested”	pile	were	too	embarrassing	to	talk	about	in	public	but	might	be	secretly	of	interest	to	the	girls	in	the	target	group.	Additionally,	a	“secret	envelope”	was	passed	around	where	girls	could	ask	questions	that	they	were	too	shy	to	ask	in	front	of	other	girls,	and	this	information	was	useful	for	researchers	to	then	design	content	in	ways	that	would	give	girls	the	information	they	needed	in	ways	that	were	adapted	to	their	levels	of	comfort	(Girl	Effect	and	2CV	2017).		Understand	and	design	for	user	habits,	preferences,	and	interests	A	nuanced	understanding	of	media	and	technology	access	and	use	is	critical.	This	includes	the	devices,	channels,	media	sources,	influencers,	data	packages,	network	strength,	and	other	elements	that	are	directly	related	to	whether	and	how	people	access	and	use	digital	devices,	services	and	platforms.	Review	of	a	free	information	hotline	in	Madagascar,	for	example,	explored	users’	channel	preferences	and	the	pros	and	cons	of	accessing	the	hotline	via	IVR,	SMS	and	USSD.	Most	users	wanted	to	listen	to	messages,	not	read	them,	making	IVR	more	appropriate	for	the	population	who	had	low	literacy	levels.	However,	some	users	wanted	to	store	the	information	received	on	their	phones,	and	SMS	was	preferable	in	their	case.	‘Discoverability’	was	better	with	SMS	messages	as	compared	to	IVR,	however,	meaning	more	users	found	out	about	the	service	by	SMS	(Wills,	Morain	and	Baudeau	2016).			Those	designing	and	implementing	SBCC	programs	with	digital	or	mobile	components	should	also	be	careful	about	making	assumptions	based	on	high-level	data.	‘Ground-truthing’	needs	to	take	place	so	that	a	nuanced	understanding	guides	design.	An	example	is	a	program	in	Sierra	Leone	where	implementers	assumed	that	the	more	marginalized	the	community,	the	lower	the	mobile	phone	access	for	adolescent	girls.	Since	the	community	had	no	mobile	coverage	or	radio	signal	and	was	strictly	Muslim,	it	was	assumed	the	girls	would	be	hard	to	reach,	however	girls	had	a	lot	of	access	to	mobile	because	parents	would	send	girls	several	miles	out	of	the	community	with	the	family	mobile	to	check	messages	and	call	family	members,	and	girls	would	then	have	plenty	of	time	alone	with	the	phone	(Bachan	2016)			2CV	and	Girl	Effect	‘s	research	(mentioned	above)	found	that	girls’	had	a	rich	and	varied	habits	which	varied	by	their	location	within	a	particular	country	(e.g.,	urban	or	rural).	Relatively	wealthier	girls	in	some	countries	had	greater	access	to	mobiles	than	their	out-of-school	counterparts,	whereas	in	other	countries	girls	who	were	wealthier	were	usually	in	school	and	it	was	considered	inappropriate	for	them	to	have	phones,	however	girls	who	were	out	of	school	tended	to	have	jobs	as	well	as	phones	(Girl	Effect	and	2CV	2017).			Watch	out	for	cost	and	data	limitations	Low	income	users	tend	to	have	very	frugal	access	habits,	and	SBCC	programs	aimed	at	these	populations	should	carefully	consider	how	to	minimize	data	consumption.	This	means	that	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 30	programs	need	to	be	designed	for	those	who	have	limited	minutes	or	text	messages	allowed.	Even	if	they	have	smart	phones,	they	may	be	mostly	offline	and	rarely	connected.	Some	popular	smart	phones	come	equipped	with	applications	like	WhatsApp	and	Facebook	Lite	or	free	Facebook	pre-installed,	and	some	data	packages	come	with	a	certain	number	of	minutes	for	these	specific	platforms.	Because	of	this,	users	may	spend	most	of	their	time	inside	of	those	platforms,	making	it	difficult	to	reach	them	elsewhere	(de	Lanerolle,	Walton	and	Schoon	2017).		Think	carefully	about	language	and	literacy	mHealth	interventions	for	disease	prevention	often	use	text	messages	for	health	information,	motivating	individuals,	and	encouraging	self-management,	however	illiteracy	can	be	an	issue	if	basing	outreach	on	SMS	(Mecheal,	et	al.	2010).	Language	can	also	be	a	politicizing	factor.	When	the	V4C	program	was	being	implemented	in	Nigeria,	the	question	came	up	of	whether	to	use	English,	Hausa	or	other	local	languages.	Research	with	stakeholders,	including	an	online	survey,	WhatsApp	surveys	with	non-Hausa	speakers,	review	of	traffic	and	engagement	data	was	conducted.	In	addition,	a	social	media	discussion	was	launched	around	whether	a	Hausa	website	was	appropriate	for	Nigeria	or	if	it	would	spark	political	/	social	issues	or	feelings	of	preferences	or	exclusion.	Hausa	speakers	strongly	supported	translating	the	website	and	its	advertising	into	Hausa.	However,	Brand	Ambassadors	and	facilitators	felt	that	localization	should	not	be	taken	lightly	as	non-Hausa	speaker	perception	of	the	brand	needed	to	be	considered	also.	In	the	end,	it	was	decided	to	keep	website	in	English,	but	to	add	key	phrases	about	unity	in	Yoruba,	and	Igbo.	The	brand	was	also	harnessed	to	send	a	message	of	unity.	Some	local	advertising	was	done	in	local	languages,	with	careful	attention	to	which	language	was	used	in	areas	that	had	mixed	Hausa-non-Hausa	speakers.	Additionally,	promotional	and	web	images	began	using	a	50-50	split	of	male	and	female	and	Hausa/non-Hausa	persons	(Every1Mobile	2016).		Determine	the	right	frequency	of	messaging	or	engagement		Though	SMS-based	reminders	trigger	individuals	to	think	about	topics	they	might	not	otherwise	consciously	consider,	or	only	consider	at	certain	times,	such	as	during	a	crisis,	it	is	challenging	to	provide	reminders	that	individuals	want	to	receive	without	being	seen	as	repetitive,	annoying	or	'nagging'	which	will	make	them	be	less	likely	to	a)	pay	attention	to	the	message	and	b)	continue	to	subscribe	to	receive	the	messages.	The	timing	of	message	broadcast	should	be	designed	to	be	both	acceptable	to	participants	and	relevant	to	the	information	in	the	message	(Gold	and	Lim	2010).		Tailor	messages	to	the	audience	and	the	individual	user		Digital	interventions	have	advantages	over	traditional	SBCC	modes	because	they	can	be	designed	flexibly	to	include	interactive	components,	opportunities	for	feedback,	and	conveniently	timed	messaging	to	engage	different	users	in	targeted	ways.	Tailored	in	the	online	context	means	that	individualized	messages	are	designed	using	a	pre-assessment	of	key	individual	difference	variables	or	characteristics	linked	to	the	behaviour	change	model	that	is	being	used.	Tailored	messages	are	more	relevant	to	users	and	tend	to	command	their	attention	better	and	persuade	them	more	effectively.	Tailored	messaging	also	users	more	likely	to	process	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 31	and	have	a	positive	perception	of	educational	materials	(Lustria,	et	al.	2013).	Interventions	should	also	be	tailored	to	the	target	audience,	for	example,	their	digital	preferences	and	habits	(Korda	and	Itani	2013).	Levels	of	engagement	and	use	tend	to	increase	when	intervention	iteratively	modify	a	platform	to	reflect	emerging	trends	with	adolescents	(Baños,	et	al.	2017).	Interventions	with	multiple,	complimentary,	focal-themed	messages	that	encourage	users	to	engage	with	the	platform	and	interact	with	other	users	on	the	platform	are	recommended	(Korda	and	Itani	2013)	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).		Use	multi-media	and	transmedia	approaches	Multi-media	and	transmedia	approaches	may	have	better	results	for	more	complex	behaviours.	In	the	case	of	East	Los	High,	for	example,	transmedia	yielded	significantly	better	outcomes	than	did	other	conditions	over	time.	Though	condom	promotion	messages	were	the	same	across	all	experimental	conditions,	when	they	were	addressed	on	the	show	and	also	in	an	extended	video	clip	dialogue	with	a	main	character	the	intervention	saw	a	strong	uptick	in	interest	and	clicks.	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).		Build	trust	and	find	the	right	voice	and	messenger(s)		To	maximize	likelihood	of	behaviour	change,	in	addition	to	messages	being	novel	or	engaging,	the	recipient	needs	to	believe	the	sender	of	the	message	is	a	credible	source	of	information		(Gold	and	Lim	2010).		Finding	trusted	messengers	and	influencers	is	a	known	good	practice	from	pre-Internet	days,	and	it	holds	true	in	the	digital	sphere	of	SBCC.	It’s	important	to	conduct	research	and	testing	to	determine	who	is	the	best	messenger	to	carry	a	particular	message	to	a	specific	audience,	and	to	develop	the	right	tone	of	voice	or	personality	for	a	message	or	conversation.	This	could	be	anyone	from	a	trusted	INGO	or	NGO,	a	Telecoms	company,	a	government	agency;	a	celebrity,	a	fictional	character	developed	specifically	for	SBCC	purposes,	to	friends	and	families.		Pay	attention	to	framing	of	messages		Message	framing	seems	to	significantly	influence	message	effectiveness.	Positively	and	negatively	framed	messages	around	hygiene	have	led	to	a	significant	improvement	in	hygiene	practices,	whereas	neutral	messages	led	to	increased	awareness	but	hardly	any	change	in	behaviours	(Barnett,	et	al.	2016).		Prepare	with	signposting	and	ensure	capacity	to	respond	to	demand	generated	SBCC	programs	should	be	prepared	to	respond	to	any	demand	that	is	created	by	increased	awareness	and	have	reliable,	trustworthy	and	vetted	online	and	offline	support	systems/	services	to	which	users	can	be	signposted.	A	community	and	radio	education	campaign	opened	up	new	channels	for	reporting	child	abuse	in	Benin,	for	example.	Despite	early	engagement	with	local	child	protection	services,	once	reports	started	coming	in	local	government	didn’t	have	capacity	to	respond	to	the	calls.	In	some	cases,	child	victims	of	abuse	that	had	been	reported	through	the	programs	SMS	service	were	removed	from	abusive	families	and	placed	with	local	police	officers,	leaving	them	open	to	other	potential	forms	of	abuse	(Bachan	2016).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 32		Develop	engaging	content	Buzzfeed2	has	an	effective	engagement	method	that	involves	packaging	information	in	concise	and	esthetically	appealing	formats.	Good	practices	for	creating	engaging	content	include	attracting	attention	with	headlines	of	eight	words	--	the	suggested	number	of	words	for	the	highest	click-rate.	Buzzfeed	uses	a	“Bite-Snack-Meal”	model	where	the	bite	is	the	headline,	the	snack	is	the	thumbnail	image	and	short	description	of	the	article,	and	the	meal	is	the	full	article.	Buzzfeed	also	personalizes	content,	based	on	user	personas	and	characteristics	generated	from	click-data	research	that	suggest	that	certain	individuals	would	choose	certain	articles.	Buzzfeed	also	allows	its	readers	to	categorize	and	organize	articles	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them.	It	features	timely	content	and	trending	topics	that	are	constantly	updated.	Lastly,	Buzzfeed	content	is	pre-packaged	to	be	easily	shareable.	This	means	that	readers	share	more	often	and	become	promoters	of	the	Buzzfeed	brand.	(Manzo	2015)	(Shane-Simpson,	et	al.	2017).		It	is	possible	to	engage	off-line	users	through	low-end	mobiles	as	well.	Gram	Vaani’s	Mobile	Vaani	is	described	as	a	social	media	platform	for	rural	areas.	It	runs	on	an	IVR	system	that	allows	people	to	call	in	to	leave	a	message	about	their	community	or	to	listen	to	messages	left	by	others.	The	Mobile	Vaani	network	covers	several	states	in	India	and	it	has	proved	to	be	as	effective	as	conventional	media	and,	in	some	cases,	more	effective,	since	in	many	rural	households	the	mobile	phone	is	the	only	electronic	possession.	Main	Kuch	Bhi	Kar	Sakti	Hoon	(Empowering	Women.	Accelerating	Change)	was	a	campaign	that	used	a	mix	of	inter-personal,	group	and	mass	media	channels	with	an	emphasis	on	incorporating	participant	voices.	An	audio	version	of	the	Main	Kuch	Bhi	Kar	Sakti	Hoon	television	series	(which	focuses	on	a	young	woman’s	ability	to	break	free	from	her	traditional	society	and	become	a	professional)	was	created.	Each	audio	episode	was	followed	by	a	set	of	questions	to	initiate	and	encourage	discussion	on	that	particular	episode.	User	opinions	were	solicited	via	Gram	Vaani,	and	a	diverse	set	of	listeners	from	various	regions,	classes	and	ethnicities	engaged	in	discussions.	At	fifty-two	percent,	contributions	from	women	in	the	Gram	Vaani	campaign	were	reportedly	higher	than	in	mainstream	media	campaigns,	which	hover	between	twenty-five	and	thirty	percent.	Overall,	there	were	over	a	thousand	contributions	to	the	campaign	discussion,	and	almost	29,000	people	accessed	the	content	(Gram	Vaani	2015)	(Gram	Vaani	n/d).			CGNet	Swara	is	a	similar	system,	designed	for	sharing	news	in	areas	where	there	is	little	mainstream	media	coverage.	The	voice-based	portal	is	freely	accessible	via	mobile	phone,	and	anyone	can	report	and	listen	to	stories	of	local	interest.	Reported	stories	are	moderated	and/or	annotated	or	edited	by	journalists	prior	to	becoming	publicly	available	for	playback	online	and	over	mobile	(CGNet	Swara	n/d).																																																															2	BuzzFeed,	Inc.	is	an	American	Internet	media,	news	and	entertainment	company	that	is	well-known	for	its	digital	savvy	and	focus	on	viral	content.	Buzzfeed	was	initially	famous	for	online	quizzes,	lists	and	pop	culture	articles;	however	over	time,	the	company	grew	into	a	global	media	and	technology	company	offering	political,	do-it-yourself,	animal	and	business	content.	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 33	Consider	using	Internet	Messaging	Platforms	and/or	Chatbots	Although	messaging	platforms	only	work	on	smart	phones,	their	use	has	grown	dramatically	in	recent	years.	By	2018,	3.6	billion	of	people	(almost	half	the	world’s	population)	was	expected	to	be	using	them.	The	shift	to	messaging	apps	was	driven	by	economics	–	they	allowed	users	to	send	text	messages	at	low	(or	no)	cost.	As	smartphone,	Wi-Fi	and	mobile-internet	access	has	grown,	messaging	apps	have	evolved	into	multi-media	hubs	that	offer	users	new	ways	of	sharing	information	and	improved	data	security.	A	2018	study	notes	that	people	are	more	likely	to	open	messages	that	come	in	via	messaging	applications	than	they	are	to	open	SMS	messages	(e.g.,	they	have	a	high	“open	rate”).	In	mid-2016,	WhatsApp	rolled	out	encrypted	messages	as	the	default,	and	other	messaging	apps	have	followed.	This	means	that	the	content	of	messages	sent	on	these	applications	is	not	accessible	by	anyone	other	than	the	sender	and	the	user.	(ICRC;	The	Engine	Room;	Block	Party;	2017)	(Echo	Mobile	and	Digital	Impact	Alliance	2018).		Alongside	the	expansion	of	Internet	Messaging	platforms	is	an	increase	in	the	use	of	Chatbots.	Most	messaging	platforms	support	bot	technology,	though	the	complexity	and	degree	of	artificial	intelligence	of	the	bot	offerings	differ.	Most	bots	perform	simple	functions	like	as	prompting	users	to	press	suggested	response	buttons	or	replying	to	users’	questions	with	short	answers.	Basic	bots	are	fairly	inexpensive	to	deploy	and	have	no	“mind	of	their	own”	that	could	take	conversations	into	unpredictable	places.	A	number	of	angles	need	to	be	considered	if	considering	using	a	bot,	so	user	and	context	research	are	a	critical	point	when	designing	or	incorporating	a	chatbot	into	a	program.	Aspects	of	inclusion	need	thorough	exploration	as	well	(Echo	Mobile	and	Digital	Impact	Alliance	2018).		Budget	for	moderation	of	content	and	comments		Both	Facebook	and	WhatsApp	have	been	used	to	spread	false	and	misleading	information	that	many	believe	has	influenced	election	processes,	fueled	hate	and	violence,	and	led	to	wider	divisions	on	topics	like	race	and	gender.	Misinformation	spread	on	WhatsApp	groups	in	Brazil	is	reported	to	have	sealed	the	win	of	extremist	Jair	Bolsonaro	in	Brazil’s	2018	Presidential	elections	and	WhatsApp-spread	misinformation	has	ignited	violent	attacks	and	even	murder	for	people	in	India,	Mexico,	and	elsewhere.	(Kayyali	2018).	To	counter	the	spread	of	fake	news,	in	January	of	2019	WhatsApp	decreased	from	twenty	to	five	the	number	of	contacts	or	group	chats	to	which	a	user	can	forward	a	message.	Ahead	of	national	elections	in	India,	however,	this	change	did	not	appear	to	be	having	a	strong	impact.	Indian	political	parties	reportedly	poured	money	into	the	creation	of	hundreds	of	thousands	of	WhatsApp	groups	to	spread	political	messages,	which	according	to	researchers,	frequently	contain	and	disseminate	false	information	and	hateful	rhetoric,	especially	that	fueled	by	Hindu	nationalists	(Perrigo	2019).		As	the	effects	of	misinformation	and	disinformation	have	become	more	apparent	globally,	platform	companies	are	being	called	on	to	make	decisions	about	speech/free	speech	and	what	content	is	allowed	on	their	platforms	(Caplan	2018).	Women	and	girls	in	particular	also	face	harassment	online,	especially	when	they	speak	out	on	gender	discrimination	or	go	against	social	and	cultural	norms	(Vlahakis	2018)	and	for	this	reason,	platforms	and	digital	initiatives	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 34	must	ensure	that	they	have	sufficient	resourcing	for	moderation	that	can	manage	communities	and	watch	for	any	misuse	of	the	platform	or	harmful	content	or	comments.		Don’t	be	fooled	by	vanity	metrics	Vanity	metrics	are	those	that	focus	on	large	numbers	of	reach	or	engagement,	for	example,	page	views,	clicks,	or	likes	as	opposed	to	quality	of	engagement	with	content	or	impact	of	the	content/platform/service.	Numbers	can	be	deceiving	in	many	ways,	for	example,	the	number	of	calls	received	to	an	IVR	line	might	be	quite	large,	but	if	the	network	is	weak	and	the	majority	of	calls	drop,	then	the	number	of	calls	received	is	not	very	meaningful	in	terms	of	impact	because	very	few	people	will	have	listened	to	a	recording.		If	people	arrive	at	a	website	page	and	leave	immediately,	chances	are	they	arrived	at	the	wrong	page	and	did	not	have	interest	in	the	content	there,	and	this	should	not	be	considered	a	sign	of	high	uptake	or	interest.	Identifying	solid	metrics	and	understanding	from	where	numbers	emanate	is	critical	to	designing	impact	measurement.	In	addition	to	numbers	and	analytics,	it	is	important	to	determine	whether	online	knowledge	or	stated	intent	translates	into	offline	behaviour.		5.	Digital	Safeguarding	good	practices		The	‘Digital	Safeguarding’	umbrella	covers	a)	safeguarding	when	people,	in	this	case,	children	and	adolescents,	use	digital	devices	or	engage	with	digital	services	or	platforms;	b)	data	privacy	and	protection;	and	c)	data	security	(Raftree	2018a).	There	are	multiple	safeguarding	areas	to	consider	when	engaging	adolescents	in	digital	initiatives,	including:		• big	picture	ethical	and	risk	review	(is	embarking	on	this	effort	ethical?);		• safeguarding,	informed	consent,	privacy	and	security	of	data	collected	during	formative	or	ongoing	research	activities;		• building	privacy	and	data	security	into	platform,	product	or	outreach	design;		• ensuring	that	the	benefits	of	collecting	personal	or	sensitive	data	outweigh	the	privacy	risks;		• following	applicable	country	and	global	legal	frameworks	related	to	data	privacy	and	transmission	across	borders;		• protecting	and	securing	any	data	collected	or	generated	throughout	the	process	• ensuring	a	clear	handle	on	how	and	where	data	flows	and	reviewing	how	partners	will	manage	data	privately	and	securely;		• and	considerations	around	the	online	experience	itself	such	as	safe	and	appropriate	content,	comments	and	moderation,	and	protection	from	online	abuse,	bullying,	harassment,	hate	speech,	violence,	scams	or	grooming	(Raftree	2018).	Gender	dimensions	of	online	harassment,	violence	and	abuse	Online	violence	and	abuse	can	manifest	as	sexual,	psychological	or	emotional.	Online	situations	can	also	lead	to	physical	harm,	violence	and	abuse	offline.	(European	Institute	for	Gender	Equality	2017).	There	are	major	gaps	in	data	on	the	prevalence	and	impact	of	online	violence	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 35	and	abuse	against	women	and	girls,	including	gaps	in	information	about	the	experiences	of	women	in	Africa	and	Asia	(Van	der	Wilk	2018).	Research	that	does	exist	suggests	that	women	are	more	likely	to	experience	online	violence	than	men	and	they	face	more	serious	consequences	(Powell	2018).	Amnesty	International	found	that	almost	a	quarter	of	women	surveyed	across	eight	countries	said	they	had	experienced	online	abuse	or	harassment	at	least	once	(Amnesty	International	2017).	In	addition	to	high	levels	of	harassment	and	abuse,	women	experience	more	severe	forms	of	online	violence	than	men,	including	physical	threats,	harassment	over	a	sustained	period,	sexual	harassment	and	stalking	(Pew	Research	Centre	2018).			The	nature	of	the	digital	space,	with	easy	amplification	and	scale,	enables	harm	caused	to	survivors	to	also	be	amplified.	Violence	and	abuse	against	women	are	carried	out	today	at	greater	distance,	speed	and	rates.	Meanwhile,	anonymity	and	encryption	protect	perpetrators	from	being	known	to	both	survivors	and	authorities	(Aziz	2017).	The	most	common	social	media	platform	highlighted	in	one	study	–	both	for	experiencing	and	witnessing	abuse	–	was	Facebook.	Other	social	media	platforms	where	research	participants	experienced	were	Twitter,	Instagram	and	YouTube.	Other	places	where	abuse	happens	included	on	the	internet	in	general,	via	mobile	phones,	and	on	messaging	services	such	as	WhatsApp	and	email.	Sexual	orientation,	gender	identity,	race	and	age	often	exacerbate	the	type	of	online	violence	and	abuse	that	women	face	(Vlahakis	2018).	For	example,	Loom	Nepal	reported	that	100	percent	of	transgender	respondents	to	their	study	reported	having	been	subjected	to	violence	online	and	84	percent	of	respondents	who	identified	as	gay,	lesbian,	bisexual,	or	other	non-heterosexual	orientation	had	been	subjected	to	online	violence.	A	disproportionately	high	number	of	people	reporting	online	violence	in	the	study	identified	as	lesbian,	gay,	bisexual	or	trans	(LGBT)	or	Dalit.	Online	harassment	and	abuse	often	lead	to	self-censorship	and	the	silencing	of	women	(LOOM	Nepal	2017).		A	2018	report	on	girls’	perceptions	and	experiences	with	mobile	phones	shows	that	girls	across	different	countries	are	acutely	aware	of	‘safety’	as	an	issue	when	thinking	about	mobile	access	and	use.	While	girls	were	positive	about	the	role	of	phones	supporting	their	safety,	they	also	pointed	out	that	they	and	their	parents	had	a	number	of	safety	concerns	and	fears,	for	example,	that	phones	could	be	a	gateway	to	‘bad	people,’	namely,	boys	and	men,	or	other	girls	who	could	be	a	bad	influence.		Girls	and	boys	also	said	that	mobiles	can	lead	them	to	dangerous	information	and	imagery	such	pornography	and	‘bad	messages’	that	upset	them	and	‘corrupt’	their	moral	being.	Other	fears	that	girls	specifically	mentioned	were	exposure	to	‘sugar	daddies’;	watching	pornography,	which	‘tempts’	girls	into	trying	sex;	being	tricked	into	meeting	men	and	boys	for	sex,	or	even	providing	the	opportunity	for	them	to	be	put	under	a	spell	and	seduced.	(Vodafone	Foundation	and	Girl	Effect	2018).		Emerging	privacy	regulations	The	European	Union	passed	new	data	privacy	regulations	in	May	of	2018	called	the	General	Data	Privacy	Regulation	(GDPR).	This	overarching	framework	has	set	the	bar	for	a	rights-based	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 36	approach	to	data	privacy	that	places	a	greater	amount	of	control	into	the	hands	of	‘data	subjects’	whose	data	is	collected	and	used	by	‘data	controllers’	and	‘data	processers.’	Though	the	GDPR	does	not	apply	to	all	countries,	it	does	require	companies	wishing	to	target	EU	citizens	with	offers	and	services	to	comply.	The	legislation	also	covers	EU-based	entities	that	are	collecting	data	in	other	countries.	Rights	and	principles	contained	in	the	GDPR	include	concepts	such	as	personal	data;	sensitive	data;	legal	bases	for	data	collection;	legitimate	purpose	for	data	collection	and	use;	informed	consent;	data	minimization;	and	rights	to	rectification,	erasure,	information	about	how	personal	data	is	being	used,	and	rights	to	refuse	or	restrict	profiling	on	the	bases	of	data	(European	Union	2016).	The	GDPR	mandates	particular	attention	to	data	privacy	and	ethics	when	working	with	children,	including	the	stipulations	around	parental	consent	and	special	privacy	considerations	for	the	data	of	children	(UK	Information	Commissioner's	Office	2018).	Many	development	organizations	are	making	efforts	to	adopt	the	philosophies	of	the	GDPR	due	to	the	belief	that	all	people	deserve	the	same	data	privacy	rights,	and	that	these	are	especially	important	for	vulnerable	groups	who	may	face	even	greater	risk	if	data	privacy	is	breached	or	their	data	is	abused	or	accidentally	lost	or	leaked	(Porter,	et	al.	2018).		India	is	in	the	midst	of	changes	to	its	privacy	laws,	with	proposed	rules	that	would	amend	Section	79	of	the	country’s	IT	Act,	the	primary	law	on	online	commerce	and	cybercrime.	If	these	amendments	are	approved,	platforms	like	Facebook	and	Twitter	would	be	required	to	censor	content	that	the	Indian	government	considers	inappropriate.	This	move	could	also	affect	how	content	is	served	outside	Indian	borders.	The	amended	law	would	also	require	social	media	companies	to	offer	up	user	messages	at	government	request.	This	is	a	challenge	for	end-to-end	encrypted	services	like	WhatsApp,	which	has	specifically	encrypted	messages	in	an	effort	to	assure	users	that	their	personal	messages	are	safe	from	corporate	or	government	eyes	(Kelly	2019).	MTV	Nishedh	will	need	to	review	its	legal	obligations	with	regard	to	privacy	laws	for	the	EU,	US,	India,	and	any	other	country	where	data	might	be	collected,	transmitted	or	processed	by	partners	or	sub-contractors.	Digital	Safeguarding	and	Responsible	Data	in	the	civil	society	space	Digital	safeguarding	and	responsible	data	management	have	emerged	as	key	concerns	and	areas	of	focus	for	those	implementing	programs	that	include	digital	data,	digital	platforms	or	digital	content.	While	digital	platforms	themselves	traffic	in	user	data,	development	practitioners	and	human	rights	activists	have	become	increasingly	vocal	about	the	need	for	greater	attention	to	how	data	from	vulnerable	or	at-risk	populations	is	collected,	transmitted,	used,	stored	and	shared	and	how	online	spaces	can	be	protected	from	manipulation,	hate	speech	and	abuse.		The	concept	of	Responsible	Data	emerged	some	five	years	ago	out	of	efforts	by	The	Engine	Room	and	other	interested	partners.	Responsible	data	is	defined	as	“The	duty	to	ensure	people’s	rights	to	consent,	privacy,	security	and	ownership	around	the	information	processes	of	collection,	analysis,	storage,	presentation	and	reuse	of	data,	while	respecting	the	values	of	transparency	and	openness”	(Responsible	Data	Forum	2014).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 37		A	list	of	ten	recommendations	to	enhance	data	privacy	was	developed	for	the	design	phase	of	the	Girl	Effect	Mobile	platform	to	help	ensure	girls’	safeguarding	and	to	address	technological,	cultural,	legal,	and	contextual	risks	as	well	as	to	ensure	that	reputational	risks,	trustworthiness,	online	abuse	and	data	privacy	and	security	measures	were	mitigated.	These	included	aspects	like	assessing	risk	to	girls	at	various	levels,	including	technology,	culture,	legal,	contextual,	trust/abuse/reputation,	data	and	privacy	breaches	and	data	ethics;	understanding	digital	privacy	and	safety	from	girls’	perspective	in	each	context	before	design;	working	with	girl	groups	to	identify	privacy,	security	and	reputational	risks,	to	design	and	develop	of	safety	and	security	protocols;	to	flag	new	risks	that	arise	during	implementation,	and	to	adapt	and	iterate	around	safeguarding	approaches	when	new	concerns	arise.	Another	recommendation	was	to	assign	or	consult	with	a	digital	security	expert	in	each	pilot	effort	to	conduct	a	privacy	impact	assessment	and	recommend	contextually	specific	approaches	and	design	elements	that	are	relevant	to	each	context	that	can	later	be	filtered	up	into	a	global	safeguarding	approach.	The	guidance	recommended	following	legal	guidelines	that	apply	in	the	various	countries	of	operation	or	reach	and	establishing	organizational	policies	and	standards	on	data	collection	and	security,	including	Privacy	by	Design	standards.	Training	for	staff	on	potential	risks	and	organizational	liabilities,	accountability	processes,	responsibilities	and	consequences	for	privacy	breaches	were	also	recommended,	as	well	as	training	for	local	partners	and	allies	(Raftree	2016).			A	number	of	other	guiding	documents	exist	to	support	practitioners	who	are	thinking	through	these	areas.	A	set	of	relevant	policy	and	guidance	for	the	development	and	social	impact	field	were	assembled	on	the	“Responsible	Data	Hack	Pad”	by	a	group	of	Responsible	Data	enthusiasts	as	a	resource	for	the	MERL	Tech	conference	in	2016	and	subsequently	turned	into	a	living	document	that	is	continually	updated	as	new	research	and	guidance	arise	(MERL	Tech	Participants	2019).		6.	Monitoring,	evaluation	and	learning	for	digital	SBCC			As	noted	earlier	in	this	paper,	the	evidence	base	on	digital	SBCC	is	somewhat	weak.	Higgs	et	al.,	when	referring	to	the	mHealth,	social	and	transmedia	approaches,	and	behaviour	change	evidence	base,	recommend	that	future	studies	adopt	rigorous	designs	and	endpoints.	The	evidence	base	needs	to	be	systematically	built	to	avoid	wasting	resources	and	enable	comparisons	across	studies,	modalities,	and	outcomes.	Additionally,	data	analysis	and	reporting	on	these	types	of	programs	should	systematically	articulate	basic	implementation	information,	such	as	the	type	of	media	platform	used,	the	content	presented,	media	distribution	and	reach,	consumer	exposure,	and	other	specifics	related	to	the	media	interface.	Additionally,	they	identify	a	need	for	qualitative	studies	that	provide	a	richer	understanding	about	how	cultural	factors	shape	the	adoption	and	success	of	new	technologies.	They	recommend	that	qualitative	studies	examine	how	behaviours	and	social	norms	interact	and	how	social	norms	shift	in	important	ways	due	to	the	infusion	of	new	technologies	in	the	community,	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 38	differences	in	role	definitions	brought	about	because	of	new	technologies	(Higgs,	et	al.	2014).	Below	are	highlighted	some	cases	that	may	provide	ideas	for	how	to	design	the	MEL	for	MTV	Nishedh.	Additionally,	some	newer	tools	that	could	be	incorporated	into	MEL	are	covered.		16	and	Pregnant		The	evaluation	team	matched	Vital	Statistics	birth	data	to	Nielsen	television	ratings	data	to	determine	whether	exposure	to	the	show	had	an	impact	on	teen	childbearing.	They	implemented	an	instrumental	variables	(IV)	strategy	using	local	area	MTV	ratings	data	from	a	pre-period	to	predict	local	area	16	and	Pregnant	ratings,	and	also	introduced	event	study	methods,	using	the	specific	timing	of	the	show’s	introduction	to	identify	a	causal	effect.	Those	findings	were	supplemented	with	a	review	of	data	from	Google	Trends	and	Twitter	that	suggested	that	the	show	led	to	increased	interest	in	contraceptive	use	and	abortion,	as	captured	by	internet	search	and	tweeting	behaviour	(Kearney	and	Levine	2015).	As	noted	earlier	in	this	paper,	these	results	were	questioned	by	researcher	Jennifer	Aubrey	who	concluded	that	they	were	based	on	faulty	analysis	of	correlational	results	from	aggregate	data,	and	that	in	fact	the	show	had	nuanced	impacts.	Girls	who	identified	with	the	main	characters	had	more	positive	attitudes	about	teen	pregnancy	than	girls	who	could	not	easily	relate	to	them	(Behm-Morawitz,	et	al.	2017).			East	Los	High		Evaluators	used	a	mixed	methods	approach	including	analytics	tracking	to	assess	audience	reach,	which	monitored	Web	traffic	to	the	East	Los	High	Web	site	and	to	NGO	partners’	Web	sites	and	widgets;	a	viewer	survey	to	assess	narrative	engagement	and	intended	outcomes;	and	a	laboratory	experiment	with	non-viewers	of	East	Los	High	to	compare	the	effect	of	transmedia	edutainment	with	other	forms	of	narrative	presentation.	Complementary	methods	included	social	network	analysis	and	content	analysis	to	understand	the	social	dynamics,	message	framing,	and	user-generated	content	on	East	Los	High’s	social	media	presence	and	participant	observation	and	in-depth	interviews	with	young	Latino	couples	to	reveal	East	Los	High’s	influence	on	their	sexual	decision-making.				More	specifically,	the	team	collected	anonymous	unobtrusive	tracking	data	through	Google	Analytics	to	capture	East	Los	High	audience	reach	during	the	pre-program	publicity,	the	premiere	of	season	1,	and	after	season	1	ended.	The	team	recorded	the	number	of	visitors,	number	of	page	views,	average	duration	of	page	views,	and	geographical	location	of	visitors.	Using	a	geographical	information	system	software,	they	generated	spatiotemporal	dynamic	visualizations	of	the	geographical	diffusion	of	East	Los	High	web	site	visitors	over	time.	NGO	partners	Planned	Parenthood	and	StayTeen.org	independently	monitored	and	shared	the	statistics	of	their	Web	traffic	and	health	service	widgets	on	the	East	Los	High	website.			An	online	survey	was	embedded	into	the	East	Los	High	web	site	and	promoted	on	social	media	with	custom	incentives.	Participants	answered	closed-	and	open-	ended	questions	about	their	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 39	impressions	of	the	program,	engagement	with	its	narrative	elements,	interpersonal	discussions	about	the	show,	and	knowledge,	attitudes,	and	behavioural	intentions	related	to	sexual	and	reproductive	health.		The	evaluation	team	derived	measures	of	audience	experience	from	established	scales	of	transportation,	identification,	and	narrative	engagement.		The	team	used	a	partial	factorial	design	to	test	the	effect	of	different	storytelling	formats	on	the	show’s	target	audience.	The	content	was	selected	according	to	the	program’s	objectives,	and	the	messages	were	identical	across	all	experimental	conditions.	Repeated	measures	of	narrative	engagement,	knowledge	(of	correct	use	of	condoms,	birth	control	pills,	and	emergency	contraception),	attitudes	(on	sex	education,	women’s	right	to	choose	abortion,	the	importance	of	HIV	testing,	the	importance	of	sex	communication),	and	behaviour	(used	protection	during	last	instance	of	sexual	intercourse,	engaged	in	sex	communication)	occurred	at	baseline,	posttest	and	a	2-week	follow-up	(Wang	and	Singhal	2016).		Voices	for	Change	(V4C)		A	Theory	of	Change	(ToC)	was	developed	as	an	iterative	tool	guiding	the	design	and	evolution	of	the	V4C	program	and	to	help	organize	and	develop	thinking	throughout	the	program	team	about	what	was	expected	to	happen,	and	why	specific	interventions	were	expected	to	have	the	desired	effects.	The	ToC	represents	a	development	of	the	socio-ecological	model	of	change	used	in	other	social	science	contexts	and	depicts	three	domains	of	change	in	‘Self’,	‘Society’	and	‘Formal	Institutions’	where	V4C	delivered	different	types	of	intervention.			• Self:		Young	women,	young	men	and	a	number	of	‘key	influencers’	were	expected	to	acquire	knowledge	and	skills	about	gender	equality	through	program	courses	and	other	activities	–virtual	and	physical	–	which	used	transformational	methodologies	to	inspire	deep	personal	change	and	commitment.		• Society:	A	‘rising	tide’	population	of	general	members	of	society	not	directly	targeted	by	the	program	was	expected	to	undergo	change	in	knowledge,	attitudes	and	practices	in	areas	key	to	gender	equality	(e.g.	women’s	leadership,	women’s	decision-making	and	VAWG).	The	change	would	happen	through	social	norms	change	stimulated	by	a	media	campaign	and	other	media	tools	to	generate	messages,	as	well	as	images/depictions	of	new	social	norms.	‘Key	influencers’	were	expected	to	contribute	to	this	social	norms	change	by	discussing	gender	equality	among	their	various	constituents/listeners	and	putting	forward	alternative	norms.	 	• Institutions:	V4C	activities	targeted	changes	in	the	law,	policy	change,	changes	in	government	planning	and	budgeting	processes,	and	changes	in	women’s	political	leadership	brought	about	partly	by	working	on	commitments	within	political	parties.			The	personal	transformation	in	the	‘Self’	domain	is	rooted	in	the	Stages	of	Change	model	of	change.	The	activity	in	the	‘Society’	domain	draws	on	a	‘diffusion’	model	of	change	which	explains	how	change	at	individual	levels	spreads	through	society	(Milward	and	Nelson	2017).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 40	Springster		This	is	a	mobile-first	global	platform	that	digitally	connects	marginalized	and	vulnerable	girls	around	the	world.	It	features	content	designed	for	girls	and	created	by	girls,	aiming	to	put	essential,	tailored	information	directly	into	their	hands,	and	to	help	girls	find	meaning	and	strength	in	each	other’s	experiences.	Girl	Effect	commissioned	2CV	to	help	them	understand	real	South	African	Springster	users’	local	contexts	and	challenges,	user	journeys	to	the	service,	overall	user	experience,	and	girls’	views	on	existing	local	content.	The	research	also	explored	overall	user	engagement	and	Springster	impact	–	including	changing	knowledge,	attitudes	and	practices	–	and	whether	this	varied	for	different	types	of	users.	Because	Springster	target	users	are	primarily	based	in	urban	areas,	this	research	took	place	in	the	Johannesburg	area,	which	had	the	most	responses	to	the	recruitment	survey.	Girls	were	recruited	from	the	Springster	site	by	sampling	registered	users	via	an	online	survey	which	appeared	at	the	top	of	users’	platform	page.	The	sample	frame	was	limited	given	the	number	of	girls	within	reasonable	geographic	ranges	for	research	purposes	and	whether	the	participant	could	be	contacted.	The	sample	include	14	to	18-year-old	users	across	a	range	of	demographics	and	usage	experiences	–	including	those	in	the	early	stages	of	platform	exploration	(1-2	visits)	and	dedicated	long-term	users	(6+	visits).	Despite	not	explicitly	sampling	for	vulnerability,	all	users	included	in	this	research	met	1	or	more	of	the	Springster	target	vulnerability	criteria	–	with	most	participants	meeting	2+	criteria.		The	approach	began	with	depth	interviews	with	the	‘seed	respondent’	–	the	Springster	user.	First	researchers	conducted	deep-dive	exploration	of	the	girl	user’s	context,	pathways	to	Springster	use,	engagement	and	user	experience,	and	impact	on	knowledge,	views	and	behaviour.	Where	possible,	they	then	conducted	depth	or	paired	interviews	with	friends	and	family	from	the	girl’s	wider	social	network	–	including	friends	and/or	family	members.	These	interviews	triangulated	data	around	the	girl’s	ambitions,	challenges	and	support	needs,	and	behaviour	or	attitude	changes,	and	views	on	Springster.	In	total,	the	team	conducted	20	in-depth	home	interviews,	10	in	depth	family	or	gatekeeper	interviews,	and	15	friendship	interviews.		Additionally,	girls’	digital	repertoires	were	researched,	including	the	handsets	they	use	and	how	they	use	and	access	data,	the	costs	and	kinds	of	mobile	and	data	plans,	the	platforms	and	apps	they	use,	information	they	seek	from	the	Internet,	how/how	often	they	access	Internet,	how	they	find	the	Springster	platform,	what	they	do	on	it,	their	expectations	of	the	platform,	use	patterns,	emotional/intellectual	engagement	with	the	platform,	their	perceptions	of	‘who	the	platform	is	for’,	the	user	interface	and	how	they	navigate	it,	and	aspects	related	to	the	site’s	content,	tone,	voice,	and	interactivity.		Lastly	evaluators	looked	at	how	girls	share	information	and	knowledge	gained	from	the	site,	the	influence	or	impact	of	the	site	on	users	(both	highly	engaged	users	and	“lurkers”)	and	measured	early	impacts	in	confidence,	knowledge,	feeling	less	alone,	and	relationships	with	family	and	friends	(Jacobs	and	Upton	2018).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 41		In	addition	to	the	focused	research	highlighted	above,	Girl	Effect	is	using	a	range	of	methods	to	better	understand	how	users’	engagement	and	participation	relate	to	changes	in	girls’	lives	before	and	after	they	read	content	on	Springster	and	engage	in	conversations	with	other	users.	Using	different	data	sources,	such	as	Google	Analytics,	comment	analysis,	online	surveys	and	social	media	analytics,	the	team	is	combining	big	data	with	traditional	approaches	to	learn	more	about	the	intersection	of	digital	behaviour,	participation	in	community	spaces	and	engagement	with	content	and	how	participation	in	this	online	safe	space	influences	change.	(Abreu	Lopes	and	Bailur	2018).	HNI	3-2-1	Program		This	program	offered	mobile	phone	users	in	Madagascar	access	to	information	on	a	number	of	topics	and	themes,	including	gender	and	gender-based	violence	through	IVR	line,	SMS	or	USSD	(which	is	similar	to	SMS,	but	users	can	have	a	back-and-forth	conversation).	Midway	through	the	project,	a	user	journey	evaluation	was	conducted	as	well	as	a	business	model	assessment	to	see	if	the	program	could	find	a	way	to	become	sustainable	without	supplemental	funding.			Core	questions	asked	during	the	user	journey	evaluation	included:	• Where	are	the	bottlenecks	in	the	customer	journey?	• What	are	the	drivers	of	repeat	usage?	What	is	the	most	effective	content?	• How	can	we	determine	which	users	are	more	valuable	for	a	mobile	operator?	• What	is	user	willingness	to	pay	for	the	service?	• What	gender	is	using	the	service?	What	content	is	most	effective	by	gender?	• How	do	marketing/promotional	activities	impact	3-2-1?		Business	model	questions	included:	• How	can	we	tackle	the	bottleneck	in	the	user	journey?	• What	is	user	willingness	to	pay?	Is	there	a	good	B2C	model?	• How	can	HNI	better	use	their	data	to	support	their	cost	structure?	• How	can	HNI	strengthen	ties	with	all	key	partners	who	are	critical	for	business	model?		The	three	channels	(IVR,	SMS,	USSD)	were	monitored	to	determine	their	uptake	and	effectiveness,	where	customers	were	getting	stuck	in	the	user	journey,	at	what	point	they	become	engaged	and	repeat	users	(or	why	they	didn’t),	user	interface	testing,	the	value	of	different	types	of	customers	(cursory	and	repeat	customers).	Customers	were	segmented	by	type	of	user	and	where	they	were	in	the	user	journey.		By	focusing	on	the	listening	behaviour	of	users	and	determining	how	many	are	‘engaged’	(those	who	listened	to	the	majority	of	a	message)	the	team	could	assess	how	many	users	in	the	base	used	the	service	in	a	way	that	could	create	real	value.	If	behaviour	change	was	to	happen,	it	was	a	pre-condition	that	the	user	have	listened	to	a	message	in	full,	therefore	only	‘engaged	users’	could	be	expected	to	exhibit	the	relevant	changes	in	behaviour.	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 42		Using	data	analytics	to	understand	trends	and	engagement	across	content	areas,	the	team	could	assess	which	content	areas	gain	the	most	hits	(initial	demand)	and	then	to	assess	levels	of	attrition	versus	those	users	who	had	truly	engaged	with	the	content.	User	testimonials	were	layered	over	the	analytics	to	compare	and	understand	(ground	truth	the	numbers).	Based	on	the	data,	a	hypothesis	around	what	is	creating	any	barriers	to	use	can	be	created,	and	the	design	of	the	service	could	be	carefully	adjusted,	and	each	change	in	design	of	the	platform/service	could	be	tested	to	see	if	user	engagement	improves	(Wills,	Morain	and	Baudeau	2016).	As	noted	above	in	this	paper,	this	type	of	monitoring	and	assessment	is	aimed	at	understanding	and	improving	elements	of	platform	or	site	design,	not	evaluating	overall	impact	of	an	initiative.	ICT	tools	and	technology	approaches	for	MEL	of	SBCC	interventions	Social	media	comments	analysis	for	social	norms	research	One	study	sampled	2872	obesity-relevant	comments	from	three	years	of	interest	from	a	multi-topic	online	message	board	and	conducted	an	inductive	thematic	analysis	to	identify	key	themes.	The	comments	analysis	allowed	them	to	better	understand	obesity	stigma,	dominant	representations	of	obese	persons,	experiences	of	explicit	stigma,	the	social	and	psychological	repercussions	of	overt	stigma	and	norms	regarding	the	perception	of	obese	bodies.	The	results	highlight	the	richness	of	data	available	via	social	media	interactions	as	a	window	into	naturally-occurring	discourse	(De	Brun,	et	al.	2014).	IVR	for	Monitoring	and	Evaluating	Media	Interventions	A	pilot	study	was	implemented	in	Rwanda	with	VOTO	Mobile	to	determine	whether	mobile	phone	technologies	can	amplify	the	reach	of	radio	programs	and	streamline	monitoring	and	evaluation	of	radio	programs.	IVR	was	of	interest	because	it	offered	the	possibility	of	collecting	large	quantities	of	qualitative	and	quantitative	data	at	low	cost	because	mobile	phone	users	could	be	asked	automated	questions	through	their	phone,	thus	avoiding	face-to-face	interviews.	IVR	was	also	seen	to	offer	benefits	beyond	SMS	data	as	it	could	collect	voice	data.	The	study	used	IVR	both	to	distribute	content	and	to	collect	data	from	listeners,	through	a	survey	that	listeners	heard	at	the	end	of	a	radio	program.			Collecting	data	on	media	content	via	the	mobile	phone	survey	was	found	to	have	disadvantages.	The	survey	was	set	up	so	that	only	those	who	had	listened	to	the	content	would	receive	the	survey,	and	this	made	it	impossible	to	compare	with	those	who	did	not	hear	the	content.	Survey	questions	needed	to	be	simple	and	brief	so	that	recipients	would	understand	them	and	be	able	to	answer	them,	and	listeners	must	be	willing	to	stay	on	the	line	through	the	end	of	the	survey.		For	these	and	other	reasons,	the	study	concluded	that	IVR	is	unlikely	to	offer	a	full	replacement	for	more	rigorous	evaluation	methods.	IVR	does	offer	several	M&E	benefits	however,	in	that	it	can	allow	project	implementers	monitor	how	listeners	are	experiencing	programs,	track	mobile	phone	reach	(the	number	of	listeners	who	listen	through	their	mobile	device),	gauge	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 43	knowledge	(whether	the	messages	provided	by	the	program	are	properly	understood),	and	obtain	feedback	on	program	content	(engagement	with	program,	enjoyment,	desire	to	listen	in	the	future,	identification	with/	likability	of	characters,	open-ended	feedback,	etc.).	All	of	this	information	can	be	used	throughout	a	project	to	improve	design	and	understand	impact.			Additional	findings	include	that	despite	the	promising	attributes	of	IVR,	the	technical	limitations	of	the	tested	IVR	system	and	the	resulting	cost	of	gathering	the	data	were	too	great	to	warrant	a	recommendation	of	the	platform	for	conducting	joint	quantitative	and	qualitative	M&E,	at	least	for	organizations	without	in-house	expertise	in	computer	programming.	Findings	suggest	that	IVR	technology	is	not	sufficiently	developed	to	support	M&E	efforts	that	combine	quantitative	and	qualitative	feedback.	IVR	could,	however,	be	used	as	a	part	of	formative	evaluation	and	periodic	monitoring	to	get	a	sense	of	how	a	project	is	doing	and	where	tweaks	might	be	made	(Kraidy	2016).		Another	study	of	VOTO	Mobile	was	aimed	at	analyzing	whether	mobile	phone-based	surveys	are	feasible	and	cost-effective	for	gathering	statistically	significant	information	in	four	low-income	countries	(Afghanistan,	Ethiopia,	Mozambique,	and	Zimbabwe).	In	this	case,	results	showed	that	the	cost	of	a	typical	household	survey	could	be	reduced	by	more	than	90	per	cent	and,	with	care,	mobile	surveys	can	be	a	feasible	tool	to	replace	more	time-consuming	and	expensive	approaches.	Lessons	from	the	exercise	included	that	unless	there	is	special	attention	to	detail,	mobile	survey	response	rates	can	be	lower	than	expected	and	they	often	exclude	the	voice	of	poor	and	vulnerable	groups.	Inclusion	can	be	improved	by	using	voice	messaging	instead	of	SMS,	offering	a	choice	of	languages,	creating	a	retry	pattern	to	ensure	receipt,	providing	a	call	back	channel	to	capture	calls	that	have	been	missed,	using	longer	introductions	to	surveys	to	provide	more	context,	choosing	a	female	voice,	and	paying	close	attention	to	the	time	of	day	of	calls	(Leo	and	Morello	2015).	Using	Internet	Messaging	platforms	for	MEL	In	2016,	ahead	of	South	Africa’s	municipal	elections	the	Africa’s	Voices	Foundation	partnered	with	Livity	Africa	to	evaluate	the	impact	of	a	campaign	to	encourage	young	people	to	vote	and	highlight	issues	that	mattered	to	them.	They	used	online	surveys	of	young	people,	conducted	via	email	and	through	WhatsApp	and	Facebook	Messenger,	and	social	media	posts.	WhatsApp	and	Messenger	were	selected	because	of	their	popularity	among	youth.	It	was	felt	that	WhatsApp	groups	encouraged	conversations	that	would	yield	particularly	useful	feedback	because	the	data	that	can	be	gathered	is	rich,	authentic,	and	provides	insights	into	socio-cultural	beliefs	and	behaviours.	There	were	concerns,	however,	about	privacy	when	using	both	Facebook	Messenger	and	WhatsApp.	Although	the	team	sought	consent	and	stored	the	data	securely,	they	did	not	feel	confident	about	how	the	data	might	be	used	by	the	platforms.	This	was	of	particular	concern	because	youth	were	asked	for	personal	information	like	voting	and	demographics.	The	organizations	have	decided	that	they	would	not	use	these	platforms	in	the	future	unless	privacy	risks	are	fully	understood	before	starting	(ICRC;	The	Engine	Room;	Block	Party;	2017).	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 44		Another	challenge	with	using	messaging	apps	is	the	potential	for	bias.	Relying	on	data	gathered	solely	through	one	app	risks	introducing	statistical	bias	into	analyses	of	a	particular	issue.	Biases	are	related	to	differential	access	to	the	internet	and	mobile	phones	which	affects	representation	of	different	populations	and	potentially	reinforcing	inequalities.	This	type	of	bias	could	also	exacerbate	blind	spots:	for	example,	reports	collected	through	messaging-app	data	might	give	the	impression	that	an	event	or	situation	was	concentrated	in	a	particular	part	of	a	country,	without	taking	account	of	network	outages	or	limited	internet	access	in	other	parts	of	the	country.	Additionally,	women	may	not	be	able	to	access	or	submit	data	over	a	messaging	app	without	the	approval	of	a	man	in	their	household.	(Though	it	should	be	noted	that	this	is	true	for	many	ICTs	and	feedback	initiatives)	(ICRC;	The	Engine	Room;	Block	Party;	2017).	Big	data	and	evaluation	When	behaviour	change	programs	are	carried	out	on	multiple	platforms	that	generate	data,	it	is	possible	to	employ	Big	Data	methods	to	conduct	research,	monitor	and	in	some	cases	evaluate	them.	Global	Pulse,	for	example,	used	digital	data	to	understand	conversations	about	contraception	and	teenage	pregnancy	among	Ugandan	youth,	and	to	analyze	their	perceptions	towards	different	types	of	contraception.	Data	for	the	study	was	extracted	from	public	Facebook	posts	and	UNICEF’s	U-report	platform,	an	SMS-based	polling	system	for	Ugandan	youth.	The	analysis	was	visualized	in	an	interactive	dashboard	that	offered	snapshots	of	the	conversations	about	different	methods	of	contraception	over	time.	It	also	visualized	popular	discussion	topics	associated	with	contraception	and	teen	pregnancy.	The	study	showed	that	there	is	potential	for	digital	data	to	help	track	attitudes	and	perceptions	about	reproductive	health	and	rights	in	real	time,	which	could	support	monitoring	and	evaluation	of	development	programs.	(UN	Global	Pulse	2014)	(Abreu	Lopes	and	Bailur	2018)		In	another	example,	Well	Told	Story	conducted	sentiment	analysis	on	millions	of	digital	media	exchanges	among	fans.	The	analysis	produced	insights	on	the	power	of	collective	discussions	to	stimulate	massive	normative	changes	around	contraception.	A	longitudinal	panel	study	linked	the	normative	shifts	to	behaviour	change	at	scale.	Well	Told	Story	is	a	research	and	media	company	working	on	social	and	behaviour	change	in	East	Africa.	The	agency	produces	a	free,	data-driven,	multimedia	(comic,	radio,	events,	digital	media)	brand	called	Shujaaz.	As	a	component	of	the	Shujaaz	media,	guided,	dynamic	digital	conversations	among	Shujaaz	fans	on	Facebook,	WhatsApp	and	via	SMS	create	a	rich	dataset	that	helps	inform	learning	and	strategy	(Well	Told	Story	2017)	(Abreu	Lopes	and	Bailur	2018).			Although	there	are	emerging	examples	of	how	big	data	could	be	used	to	evaluate	SBCC,	there	are	plenty	of	limitations	including	concerns	about	its	use.	Careless	interpretation	of	big	data	might	lead	to	disproportionate	representation	of	those	who	are	able	to	access	and	use	the	Internet	and	leave	big	data	trails.	Use	of	big	data	requires	adequate	normative	frameworks,	protection	of	privacy,	and	risks	and	harms	mitigation	for	individuals	and	groups	of	individuals.	Access	to	big	data	has	proven	to	be	challenging,	and	it	requires	technical	knowledge,	skills	and	 
Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) 45	budget	to	retrieve,	handle	and	store	it	(Abreu	Lopes	and	Bailur	2018).			7.	Conclusion		The	evidence	base	related	to	digital	social	and	behaviour	change	communications	is	growing	and	becoming	more	robust,	yet	there	is	still	a	need	for	more	theory-based	approaches	and	for	on-going	research	and	evidence	building	to	better	understand	the	complex	nuances	of	this	space.	Digital	tools	and	social	media	are	a	natural	fit	for	SBCC	because	rich	and	multi-layered	approaches	tend	to	have	a	greater	impact	on	behaviour	change.			At	the	same	time,	the	process	of	creating	and	finessing	a	digital	SBCC	approach	is	a	complex	one	that	depends	on	factors	at	the	individual,	family,	community,	society	levels,	as	well	as	media	context	and	access	to	digital	devices,	channels,	platforms	-	and	skills	to	navigate	them.		Digital	SBCC	practitioners	must	be	aware	of	the	potential	paternalistic	and	manipulative	sides	of	digital	behaviour	change	approaches	both	for	ethical	reasons	and	because	new	and	emerging	legislation	provides	greater	rights	to	data	subjects	in	the	area	of	data	privacy,	protection,	security	and	protection	from	digital	profiling.		A	number	of	good	practices	have	emerged	from	the	literature	and	from	known	good	practice	in	the	fields	of	behaviour	change,	digital	development,	communication	for	development	approaches,	and	commercial	tactics	for	using	digital	to	engage	different	populations	in	effective	ways.	These	must	be	framed	in	strong	approaches	to	digital	safe-guarding	to	ensure	that	ethics,	data	privacy,	data	security,	and	overall	child	protection	aspects	are	maintained.		Several	creative	approaches	to	using	digital	and	social	media	for	SBCC	have	emerged	over	the	past	five	years.	They	work	through	a	number	of	channels	and	platforms	to	create	transmedia	approaches	that	are	cemented	in	youth	interests,	contexts,	needs	and	media	/	digital	habits.	Closer	review	of	these	efforts	offers	much	learning	that	can	be	applied	to	future	SBCC	efforts	that	utilize	social	media	and	digital	tools	and	platforms.		An	interesting	challenge	is	how	to	create	lively	and	engaging	transmedia	approaches	that	rely	on	lower-end	tools	and	that	engage	users	who	have	little	to	no	Internet	access.	The	trick	will	be	to	take	ideas	from		high-powered	digital	approaches	and	adapt	them	to	low-tech	environments	in	ways	that	are	highly	engaging	for	young	people.	In	addition,	there	is	a	need	to	design	MERL	approaches	that	take	advantage	of	transmedia	touch	points	where	participant	opinions	and	other	data	can	be	collected	and	used	to	inform	and	shape	the	course	of	on-going	activities.		This	paper	aims	to	stimulate	ideas	on	how	to	address	these	challenges	so	that	digital	SBCC	initiatives	can	be	implemented	and	evaluated	more	effectively	and	with	greater	impact.
