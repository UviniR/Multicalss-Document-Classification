Abstract
Purpose –Internet use has become particularly prevalent among adolescents, prompting much thought and
concern about both its potential benefits and adverse effects on adolescent learning outcomes. Much of the
empirical literature on the impact of Internet use on adolescent learning outcomes is mixed, and few studies
examine the causal relationship between the two in rural China. In order to bridge these gaps, we use empirical
analysis to investigate the effect of Internet use on the learning outcomes of adolescents in rural China.
Design/methodology/approach –We use fixed effect models with samples drawn from a large nationally
representative dataset (the China Family Panel Studies —CFPS) to identify the causal impacts of Internet use on
the learning outcomes of three cohorts (Cohort A ( N5540), Cohort B ( N5287) and Cohort C ( N5827)) of
adolescents in rural China.
Findings –The results of the descriptive analysis show a continued increase in the number of adolescents
accessing the Internet and the amount of time they spend online. The results of the fixed effect models show
that Internet use has positive (in many of the analyses), but mostly insignificant impacts, on the learningoutcomes of adolescents. In the sets of results that find significant associations between Internet use and
learning outcomes, the measured effects are moderate.
Originality/value –This study investigates the causal relationship between Internet use and adolescent
learning outcomes in rural China. The findings claim that there is not a great need to worry about adverse
effects of Internet use on adolescent learning development. Attention, however, should focus on seeking ways
to improve the positive effects of the Internet use on adolescent learning outcomes. The study will provide areference and experience for the development of education and the Internet in rural areas and promote the
integrated development of urban and rural areas in China.

The Internet has grown rapidly in both use and applications worldwide, especially for certain
age groups. Internet use has become an increasingly important part of life in modern societies
and has changed the way people work, learn, communicate and entertain ( Firth et al., 2019 ).
Use of the Internet has become particularly prevalent among adolescents, who are commonly
referred to as “digital natives ”(Thompson, 2013 ). Large shares of adolescents spend much of
their time online and use internet-connected technologies for social interaction,
communication, entertainment, education and information retrieval ( Colley and Maltby,
2008;Subrahmanyam and Greenfield, 2008 ;Kormas et al., 2011 ;Wang et al., 2011 ;Reich et al.,
2012). Studies show that in Singapore adolescents aged 12 to 18 spend an average of
216.25 min per day on the Internet ( Shin and Kang, 2016 ). Nearly all (94%) of Spanish
adolescents with Internet access use instant messaging; 93.5% of Spanish adolescents use
social networking sites ( G/C19omez et al., 2017 ). Similarly, 90% of US teens say they play video
games ( Anderson and Jiang, 2018 ). According to Is¸ik and Alkaya (2017) , 80.8% of adolescents
say they would prefer to browse research websites, and 94.8% of students say they use the
Internet for preparing homework in Ankara, Turkey. Trends indicate a continued increase in
the number of adolescents accessing the Internet, the amount of time they spend online and
the complexity of their online behavior ( Livingstone and Helpsper, 2007 ).
Despite the positive possibilities of Internet use by youth, concerns also have arisen about
potentially adverse effects of Internet use on educational development among adolescents
(Anderson et al., 2007 ;Bricolo et al., 2007 ). Parents, teachers and researchers are concerned
that students who spend excessive time on the Internet may have difficulty completing
homework assignments, studying and getting sufficient sleep to meet their academic
responsibilities ( Sinkkonen et al. , 2014 ). Research has shown that the use of the Internet
occupies the learning time of adolescents and often can distract them since most adolescents
use the Internet to browse websites, listen to music, chat or play games while learning or
doing homework ( Kirschner and Karpinski, 2010 ). Moreover, teenagers use the Internet not
just for learning, but also for socialization, entertainment and other activities ( Qahri-Saremi
and Turel, 2016 ;Chang et al., 2019 ).
In recent years, a number of research teams have empirically studied the correlations
between Internet use and adolescent learning outcomes, but results are mixed. On one hand,
some studies found positive relationships between Internet use and academic performance
measured via grade point averages and standardized test scores over time ( Jackson et al., 2006 ,
2011;Drain et al., 2012 ). Using the Internet for accessing information and reading has been
demonstrated to positively affect the comprehension capacity and learning of adolescents
(Salmer /C19onet al., 2018 ). Empirical research has also shown that information technology (IT) can
provide a highly experiential and interactive learning environment and has potential for
assisting adolescent cognitive, psychological and academic development ( Straker et al., 2009 ;
Jackson et al., 2011 ;Fitton et al., 2013 ;Fonseca et al., 2014 ;Chang et al., 2019 ). Students who use
the Internet for learning and communicating frequently, or just in general, demonstrate better
cognitive capacity than students who do not use the Internet frequently ( Johnson, 2008 ).
On the other hand, there are a number of studies that have found that Internet use can
have either no significant relationship or even a negative correlation with adolescent
academic development ( Sana et al., 2013 ;Qahri-Saremi and Turel, 2016 ;Rashid and Asghar.,
2016). For instance, the time that children spent online in early childhood has empirically been
shown to have a negative and statistically significant impact on their middle childhood
academic performance ( Hurwitz and Schmitt, 2020 ). There are uses of the Internet that are
thought to have a negative impact on educational development, such as the excessive use of
videogames and/or social media ( Turel and Serenko, 2012 ;Sana et al. , 2013 ;Turel, 2015 ).
Mobile phone use also has been found by some research teams to be negatively related to
student academic achievement in addition to increasing attention disorders and depressionCAERproblems ( Harman and Sato, 2011 ;Roberts et al. , 2015 ;Seoet al. , 2016 ;Hsiao et al. , 2017 ).
Qahri-Saremi and Turel (2016) , however, find that there are no significant effects of utilitarian
(school-oriented) Internet use on the educational development outcomes of adolescents.
Although researchers, theoretical and empirical, have focused recently on the issues of the
relationship between Internet use and adolescent academic performance, some gaps exist,
including some common methodological shortcomings. First, most studies use
cross-sectional data and descriptive analysis or relatively simple correlation analysis to
study the association between Internet access and its use on student educational
development (e.g. Moreno et al. , 2011 ;Moreno et al. , 2013 ;Qahri-Saremi and Turel, 2016 ).
As a consequence, few studies have examined the causal impact of Internet use on adolescent
academic performance. Hurwitz and Schmitt (2020) use longitudinal survey data to explore
the association between Internet use in early childhood and academic performance in middle
childhood. Moreover, Liet al. (2006) use a randomized experiment to examine the impact of
computer use on school readiness and cognitive development. However, these studies have
small samples which may not be representative. Second, few research teams have had access
to nationally representative data to study issues of Internet use and the ability of adolescents
to learn. Most literature uses either small or unrepresentative samples to study this
relationship (e.g. Li and Ranieri, 2010 ;Fitton et al., 2013 ;Rahardjo et al., 2016 ;Chang et al.,
2019), which may not lead to reliable and general conclusions. Third, to our knowledge, there
is relatively little research on the impact of Internet access and use on the academic outcomes
of young people in developing countries, both in general and in rural settings in particular.
Most studies only examine the relationship between Internet use or social media use and
educational development of adolescents in developed countries by using data from urban
areas (e.g. Seoet al., 2016 ). Of greatest relevance to this study, there is little empirical work
that has been done in rural China on this issue.
As one of the fastest-growing economies in recent years, China has had a steadily
increasing rate of Internet penetration. In recent years, almost all individuals, including
adolescents, have been able to readily access the Internet in China ( Hong, 2017 ). As of
December 2015, the Internet penetration rate of Chinese adolescents was 85.3%, which was
35 percentage points higher than the overall (individuals of all ages) Internet penetration rate
(CNNIC, 2016 ). In 2015, the proportion of total adolescent Internet users was 72.4% urban and
27.6% rural ( CNNIC, 2016 ). As such, China is both in need of a study of these issues on rural
youth and is also an appropriate setting for studying the effects of Internet use. Our studyfocuses on trying to identify the causal relationship between Internet use and learning
outcomes of adolescents in rural China. In addition, our study uses a nationwide sample from
the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey. Its stratified, multi-stage sampling strategy
ensures that the CFPS sample represents 95% of the total Chinese population in 2010 ( Xie and
Hu, 2014 ). Compared to other data sources, the large-scale, high quality and nationally
representative data from the CFPS can help us better understand the prevalence and trends of
Internet use among rural youth in China ( Li, 2019 ). We try to overcome the methodological
shortcomings of previous studies, especially in terms of identification. Most studies only use
descriptive analysis or relatively simple correlation analysis, while we use fixed-effect modelsto identify the causal impacts of Internet use on learning.
To bridge the gaps in the literature, the overall goal of our study is to answer the following
question: What are the effects of Internet use on the learning outcomes of adolescents in rural
China? To help answer this broad question, we pursue four specific objectives. First, we
report on the trends of Internet access and usage among adolescents in rural China. Second,
we describe the learning outcomes of these adolescents over time. Third, we examine whether
Internet access and usage have an impact on the measured learning. Fourth, we investigate
whether the impacts of Internet use on learning outcomes change for adolescent of different
educational backgrounds and ages.Internet use on

2.1 Sample selection
2.1.1 Sampling. Our study primarily uses data from the CFPS, which is a national and
longitudinal survey conducted by the Institute of Social Science Survey (ISSS) at Peking
University. The CFPS surveys economic and social development and changes in 25 provinces
in China, excluding Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Hainan, Hong Kong,
Macau and Taiwan. The CFPS survey uses a stratified, multi-stage sampling strategy that
ensures the sample represents 95% of the total population of China ( Xie and Hu, 2014 ).
Therefore, the CFPS sample can be regarded as a nationally representative sample.
The CFPS data set lends two strengths to this study. First, compared to other nationally
representative data, such as the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and China ’s census
data, the CFPS is the only existing nationally representative data that contains measures for
both adolescent Internet use and learning ability ( Li, 2019 ). Second, since most previous
studies on this issue rely on cross-sectional data, they cannot establish a causal relationship
between Internet use and adolescent learning outcomes. The longitudinal design of the CFPS
follows the same adolescents through multiple years, helping to address the issues of
simultaneity and reverse causality.
2.1.2 Follow-up and attrition. The first round of data collection was carried out in 2010,
followed by a further four rounds of data collection in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. The CFPS
contains an extensive set of measures of Internet access and usage, learning outcomes and
sociodemographic characteristics of respondents ( Xie and Hu, 2014 ). Our study primarily
uses data from CFPS 2010, CFPS 2014 and CFPS 2018 since the CFPS uses the same set of test
questionnaires every four years to measure learning development. As such, this study is
based on two cohorts of adolescents: One cohort was made up of adolescents aged 14 to 17 in
2010 who were followed up in 2014 when they were aged 18 to 21. The other cohort was made
up of adolescents aged 14 to 17 in 2014 who were followed up in 2018 when they were also
aged 18 to 21.
Focusing on these two cohorts allows us to track changes in Internet access and usage by
adolescents of the same age group between 2010 and 2014 (henceforth, Cohort A ), as well as
changes in Internet access and usage by adolescents of the same age group between 2014 and
2018 ( Cohort B ). In addition, we can examine the learning development for these two cohorts
of adolescents (since the individuals in both cohorts took a test in both years that they
participated in the survey). We also combine these two cohorts (which potentially gives theanalysis additional statistical power) to study the total impact of the Internet on learning
outcomes ( Cohort C ), resulting in three cohorts of adolescents: Cohorts A, B and C.
When tracking the adolescents in the sample over time, the CFPS survey team did
encounter substantial attrition. Our original sample in Cohort A in 2010 included 1,368
adolescents aged 14 to 17. CFPS followed up with 653 of these adolescents in 2014. For Cohort
B, the original sample in 2014 included 980 adolescents aged 14 to 17, of which CFPS followed
up with 441 individuals in 2018. Cohort C was the combination of these two cohorts.
Cohort A and B had follow-up rates of 0.48 ( 5653/1,368) and 0.45 ( 5441/980), respectively.
We also include one additional adjustment to the final sample sizes of the study.
Specifically, we excluded observations that had missing values of the variables that were
included in the study. We also excluded cases where the personal information of the
respondents was inconsistent between 2010 and 2014 or between 2014 and 2018. After
making these adjustments, the final analyzed samples included 540 adolescents in
Cohort A and 287 adolescents in Cohort B. The attrition rates due to missing and
inconsistent data were 0.173 ( 5(653 –540)/653) in Cohort A and 0.349 ( 5(441 –287)/441) in
Cohort B. After all exclusions, a total of 828 adolescents were attrited in Cohort A and a total
of 693 adolescents were attrited in Cohort B. Figure 1 shows, in detail, how samples were
selected and followed up.CAERAs above, we carried out attrition tests for Cohort A and Cohort B to see if the attrition due to
various reasons had any impact on the nature of the sample. We regressed attrition status on
all variables and found that there were essentially no differences between the final analyzed
sample and the attrited sample of both Cohort A and Cohort B, with the exception of one
variable that would be expected to change over time. Specifically, we find that the probability
of family members migrating for work in the attrited sample and the final analyzed sample is
significantly different. For details, please see Table A1 in the appendix.
In order to determine whether adolescents in Cohort A were different from those in Cohort
B, we compared the final analyzed samples in Cohort A and Cohort B. We did so because in
the midst of China ’s rapid growth, technological developments and changes in social
institutions, it is possible that the cohort of adolescents that were aged 14 to 17 in 2010 had
different experiences in Internet/online access than the cohort of adolescents that were aged14 to 17 in 2014. We found that the adolescents in Cohort A and those in Cohort B indeed
showed some differences in their characteristics. For example, the average math test score of
adolescents aged 14 to 17 in Cohort B was 12.86, which was 1.45 lower than the average math
score of adolescents aged 14 to 17 in Cohort A. Moreover, the percentage of adolescents using
the Internet in Cohort B (60%) was higher than the percentage of adolescents in Cohort A
(36%). The average household income per capita (8.50) of adolescents in Cohort B was higher
than that (8.18) of adolescents in Cohort A. While these results mean that we need to be careful
when examining results from Cohort C (which we wish to do, due to the fact that the sample
size of the combined cohort is larger, giving the analysis more statistical power), if there are
differences (or if there are no differences) in the relationship between Internet access/usage
and learning when we use Cohort A or Cohort B, the findings may be meaningful. For details,
seeTable A2 in the appendix, which compares adolescents of Cohort A and Cohort B.
2.2 Data collection
2.2.1 Outcome measurement. The dependent variables in this study are learning outcomes,
as measured by the cognitive ability score of math and language test scales given to a
subset of the respondents of the CFPS. Specifically, the CFPS administered comprehensive
cognition measures for all survey respondents aged 10 and above in all rounds of surveys1368 individuals aged 14-17 in 2010 980 individuals aged 14-17 in 2014

learning
outcomes(Xie and Hu, 2014 ). These measures include two standardized tests –a language test and a
math test ––that were developed to measure verbal and math abilities of respondents as well
as learning performance over time ( Huang et al., 2015 ). The language test had 34 items, and
the math test had 24 items, all of which were drawn from the standard primary and secondary
school curriculums. For each test, a respondent was scored according to the number of
questions that he/she answered correctly. Thus, language test scores ranged from 0 to 34 and
math test scores ranged from 0 to 24.
We also aggregated language test scores and math test scores to get a measure of total
learning performance. A Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.79 confirms that combining these variables
into a single scale is appropriate ( Li, 2019 ). In addition, using the CFPS cognitive test to
measure learning performance can overcome grading inconsistencies across different schools
and/or different teachers ( Zhang and Xie; 2016 ;Miao, 2017 ;Li, 2019 ). In the analysis, we use
the standardized language and math scores.
2.2.2 Internet use measurement. The main set of independent variables that we use in the
analysis is Internet use, measured in four different ways: general Internet usage, weekly
online time, Internet usage for learning and mobile phone usage. General Internet usage is a
binary variable (1 5yes, 05no) that asks respondents whether they had access to the
Internet (in any capacity and via any means) in the CFPS survey. Weekly online time is a
continuous variable (hours) measured by asking respondents how many hours they spend
online each week in their spare time. Internet usage for learning was asked as a categorical
variable captured by a question in the CFPS that asked how often respondents used the
Internet for learning. This was a multiple-choice question with seven answers: An answer of
1 indicates Internet use for learning almost every day; 2 indicates 3 to 4 times per week;
3 indicates 1 to 2 times per week; 4 indicates 2 to 3 times per month; 5 indicates once a month;
6 indicates once every few months; 7 indicates never. In this paper, we transformed these
answers into a dummy variable, defining Internet usage for learning with values of 1 –3a s
“frequent" and assigning these to a new value of 1, and defining Internet using for learning
with values of 4 –7a s “not frequent" and assigning these to a new value of 0. It should be noted
that the CFPS did not collect data on Internet usage for learning until 2014, so this variable
could not be used in the analysis of Cohorts A or C. Mobile phone usage is a dummy variable
(15yes, 05no) measured by asking respondents whether they used a mobile phone.
2.2.3 Control variables. The following covariates are used to control potential confounding
in the relationship between Internet use and adolescent learning outcomes. First, we controlindividual characteristics including age, years of education and paid tutor usage (whether
adolescents participate in for-pay tutoring). Second, several household characteristics are
controlled for, including household income (household log net income per capita), and
whether family members migrated out of their home community for work.
2.3 Statistical methods
This subsection describes our analytical approach. To report on the trends of Internet access
and usage among adolescents and describe their learning development over time in rural
China, we use descriptive analysis. To examine whether Internet access and usage have an
impact on learning outcomes of adolescents, we constructed a fixed effect model as follows:
Y
it¼β0þβ1Internet itþβ2Xitþμiþεit (1)
Yitis the outcome variable representing standardized math test score, language test score and
total score of adolescent iat time t. The independent variables, Internet it, are measured by
general Internet usage, weekly online time, Internet usage for learning and mobile phone
usage. Except for weekly online time, which is a continuous variable, all other variables
contained in Internet itare dummy variables, equal 1 for “yes”and 0 for “no.”Xitis a vector ofCAERcovariates that capture the individual characteristics of each adolescent (whether the
adolescent belongs to 18 –21 age group, years of education and paid tutor usage), as well as
household characteristics (household log net income per capita, whether family members
migrate for work). μiis the individual fixed effect. εitis an error term. We adjust robust
standard errors for clustering at the village level.
In addition, to investigate whether the impacts of Internet use on learning outcomes
change for adolescent of different educational backgrounds and ages, we include two
interaction items, respectively. One is the interaction of Internet use and education (a dummy
variable that is measured by asking whether the adolescent has more than 9 years of
education, 1 5yes, 05no), the other is the interaction of Internet use and age groups
(whether the adolescent belongs to 18 –21 age group, 1 5yes, 05no). We constructed a fixed
effect model as follows:
Yit¼β0þβ1Internet itþβ2Interaction itþβ3Xitþμiþεit (2)
All variables in model (2) are the same as in model (1), except for Internet it, which is the
interaction between Internet use and education or the interaction between Internet use and
age group. As before, all regressions employ robust standard errors clustered at the
village level.
3. Results
3.1 Descriptive analysis
In this initial subsection of the paper, we use descriptive analysis to both provide context for
and summarize our data on adolescent Internet use and learning outcomes. The Internet use
and learning outcomes of sample adolescents are reported in Table 1 . The variables that we
use for describing Internet usage, mobile phone usage and weekly online time demonstrate in
what ways adolescents are increasing their use of the Internet. General Internet use (row 4,
column 3 and column 6) and mobile phone use (row 7, column 3 and column 6) increased
significantly by about 40 percentage points in both Cohort A and Cohort B. The same
conclusion can be drawn from Cohort C (row 4 and row 7, column 9), which is the combination
of cohorts A and B. Weekly online time increased significantly by between 6.64 (row 5,
column 3) and 9.56 (row 5, column 6) hours in cohorts A and B, as did Internet usage forlearning in Cohort B, which increased by 24 percentage points (row 6, column 6). We also find
that, from the comparison of cohorts A and B, Internet use is becoming more popular among
adolescents over time.
Looking at learning outcomes from Table 1 , indicators measured by math test scores,
language test scores and total scores show that adolescent learning outcomes have increased
over time in all cohorts showing that adolescents perform better as they grow. In Cohort A,
math test scores rose from 14.31 (row 1, column 1) to 15.40 (row 1, column 2) between 2010 and
2014 and language test scores rose from 25.08 (row 2, column 1) to 26.02 (row 2, column 2).
In Cohort B, math tests scores rose from 12.86 (row 1, column 4) to 17.70 (row 1, column 5), and
language test scores rose from 25.50 (row 2, column 4) to 27.74 (row 2, column 5). In all cohorts,
math test scores increase more than language test scores do, and we find that for all score
measurements, growth over time is the largest in Cohort B, indicating that the learning
outcomes of the adolescents in Cohort B have increased the most. A possible reason for this is
that, compared with Cohort A, more adolescents in Cohort B choose to stay at home for
education and take part in for-pay tutoring instead of going out to work, although these
differences are not significant. Adolescents in Cohort B also have higher rates of Internet use.
In addition, between 2014 and 2018, the Ministry of Education of China issued several plans
on education informatization, such as the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Educational
Informatization ”in 2016 and the “Action Plan for Educational Informatization 2.0 ”in 2018.Internet use on

Appendix Table A2 . Thus, it is hypothesized that Internet use may be related to learning
outcomes.
3.2 The impacts of Internet use
Results for the impact of general Internet use on math and language scores for all cohorts are
found in Table 2 and are reported in standard deviations. Focusing on Cohort A (that is the
adolescents that were 14 –17 years old in 2010 and 18 –21 years old in 2014 —nA5540), we see
no significant effects of general Internet usage on learning outcomes. The coefficient for math
score (0.07 —row 1, column 1) is positive, but insignificant (standard error 50.06). The
coefficient for language score, while positive and larger (0.14 —row 1, column 2), is also
insignificant (standard error 50.08).
The results are slightly different for Cohort B ( nB5287), the cohort that was 14 –17 in
2014, especially for language. As in the case of Cohort A, we find a positive but insignificant
effect of general Internet use on math scores (coefficient 50.01; standard error 50.11—row
1, column 3). However, for the impact of general Internet use on language scores, we do see a
positive and significant coefficient. The coefficient (0.27) is significant at the 0.05 level of
significance. Despite being positive and significant, this effect is still moderate. A coefficient
of this size implies that if a student from Cohort B uses the Internet, their language score
increases by 0.27 standard deviations.
In Cohort C, the combination of cohorts A and B (so nC5827), we see results that roughly
fall between those in columns 1 to 4. There is no effect of general Internet use on math scores(row 1, column 5). The impact of general Internet use on language scores, however, is positive
and significant (row 1, column 6). As in the case of the impact of general Internet use on
learning outcomes when we only use Cohort B, the magnitude of the coefficient
(coefficient 50.17; standard error 50.07) is moderate (and is smaller than the measured
effect using just Cohort B as shown in the previous paragraph).
InTable 3 , the analysis examines the impact of the other three measures of Internet use,
Weekly online time, Internet usage for learning and Mobile phone usage. We first look at the
results for both Cohorts A and B of the impact of weekly online time on learning outcomes [1].
In the case of the weekly online time [2]regressions (row 1), we find few significant impacts,
and for those we do find, the magnitudes of the measured effects are relatively small. In
Cohort A in the language score regression (row 1; column 2) and in Cohort B in the math and
language score regressions (row 1; columns 3 and 4), none of the coefficients are statistically
significant from zero. In the case of math scores for students in Cohort A, however, we find the
measured impact is negative and significant. In other words, like a number of authors in the
literature predict ( Hurwitz and Schmitt, 2020 ;Junco and Cotten, 2012 ;Lepp et al., 2015 ), when
students are online for more time each week, their learning outcomes (in this case math score)
suffer. However, it is important to note that, although negative, the magnitude of the
coefficient is small. In fact, the magnitude (in absolute value) is more than 50 times smaller
than the effect of general Internet usage that we found above ( Table 2 , row 1, column 4). This
means that if the average student in Cohort A increased their weekly online time by one hour,
their math score would only fall by 0.004 standard deviations.
In the analysis of the impacts of Internet usage for learning on the learning outcomes of
adolescents we only run regressions using data from Cohort B. The more restricted analysis
was necessary as Internet usage for learning was not measured until 2014 ( Table 3 , row 5).
According to the findings, the coefficients for math and language scores are both positive.
Despite this, these coefficients are also not significantly different from zero.Internet use on

adolescents in both Cohorts A and B. Here we can see that in Cohort A, the sign on the
coefficient for math score is positive while the sign on the coefficient for language score is
negative ( Table 3 , row 9). In Cohort B both coefficients are positive. As with Internet usage for
learning, however, these coefficients are not significant for either cohort.
3.3 Heterogeneous effects
To further draw out important effects of Internet use on academic achievement, we now
examine important adolescent subgroups, specifically educational background and age.Education is the most important contributing factor to the level of Internet skills of students,
which positively affect adolescent academic performance and intellectual capacity
(van Deursen and van Dijk, 2011 ;van Deursen and van Diepen, 2013 ). Students with
higher levels of education draw more benefit from using social media for learning, interaction
and collaboration ( Chai-Lee, 2013 ). As children grow older, their cognitive processes and
abilities (language, perception, memory and metacognition) improve substantially in
response to genetic and environmental forces ( Spiess et al. , 2016 ), thus Internet as an
environmental stimulus may have a greater impact on learning development of older
adolescents.
Results for the impact of general Internet use on math and language scores for adolescents
of different educational backgrounds are found in Table 4 . Looking at Cohort A, we find that,
while the signs on the point estimates of the coefficients are mixed for the poorly educated and
positive for the highly educated, only the effect on the language score of highly educated
adolescents is significant (row 10, column 2). The coefficient (0.28) is significant at the 0.01
level and moderate in size. In Cohort B, the signs of the coefficients are mixed for the poorly
educated and negative for the highly educated, but none of these effects are statistically
different from zero.

learning
outcomeslargely follow those of the analysis with no interaction and are presented in Table 5 . We first
examine the effects of weekly online time on the learning outcomes of adolescents of different
educational backgrounds. We find few significant impacts of weekly online time on learning
outcomes, and the ones that we do find are relatively small. We see that, for Cohort A, weekly
online time affects the math scores of the poorly educated (coefficient 5/C00.006; row 1,
column 1) and the language scores of the highly educated (coefficient 50.007; row 2, column 2),
both at a significance level of p50.05. This means that if the average poorly educated
adolescent in Cohort A increased their weekly online time by one hour, their math score would
fall by 0.006 standard deviations, and that if the average highly educated adolescent did the
same, their language score would rise by 0.007 standard deviations. The other coefficients for
Cohort A, math scores of the highly educated and language scores of the poorly educated are
not statistically different from zero. In Cohort B, while coefficients for the math and language
scores of both the poorly and highly educated are all positive, they are also all small and not
statistically different form zero.
Similar to the regressions with no interaction, Internet usage for learning and mobile
phone usage have almost no significant impacts on the learning outcomes of adolescents of
different educational backgrounds, with one exception. In Cohort B, we find that, for the
poorly educated, mobile phone usage has a positive and significant impact on language
scores. This impact (coefficient 50.26) is significant at the p50.05 level [3]. In the case of all
other regressions (the heterogeneous impacts of Internet use for learning on the math andVariablesCohort A Cohort B

Turning to the impact of general Internet use on the learning outcomes of adolescents of
different age groups, shown in Table 6 , we also find similar results to our previous interaction
comparison (in Table 4 ). For adolescents in the 18 –21 age group in Cohort A, we see that
general Internet use has a positive effect (coefficient 50.29; row 10, column 2) on language
scores [4]. Although this effect is significant at the p50.05 level, this is the only significant
effect we see in this analysis.
InTable 7 , which presents the impact of other measures of Internet use (Weekly online
time, Internet usage for learning and Mobile phone usage) on the learning outcomes of
adolescents of different age groups, we find only one significant effect, which was in Cohort B.
We found that mobile phone usage affected the language scores of adolescents in the 14 –17
age group (coefficient 50.30; row 11, column 4) at a significant level of p50.05. All other
measured effects in this analysis are insignificant. Again, the magnitude of this effect isVariablesCohort A Cohort B

4. Conclusion
Although previous studies have investigated the impact of Internet use on adolescent
academic performance, the causal relationship between the two is not yet fully understood.
Most of the studies on this topic only use cross-sectional data and descriptive analysis tostudy this relationship in developed countries. To bridge these gaps in the literature, we have
examined the causal relationship between Internet use and adolescent learning outcomes
using in two different cohorts, using fixed-effect models and longitudinal data from three
waves of a nationally representative survey in rural China. We also investigated the
heterogeneous effects of Internet use on adolescents of different educational backgrounds
and ages.
The findings of this study are consistent with research which shows that Internet use as
measured by a comprehensive set of items (General Internet usage, Weekly online time,
Internet usage for learning and Mobile phone usage) largely has no significant impact on
adolescent academic performance ( Qahri-Saremi and Turel, 2016 ;Rashid and Asghar, 2016 ;
Hsiao et al., 2017 ). We found that most coefficients were insignificant, but of those that were
not, the analysis showed that there were moderate positive effects, which were partially in
line with the results of some studies that demonstrate a positive relationship between Internet
use and academic performance ( Bawaneh, 2011 ;Jackson et al., 2011 ;Fonseca et al., 2014 ). The
findings show that Internet use causes no harm to adolescent learning development and there
is no need to worry about the potentially adverse effects of the Internet.
In addition, our results showed that Internet use had almost no heterogeneous effects on
the learning outcomes of adolescents of different educational backgrounds and age groups. In
the regressions that did show impact, the results demonstrated that the effects onVariablesCohort Aa

The impact of general
Internet usage onlearning outcomes of
adolescent in different
age groups in Cohort ACAERstandardized math and language scores in Cohorts A and B were significant but moderate
among these groups. Specifically, the language scores of highly educated adolescents in
Cohort A would increase if they had a general Internet use. In Cohort B, the significant and
positive effect was the effect of mobile phone usage on the language scores of the poorly
educated. For adolescents of different age groups, we found that adolescents in the older
group in Cohort A would increase their language scores if they had a general Internet use.
Mobile phone usage had a positive impact on language scores of adolescents in the younger
group in Cohort B.
The fact that we find few significant impacts can likely be attributed to digital divides,
which refers to gaps in not only Internet access but also digital skills (or Internet skills, digital
competences). Since the Internet is increasingly widespread in developing countries, the lack
of digital skills is becoming a key problem ( van Deursen and van Dijk, 2009 ). Although
existing research has different definitions of digital skills, they all believe that digital skillsshould involve the abilities to use a digital device and the Internet efficiently and effectively
(Hargittai, 2003 ;Pagani et al., 2016 ). In addition, digital skills play a significant role in student
learning ( van Deursen and van Diepen, 2013 ;Hurwitz and Schmitt, 2020 ). However, digital
divide usually occur between rural and urban settings ( Philip et al. , 2017 ), since rural
adolescents are in low socioeconomic status and they lack chances and guidance to practiceVariablesCohort A Cohort B

outcomestheir digital skills, such as school information communication technology (ICT) facilities,
teaching resources. Moreover, lower-income parents are less likely to offer help and expertise
for ICT use ( Zhong, 2011 ). Although adolescents have high Internet access in rural China,
Internet access does not necessarily guarantee that individuals will have the necessary skills
to enjoy the benefits brought by ICTs ( Ono and Zavodny, 2007 ;Zhong, 2011 ). As we did not
explore this, we include it as a limitation of our study.
Further attention should also be paid to distinct patterns of Internet use, as each pattern is
likely to have different impacts on adolescent development. In particular, it seems likely that
social activities such as text messaging, email and social media use have different impacts
than playing video games or browsing the web ( Wilmer et al., 2017 ). For instance, using social
media requires expressive and receptive written language competencies, which involve
successive cognitive processing and help to improve language achievement ( Johnson, 2006 ;
Abrahim et al., 2019 ). Video game usage has been found to be related to the visual and spatial
skills of children ( Green and Bavelier, 2007 ), which are believed to contribute to math
achievement ( Anobile et al. , 2013 ). Moreover, using the Internet for accessing information,
mostly for learning, can have positive impacts on adolescent educational development
(Willoughby, 2008 ). Considering the potential impacts of different patterns of Internet use on
specific learning developments among adolescents, further research is required to study how
these patterns affect adolescent development.
Unfortunately, we are unable to address potential mechanisms of the effects of Internet
use on adolescent learning outcomes as they are outside the scope of our analysis. When
looking to the literature, to our knowledge, no studies have been able to address the
mechanisms by which Internet use affects adolescent learning outcomes, revealing a larger
gap in the literature as a whole. This limitation presents an opportunity for future research to
address these potential mechanisms.
Despite limitations, our study has important implications. Information technology has
developed rapidly and brought significant changes to personal life in recent years. This is
especially significant, as the Internet is increasingly viewed as an environmental stimulus
with a potential impact on adolescent growth and development ( Young, 2007 ;Johnson and
Puplampu, 2008 ;Fuhrmann et al., 2015 ). Our study finds that Internet access and usage cause
no harm to adolescent learning development, and even have some positive but moderate
impacts on learning outcomes, although most impacts are statistically insignificant. Future
research should focus on ways to improve these positive effects.
Notes
1. Please note, in the rest of the paper, we do not include the results from cohort C, as they are similar to
those for cohorts A and B. For the interested user, however, please see the online appendix with theseresults —<Appendix >.
2. To draw out and examine potential nonlinear relationships between weekly online time and test
scores, we initially included the squared term in the regression. We found that the results wereessentially unchanged, and thus we omit it from the analysis.
3. As Internet use for learning was not measured until 2014, we only study Cohort B for this regression.4. In this table, we only use data from Cohort A, as Cohort B exhibits multicollinearity between general
Internet usage and 18 –21 age group.
