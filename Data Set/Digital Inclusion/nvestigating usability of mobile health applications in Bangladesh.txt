Abstract
Background: Lack of usability can be a major barrier for the rapid adoption of mobile services. Therefore, the
purpose of this paper is to investigate the usability of Mobile Health applications in Bangladesh.
Method: We followed a 3-stage approach in our research. First, we conducted a keyword-based application search
in the popular app stores. We followed the affinity diagram approach and clustered the found applications into
nine groups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in total) and conducted a heuristic
evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest downloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30
participants.
Results: We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature from heuristic inspection. The most
(21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and minimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale
(SUS) scores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the heuristic evaluation. Thus,
the results of heuristic evaluation and user studies complement each other.
Conclusion: Overall, the findings suggest that the usability of the mobile health apps in Bangladesh is not
satisfactory in general and could be a potential barrier for wider adoption of mobile health services.

Background
Digitalization can play an important role in delivering
health services to individuals and communities. Hospitals
have been digitalizing their services and renovating the
whole process of health care. Digitalization not only helps
to improve patient safety and satisfaction but also keeps
health statistics of the population up-to-date. Since an
approximate of 6 billion people (around 75% of the world
population) have access to mobile phones, mobile health
applications have become an important channel for pro-
viding healthcare services by healthcare service providers
[1]. Therefore, mHealth (mobile health) as a field of
research has become prominent in recent years. In
general, the term mHealth refers to the practice of using
mobile devices in health care services [ 2]. The Global
Observatory for eHealth defines mHealth as “medical and
public health practice supported by mobile devices, such asmobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital
assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices ”[3]. The
mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices to
improve the process of medical data collection [ 4], service
delivery [ 5], patient-doctor communication [ 6], and real-
time monitoring and adherence support [ 7].
The mHealth applications have even been widely used
in the remote villages of developing countries [ 8]. For
example, doctors in Tanzania can use Afya Mtandao
(Swahili for Health Network) network from anywhere in
the country even during the surgical operation through
mobile phones [ 9]. United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) has built the foundation
of Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA), a
support for the development of a health informatics
network for maternal patients using mobile phones.
Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and Use Results
(MEASURE) is another US (United States) funded pro-
ject that focuses mainly on the development of mobile
platforms for monitoring health in developing countries

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1033-3[10]. Most of these mHealth services in developing
countries rely on text messaging [ 10] in health related
issues such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
prevention [[ 11–14]]. These messages are also used to
bridge the community and the health worker [ 15].
In Bangladesh, a number of initiatives on mHealth have
already been taken by the government and the non-
government organizations. These include developing mo-
bile applications for health care service delivery, personal
health tracking, remote consultation, and information de-
livery. However, the outcomes of these initiatives are not
well understood. There has been very little research in the
mHealth domain of Bangladesh. There are a few studies,
which mainly focused to assess the opportunities, and
challenges of using Information Technology in the health
sector of Bangladesh [ 16–19]. However, very few studies
have been conducted that evaluate the mHealth applica-
tions in Bangladesh in terms of usability. Usability is de-
fined as the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with
which users achieve specified goals in a specific context of
use [ 20]. Usability is one of the key quality attributes for
the successful development and adoption of mHealth apps
like any other digital applications [ 21–24] . Therefore, the
objective of this research is to understand the state of the
art of the mHealth applications developed in Bangladesh,
and to assess the overall usability of these applications.
Consequently, this paper addresses the following research
questions:
How usable are the mHealth applications in Bangladesh?
Does the usability vary depending on the type of
applications?
To attain this research objective, this paper follows a
3-stage research process: systematic application review,
expert inspection, and user studies. The findings suggest
that the usability of the mHealth apps in Bangladesh is
not satisfactory in general. Based on the findings, the
paper provides several actionable guidelines for the
practitioners.
ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in
healthcare services has brought revolutionary changes by
enhancing service quality, ensuring safety and clinical
effectiveness. Research on health informatics, in the
form of mHealth, has gained much attention [ 25]. A
synopsis on the impact of mobile applications in public
health can be found in the study of Fiordelli et al. [ 25].
They reviewed mHealth related studies published be-
tween 2002 and 2012 and found that mHealth services
are mostly focused on chronic conditions. They also
found a lack of mHealth related studies in Asia. In fact,
very few studies have been conducted on the influence
and adequacy of mHealth services in developing
countries like Bangladesh.In order to understand the influence of mHealth on
public health services, Ahmed et al. [ 19] studied the
existing eHealth and mHealth enterprises and
assessed their prospects in Bangladesh. They found
that tele-consultation, prescription, and referral are
the most common initiatives. They also suggested that
the availability of trained health care professionals,
capacity building, research support, and experience
factors sharing are the key for promoting and imple-
menting mHealth services in Bangladesh. In another
study, Prodhan et al. [ 26] investigated the telemedi-
cine initiatives and their interoperability. They found
that most of the initiatives have different formats of
data. Different data format along with lack of proper
data storage facilities greatly affect the interoperability
among the existing health care services. They further
found that most of these projects work well at the
beginning, but fail in the long run due to lack of
publicity and user acceptance. Thus, they recommend
for a standard data storage policy as well as a proper
awareness program to increase the usage of telemedi-
cine services.
Ahsan et al. [ 27] conducted a survey on the sub-
scribers of Aponjon , an app that serves pregnant women
or new mother. This study concludes that mHealth can
significantly contribute to improving health status. Prue
et al. [ 28] found that mobile phone services could assist
health professionals by rapidly detecting and treating
patients with Malaria in a remote area in Bangladesh.
Khatun et al. [ 29] conducted a survey on 4915 randomly
selected personals and proposed a framework to assess
the community readiness (in terms of technological, mo-
tivational and resource) towards mHealth services in
Bangladesh. The study found that the community has
access to mHealth services, but a noticeable gap is
present between the users ’readiness and technological
competencies. In another study, Khatun et al. [ 30]r e a f -
firmed this framework by conducting 37 in-depth inter-
views with the aim to identify the potential obstacles and
possible solutions for mHealth services in Bangladesh.
Similarly, another in-depth interview study was conducted
by Eckersberger et al. [ 31] to explore if women are inter-
ested to receive text messages on their phone for contra-
ceptive use and family planning in Bangladesh. Huda et al.
[32] explored the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived
appropriateness of using the mobile phone (in a poor rural
community in Bangladesh) to receive a voice message, dir-
ect counselling, and unconditional cash transfers to pro-
vide food and nutrition guide during pregnancy and the
first year of a child ’s life. The study found that most of the
mothers did not feel any major problem to operate mobile
phones and the mothers provided very positive feedbacks
that support the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriate-
ness of the mobile messaging program.Islam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 2 of 13A few studies also discussed the design, development,
evaluation of mobile health applications. For example,
Islam et al. [ 33] discussed the design and development
of a mHealth application named DiaHealth . They exam-
ined the diabetes related health apps and extracted the
most important features for developing DiaHealth app
for diabetes. In another study, Shermin et al. [ 34] briefly
discussed VirtualEyeDoc app and its effectiveness. This
app is designed in Bengali language to help Bangladeshi
people to identify their vision problem and maintain
good eye health. Zaman & Mamun [ 35] designed a pre-
ventive app for cardiovascular diseases and depicted the
importance of such app in Bangladesh. Hoque et al. [ 36]
developed a mobile-based remote monitoring system to
aid the palliative care treatment for rural breast cancer
patients in Bangladesh. Khan et al. [ 37] designed a
mHealth app, PurpleAid for the women of Bangladesh.
The app is designed to diagnose women specific diseases
and provide suggestions to prevent and cure.
A number of studies also investigated the adoption and
post-adoption of mHealth applications in Bangladesh. For
example, Hoque et al. [ 38] proposed a theoretical model
that predicts behavioral intention to adopt mHealth appli-
cations of the elder citizens in Bangladesh. They used the
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use (UTAUT) model
and derived a set factors of mHealth acceptance in
Bangladesh. The factors include gender, the experience of
using a mobile phone, performance expectancy, effort ex-
pectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic
motivation, price, and habit. Akhter et al. [ 39] developed a
service quality model in the context of mHealth services
by framing its relationship with satisfaction, continuance
intention and quality of life. In another study, Akhter et al.
[40] developed an mHealth continuance model by incorp-
orating the role of service quality and trust.
Finally, only a few studies investigated usability and
user experience of mHealth services. Haque et al. [ 36]
developed a mobile application for breast cancer patients
in Bangladesh by following a participatory design
process involving both patients and doctors. They also
explored the key quality of such kind of system to accept
and adopted by users of Bangladesh. The study found
that the quality of such a system might depend on us-
ability (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) and sustain-
ability. In another study, Bhuiyan et al. [ 41] proposed an
SMS (short message service) based immunization system
and then valuated the usability of a SMS alert system for
immunization. Two approaches were used to test the us-
ability: (a) system centric that measures the availability,
localizability, supportability, security, and technical feasi-
bility of the mHealth service; and (b) human centric that
measures the knowledge of usage, learnability, memor-
ability, and satisfaction of the user. As outcome, this
usability study found that the SMS alert system waseffective to the end users, found very easy to use, Learn
ability, reliability and satisfaction rate was also higher,
and the participants were willing to use the proposed
system instead of manual system, which indicate the
overall efficacy and efficiency of the proposed SMS
based immunization system.
Taken together, our literature review indicates that us-
ability has not been the key focus in most prior research
conducted in Bangladesh.
Methods
We followed a 3-stage research approach to achieve the
research objectives. Stage I aimed to provide the present
status of developed mHealth applications and the other
two stages ( Stage II and Stage III ) aimed to assess the
usability of mHealth applications in Bangladesh. These
stages were carried out in sequential order. In stage I, all
mHealth applications developed for the users/citizens of
Bangladesh were investigated to extract data related to
their functionalities/features and targeted users. The ex-
tracted data were analyzed to provide the present status,
as well as create categories of mHealth applications in
Bangladesh. In Stage II , we carried out expert inspec-
tions [ 42] on a number of selected apps. The set of
heuristics to conduct the expert inspection were ex-
tracted and synthesized from the existing literature.
The expert inspections were carried out by three
Human-Computer Interactio n (HCI)/usability experts.
Each expert evaluated each of the 36 selected applica-
tions. Finally, in Stage III , a survey was conducted to
get feedback scores from users using System Usability
Scale (SUS) [ 43]. We evaluated 9 mHealth applica-
tions in this stage. The feedback scores were collected
from 30 participants. An overview of the research
method is shown in Fig. 1. The detailed discussions
of each stage along with the findings are discussed in
the following sections.
Stage I: app review
This stage of research was aimed to investigate the exist-
ing mHealth apps in Bangladesh. We conducted the
following two sequential steps in this stage.
Application search
We performed keywords based search in the popular
app stores: Google Play, Apple App Store, Windows
Phone Marketplace, and Blackberry App World during
the period of March 2018 –April 2018. The keywords
are ‘Mobile health Bangladesh ’,‘Apps for healthcare
Bangladesh ’,‘Fitness Bangladesh ’,‘Doctor Bangladesh ’,
‘Health Tracker Bangladesh ’,‘Bangladesh Health Doctor ’,
‘Healthy Bangladesh ’,‘Digital Health Bangladesh ’,
‘Bangla Health Guide ’,‘Healthy Bangladesh Citizens ’,
‘Pocket Medicine Bangladesh ’,a n d ‘Bangladesh healthIslam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 3 of 13care ’. Each app appeared in the search results was
checked meticulously to ensure whether the applica-
tion is for health care service and targeted for the
users from Bangladesh.
Analysis and results
We found 234 mobile health applications that are
developed for the users of Bangladesh. These apps
were analyzed to understand the present status of
mobile health applications in Bangladesh from three
perspectives: health services covered by the mobile
applications and targeted end users of these
applications.
Clustering mHealth apps Each app was analyzed to ex-
tract information related to its functionalities or features.
The functionalities of the mHealth apps were analyzed
through an affinity diagram [ 44]. All four authors of this
article participated in the clustering process in two inde-
pendent expert groups. First, the apps were stack in
different or similar cluster based on its functionalities by
the two expert groups. Second, the expert groups added
cluster headers. Third, the expert groups drew the affin-
ity diagram by organizing these on the board and then
expert groups reviewed the clusters and relations be-
tween the clusters and then modified the diagram where
needed. Finally, these two sets of diagrams were analyzed
by all experts to prepare one affinity diagram and come
up with the final clusters.
At the end of the process, we found nine clusters:
General Health Informative Apps, Institutional Apps,
Fitness Apps, Physician Information, Mother & Child,
Disease Specific Care App, Food & Nutrition, Herbology,
and Homeopathic. The number of applications in each
cluster is presented in Table 1. We found that one third
of the total apps were developed to provide information
related to health care, followed by institutional apps
(12%). 10% of the apps were related to physician infor-
mation whereas, another 10% was related to body fitness.Similarly, 9% of apps were related to mother & child,
whereas, another 9% was related to herbology. Finally,
food & nutrition accounted for 7%, disease specific care
apps accounted for 5%, and homeopathic accounted for
4% of the total apps.
General Health Informative Apps provide generic in-
formation related to the health. Example apps in this
category includes Patient Aid, and Bangla Health Guide.
Physician Information apps provide information about
doctors including their expertise, appointment proced-
ure, contact information, hospital locations, and treat-
ment time. This category includes apps such as Practical
Diagnosis and Management, Doctora, and Ms. Daktar.
The category, Institutional Apps includes apps that pro-
vide information related to a specific hospital and their
services, location, contact information, opening time,
and emergency number. Example apps in this category
include Hashpatal and BD Hospitals. Apps that provide
information/assistance for physical exercise, weight loss
or gain, and different types of body building exercises
belong to the Fitness Apps category. Example apps in
this cluster are Bangla Gym Guide, and Yoga Guide
Bangladesh. Mother & Child apps were developed to

women, and new mother. Examples in this category are
Aponjon, and Momota. Applications that provide infor-
mation (remedies and precautions) about a particular
disease belong to the Disease Specific Care Apps cat-
egory. For example, Breast Screening, and Rabies fall in
this category. Food & Nutrition cluster includes apps
that provide information about healthy food, and nutri-
tion information for good health. Example apps that fall
in this category are Bangla Vitamin Guide, and Pusti
Kotha. All herbal treatment, herbal medicine, and
herbal information related applications are grouped
under the Herbology cluster. Herbology apps also pro-
vide all sorts of herbal remedies and their preventive
and curative properties. For example, Bangladeshi
Herbal Treatment, and Herbal Medicine Bangla apps
fall in this category. Finally, apps that provide informa-
tion and medication support related to the Homeo-
pathic treatment belong to the Homeopathic cluster.
Example apps in this category are Homeopathy Guide,
and Homeopathic Bangla Book.
Targeted users of mHealth apps We found that the
targeted users of mHealth applications were healthcare
professionals (4%), mom & kids (15%), patients (24%),
and other users (57%) (e.g. health-conscious people). It
was striking to observe that none of the apps was devel-
oped for the disabled people. We also found that none
of the applications were developed for illiterate people.
These results indicate that mHealth apps in Bangladesh
overlooked marginalized people.
Stage II: heuristic inspection
In this stage, we randomly selected four mobile applica-
tions from each category (i.e., a total 36 apps) for heuris-
tic usability evaluation.
Heuristic selection
Prior literature proposed different sets of heuristics to
evaluate usability of web and desktop applications such
as Nielsen ’s 10 general principles for interaction design
[45], Tognazzini ’s 16 principles of user interface (UI)
design [ 46], Garrett ’s 7 guidelines to design websites
[47], Schneiderman ’s 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design
[48] and Sollenberger ’s 10 fundamentals for UI design
[49]. Among these, Nielsen ’s 10 general principles are
widely used [ 50]. Thus, we adapted Nielsen ’s 10 princi-
ples in this study to evaluate usability of the selected
mHealth applications. The list of heuristics is presented
inAppendix 1 .
Conducting expert inspection
The selected applications were evaluated based on the
heuristics presented in Table 6 in Appendix 1 by threeusability experts (first three authors of this article).
Among them, one had 10 years of experience in UI de-
sign and evaluation with a PhD degree in HCI, while
other two were postgraduate students (one in PhD and
one in MSc program) in Computer Science and had 2 –
3 years of experience in usability evaluation and UI
design. Each usability expert conducted the inspection
independently. Individual evaluation report for each ap-
plication was then compared to write a single report for
each application. In some cases, there were conflicts
raised about the revealed problems. These conflicts were
solved by discussions. For heuristic evaluation, Nielsen ’s
(1995) [ 45] concept of severity rating (0 to 4) was
adopted ,with 0, indicating not a usability problem at all;
1, cosmetic problem only; 2, minor usability problem; 3,
major usability problem; and 4, usability catastrophe. A
few examples of usability problems for CareSatisfaction
application are presented in Appendix 2 .
Analysis and results
The study data was analyzed to find out the overall us-
ability, heuristics that are violated, and severity associ-
ated with each heuristic violation. We found 406
problems by evaluating 36 mHealth applications with an
average severity of 2.74 (see Table 2). Around 21% of oc-
currences were related to the violation of the heuristic
‘Aesthetic and minimalist design (H7) ’. The least
(around 4%) violated heuristic was the ‘Customization
and shortcuts (H6) ’. In general, heuristics related to the
user control and freedom (H2), Consistency and Stan-
dards (H3), and readability and glanceability (H10)
showed high severity while physical interaction and
ergonomics (H8) showed less severity. More than half
(61%) of the total revealed problems were Catastrophic
and Major problems. Catastrophic problems were ob-
served in terms of all heuristics, but maximum number
is found for H7 and H10.
Apps related to the Physician Information, Institu-
tional Apps, and Disease Specific Care Apps showed
highest percent of usability problems, while the apps re-
lated to Fitness Apps and Herbology showed highest se-
verity score (see Table 3). Slightly smaller numbers of
usability problems were found for apps that belong to
Mother & Child and Food & Nutrition cluster. The aver-
age severity level varies from 2.1 to 3, with Herbology
showing the maximum severity score. A high number
(from 16 to 33%) of catastrophic problems were found
for each cluster.
Table 4shows the number of times each of the heuris-
tics was violated. As shown in the table, each of the heu-
ristics was violated from minimum one to maximum 12
times for each cluster except the Mother & Child cluster.
We calculated the number of usability problems and
the number of UIs in each application. The PearsonIslam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 5 of 13Correlation Coefficient tests between the number of UIs
and the problems observed ( r= 0.0899, p= 0.656) and
between the number usability problems and the average
severity rating of each application ( r= 0.3128, p= 0.112)
were non-significant.
Stage III: user study
Participants profile
We prepared a list of 50 individuals who could par-
ticipate in our study using snowball sampling. We
sent email invitations to these individuals for partici-
pating in our study. Among them 30 individuals
agreed to participate in this study. Therefore, a struc-
tured user survey was conducted among these 30 (17
males and 13 females) participants. The recruited par-
ticipants ’profession includes undergraduate students,banker, teacher, intern doctor and housewife. The
participants ’average age was approximately 33 years
and ranged from23 to 55 years. All the participants
are experienced with smart phones and mobile appli-
cations. Twenty-one participants had experience with
the use of mHealth applications and used 2 –3m o b i l e
health applications.
Study procedure
The study was conducted in a Software Engineering lab
at the authors ’institute following the System Usability
Scale (SUS) [ 43] evaluation procedure. The SUS is a sim-
ple, ten items scale that provides the overall view of sub-
jective usability assessment. The SUS consists of 10
items, with odd-numbered items worded positively and
even-numbered items worded negatively. The questionsTable 2 Number of unique usability problems identified by the evaluators

SUS is a Likert scale, and the respondents indicate
their level of agreement or disagreement on a scale of
1 to 5 for each statement. Nine mHealth apps, 1 from
each category were selected for evaluation. The appli-
cations that had maximum downloads were selected
for user testing. The test was conducted in three ses-
sions, where each app was evaluated by 10 partici-
pants (i.e., each participant evaluated 3 apps selected
in a random fashion). In each session, one participant
evaluated 1 app at a time and took on average 25 –30
min. During each test-session, at first the participant
was briefed about the purpose of the study and his/
her roles. The participant was also briefed that the
goal of the study is not to assess him/her, rather to
evaluate the mobile application, so that he/she be-
haves normally during the test session and provides
honest opinion/response about the overall system
functionalities and performance. After that, the test
participant ’s demographic information was collected,and a test-consent form was also signed with him/
her. Then the participant was asked to explore and
use a randomly assigned application for 15 –20 min. In
the end, the participant was asked to answer the SUS
statements [ 43] . The SUS score was calculated fol-
lowing the Brooke ’s (1996) [ 43]g u i d e l i n e s .F i r s t ,f o r
odd numbered questions, we subtracted one from the
user response (scale positio n), and for even-numbered
questions, we subtracted the user responses (scale
position) from 5. After that, we summed up the con-
verted score and then multiplied it by 2.5. Finally, we
computed the average value of the SUS scores for the
studied applications.
Data analysis and outcomes
The SUS score of each app is shown in Table 5.W e
followed Bagor et al. ’s (2008) [ 51] guidelines to evaluate
the SUS scores. The score can be acceptable (SUS
score > 70), marginal (50 < SUS score > 70) and un-
acceptable (SUS score < 50). The results show that moreTable 4 Heuristics violation to each cluster

score. Among the accepted applications, most of the
apps were found to have SUS scores just above the
threshold value of acceptable. Only Aponjon Preg-
nancy was found to have high SUS evaluation score.
Taken together, most of these apps were found to
have poor to marginal usability according to their
SUS scores.
Figure 2represents the relation between the average
SUS scores and the number of usability problems
found. The results show that SUS scores are inversely
related to the average number of problems found in
Stage II (see Fig. 2). This indicates that the findings of
expert inspection and SUS evaluation match with each
other in most cases. For those apps where we observed
less number of usability problems (7 –8 problems), we
found the SUS score values were acceptable. Those
apps with comparatively higher number of usability
problems revealed SUS score below the acceptable
level. However, exception was found for two apps
(Herbal Treatment and Homeopathic Bangla Book ). Al-
though, the number of usability problems of these apps
was comparatively smaller, their SUS scores were below
the acceptable level. We also investigated if SUS scores
relate to application size (number of UIs). The result is
s h o w ni nF i g . 3. We found that SUS scores do not re-
late to the number of UIs.
Discussions
Key findings
In this paper, we investigated the overall usability of mo-
bile health applications in Bangladesh through an exten-
sive empirical research. This research provides three
main findings. First, we summarized an overview ofmHealth applications developed in Bangladesh along
with the targeted end users a nd the features/functional-
ities provided by the applications. We found 9 categor-
ies of applications based on their features/
functionalities. The study also found that healthcare
professionals, mothers, patients, and other general users
have been the targeted end users for the mHealth apps
in Bangladesh.
Second, the study found that the usability of
selected mHealth applications in Bangladesh in gen-
eral does not adhere to or follow the design princi-
ples. Both expert inspection and SUS technique
revealed that the existing mHealth applications
would be very hard for the users to use. The results
indicate that the lack of usability would be one of
the key barriers for adopt ing mHealth applications
in Bangladesh.
Third, we also strived to explore the possible rela-
tion among the number of usability problems with
the application size (number of UIs), the severity
scores, and the SUS score. We found that although
positive relations were observed between the number
of usability problems with the number of UIs and
with the severity score, but the relations were not sig-
nificant. Furthermore, we found that the number of
usability problems had an inverse relation with the
SUS score. This indicates that the findings from heur-
istic inspection and SUS evaluation complement each
other.
However, a major limitation of this study is that we
conducted the user study with a small number of partici-
pants and with a small number of apps. Another limita-
tion is that we have not compared between Government
and private apps in this study.

This research is the first to provide in-depth view on
the usability status of mHealth applications in
Bangladesh. The findings will greatly contribute to re-
search in health informatics, and to the HCI practi-
tioners, non-government organizations (NGOs) and
Government organizations providing health services in
Bangladesh. The study provides the following implica-
tions: First, our results provide clear empirical evi-
dence that usability has been overlooked in mHealth
applications development. These findings could pro-
vide important practical implications such as increas-
ing awareness of improving usability in mHealth
applications. The results also depicted the type of us-
ability problems (or heuristics violated in develop-
ment), found in the tested apps. These findings may
provide the underlying knowledge (e.g., heuristics
often not fulfilled) for usable mHealth applications
development. Furthermore, the findings also reveal
the necessity of curriculum revision in computer sci-
ence education to integrate HCI concepts. Conse-
quently, possible future research area could be to
investigate the underlying reasons and its possible so-
lutions of why usability was overlooked in the devel-
oped mHealth applications.
Second, the findings of this research can guide re-
searchers for further studying mHealth services and
plan for usability-based research designs in the con-
text of Bangladesh. The lack of usability in tested
apps imposes an important question of to what extent
user centered development approaches are actually
used in Bangladesh for developing the mHealth appli-
cations. Furthermore, it raises the question of to whatextent requirements elicitation study for finding the
contextual need for developing new and usable
mHealth applications has been conducted in develop-
ing these applications. All these questions provide fur-
ther research directions that can be conducted by
researchers. Future research, for example, may focus
to design, develop and evaluate mHealth applications
by following methodologies that keep usability at the
center of attention.
Third, this paper is the first to provide a taxonomy of
mHealth apps developed in Bangladesh. We found 9
types of mHealth applications available in Bangladesh.
Future studies can be conducted to verify the applicabil-
ity of this taxonomy in other contexts and possibly ex-
tend it.
Finally, our study results suggest that there have
not been enough effort to develop mHealth apps for
marginalized population in Bangladesh. Thus, special
emphasis on user profile (such as disability, literacy,
etc.) would be required to develop accessible and
usable apps for the marginalized citizens of
Bangladesh.
Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to explore usability of
mHealth applications in Bangladesh. The findings sug-
gest that the usability of the mHealth applications is not
satisfactory. Our findings highlight the heuristics that
are often violated in these mHealth applications. Such
information can be used by designers to improve their
applications in terms of usability. This in turn, may im-
pose a barrier on adoption and use of mHealth applica-
tions in Bangladesh.Fig. 3 Average SUS vs Average SizeIslam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 9 of 13Appendix 1
Heuristics of Expert Inspection
Table 6 Set of heuristics for expert inspection
No Heuristics
H1 Visibility of system status
a. Always keep users informed about what is going on (e.g. “loading ”,“deleted ”)
b. Provide appropriate feedback (e.g. tactile, visual, audible) to the user within reasonable time
H2 User control and freedom in system navigation
a. Provide “emergency exits ”to instantly leave an unwanted state
b. Provide basic navigation controls on screen, even if the device itself provide buttons to perform similar functions (e.g. “back ”function)
c. Avoid accidental activation of closely located touch controls
H3 Consistency and standards
a. Users should be able to do things in a familiar, standard and consistent way, based on experience from similar apps and platforms (e.g.
tactile gestures)
H4 Realistic error management
b. Express error in plain language (no codes) and constructively suggest a solution
c. Users should be warned to confirm risky action in order to avoid accidental errors (e.g. delete, payment)
H5 Minimize the user ’s memory load
a. Provide clear affordance for touch controls and other UI elements
b. User should not have to remember information between screens
H6 Customization and shortcuts
a. Make the system easy for first time setting and learning
b. Provide basic configuration options for common users and advanced configuration for expert users
c. Provide shortcuts to most frequent tasks, allow users to tailor frequent actions.
H7 Aesthetic and minimalist design
a. Avoid displaying irrelevant or rarely needed information
b. Most relevant information should be highlighted through large size, color, etc.
H8 Physical interaction and ergonomics
a. Touch control elements should have adequate size and spacing for fat fingers
b. Place control elements in a recognizable position
c. Place control elements so they can be easily pressed with the user ’s thumb in any hand (or provide an option for switching layout based
on hand orientation)
H9 Minimize human-device interaction
a. Strive to reduce interaction effort because users may be in motion with only one-thumb and one-eye on the system
b. Reduce data entry, especially with typing. Use sensors (e.g. location, voice) or historical and personalization data to establish defaults
H10 Readability and Glanceability
a. Ensure that text and textboxes fit on the screen
b. Ensure readability in different lighting conditions with sufficient contrast
c. Ensure user is able to quickly get relevant information by glancing at screenIslam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 10 of 13Appendix 2
Evaluation of CareSatisfaction App
A few examples of problems by an evaluator for CareSa-
tisfaction application (see Fig. 2) are presented in Table 3.
The CareSatisfaction app provides patients opinions
about the service quality of clinics or hospitals in
Bangladesh.

Heuristic
P1 “The hint provided about the text input is confusing since in both fields same example texts
are shown by default. The first field should be for the Division whiles the second one for the
District name. So, user will not be able to quickly grasp the information or what they need to do ”3 H10
P2 “The orientations of the three buttons are very unusual. Despite of having space at left and
below, the buttons are organized in a very compact way. The buttons are not organized in a
conventional manner and lack proper spacing among the buttons ”2 H8, H9
P3 “No proper instruction, indication or hints is given about the button. Even it is almost impossible
to detect it as a button ”4 H3, H10
P4 “The lists are organized in a scattered way. Difficult for a user to find the certain area/district. A
systematic way could be followed, for example, ordering the districts name alphabetically. User
has no control to see the list in a systematic way ”2 H4, H6, H9
P5 “The message icon is used instead of a rating icon for asking user to rate the app. It may reduce
the users ’memory load (user should not remember its functionality) if a proper icon was used here ”3 H3, H5
P6 “No constraint as well as error control mechanism are given in the fields of adding new hospital.
For example, user can give alphabetical input in latitude longitude field (where numerical value
could be the only accepted value) ”2H 4
P7 “Basic navigation control is missing in the screen like there is no Home or Back button is present
in the screen ”3H 2Islam et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:19 Page 11 of 13Appendix 3
