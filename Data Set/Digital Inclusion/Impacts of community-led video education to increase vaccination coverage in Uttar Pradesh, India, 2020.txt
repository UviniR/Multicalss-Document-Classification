Synopsis
This study evaluated whether and how a community-led video education intervention to target knowledge, 
attitudes and behaviours of caregivers could increase demand for vaccination and increase vaccination 
coverage in two blocks of rural Uttar Pradesh.
Context
Vaccine-preventable illnesses account for 20 per cent of child mortality in India and these deaths represent 
a large proportion of vaccine-preventable deaths globally. In rural Uttar Pradesh, India, only 52 per cent of 
children received all necessary vaccines in 2012–13. In this context, children and their caregivers face 
multiple barriers to vaccination, one of which is low awareness of and demand for vaccination. This study 
hypothesised that a community-led video education intervention to increase caregivers’ demand for 
vaccination could increase vaccination coverage in rural India.
Research questions
This study addresses the following questions:What is the impact and cost-effectiveness of a community-led 
video education intervention on vaccination coverage among children 6 to 17 months old living in rural Uttar 
Pradesh;What is the impact of the intervention on vaccination timeliness and dropout; Does the intervention 
lead to increase in vaccination rates among vulnerable children;Does the intervention lead to change in 
community attitudes and normative beliefs related to immunisation; and Why and how does the intervention Impact Evalutions   2020|  3ie series report Funded by 3ie

Methodology
Intervention designPATH’s Projecting Health, a multi-component intervention, aimed to train community 
members to design and produce culturally appropriate, ‘hyper-local’ videos with tailored behaviour change 
communication messaging to target root causes of sub-optimal health seeking behaviours. These videos 
were co-created by a local community-based organisation, community health workers, called Accredited 
Social Health Activists or ASHAs, and village women. ASHAs screened the completed videos at community 
gatherings such as mothers’ group meetings and on designated Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHND) 
often attended by expecting and lactating mothers, their mothers in-law and sisters in-law. The videos were 
also screened for men in the evenings. In addition, the ASHAs conducted in-home screenings for mothers 
from hard-to-reach (HTR) or other vulnerable communities. The intervention package also included trainings 
for ASHAs on operating the projector for video screening and facilitating mothers’ group sessions.Theory of 
changeThe theory of change hypothesised that the intervention components would effect changes at three 
levels: mothers’ attitudes and beliefs, mothers’ networks, and community attitudes and social norms related 
to immunisation. The video screenings and the monthly mothers’ group meetings were expected to improve 
awareness of vaccination and knowledge of where/when/how to access health services. It was also 
envisaged that engaging ASHAs would improve their outreach and mobilisation practices.The theory of 
change rested on the following contextually-driven assumptions:Health care-seeking behaviour change in 
rural India is highly dependent on family- and community-level attitudes and norms;Awareness of where and 
when to access services and care seeking behaviour is largely driven by ASHA outreach; andDuring the 
government-mandated VHNDs, vaccines are available, ASHAs are able to mobilise families, well-trained 
frontline health workers are available and able to effectively and safely administer vaccines and provide 
education and counselling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation designA cluster-randomised, controlled trial was 
conducted in two blocks (Airaya and Hathgaon) of Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh to evaluate whether the 
intervention had an impact on vaccination coverage, including the among children 6 to 17 months of age. A 
single cluster represented a single ASHA and the villages and hamlets she is responsible for 
serving.&nbsp;Seventy-four ASHA-village clusters within Airaya and Hathgaon blocks were pseudo-
randomly selected. Half these clusters were pseudo-randomly assigned to receive the Projecting Health 
intervention and the remaining half clusters acted as controls.
Main findings
The intervention did not have a significant impact on the full immunisation rates of infants. In the 
intervention areas, there was a non-significant 2.8 percentage point increase in the probability that an infant 
was fully immunised compared to the control clusters.The effect on timeliness of vaccination among 
children was marginal, with a 0.8 percentage point increase in the probability that a child in the intervention 
arm received all vaccines on time. The probability that a child received the first but not the third dose of DPT 
decreased by 6.78 percentage points in intervention villages relative to control villages. While all outcome 
indicators changed, their magnitude was not statistically significant.The intention to vaccinate was very high 
for mothers at baseline (97.7%) and endline (98.6%). Comparing intention between intervention cluster 
respondents who reported viewing an immunisation video at endline versus those who did not illustrates 
that viewing videos was associated with higher intent in the intervention clusters.In contrast to the high 
intent recorded through the household survey, the process evaluation indicated that there were individuals 
who actively chose not to vaccinate their children. This may reflect family constraints or logistical barriers 
that prevent a mother from taking a vaccine decision regardless of own personal intention to vaccinate.The 
study also found that viewing a video was associated with greater knowledge of antenatal care, birth 
preparedness, breast feeding and immunisation. The process evaluation corroborated these findings, 
showing an increase in maternal knowledge of the aforementioned topics among those women who were 
exposed to the intervention.Even though the study was not powered to detect a difference among 
subgroups, exploratory analysis suggests that certain subgroups such as families in communities identified 
as HTR and Muslim households have benefitted from the intervention. The authors speculate that these 
results could be attributable to the improved outreach by ASHA as a consequence of the intervention.Cost-efficiency analysisSince the study did not find a significant impact, the authors do not report a cost-
effectiveness analysis. They, however, present a cost analysis from an implementer perspective; that is, 
what would be the total cost of operating the programme. However, the analysis does not account for the 
time that participants spent engaged in the intervention and the opportunity cost of their 
attendance.Implications for policy, practice and researchThe authors highlight that even in the absence of 
significant impact, the evaluation brings to light some important findings and lessons. For instance, the 
process evaluation indicates possible reasons for the null findings including key supply-side constraints that 
the intervention was not designed to mitigate. Furthermore, the process evaluation uncovered additional 
drivers of vaccine coverage that were likely underestimated in the original theory of change, such as the 
importance of family members other than the parents in vaccine decision-making. The authors conclude 
that there is a need for further research on the importance of high-quality clinical care to engender trust at 
the community level, engagement of all household members in the vaccine decision-making process, and 
continued and expanded outreach to vulnerable communities.
