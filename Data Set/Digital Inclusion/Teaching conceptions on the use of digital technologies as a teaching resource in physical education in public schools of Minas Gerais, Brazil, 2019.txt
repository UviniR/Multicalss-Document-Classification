Abstract :It is observed that the technologies have invaded t he classrooms, 
providing increasingly attractive teaching methods.  Technologies have 
challenged school institutions to keep up with this  new reality. In some 
cases, the technologies offered aim, to a certain e xtent, to meet some 
educational needs of students and soften deficienci es in classroom teaching. 
The arrival of digital technologies in classrooms b rings great advances, but 
also brings many uncertainties and insecurities, gi ving rise to new tensions, 
new possibilities and new challenges. With today's technologies, the school 
environment can transform into a meaningful, face-t o-face and digital 
learning environment, making students more active, motivating them to 
learn and search all the time. The present work aim s to present the 
advantages and disadvantages of these digital metho ds, as well as to 
demonstrate the applicability of these technologies  in the current daily life 
of school institutions. It also presents some impor tant aspects about the use 
of technologies in the learning process, discussing  how the use of virtual 
simulations software can contribute to the teaching  of Physics. To obtain 
data from the students, a questionnaire with seven questions was used. 
 
1 Introduction 
Every day more information and communication techno logies invade people's daily lives. 
These new technologies can provide new perspectives , broadening the view of some people 
on certain subjects, and here, the objective of the present work, is precisely to demonstrate 
how these technologies can influence teaching, cont ributing to learning. 
It is important to highlight the role of technologies in the school environment, as it aims 
to support the new teaching pattern, ie, technology must support students in their learning, 
constituting another educational resource.

ISE2A 2017According to [1] education and the education system  have undergone many changes. The 
advancement of technology has popularized access to  information by changing our way of 
living and consequently our way of learning. 
According to [2]: In the current stage of technolog ical and economical development, new 
educational paradigms that include the insertion of  information and communication 
technologies in educational environments emerge. Informatics in education is a controversial 
subject and marked by contradictions among educator s, but it must be incorporated into the 
teaching and learning process.   
Technology is widely used in today's society as a f acilitator of everyday tasks, being 
increasingly inserted in work, leisure, politics an d also education, being the focus of this 
research.  
The purpose of this study was to verify the use of digital technologies in the teaching of 
physics in state public schools in Minas Gerais, an d to identify the challenges and facilities 
provided by this insertion. 
Additionally, we aimed to verify the relation of th e students with the technological 
resources offered to them and if these resources fa vor a meaningful learning. [3]. 
Students usually have difficulties in understanding and interpreting the physical concepts 
studied in science, with this it is considered the use of educational technological resources as 
a medium that can facilitate the understanding of t hese concepts and soften the difficulties of 
teaching and learning of the students. 
On the subject, [4] mentions: Educational technolog y is understood as the set of 
techniques, processes and methods that use digital means and other resources as tools of 
support applied to teaching, with the possibility o f acting methodically between who teaches 
and who learns.  
The use of technologies can arouse students' intere st not only within the classroom, but 
also arouse ongoing interest in learning. According  to [1]: "The student developing the habit 
of research and interest in information will naturally develop the need for learning, becoming 
a questioning and critical being of the reality that surrounds him." 
2 Methods 
In order to investigate how the use of digital tech nologies can influence the significant 
learning of physics contents, a questionnaire with seven questions was applied to students of 
the state network in the cities of Congonhas and Sã o Brás do Suaçuí, located inside of Minas 
Gerais, Brazil. In total, four schools participated  in the research, with three schools located 
in the city of Congonhas and one school located in the city of São Brás do Suaçuí. A total of 
159 students from a first, second and third year hi gh school classes were surveyed.  
The applied questionnaire had objective and discurs ive questions, among which were 
verified the positions of the students in relation to the use of the digital technologies in the 
teaching of Physics. 
In some questions the students were questioned about the use of technologies in everyday 
school and outside, what technological devices were used and whether teachers used digital technologies in their classes. Another research question was to verify if the school offered a 
laboratory of computer science for the frequent use of the students. 
The analysis of the data obtained by the questionna ire applied to the students was carried 
out based on the Bardin content analysis techniques  [5], being made a grouping and 
classification of the similar answers, these being represented in graphs and tables. 3 Results and Discussions 
For the analysis of the answers, the schools partic ipating in the research were: School A (32 
students), School B (39 students), School C (18 stu dents) and School D (70 students). In this 
denomination we indicate the number of students par ticipating in the research per school. 
The first question asked if students were using any computer equipment, "Which computer 
equipment do you most use?" The results are shown i n Figure 1. 
Figure 1:  Computer equipment in the schools surveyed 
 
It was verified in the graph of Figure 1 that the s martphone (45%), the desktop computer 
(34%) and the tablet (11%) were the resources most used by the students.  
The third question asked the students if they had a ccess to the school's computer lab to 
carry out school activities. The results are shown in Figure 2.

ISE2A 2017      From the results obtained, it is verified tha t the students of school D have greater access 
to the information technology laboratories, whereas  the students of schools A, B and C in the 
majority do not have. It is noticed that the lack o f structure of the schools can contribute to 
the learning difficulties of the students. 
      Question number 4 had as objective to verify which items that the students consider more 
interesting for the learning of Physics. They could  choose from a list of terms provided. 
"Among the items below, what do you think would be interesting to learn physics more 
easily?" Figure 3 represents the variability of res ponses given by students. A greater choice 
was observed for the item dealing with experiments that illustrate everyday physics. This option appears with relevance in the charts of the four surveyed schools, with emphasis on 
school D. It is observed that the sum of the values  expressed in Figure 3, extrapolated the 
100 percent. This is because students could choose more than one answer option from the 
offered ones.

Question number 5 had as objective to verify, in the opinion of the students, if the teachers 
use some technological resource next to the teachin g of Physics during the classes in the 
school routine.  
According to the data obtained and shown in Table 1, most of the students stated that the 
teachers of these surveyed schools, in general, do not use technological resources to aid 
teaching, that is, most of the classes are given in  an expositive way using the blackboard .

ISE2A 20174 Conclusion  
We carried out a survey under high school students of four different schools on the use of 
digital technologies in the study physics. In total 159 students filled out a questionnaire. The 
results indicate that the students are interested i n the possibility of using digital technological 
resources that can contribute to the learning of th e concepts of Physics. This is justified by 
the everyday use of digital technologies such as smarphones, tablets and computers. 
      The results obtained with the application of the questionnaires showed that the digital 
technologies can contribute to the teaching of Phys ics, since these teaching methods are well 
received by the students, who find in these new way s to learn an opportunity to study with 
pleasure, characterizing the basic concepts of mean ingful learning theory.
