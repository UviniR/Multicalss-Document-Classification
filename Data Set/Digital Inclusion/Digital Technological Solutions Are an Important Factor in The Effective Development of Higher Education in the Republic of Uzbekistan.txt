Abstract . This article shows the main directions of improving higher education in the Republic of 
Uzbekistan in the context of the formation of the digital economy. The authors' research is based on real 
examples of the Tashkent State Economic University. The article proves that the digital transformation 
and change in the methods and means of teaching students and undergraduates in the context of the 
pandemic caused by the spread of COVID  19 infection require new technological approaches to teaching 
and managing the university from the teaching staff and university administration.  In this article, the 
authors conclude that digital technologies individualize the educational process, diversi fy, develop 
students' independence, and develop creative thinking skills. Thus, the quality of education improves, and it is not only about the full and high -quality fulfillment of the requirements of the curriculum: classes 
begin to meet the personal inte rests and needs of students and undergraduates, which is undoubtedly an 
additional incentive to master the educational material. Thus, modern technological solutions based on the 
latest digital technologies contribute to an increase in the efficiency and q uality of the educational process 
in a higher educational institution.   
1 Introduction  
The formation of the digital economy on a global scale 
has a great impact on the development of industries and 
spheres of national economic systems. Technologies 
such a s cloud computing, blockchain, mobile Internet 
are becoming widespread, robotics, geonomy, new means of energy storage are actively developing, 
digital platforms, web services, big data processing and 
analytics technologies, etc. are becoming widespread.  
In the Republic of Uzbekistan, a whole range of 
measures is being taken to introduce digital 
technological solutions in the industry and the sphere 
of the national economy. One of the important stages in 
the development of the digital economy was the Decree  
of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Sh.M. Mirziyoyev "On approval of the Strategy" Digital 
Uzbekistan 2030 "and measures for its effective 
implementation", signed on October 5, 2020.  
Scientific research by scientists testifies that 
education is  not just a way of transferring knowledge, 
it accumulates the cultural heritage of the nation, 
promotes the empowerment of a person, and forms his 
moral ideals. Education in general and higher 
education in particular, is one of the conditions for 
economic growth, increasing the material well -being of 
the country's population. The level of education has a 
significant impact on various aspects of human life: 
health, perception of culture and art, professional and 
political mobility, etc. It is no coincidence that in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to 
education is enshrined as one of the basic human rights.  
The role of education in increasing labor 
productivity, increasing the production of goods and 
services, as well as increasing workers'  income is 
assessed within the framework of the theory of the so -
called human capital. Within the framework of this 
theory, human capital is assigned a central role, and the 
most important goal is the creation of such a socio -
economic system that will ensu re the development and 
use of the capabilities of each person. Human potential 
is the main part of the country's national wealth. In developed countries (Japan, Canada, USA, etc.), the share of human capital in the country's national wealth 
is 60 to 80%. H owever, a high level of education is not 
a guarantee of economic growth in the country. The 
reasons for the lag in the economic development of 
countries with a high level of education may be the 
following:  
- irrational structure of education;  
- ineffective  use of the existing educational 
potential (for example, when a person is forced to perform work that does not correspond to his level of 
education);  
- low level and inadequate structure of investment 
in education;  
- low quality of education;  
- insufficien tly clearly chosen strategy for the 
development of education.  SHS Web of Conferences 100, 01016 (2021)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202110001016

development of higher education in the Republic of 
Uzbekistan are:  
- comprehensive assistance to the professional 
education market;  
- the priorit y of forming a "talent pool" for the 
development of promising markets and technologies, 
training of personnel for those industries that have not 
yet begun to present a wide effective demand for graduates (creating a scholarship fund for those 
students who will choose areas and specialties that are 
priority for the state);  
- the formation of innovative and corporate 
cooperation as a form of integration of diverse 
educational institutions of higher and secondary vocational education, research institutes, basi c 
enterprises and organizations, within which educational 
programs of different levels of vocational education 
will operate;  
- the priority of the scientific function of the higher 
education system, which directly affects the change in 
the principles of or ganizing production;  
- the increasing influence of higher education on 
the labor market through the creation of new 
technologies and the opening of new areas of social 
activity.  
2 Liter ary sources and legal 
documents  
In the Republic of Uzbekistan, the deve lopment of 
higher education in the context of the formation of the digital economy is receiving close attention. This is 
evidenced by the adoption of a number of government 
documents.  
In particular, on October 5, 2020, the Decree of the 
President of the Re public of Uzbekistan No. UP -6079 
“On approval of the  “Digital Uzbekistan  - 2030 ” 
strategy and measures for its effective implementation” was adopted [1], which emphasizes that without the 
development of digital infrastructure and raising the 
level of knowl edge in the field of digital technologies, 
further development of the country is impossible.  In 
addition, the digital development of industries and spheres of the national economy requires qualified personnel. In this regard, in the last 3 years alone, a 
number of decrees and resolutions of the President 
have been adopted, contributing to raising the level of 
the higher education system to a new, higher level.  
(Resolution of the President of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan “On measures for the further developmen t 
of the higher education system ” No. PP -2909 dated 
April 20, 2017 No. 18, art. 313, No. 19, art. 335, No. 24, art. 490, No. 37, art. 982; Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On additional 
measures to improve the quality of education  in higher 
educational institutions and ensure their active 
participation in the large -scale reforms being 
implemented in the country ” No.PP -3775 dated 
05.06.2018; Resolution of the President of the Republic 
of Uzbekistan “On measures improvement of the training system for qualified personnel in demand and 
the development of scientific potential at the National University of Uzbekistan named after Mirzo Ulugbek in 2019 -2023 ”). In addition, the President of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan Sh.M. Mirziyoyev issued a 
decree “On approval of the concept of development of 
the higher education system of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan until 2030”, which defines the key areas of comprehensive reform of higher education in the country. This document defines the key tasks of 
transforming higher education in Uzbekistan.  
These include:  
- increasing the level of knowledge, skills and 
abilities of future specialists who have the necessary 
competencies, high moral principles and are able to think independently;  
- modernization of high er education;  
-social and economic development based on the 
latest educational approaches.  
The reform of vocational education also provides 
for the creation of "career centers" to assist students 
with internships and finding a job in the labor market, 
the formation of an employer base and the effective use 
of the potential of graduates based on the optimization of the structure of scientific and educational 
institutions.  
The activities of the sphere of higher education are 
implemented in accordance with a s et of government 
documents and are aimed at cardinal transformations of 
the teaching and educational process in universities in 
order to achieve high rating indicators at the world 
level.  
As the present  study  shows , a wide  range  of works  
by domestic  and foreign scientists  is devoted  to the 
application  of modern  information  and communication 
technologies  in education . 
For example, in the works of such scientists as 
Akimova O.B. [2], Kvashin A.Yu., Kramarenko N.S. 
[12] it is shown that in the development of h igher 
education in the digital era, technological security of 
the educational process and digital literacy of the 
teaching staff are of great importance.  
The publications of foreign scientists Anderson 
T.D., Clark T., Detweiler R. [7], Dillon C., Hillman D . 
show that the use of methods and means of distance 
education has a significant place in the development of 
digital education.  The same concept is expressed by 
such Russian scientists as Ardovskaya R.V., Bakalov 
V.P., Batygin B.S., Dikov N.R., Ivanchenko D.A. [9], 
Ignatova N.Yu. [10], Isaev Yu.V., Kanaev V.I., 
Kozlova N.Sh. [11], Komarova I.N, Mateev D.A., 
Muromtsev V.V., Prokhorova N.S. and etc.  
In particular , we have studied  the scientific  works  
of such authors  as Alimov  R.Kh [3], Begalov  B.A. [4], 
Bekmu ratov T.F., Bobodzhanov  A.B., Vertakova  
Yu.V., Tolstykh  T.O., Shkarupeta  E.V., Dmitrieva  
V.V. [5], Gayibnazarov  B.K., Gulyamov  S.S.[6], 
Dadabaeva  R.A., Dzhanadilov  Sh.U., Zhukovskaya  I.E. 
[8], Kuznetsova  S.A., Markova  V.D.[12], 
Musaliev  
A.A., Odilov  Shch .G., Swan  M. [15], Xashim xodjayev 
Sh.I. [16] etc.

ISCSAI 2021Analysis of literature sources also shows that 
scientists around the world are studying the 
phenomenon of the development of digital technologies.  
In fig. 1.  presents the forecast of analysts of the 
American analytical company McKinsey International 
Data Corporation (IDC), specializing in research of the 
information technology market. As can be seen from 
Fig. 1, the potential economic effect from the introduction of such technologies should be from 14 to 
33 trillion USD.  
Experience shows that digital technological 
solutions cover all sectors and spheres of the modern 
economy.  
Higher education in the modern period is also 
unthinkable without the use of the latest digital 
technologies and mechanisms, as well as t he 
capabilities of artificial intelligence.  
 
Fig. 1. Forecast of the growth of the economic effect 
obtained through the introduction of advanced technological 
solutions

McKinsey International Data Corporat ion (IDC).  
Analysis of literary sources shows that in the 
context of the digitalization of the world economy, the 
sphere of higher education needs new management and 
technological solutions that are designed to bring 
higher education institutions to the hi ghest levels in 
international rankings.  
The formation and development of the digital 
economy in Uzbekistan is inextricably linked with the development of information and communication 
technologies (ICT). Conducted research has shown that 
a distinctive char acteristic feature is the all -round 
penetration of ICT into various spheres of public life. 
According to the results of the research, the specialists 
came to the conclusion that the successful development 
of the digital economy in a separate country is an important role for the state.  
The development of the digital economy in the 
republic is caused by an increase in the field of those types of economic activity, which are associated with 
the production of intelligent and industrial products.

The functioning  of the digital economy creates the 
basis for innovation and the formation of human capital.  In Uzbekistan, the basis of the digital economy is a set of industries in the sphere of information services.  There is a growing dependence of the 
functioning of t he economy on information. Moreover, 
we are talking about increasing the share of such areas 
as education, information and communication and 
intellectual services.  
The modern stage of development of the digital 
economy in Uzbekistan is characterized by the  period 
of state of affairs and high dynamics of development.  
 The modern stage of development of the digital 
economy can be assessed on the basis of the following 
characteristics:  
1) Computerization of economic activity and the 
use of electronic internal  computer interoperability on 
the basis of electronic document circulation;  
2) Connections to the Internet are not only 
computers, but also the Internet -thins , directed at the 
creation of business models;  
3) The use of ICT for the involvement of citizens i n 
social activity, the development of new effective forms 
of interaction with the state authorities;  
4) The use of effective feedback mechanisms in the 
framework of the electronic government to ensure the 
participation of citizens in public life;  
5) Mobili zation of citizens by means of the Internet 
for solving publicly important tasks, etc.  
The basic institutions of the digital economy 
include electronic commerce, electronic employment, and electronic government, which form the institutional and educational  institutions.  
In the framework of the electronic commerce as the 
basic institute of the digital economy, IT companies enter into cooperation with the representatives of other 
companies, the state and the scientific community.  The 
electronic commerce allow s companies to more 
efficiently and flexibly carry out internal operations.  
3 Modern approaches to the 
organization of education in a higher 
educational institution in the context 
of digital transformation  
In the conditions of the formation of the digital 
economy, serious qualitative changes are taking place, 
which are reflected in the development of all sectors 
and spheres of the economy, including the 
modernization of the education system. Scientific 
research by scientists testifies that education is not just 
a way of transferring knowledge, it accumulates the 
cultural heritage of the nation, promotes the 
empowerment of a person, and forms his moral ideals. Education in general and higher education in particular, is one of the conditions for economic growt h, 
increasing the material well -being of the country's 
population. The level of education has a significant 
impact on various aspects of human life: health, 
perception of culture and art, professional and political 
mobility, etc. It is no coincidence that in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the right to education is 
enshrined as one of the basic human rights.

ISCSAI 2021Digital technologies are dramatically transforming 
the content of the taught disciplines and the way they 
are presented. This is not only el ectronic presentations 
or the use of video, but also direct connections to 
electronic databases, news, ongoing forums, video 
broadcasts.  In modern higher education, virtual (VR) 
and augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly 
used. VR and AR technologi es are used in immersive 
education (IE) programs.  Such programs include the 
use of modern information technologies in the learning 
process, which takes place inside various virtual worlds 
and simulations, often in a playful way [ 8]. This type 
of training h elps to increase engagement, 
communication between students and interest in the subject, as well as the implementation of projects for real enterprises and organizations.  
The digital transformation of the economy is based 
on the following technologies:  
- data mining;  
- business intelligence (eng. Business intelligence);  
- machine learning (eng. Machine learning);  
- artificial Intelligence;  
- big data technologies;  
- internet of Things;  
- blockchain.  
Let's consider the specifics of each of these 
techno logies. Data mining - research and discovery by 
a "machine" (algorithms, artificial intelligence) in raw data of hidden knowledge that was not previously known, non -trivial, practically useful, available for 
human interpretation. Business intelligence - systems, 
tools and technologies for data analysis of organizations. Digital transformation is transforming 
business intelligence into intelligence. It is intelligent 
business intelligence that is the trend that determines 
the development of tools that effect ively turn a 
"caterpillar into a butterfly". Machine learning is a 
class of artificial intelligence methods, a characteristic feature of which is not a direct solution to a problem, 
but learning in the process of applying solutions to 
many similar problems . The essence of the machine 
learning process is the use of algorithms that allow some technical system to draw conclusions from data without following certain rules. Artificial intelligence 
(AI; English artificial intelligence, AI): the science of 
creat ing intelligent technologies; the property of 
intelligent systems to perform creative functions that 
are traditionally considered the prerogative of a person. 
AI allows you to automate and intellectualize repetitive 
learning and retrieval processes through  the use of data. 
AI functionality and technologies integrate into existing products and intellectualize them at different levels. AI combined with large amounts of data 
improves various technologies that are used in all areas 
of the economy. The Internet of Things (English 
internet of things, IoT) is the concept of a computing 
network of physical objects ("things") equipped with 
built-in technologies for interacting with each other or 
with the external environment, considering the organization of such netw orks as a phenomenon that 
can restructure economic and social processes, eliminating the need for human participation from part of actions and operations. Blockchain (English 
blockchain, originally a block chain - a chain of 
blocks) is a continuous sequent ial chain of blocks 
(linked list), built according to certain rules, containing 
information. In the digital economy, blockchain is a 
very promising digital technology.  
The world of education and science is becoming 
global, the development of digital techno logies leads to 
the removal of language barriers. Universities and individual teachers are actively entering the MOOC 
market (MOOC - Massive on -line open course) - an 
already established form of distance learning with open 
access on the Internet. The numbe r of students who 
study remotely is increasing, since traditional 
educational programs often do not keep pace with the dynamics of technology development [1 7]. 
The education sector is also undergoing great 
changes in the Republic of Uzbekistan. In secondar y 
educational institutions of Tashkent and in the regions, 
such systems as "Electronic Diary", "Assessment of Teachers", "Electronic Student" have begun to work. 
The Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry for 
the Development of Information Technolog ies and 
Communications were instructed to create 14 special schools for training programmers this year and 82 - 
next year [9]. In higher education institutions in the 
context of the pandemic caused by the spread of the 
virus infection COVID - 19, digital plat forms were 
introduced, which made it possible to conduct online 
education in universities. Digital transformation 
implies improving the system of professional 
development of the teaching staff. In particular, on the basis of the Tashkent University of I nformation 
Technologies and IT -parks, a national system of 
training and certification of information technology 
teachers will be introduced. Obtaining a certificate 
upon completion of training will allow teachers to receive a 50 percent salary increase. Sc hool teachers 
will also be rewarded if their students successfully 
complete the One Million Programmers course  [18]. 
At present, in Uzbekistan, within the framework of 
the implementation of the Presidential Decree "On 
measures for the further development o f the higher 
education system", each higher educational institution 
establishes close partnerships with leading foreign 
universities and centers. The decree stipulates that 
well-established partnerships with foreign universities 
are capable of attracting a t least 350 foreign highly 
qualified teachers and scientists to Uzbekistan to the educational process at universities annually. At the 
same time, work is underway to widely introduce 
advanced pedagogical technologies, curricula and teaching materials based  on international educational 
standards into the educational process. Taking into account the prospects for the integrated development of regions and sectors of the economy, the needs of 
territorial and sectoral programs, target parameters of 
personnel tra ining are formed in accordance with 
higher education, directions and specialties of training are optimized. Work is being consistently carried out to 
solve the problem of creating and introducing a new 
generation of textbooks into the higher education 
4SHS Web of Conferences 100, 01016 (2021)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202110001016
ISCSAI 2021system, providing universities with modern educational 
and scientific literature. Work has been established to 
translate the latest foreign literature into the Uzbek language.  
The digitalization of education makes it possible to 
gain access to information that  was previously 
available only to experts and scientists. Most 
publishing houses specializing in educational literature 
have switched to electronic versions of textbooks and manuals. Thus, there is a transformation of teaching: 
students have the opportunit y to study disciplines in 
any sequence, on any platform, using technical means 
and technologies convenient for them, and the task of 
the teacher is to help students navigate the vast 
amounts of information.  
Thus, it can be noted that the transformation of 
higher education ensures that each student achieves the 
necessary educational results due to an individualized educational process, which in turn implies the use of a 
full range of digital technological solutions.  
Currently, the Tashkent State University  of 
economics  (TSUЕ) has accumulated its own 
experience in using digital technologies in the 
educational process.  
So, during the quarantine period caused by the 
COVID 2019 pandemic, educational activities at TSUE 
were carried out using a digital platform, on  which 
teaching materials were placed by the teaching staff. 
Students studied educational resources displayed on the 
platform and submitted completed assignments for 
verification. Work on the basis of this platform allowed 
students to successfully pass tes ts in the studie d 
disciplines at the end of the semester.  
Practice has shown that distance learning is an 
interesting process based on the use of all kinds of 
gadgets. When organizing distance education, the most 
effective form of material placement is a d igital 
platform.  The educational material on the platform is 
presented in the form of modules, including 
methodological recommendations for studying the 
topic, visual and theoretical resources and explanations 
for practical tasks, links to the necessary li terature.  
In the  course of analyzing the work of the platform 
for the semester, the university's leadership identified 
the positive sides and shortcomings in the functioning 
of the platform. The developed platform was easy 
enough for students to use. Howev er, it was not 
possible to carry out laboratory tasks on this platform. 
In addition, the process of evaluating the practical 
assignments completed by the students , took a long 
time.  
Assessment of the platform's functioning, analysis 
of international experi ence allowed the  TSUE 
management to make a decision to introduce modern 
software Moodle (Modular Object -Oriented Dynamic 
Learning Environment) into the scientific process of a 
higher educational institution. Moodle  is a free and 
open  source  platform . The M oodle web applic ation allows you to create a 
customized learning management system that allows 
teachers and students to interact effectively online.  
Moodle was created at the Australian University of 
Technology, and from the outset was positioned as an 
open, easy-to-insta ll and free educational site.  
The advantage of Moodle is the ability to use it 
both on a stationary computer and on any mobile 
device with the ability to access the Internet.  
The platform maximizes the preservation of the 
traditional values  of full-time ed ucation. It is a modern, 
constantly evolving environment. The chat and forum 
system, which users actively use, makes it possible to 
quickly identify platform flaws and fix them.  
This system is very mobile, it allows teachers to 
create all k inds of web cour ses and fill them with 
educational content. Elements of online courses are 
various interactive tasks, open -ended questions, text 
pages, dictionaries, links, files, cases and much more.  
In addition, the following positive aspects of the 
Mood le program shoul d be noted:  
- multifunctionality and ease of use, both on the 
part of students and on the part of the teaching staff;  
- the ability to customize and edit student accounts;  
- each student can choose a convenient time for 
study and vary the p resentation of t he material, both in 
time and in speed;  
- a huge set of components for effective exchange 
of information: a regular online lesson, chat, 
questionnaire, forum, terminological dictionary, etc .;  
- all passed material, as well as intermediate and 
final contro l with teachers' comments, are saved in the 
system. You can return to them at a time convenient for 
the student;  
- an objective assessment of the student's 
knowledge;  
- the possibility of organizing an e -mail distribution 
at the request of the student;  
- increasing the level of assimilation of educational 
material through the use of innovative teaching 
methods;  
- the teacher for any course is constantly in touch 
with the student;  
- the functionality of the platform allows you to 
conduct the learning process  both with one student and 
with a whole group of students.  
World practice shows that the improvement of the 
technical base of universities, the use of artificial 
intelligence methods, the development of a digital 
educational environment, th e u se of electro nic 
scientific publications in various foreign languages of libraries around the world contribute to the 
achievement of high results in the preparation of 
competitive specialists.  
Based on modern reality, the following priority 
areas of int eraction between  universities in Uzbekistan 
and foreign universities and research centers can be 
identified: - branches of foreign universities; - joint 
5SHS Web of Conferences 100, 01016 (2021)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202110001016
ISCSAI 2021faculties; - joint educational programs of double 
degrees; - attraction of foreign specialists; - advan ced 
training and  internships. A very important decision in 
higher education today is the decision made in 2018, 
which grants the right to basic (leading) universities, 
based on the needs of customers, to independently develop and approve curricula and prog rams in 
agreemen t with the Ministry of Higher Education. In 
addition, in 2018, the universities of the Republic 
received the right to accept foreign citizens for 
bachelor's programs outside the admission quota 
through interviews, without passing tests. The  credit-
modular system is being implemented in a pilot mode 
for all forms of education.  
 In recent years, optimization of directions and 
specialties of education in universities, taking into 
account the prospective development of industries and 
regions, ha s become widespr ead in the Republic of 
Uzbekistan. For example, from the 2018 -2019 
academic year, the universities of Uzbekistan began training personnel in 66 new areas of bachelor's degree 
and 48 new specialties of magistracy.   
However, it should be note d that with the many 
possibilities of digital technologies in the field of 
improving the educational process at a university, their 
integration into the educational process also causes 
certain problems.  
First of all, these are the problems associated with 
technical equipm ent and the ability of each teacher and 
student to access the unified educational environment of the university from remote regions of the country.  
The second problem is that it is necessary to 
constantly retrain the teaching staff of the u niversity in 
accordance with the requirements of digitalization. In the context of the development of the digital economy, each teacher needs to improve their knowledge and skills in the field of digitization of educational and 
methodological material, the  development of electronic 
educational publications, the creation of open 
educational courses, conduct online classes with 
constant improvement of communication skills.  
Digital technologies contribute to the 
implementation of the “Digital University” conce pt, 
which includ es several components at once:  
- a complex of information systems for university 
management;  
- implementation of the educational process online;  
- effective management of the educational process 
based on the creation of conditions for takin g into 
account t he individual abilities of students;  
- the formation of the key competencies of the 
digital economy among students, faculty, personnel serving the educational process of the university.  
We would also like to note that the digital economy 
contributes to the  development of interaction between 
the university and employers. This is clearly confirmed 
by the annual holding of Career Days at the Tashkent 
State Economic University. In particular, we can say 
that digital technologies help to identify  promising 
profe ssions, contribute to the formation of graduates' competencies based on the requirements of the economic market.  
4 Conclusion  
Today, digital technologies throughout the world are developing rapidly, being both an engine of economic 
growth a nd a sector that  has already significantly 
changed and transformed economic processes in other industries and continues to influence the formation of a 
new type of economy based on knowledge, use of 
information and products of human intellectual labor. 
In the course of wr iting this article, the authors 
revealed that the telecommunications infrastructure in Uzbekistan, compared to neighboring countries, is 
developing relatively well and stably, but, at the same 
time, it is necessary to take measures to achie ve a 
higher leve l comparable to the level of advanced 
foreign countries. Studies of modern scientists indicate 
that the successful cooperation of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan in the field of ICT with foreign partners indicates the great potential of Uzbekist an in this area.  
In addition, ICT analysts note that Uzbekistan, thanks to constant development, is potentially able to act as a regional "broadband backbone" and 
telecommunications hub for neighboring countries. Big 
data and blockchain technologies are be coming more 
and more widespread in industries and spheres of the 
economy, artificial intelligence systems and 
robotization are rapidly developing.  
To achieve high results in the preparation of 
qualified specialists, it is necessary not only to increase 
the technical capac ity of the university, but also to 
constantly improve the methods and forms of teaching in the context of the digitalization of the economy. And 
also to improve the research methodology on the 
effectiveness of methods, forms, teaching aids in an 
open educa tional space; their methodological 
substantiation, including the ratio of traditional and e -
learning, contact and independent work of students;
