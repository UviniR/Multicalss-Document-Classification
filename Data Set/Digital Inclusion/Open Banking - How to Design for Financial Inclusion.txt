EXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
OPEN BANKING IS TRANSFORMING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES 
industry in advanced economies. By breaking open the data silos of traditional banks, 
open banking regimes allow fintechs and other innovators to access customer data, 
including transaction data, and use these data to develop new products and services that are 
better suited to the needs of consumers. For emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), 
open banking holds out the promise to foster innovation and lower costs in ways that will make 
it more economical to serve the underserved and unbanked and offer products and services 
better suited to their needs. 
However, open banking regimes as a means for furthering financial inclusion are largely untested 
in EMDEs. To better understand the opportunities and risks, CGAP has conducted a landscaping 
review of 12 open banking regimes, including deep dives into seven regimes and two case 
studies, to learn how they can be designed to enable products and business models that could be 
beneficial for financial inclusion, and how these may alleviate pain points of low-income individuals. 
Based on this review, CGAP has identified 12 design components that policy makers need to 
consider when developing a framework for an open banking regime. Five of these components 
are critical to expanding financial services for poor people, or what we call “financial inclusion 
by design.” These five design components address: 
1. Who is required to share data and who can access the data.
2. What types of data are shared.
3. Which industries are covered (e.g., banking only or utilities and telecoms). 
4. Whether payment initiation is enabled in the regime.
5. Who bears the cost of the regime (including for each data exchange and the set-up of the 
relevant infrastructure).
How these questions are addressed will have a significant impact on a regime’s potential to achieve 
financial inclusion objectives. For example, the greater the number of participants required or 
permitted to share the data and access them, the greater the diversity of new services that can be 
enabled, and the more competition that could result. Similarly, the greater the breadth in the types of 
eligible data, the more likely that products relevant for low-income individuals can be developed.
Since it is still early days for open banking regimes, in particular in EMDEs, these early findings need 
to be tested further and substantiated through more in-depth research in a range of countries. In the 
meantime, this paper is intended to catalyze policy makers to consider how they can design open 
banking and other data-sharing frameworks from the perspective of financial inclusion. 2
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
SECTION 1
1 We use the term “open banking” in this report because it is widely used in the industry. Although the term 
“data sharing” technically may be more suitable, in certain instances the data shared do not relate to banking 
but to other financial services. Also, the data are not “open,” per se, but rather shared only with certain 
authorized third parties.INTRODUCTION
OPEN BANKING IS TRANSFORMING FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR 
consumers, banks, fintechs , regulators, and other financial sector stakeholders.1 
Traditionally, banks have held a monopoly on consumer transaction data but have 
made scant use of this treasure trove of proprietary information. Since its adoption in advanced 
economies in 2018, open banking has begun to create significant changes in the marketplace 
by breaking down data silos within the financial sector and opening up access to data to 
a wider range of users. The rise of fintechs and other innovative business models, such as 
platforms, has shown that new market players often are better positioned or have stronger 
incentives to leverage data and, based on that data, can offer consumers a range of new 
products and services at a lower cost. Middle- and low-income countries are now starting to 
explore the promise of open banking. 
Open banking may offer many advantages for people with low incomes. If properly structured 
and with the right market conditions, the exchange of data that results from open banking can 
support financial resilience and financial inclusion in several ways. First, when fintechs and 
financial institutions are able to access customer financial data held by incumbent banks and 
other financial institutions, these new entrants can create new products. Compared to current 
products offered by existing institutions, these new savings, credit, and financial management 
products would provide improved value for those who are banked but underserved. 
The unbanked may benefit if data held by nonfinancial institutions such as utility companies 
and telecommunications (telecoms) providers also can be accessed. Second, market entry 
by new types of entities facilitated by open banking—such as account information service 
providers  (AISPs) and payment initiation service providers  (PISPs)—can increase competition 
in financial services markets. This can lead to lower prices and increased product diversity, 
which would render financial services more affordable to low-income populations. Further, due 
to their lower cost structures, entities based on these new business models may now view as 
profitable previously unprofitable segments of the population such as the unbanked and the 
underbanked. This results in an increase in the size of the customer pie, with other financial 
sector stakeholders incentivized to innovate and reach low-income populations as well. 3
InTRodUCTIonNot all emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) are in a position to introduce an open 
banking regime, given capacity and resource constraints as well as legal and institutional 
requirements. Open banking regimes , in particular, raise supervisory and enforcement 
challenges, especially on tech-intensive issues such as quality of service, denial of service, 
cybersecurity, and so forth. Further, with open banking schemes nascent worldwide, it is too 
soon to know whether the introduction of open banking regimes would benefit EMDEs in every 
context or whether certain market contexts would benefit more than others. 
Open banking is just one of several initiatives that support financial inclusion and innovation, 
and policy makers may decide to prioritize policy changes such as opening basic accounts 
or creating innovation facilitators like regulatory sandboxes. However, for regulators in EMDEs 
that prioritize open banking implementation and want to ensure that it supports low-income 
populations, we submit that a sound open banking regime’s design should deliberately support 
financial inclusion as a central objective. We call the concept “financial inclusion by design.”
This paper is based on a landscape review of 12 open banking regimes. It provides our early 
findings on the types of open banking-enabled products and business models we believe 
would be beneficial to financial inclusion, and how they may alleviate relevant pain points for 
low-income individuals. We next examine the design implications the findings have on open 
banking regulatory frameworks. To conclude, we identify the 12 design components critical 
to any open banking regime and the five specific considerations EMDEs should contemplate 
if they want their regime to support financial inclusion as a policy objective (i.e., financial 
inclusion by design). As it is still early days for most countries, EMDEs in particular, that 
have introduced an open banking regime, our initial findings need to be further tested and 
substantiated through in-depth research in a range of countries. Finally, Appendix A provides 
a glossary of industry terms found in the paper, while Appendix B and Appendix C provide 
in-depth case studies on two front-runner open banking regimes in Latin America (Brazil and 
Mexico, respectively).
What is an open banking regime? 
The term “open banking” is loosely used by the media and the financial services industry to 
designate a range of data-sharing practices—from bilateral data-sharing contracts and financial 
services providers  (FSPs) individually opening application programming interfaces (APIs)  (e.g., 
Paytm)2 to voluntary private sector initiatives of collective data sharing (e.g., the open banking 
initiative in Nigeria3 and The Clearing House4 in the United States) and mandatory data sharing 
regimes  (e.g., Open Banking in the United Kingdom and PSD2  in the European Union). Open 
banking-enabled products include consumer products and services that use data obtained 
through open banking to inform product design, for example, personal financial management, 
budgeting applications, and credit score monitoring services, among others.

OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Since the primary audience for this paper 
is financial services and competition 
regulators, we focus on open banking 
regimes. We define an “open banking 
regime” as a consent-based data-sharing 
scheme mandated or supported by 
regulators toward the goal of creating 
competition and fostering innovation in 
financial services. Although many regimes 
include payment initiation (a third-party 
service that facilitates payment initiation for 
the customer), it is not an open banking 
regime requirement, and therefore it is not 
included in our definition. Within an open 
banking regime, banks and FSPs (i.e., data 
holders ) exchange consumer data with 
other FSPs and/or third-party providers  
(TPPs) (i.e., data users ) on the basis of 
customer consent. Data sharing usually 
does not require a contractual relationship 
between data holders and data users. 
In addition, data users often are subject 
to a licensing/authorization framework or 
technical and security standards at the 
very least. Purely voluntary private sector 
schemes and unilateral open APIs , are excluded from our definition because these schemes 
and API initiatives do not include regulatory involvement. See Box 1 for key definitions used 
throughout this paper.
We also distinguish open banking regimes from “ data portability .” Often expressed as a 
consumer right, data portability is the ability of an individual to obtain, upon request, their 
own personal data from current data holders in a structured, commonly used, and machine-
readable format. Consumers are entitled to use these data for their own purposes—across 
services and with a variety of data users. Where technically feasible, it may allow individuals 
to request that the data holder transmit data directly to a nominated data user. Data 
portability is often a right found in data protection laws (e.g., GDPR  in the European Union) 
that applies to all personal data held by data holders. It differs from open banking not only 
in its much wider scope, covering all personal data (vs. financial data), but in the fact that it 
focuses on a right given to individuals. Open banking regimes usually create a data-sharing 
framework with rights and obligations imposed on legal entities (data holders and data users) 
upon individual consent. BOX 1.  Key definitions 
Open banking
The exchange of consumer data between banks 
and other FSPs (i.e., data holders), on the basis of 
customer consent, with other FSPs and/or TPPs 
such as fintechs (i.e., AISPs and PISPs—both known 
as data users). Although payment initiation is an 
important element of open banking from a financial 
inclusion perspective (as discussed in Section 3), it is 
not essential to the functioning of open banking, and 
therefore it is not included in its definition.
Open data
The exchange of consumer data between private 
sector institutions, including financial institutions and 
nonbank financial institutions such as mobile money 
issuers, utility providers, and telecoms, with other 
such institutions on the basis of customer consent. 
Open APIs
Proprietary APIs that an FSP makes widely 
available for other companies to consume, allowing 
these other companies to seamlessly plug into the 
FSP’s system.5
InTRodUCTIonOn this basis CGAP has undertaken a landscape review of 12 open banking regimes,5 with 
a deep dive into seven of those regimes.6 In choosing which countries to study we aimed 
for diversity in geography and regime type (e.g., mandatory vs. voluntary, standardized vs. 
nonstandardized APIs).7 We reviewed only regimes that had sufficient public documentation 
available to determine, at a minimum, the regime’s main elements and the rationale 
and objectives behind it. For deep dive jurisdictions, we looked for early lessons from 
implementation. Where possible, we supplemented desk-based research with interviews with 
the relevant regulators and other stakeholders.
5 The 12 regimes are Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.
6 The seven deep-dive regimes are Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, and the 
United Kingdom—the more advanced open banking regimes among the 12.
7 Regime distinctions are set out in Chaib (2018).6
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
SECTION 2
WHY OPEN BANKING 
MATTERS FoR POOR PEOPLE
Open banking and financial inclusion
Open banking regimes premised on access to bank account data are not primary drivers of 
financial inclusion in terms of account openings. However, open banking can help increase 
the number of relevant services and improve the quality of those services for people who 
already have a bank account but are underbanked. Further, if the data in scope for these 
regimes go beyond bank accounts and accounts with other FSPs—such as mobile money 
accounts—and include data from sectors such as utilities and telecoms (what we call “open 
data” ), then these regimes may even support access to accounts and other services for the 
financially excluded. It is therefore critical that regimes wishing to support financial inclusion 
and to go beyond improving the value of financial services for the underbanked must focus on 
open data and embrace a broad scope of data exchange. Aside from bank account data, they 
must encompass mobile money account data and data from the utilities and telecoms sectors, 
among others.
Our review found three countries—Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia—with explicit financial 
inclusion objectives in their open banking regimes. Also, in certain first mover countries, 
including the United Kingdom and Australia, vulnerable populations have been identified as 
a specific subset of the population with needs that can be met with open banking-enabled 
products (HM Government 2019; Consumer Data Standards 2019). The United Kingdom’s 
experience with open banking is particularly encouraging from a financial inclusion standpoint. 
A recent U.K. report found that those “on the margins” of financial inclusion (with no account 
or only a basic account) are likely to pay less in fees with open banking—saving the equivalent 
of 0.8 percent of their income. Open banking would save those who are “overstretched” (with 
account(s) and heavily indebted) the equivalent of 2.5 percent of their income (Reynolds and 
Chidley 2019). The report concludes that open banking could improve financial inclusion and 
resilience and drive value for these segments by helping them control their finances, obtain 
better deals, and manage debt. 
The United Kingdom already has several open banking products on the market that target 
those who are financially underbanked or vulnerable. Mojo Mortgages combines open banking 7
WhY opEn B AnkIng M ATTERS  FoR pooR  pEopl Edata with more widely used scoring methods to accurately assess what a customer can 
afford.8 Canopy uses consumer rent payments to improve credit scores.9 Tully provides debt 
rehabilitation  services based on open banking data.10 Touco and Kalgera help those with mental 
health issues and older individuals better manage their money by building features on top of the 
basic aggregation proposition, such as the ability to send a notification to a trusted person if 
daily spending falls outside of normal patterns.11
How does this experience translate to EMDEs? We are starting to see fintechs in EMDEs 
provide services based on consumer data analysis that could improve the financial resilience of 
low-income populations. To reduce reliance on high interest overdrafts, for example, in Brazil, 
Rebel’s Tapa Buraco service alerts customers of overdrafts so they can access a prequalified 
30-day interest-free loan on the balance and benefit from a reduced interest rate thereafter.12 In 
Argentina, Afluenta helps consumers find optimal interest rates and loan fees that fit their 
circumstances.13 Meerkat in South Africa provides a saving tracker/sweeper, as well as a debt 
rehabilitation service based on consumer data and robo-advice.14 
However, as these services have been developed outside of open banking regimes,15 their 
ability to access customer data is limited. They often rely on sharing login details, combined 
with screen scraping  (customers sharing online log-in details with third parties, a practice 
considered not secure because of the possibility of unauthorized account access), public 
databases, or customers directly providing data via interviews. For example, Meerkat is required 
to conduct interviews to identify areas where clients can save money by switching financial 
providers. It also is required to obtain customer consent for savings sweeping every month.16 
An open banking scheme would give Meerkat access to customer transaction data, allowing 
it to create a personalized budget based on expenditures. This would facilitate repurposing 
expenditures toward savings and allow Meerkat to undertake real-time payment initiation for the 
purpose of savings sweeping. Box 2 offers an in-depth look at how Brazil’s new open banking 
regime can help Guiabolso provide personal financial management services.
Product innovation
Low-income individuals face a variety of issues that may render them financially unstable and 
vulnerable to financial shocks, including volatile, irregular income; a lack of liquidity; and paying 
a disproportionate amount of income on essential household expenses. They also experience 
more difficulty in accessing financial services, which limits their ability to address vulnerability.

OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
They may lack the necessary identification, address, or other documentation that would allow 
access to formal financial services. Additionally, especially for women, social norms may limit 
their control over their personal finances. Low-income individuals also may not have access to 
credit, and if they do, they may be susceptible to taking on inappropriate and/or excessively 
priced credit products.
The global evidence we reviewed suggests that, by responsibly using shared customer 
transaction data , fintechs and other types of financial institutions in EMDEs may be able to do a 
better job than traditional banks have done with such data. Third parties can use data to create 
value for potentially excluded and lower-income customers in three main ways: (i) improving 
access to credit and/or conditions of access, (ii) improving financial management, and (iii) 
facilitating access to accounts if collaborative customer due diligence  (CCDD) is allowed.17 The 
specific value propositions fintechs and third parties can offer to address these value creation 
opportunities follows.
17 CCDD approaches seek to address the shortcomings of current CDD processes. Examples include creation 
of a public utility that FSPs can use to identify clients and verify identities on an ongoing basis; access 
to know your customer (KYC) as a service, a centralized database where banks can share and access 
KYC information on corporate clients; and self-sovereign IDs—a new ID category that promises to work 
across borders, allows individuals to prove their identity based on alternative data sources. It also provides 
customers with more control over who accesses their data. See Lyman et al. (2018).BOX 2.   The utility of open banking regimes: Spotlight on Brazil’s Guiabolso
In Brazil, Guiabolsoa offers a personal financial 
management tool that allows customers to view 
all their accounts on one dashboard. The tool 
recommends suitable financial products based on 
the customer’s profile and transaction history. Since 
Brazil’s open banking regime is not yet operational, 
Guiabolso frequently must access customer data 
via screen scraping rather than open banking APIs. 
The process has raised a variety of issues. First, it is 
technically difficult, because each bank has different 
security layers and the technological infrastructure of 
banks is often suboptimal. This creates difficulties for 
consumers as they try to connect in real time (e.g., 
a change in web display format can lead to a login 
process that is unusable).b Screen scraping is also not secure. Because of the lack of regulation, login details 
captured by the process are not necessarily protected 
and could lead to unauthorized account access. The 
new Brazilian regime, which would require banks to 
provide Guiabolso access to this information through 
API connections, can alleviate these issues.
The lack of a fully operational open banking regime also 
means that Guiabolso is limited to using the information 
that appears on an internet banking site, which is often 
restricted to three months’ prior history. Under the new 
Brazilian open banking regime, Guiabolso will have 
access to up to 12 months of transaction history, which 
would provide a better understanding of a customer’s 
income stability and allow the company to more 
effectively underwrite loans.

WhY opEn B AnkIng M ATTERS  FoR pooR  pEopl EImproving access to credit and/or conditions of access 
• Responsibly expanding access to credit.  Low-income individuals often have difficultly 
accessing credit. High cost, short-term credit easily can lead to financial vulnerability. 
Properly designed open banking products—especially open data products—can expand 
access to credit that helps, rather than harms, consumers by using alternative financial data 
(e.g., Mojo Mortgages and Canopy in the United Kingdom).
• Supporting debt rehabilitation services.  Providers such as Tully in the United Kingdom 
and Meerkat may use open banking data to build a customer’s budget, identify loans that 
can be refinanced or consolidated, and negotiate affordable repayment schedules on the 
customer’s behalf. When these services are coupled with payment initiation, “ smart loan 
repayment ” may be introduced. These debt repayment plans can account for fluctuations 
in customer income during repayment periods, which allows customers to pay based on 
available liquidity without triggering default provisions.
• Reducing reliance on overdrafts and other excessively priced credit products.  
Open banking services can alert customers before they go into overdraft and offer less 
pricey credit alternatives (e.g., Rebel’s Tapa Buraco service in Brazil). Consumers also can 
find optimal interest rates and loan fees that fit their circumstances by using apps such 
as Afluenta in Argentina or Credit Karma18 in the United States.
Improving financial management
• Improving savings behavior.  Low-income individuals with volatile or irregular income may 
have difficulties weathering financial shocks. Open banking can enable products that advise 
customers on when and how much to save. They include savings trackers (like Meerkat’s, 
which repurposes expenditure on highly priced financial services toward savings) and 
automatic savings sweepers that calculate what a consumer can save, and when, based 
on their financial history, then automatically transfer funds to a dedicated savings account (a 
product provided by the U.S. fintech, Digit).19
• Lowering tariffs on household bills.  Many families in emerging markets pay a “poverty 
premium” for essential goods and services, such as telephone communications, gas, 
electricity, and broadband (Davies, Finney, and Hartfree 2016). For certain strata of this 
population, open banking products that analyze spending patterns, identify opportunities 
for saving money, negotiate new contracts on a consumer’s behalf, and cancel their old 
subscriptions can tackle both demand- and supply-side factors that create a premium in the 
first place. Trim20 is an example in the United States.
• Encouraging healthy financial behaviors.  Low-income individuals often perceive a 
lack of control over their financial lives. Personal finance and budgeting applications can 
empower individuals with data insights generated from transaction data—for example, 
highlighting ways to save or sending reminders on due dates for a regular payment or bill. As 
long as the relevant consumer protections are in place, when applications are permitted to

OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
initiate transactions on behalf of the customer, consumers can put insights into practice in a 
seamless and user-friendly manner. In the European Union, Yolt Pay21 allows Yolt budgeting 
app users to initiate money transfers through open banking APIs; in Brazil, Guiabolso allows 
customers to obtain a suitable loan directly from its application.
Facilitating access to account if CCDD is allowed
• Overcoming a lack of documentation.  Onerous customer due diligence (CDD) 
procedures can result in high costs for low-income customers or prevent them from 
accessing financial services because they often lack official identity documentation. Brazil’s 
open banking regime foresees a collaborative approach to CDD (CCDD) by allowing FSPs 
to share registration data, which would reduce the paperwork and hassle as consumers 
gain expanded access to a variety of financial services. If open banking regimes expand 
to include sharing of telecoms, social media, and other types of data (i.e., open data), SIM 
card registration or other CDD methods could help individuals overcome issues with formal 
identification—as long as a simplified CDD approach is permitted.
Many of these solutions are predicated on smartphone access, especially those that rely on 
data visualization. Although smartphone ownership is on the rise because of price decreases, 
smartphone users are still the exception rather than the rule among poor people in EMDEs. For 
example, only 45 percent of phone owners in Sub-Saharan Africa had adopted smartphones in 
2018 (GSMA Intelligence 2020). However, owners of feature phones still can take advantage of 
some open banking-enabled services. Many products, such as automatic savings sweeping, 
smart loan repayment, and decentralized CDD, use data only on the back end and do not 
require smartphone technology. Other services, such as switching utilities or personal financial 
management, work on SMS or USSD menus (i.e., two-way flash messages integrated into a 
user menu on a feature phone) with modest loss of functionality. Fintechs that aim to target 
nonsmartphone users would have to adapt the user experience to such constraints, but most 
open banking-enabled services should be adaptable.
Yet there are limits to the applicability of open banking in EMDEs. Many low-income customers 
currently do not have a digital financial data trail to analyze. For this reason, it is important 
to consider how open data regimes ultimately could leverage other types of digital data—
whether social media activity, airtime use, or location data—to extend their benefits to those 
not financially included via digital payments. Since the players that hold these types of digital 
data usually are not under the jurisdiction of the financial sector regulator, regulators should 
collaborate with their respective counterparts in other domains to determine how a cross-sector 
open data regime can be established. See Section 3 for additional details.
Emerging business models
Open banking regimes define who can or should participate in data sharing. Often, it is not only 
existing players such as banks and payment service providers (PSPs), but new types of entities 
as well. In addition, new activities that until recently were outside the regulatory perimeter 
21 See the Yolt website: https://www.yolt.com/faqs  11
WhY opEn B AnkIng M ATTERS  FoR pooR  pEopl Emay be incorporated in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and to level the playing field. These 
activities include the amalgamation and analysis of data to propose tailored financial products 
and the ability of customers to directly pay merchants without the intermediary of a credit card 
scheme—also known as payment initiation.22
A good example is the European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive.23 This law 
created a proportional regulation to incorporate two types of TPPs that conducted previously 
unregulated activities under PSD1 and are now considered PSPs: AISPs and PISPs. AISPs 
(e.g., Yolt and Moneyhub), which provide customers with consolidated information about 
their financial accounts with other PSPs, have only a registration requirement and no capital 
requirements.24 PISPs, which allow consumers to make payments from accounts that are 
initiated by a party other than their account issuer,25 must be authorized but have a reduced 
initial capital requirement of 50,000 euros (vs. 125,000 euros for PSPs that offer other payment 
services, such as execution of payment transactions, issuance of payment instruments, 
and money remittance).26 In return for being regulated and to permit them to effectively offer 
services, TPPs are an essential part of the European Union open banking regime—also known 
as X2A or access to account. 
As part of its voluntary open banking regime, the Japanese Government similarly advanced a 
series of legislative amendments in June 2018. These included amendments to the Banking 
Act. The amendments provide a new regulatory framework for electronic payment service 
providers  (EPSPs)—covering both PISPs and AISPs—along with a registry of EPSPs managed by 
the Financial Services Agency. Registration requirements for EPSPs are minimal; entities simply 
require a non-negative capital ratio.27 
Specifically, AISPs’ ability to regroup diverse sets of information and provide individual 
customers with real-time analytics also provides customers with new insights that can influence 
their behavior. It also permits AISPs to become the customer-facing provider of choice without 
actually providing financial services (thus avoiding certain onerous regulatory requirements, 
which are borne by the product underwriters). As trust increases between AISPs and 
customers, AISPs will be in a privileged position to curate distribution channels. 
PISPs offer new business model opportunities for digital payments by allowing third parties 
to initiate transactions on the customer’s behalf from an account the customer holds with 
another institution. This allows the customer to separate the experience of performing a 
22 When elaborating their open banking schemes, other jurisdictions have authorized alternative types of entities 
rather than AISPs and PISPs. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) created a new category of “ account 
aggregators ” whose sole role is to securely transfer financial data from data holders to data users, based on 
customer consent. These aggregators can exercise the business of managing consent only and must be 
registered with RBI. See Sections 4 and 5(f) of RBI’s Master Direction—Non-Banking Financial Company—

can offer information services to customers, given that they are not currently allowed to see the data.

payment (online or in-person) from the provider that holds their account. In India, payment 
initiation functionality has allowed fintech services such as Google Pay to quickly scale, 
absent a license to hold customer funds. In other markets, the service is providing new ways 
for nonbanks to introduce payments into customer products. In each of these cases, funds 
transfer (clearing and settlement) between accounts continues to be managed through existing 
payment systems with appropriate regulatory oversight (e.g., UPI in India and Faster Payments 
in the United Kingdom). 
In many countries, B2B service providers also facilitate data sharing and payment initiation 
services as a product for licensed financial institutions and third parties. Service providers such as 
Plaid in the United States provide the “plumbing” where it is too complicated or costly for TPPs to 
negotiate individual contracts.28 This model also can benefit data holders themselves (i.e., banks), 
allowing them to build new services leveraged on their own accounts.29 That said, if overall 
costs to consumers do not increase, the added time and costs of transactions by these service 
providers (in comparison to transactions under an open banking regime) must be offset by gains 
in efficiency.
Some incumbents are adapting by acquiring or developing in-house solutions (e.g., 22seven, 
an AISP run on Yodlee rails bought by Old Mutual bank in South Africa30 and Visa’s recent 
acquisition of Plaid), or by unilaterally exposing their APIs to allow third-party developers to 
create innovative products in partnership (e.g., South Africa’s Nedbank31 and the Co-operative 
Bank of Kenya32). Credit card companies also are positioning themselves as value-add 
intermediaries in open banking. One example is Mastercard’s centralized enquiry and dispute 
resolution service for banks and TPPs.33 However, incumbents still retain advantages with 
certain types of information and access to low-cost funding (see Box 3).

WhY opEn B AnkIng M ATTERS  FoR pooR  pEopl EBOX 3.  Addressing informational asymmetry
The main benefits of open banking regimes stem 
from the increased competition generated by third-
party data access in the financial services markets. 
Two types of financial information can help providers 
target offers and evaluate risk: (i) hard information, 
which includes an individual’s credit history and default 
history, and (ii) soft information, such as consumer 
preferences, level of income, and behavior (Beaton-
Wells 2019; Padilla and de la Mano 2018). 
Traditional banks have significant advantages with 
soft information,a which is one of the reasons fintech 
firms have found it difficult to compete with banks 
beyond initial successes.b According to Padilla and de la Mano (2018), although banking has been 
liberalized in recent years, the reason we have not 
seen positive consumer outcomes is mainly because 
of the informational advantages banks have. On the 
other hand, social media firms, utility providers, and 
telecoms also have a significant advantage with soft 
information, but they lack access to lender-specific 
hard financial information.c An open banking scheme, 
which requires both hard and soft information sharing 
and includes data reciprocity, is one remedy that 
addresses informational asymmetry and may even 
swing the power balance toward BigTech  and other 
new entrants.
a. Banks have other advantages that are not related to data, but they fall outside the scope of this research. For example, they have a 
“too big to fail” advantage, which gives them access to funding at a lower cost than competitors. See Beaton-Wells (2019) and Padilla 
and de la Mano (2018).
b. Other reasons include the absence of an installed and loyal customer base, lack of reputation and brand recognition, and a relatively 
high capital cost. See Padilla and de la Mano (2018).
c. Certain TPPs, such as BigTech, have additional advantages, such as large installed customer bases; established reputations; powerful 
brands; considerable earnings; and unfettered access to capital markets. They require scheme reciprocity to maintain an even playing 
field. See Beaton-Wells (2019) and Section 3 of this paper.14
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
SECTION 3
12 DESIGN COMPONENTS
FROM OUR LANDSCAPE RESEARCH OF 12 COUNTRIES, WE IDENTIFIED 
12 design components of open banking regimes: four determine regime scope and eight 
affect implementation. First, we look at the implications of each design component for 
the EMDEs that may wish to support financial inclusion, given market conditions and potential 
resource and capacity constraints. Regulators that may be considering the design of an open 
banking regime should address these components, as each can have far-reaching implications. 
Components that determine scope
TYPES OF SERVICES  
Which financial products and services are included in an open banking regime varies across 
regimes. In cases where the scope is clear, there are two approaches: 
1. Broad scope, covering many types of financial services, including credit and insurance 
(e.g., Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, and Singapore).
2. Targeted scope, focused on banking and/or payments (e.g., Bahrain, Hong Kong, the 
European Union, and the United Kingdom). 
In certain jurisdictions there is a clear correlation between the regime rationale and the 
types of products that are in scope. The open banking regime In the United Kingdom was a 
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) remedy imposed on the nine largest banks accused 
of anti-competitive behavior and thus the United Kingdom’s regime focuses only on banking 
products. X2A in the European Union is part of a payment regulatory framework and is thus 
focused on payments. We observed a trend toward broader scopes in the other regimes, 
especially in newer regimes such as those in Brazil and Mexico. This may be because the 
regulator, with its focus on innovation, has decided that there is no reason to restrict the scope 
to banking and/or payments—in contrast with the first open banking regimes in the European 
Union and the United Kingdom. 
Two regimes go beyond financial services data and in subsequent phases plan to encompass 
other services from economic sectors such as energy, telecoms, and utilities (i.e., open data). 
This includes Australia, which is implementing a consumer data right  (CDR) in the energy 15
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSand telecoms sectors after the banking sector, and the United Kingdom, which has followed 
Australia’s lead with the recent introduction of a Smart Data regime that will extend data 
sharing to energy, pensions, telecoms, and other utilities (HM Government 2019). Australia is 
considering data sharing across sectors as part of CDR.34 In addition, the account aggregator 
ecosystem led by Sahamati35 in India expects to expand use cases to sectors such as health, 
telecoms, and education.36
Implications for EMDEs
In order for individuals with thin digital financial data trails to benefit from open banking regimes, 
the regimes should include as many types of financial services as possible. The potential is 
greatest, however, in open data regimes where data from telecoms and utilities transactions are 
critical for bolstering thin trails. Including these sectors may expand an individual’s access to 
services. Further, data from other digital services such as social media, messaging platforms, 
web searches, and e-commerce could help to bolster trails if they are included in the scope 
of open data regimes. Finally, cross-sectoral products can provide clear benefits, such as 
responsible credit and shared CDD, for all consumers. 
Note that an increased number of covered services clearly requires greater resources for 
supervision and enforcement. A broader scope also implicates more than one regulator—
financial (e.g., insurance, investments regulators) and, for open data regimes, nonfinancial (e.g., 
telecoms, energy regulators). This often makes orchestration more complex.
PARTICIPANTS
There are two main types of participants: (i) entities that share data, by mandate or voluntarily—
data holders—and (ii) entities that either have a right to access data or are permitted to access 
data—data users. 
There are three general approaches to defining data holders: 
1. Name specific institutions.  For example, the nine largest banks in the United Kingdom 
or the banks categorized as Segment 1 and Segment 2 institutions, as well as all 
authorized payment institutions in Brazil. 
2. Use entity categories.  For example, account servicing payment service providers  
(ASPSPs) in the European Union, financial institutions in Japan and Malaysia, banks in 
Australia and Hong Kong, and “providers” in Singapore.37 
3. Cover a broad range of financial sector entities.  In Mexico, this includes fintech 
institutions, clearinghouses, traditional financial institutions, and credit bureaus. In India it 
includes banks, banking companies, NBFCs, asset management companies, depositories, 
depository participants, insurance companies, insurance repositories, and pension funds.

37 Providers are defined in Singapore’s “Finance-as-a-Service API Playbook” as organizations that expose data 
through APIs; this includes regulators, insurers, and banks.16
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Data users, which often are TPPs, generally are different from data holders. TPPs are either 
allowed access—as a right if licensed or authorized (as in Australia, the European Union, 
Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom) or simply upon request (with no rights as in Bahrain, 
Malaysia, and Singapore). Data users are subject to a licensing or an authorization framework 
or, at the very least, some mandatory technical and security standards. The main rationale 
for differentiation between data users and data holders is that open banking regimes level the 
playing field by allowing parties that lack bargaining power, such as fintechs and other TPPs 
(but possibly not BigTech—see discussion that follows), data access they normally would not 
have. 
In Mexico,38 India,39 and Brazil, most participants are, to a certain extent, considered both data 
holders and data users, and thus “data reciprocity” exists between participants—they can 
request access to data held by fellow participants but must then share their own data with 
those participants upon request. 
Lack of data reciprocity has long-term repercussions on competition. Although open banking 
regimes effectively allow third parties access to customer data from traditional incumbents such 
as banks, solving one type of data asymmetry, they inadvertently may create a different type 
of data asymmetry. A lack of reciprocity in the open banking scheme may greatly increase the 
power of BigTech platforms (e.g., Amazon, Facebook, Google), that can tap into this data by 
becoming accredited TPPs in order to enter and strengthen their financial services offerings. 
However, they are not required to give others reciprocal access to their financial services 
databases under that regime (Beaton-Wells 2019).
Note that BigTech already has a data advantage, not only due to the sheer amount of data it 
has collected over time, but because of its superior information about consumer preferences, 
habits, and conduct, particular information at a certain point in time at a specific location in 
real time.40 If BigTech combines its data advantage with the data it can obtain through open 
banking, it effectively would be in a position to create “super profiles” that other players 
cannot easily replicate (Beaton-Wells 2019; Padilla and de la Mano 2018). For example, a bank 
trying to achieve data parity with Google would need to successfully enter markets for online 
advertising, mobile operating systems, mobile app distribution, browsers, email, and online 
video distribution (Padilla and de la Mano 2018). Data sharing reciprocity, although not a silver 
bullet, is one mitigation strategy to consider for reducing data asymmetries. 
Implications for EMDEs
As Section 2 states, the greater the number of participants in an open banking regime, the 
greater the scale and diversity of new services that could be enabled and the more competition 
would advance. Bringing fintechs, other TPPs, and other FSPs (e.g., e-money issuers [EMIs]) 
into a regime’s scope would ensure there are more actors in place that would have the ability to 
38 In Mexico, reciprocity does not cover third parties specializing in IT, such as BigTech; they can obtain data but 
are not required to share their data.
39 It is unclear whether India’s regime allows reciprocity as there is no reciprocity in RBI’s Master Direction. 
However, members of the Sahamati cooperative are expected to abide by a rule of reciprocity, and certain 
data holders, such as tax authorities, are not expected to request access to data.
40 Other advantages include large installed customer bases, established reputations, powerful brands, 
considerable earnings, and unfettered access to capital markets. See Padilla and de la Mano (2018).17
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSoffer products and/or provide data that can assist poor people in EMDEs, which, in turn, would 
render financial services more affordable. For financial inclusion, EMIs may be one of the best 
sources of data for underbanked people, depending on the market—for example, in Africa, 
EMIs often are sole account issuers to low-income individuals.
Further, EMDEs can leapfrog by incorporating reciprocity from the start to avoid pitfalls with 
BigTech later on. Lastly, under an open data regime, reciprocity is even more important in 
ensuring that the entire regime is balanced, especially since entrants such as telecoms, utilities, 
and social media companies are an important source of alternative data (Waldron and Hacker 
2020). It should be noted that in an open data regime, the relevant institutions in these sectors 
also must be designated as data holders. 
TYPES OF DATA
Although customer transaction data sharing is at the heart of our definition of open banking 
schemes, the majority regulate access to three main types of data: 
1. Generic services data—publicly available information on specific financial services, such as 
product pricing and locations of ATMs, agents, and branches. 
2. Customer data—personally identifiable data of a customer required for account opening 
and administrative purposes, including registration)/ know your customer  (KYC) data.
3. Transaction data.41 
For regimes in our review that had a clear data scope, all but two explicitly require sharing 
customer account data and transaction data with customer consent.42 A majority of regimes 
also require generic services data sharing, but since it is market-level public data, sharing often 
is not related to a user request. Customer data sharing allows individual customers to obtain 
personalized offers and/or other assistance, while transparency is the main function of generic 
services data sharing.
Implications for EMDEs
Generic services data sharing would create greater transparency on pricing, terms, and 
conditions in financial service markets and other economic sectors, if included. In addition 
to inciting more competition because consumers are allowed to easily compare product and 
service offerings, ultimately these data may reduce unjustified price discrimination between 
segments of the population, a goal that is often important to EMDEs.
Sharing customer transaction data is key to ensuring that appropriate products are developed 
for low-income individuals and sharing KYC/customer registration data is necessary to enable 
CCDD for new entrants and incumbents alike. The latter is particularly useful for overcoming 
41 Other data types not listed in the three categories include aggregated statistical data (e.g., Mexico) and 
customer acquisition data (e.g., Hong Kong).
42 As part of a staged implementation process, Malaysia expressly authorizes only generic services data sharing. 
It is highly likely this will be expanded to include customer data. Currently, Indonesia is solely considering 
the introduction of payment initiation in its open banking framework, see “Latest Info,” Bank of Indonesia, 
4 January 2020, https://www.bi.go.id/en/ruang-media/info-terbaru/Pages/BI-Dorong-Peran-Industri-dalam-
Mengembangkan-Open-Banking-di-Indonesia.aspx18
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
identification issues if a regulatory framework permits digital copies of identification and/or 
alternative identification. 
PAYMENT INITIATION43
The open banking regimes of Bahrain, Brazil, the European Union, Japan, Singapore, and 
the United Kingdom go beyond data sharing to outline requirements for financial institutions 
to allow third-party payment initiation.44 This allows third parties to initiate transactions on a 
customer’s behalf from an account the customer holds with another institution. 
Payment initiation gives consumers greater control over their finances by allowing them to 
perform payments from a wider variety of service providers. For example, when a customer 
receives a personalized mortgage offer from a third party that has collated their data, the 
customer can initiate payment without leaving the mortgage site. Payment initiation allows the 
customer to act on the data by initiating payment for a new transaction. The firm Plaid argues 
that access and acting are complementary and essential to encouraging innovation and solving 
consumer pain points. Taken together, they reduce the information and power asymmetries 
between consumers and data holders (Pitts 2019).
Including payment initiation in an open banking scheme is important for ensuring its successful 
adoption. Moving money within the financial sector is typically expensive, especially in markets 
that use card infrastructure. Adding payment initiation to data sharing can open up cheaper 
rails to move money. Beyond cost, payment initiation can democratize access to the payment 
system. A TPP may offer customers a highly useful application because of the data open 
banking provides, but it may not be able to provide basic payment features if it must contract 
with a sponsor bank to enable payments. Including payment initiation in the open banking 
scheme can remove this barrier.
Implications for EMDEs
Regulators in EMDEs should consider incorporating payment initiation  into their open 
banking regimes because it provides the greatest benefit to inclusive finance. However, 
real-time transactions between accounts held with different providers still require a payment 
infrastructure that supports instant payments. Examples of this include Mexico’s interbank 
electronic payment system (SPEI) and Brazil’s PIX instant payment system. 
43 Payment initiation is distinct from other types of automatic referral services, such as Hong Kong’s customer 
acquisition data  and Brazil’s loan forwarding services. Referral services allow third parties to assist a 
principal in obtaining new clients through customer referrals and loyalty programs (e.g., Hong Kong) or allow 
customers to directly contract with TPPs for loans through a digital interface (e.g., Brazil). 
44 Jurisdictions such as India, whose payment initiation infrastructure is separate from its open banking regime, are 
not included in this section, because in such situations the open banking regime is not driving this functionality.19
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSComponents related to implementation
MANDATORY VS. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
One of the main distinctions between open banking regimes is whether participation is 
mandated by regulation/legislation or is voluntary. A voluntary regime implies that participation 
is voluntary, but its rules are usually mandatory once an entity has decided to join. 
Of the 12 regimes reviewed, six are mandatory in some sense—for the entire industry (Australia, 
Bahrain, the European Union, and Mexico) or for specific actors in the industry (Brazil and 
the United Kingdom). When a scheme is mandatory, its details can be set out either through 
legislation (PSD2 for the European Union, amendments to the Australian Treasury Act, and 
Mexico’s fintech law); sector-specific regulation (the Resolution of the Central Bank of Brazil 
and Rulebook additions issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain); or as a remedy imposed by a 
competition authority (the CMA order in the United Kingdom). From a geographic perspective, 
all regimes reviewed in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East were mandatory, while all 
the voluntary schemes introduced by regulators were found in regimes in Asia (India, Indonesia, 
Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore).
Voluntary schemes entail various levels of public sector involvement. They can be introduced 
by the regulator to kick-start data sharing (as in India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Malaysia) 
or to give structure to current industry initiatives (as in Japan and Singapore). The level of 
specification the government sets out in voluntary regimes also varies—from highly detailed 
frameworks (in Hong Kong and Singapore) and a specific licensing regime (for account 
aggregators in India) to high-level guiding principles (in Indonesia, Japan, and Malaysia). 
Although we differentiate between voluntary and mandatory regimes, some voluntary regimes 
are highly prescriptive—bordering on mandatory—in their manner of implementation. For 
example, although technically Hong Kong is a voluntary regime, as its policy documentation 
articulates, when read in conjunction with other policy statements and levels of specification 
for the framework, it appears to be mandatory. Equally, some voluntary regimes are not highly 
prescriptive but de facto mandatory because of expectations set by the regulator (e.g., Japan). 
Implications for EMDEs
Each regulator must determine the amount of control that is right for its jurisdiction based on 
the dynamics of its market ecosystem and whether there is a need to sanction anticompetitive 
behavior. A mandatory regime may not be necessary if the market already is moving in that 
direction. Further, some of the burden on the regulator may be removed with upfront industry 
buy-in on the need for an open banking regime or by allowing industry participation in the 
regime’s design. This may permit a regulator to limit intervention to specific shortcomings that 
result from an industry-led approach, rather than to impose a mandatory regime. 
If a regulator decides to impose open banking, it should have the ability to enforce it 
and sanction noncompliance. EMDEs with low enforcement capabilities and/or a lack of 
resources should keep in mind that a mandatory regime with little enforcement may be more 
counterproductive than a voluntary approach. 20
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR DATA SHARING (API s)
A second major distinction is whether a regime requires data sharing through standardized 
APIs or whether it allows/requires the industry to set data sharing standards (Chaib 2018). Six of 
the reviewed regimes stipulate use of standardized APIs (Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, 
Singapore, and the United Kingdom) while the remaining six (Bahrain, Brazil, the European 
Union, Hong Kong, India, and Japan) allow (or require, as is the case for Brazil and India) the 
industry to determine data sharing standards.
There does not appear to be a correlation between the mandatory character of a regime 
and whether API standardization is required.45 Similarly, for voluntary regimes, there is 
no correlation between level of specification and imposition of standardized APIs—a high 
degree of specification by the regime does not mean APIs would be standardized.46 These 
observations support the conclusion that standardization of data sharing protocols is primarily 
a technical decision. It is not related to the amount of control a regulator wishes to exercise 
over the regime. 
There is ongoing debate on whether standardized APIs are the best practice. This is based on 
anecdotal evidence from early implementations in the European Union, which does not stipulate 
API standards,47 and the United Kingdom’s Open Banking regime, which does.48 The United 
Kingdom has seen, by far, the largest number of open banking services to date.49 According 
to some industry stakeholders, the lack of standardized APIs has hampered progress in the 
European Union; yet industry alternatives being put in place, such as the Berlin Group,50 
cannot ensure a harmonized approach because they are piecemeal and voluntary.51 The lack 
of standardized APIs also has created challenges for TPPs in Japan because they need to 
consume APIs tailored for each financial institution. In addition, they must individually negotiate 
with each institution, which is a function of the regime framework that imposes contracts 
between TPPs and data holders.52,53
On the other hand, arguments against API standardization center on (i) a legal framework’s 
ability to adapt to technological change and (ii) the IT infrastructure of financial institutions 
45 Of mandatory regimes, three require that specific standardized APIs be issued by the regulator (Australia, 
Mexico, and the United Kingdom) and three do not (Bahrain, Brazil, and the European Union), although Brazil 
requires that participants follow the standardized APIs that the industry stipulates through a convention.
46 Voluntary regimes may (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore) or may not (Hong Kong, India, and Japan) 
require industry standardized open APIs of its voluntary participants.
47 According to an 18 May 2020 interview with Gavin Littlejohn, chairman of FDATA Global, the PSD2 did not 
specify API standards as PSD2 was drafted in 2013 when screen scraping was the norm.
48 Standard APIs in the United Kingdom were part of its open banking initiative since 2015, when it became 
clear that APIs would overtake screen scraping (interview with Gavin Littlejohn, 2020).
49 As of August 2020, the United Kingdom’s Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) reported 273 regulated 
providers, made up of 196 TPPs and 77 account providers, of which 88 regulated providers have at least 
one proposition “live” with customers. See the OBIE website: https://www.openbanking.org.uk/wp-content/

52 The imposition of contracts in the Japanese regime is at odds with most open banking regimes. Most remove 
the requirement for a contractual relationship between data users and data holders because the rights and 
obligations of each are dictated by regime provisions.
53 Interview with Toshio Taki, co-founder of Money Forward, 11 December 2019.21
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSlocated in rural or poor areas. As laws, and often implementing regulations, are difficult to 
quickly modify and given the rapid pace of technological change, regulators tend to avoid 
including technological standards within laws. Another argument against standard APIs is 
that they may be a disadvantage to data holders that may be technically unable to integrate. 
For example, credit unions in Canada, which are small and tend to serve rural, geographically 
isolated, and marginalized people, have voiced concerns with standardized API integration. 
They see it as complicated and prefer to implement data sharing through less sophisticated 
solutions like sanctioned screen scraping.54 
In light of these concerns, the industry may be best placed to agree to standards that can be 
quickly adapted as technology changes, even though standards may be subject to regulatory 
approval. APIs also can be standardized without technical specifications inserted. For example, 
they can include nontechnology-dependent API elements, such as standardized protocols to 
access data (messaging, sync or async, authentication); exchanged content (in which specific 
calls are valid); and data format.
An interesting development is the hybrid approach taken in Brazil, where API standard 
development has been delegated to scheme participants. However, the regulator oversees 
delegation and must approve the final standards. This is in contrast with the United Kingdom’s 
Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), a U.K. company set up and governed by CMA55 
that is tasked with implementing open banking, including the development of API standards. 
Brazil’s open banking regime foresees a convention drafted by regime participants that sets out 
agreed-on API standards, among other implementation issues, with oversight from its central 
bank. (See the Brazil case study in Appendix B for details.)
Implications for EMDEs
Many regulators in EMDEs are unable to foster dialog on technical standards with market 
players. On the other hand, a lack of standardization or allowing data holders, who are often 
not interested in quality, to determine standards is unlikely to produce an optimal outcome. 
Standardization of open banking APIs should be a priority in all cases, even if it is not a launch 
requirement, and there are many ways to achieve standardization. Regulators in EMDEs, 
in particular, may wish to consider a layered API standardization approach that is similar 
to the Brazilian approach. This would include allowing the industry, as a body with equal 
representation for each type of stakeholder, to determine standards under the regulator’s 
oversight. It is important for regulators in this scenario to outline processes in the event the 
industry is unable to agree on standards—whether it be giving the regulator the final decision or 
allowing a majority vote.

OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
STAGED IMPLEMENTATION
Six of the reviewed regimes are implementing open banking in stages.56 The main criteria for 
staged implementation include the following: 
1. Sensitivity of the data—public information is released first, then confidential customer data 
is shared (Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, and United Kingdom). 
2. Types of services, with data related to simpler services, such as personal loans, credit and 
debit cards, deposit accounts, and transaction accounts, released first (Australia, Brazil, 
Hong Kong, and Malaysia). 
3. Type of entity that must release, with larger entities releasing earlier (Australia and Brazil).
Staged implementation allows both stakeholders and regulators to take small steps and to learn 
about pitfalls and master best practices before committing to widespread data sharing. Open 
banking regimes are new, and staged implementation allows measured risk-taking with data 
that, if mishandled, could cause substantial consumer harm. The approach also is viable when 
a regulator transitions to open data, as is the case with Australia and the United Kingdom. 
The assumption is that larger entities with the biggest customer data sets would be the first to 
implement and so should bear the early burden and pave the way for the rest of the industry.
Implications for EMDEs
EMDEs may face technical and resource capacity issues or they may lack relevant legal 
frameworks, especially on data protection, competition regulation, and consumer protection. 
Certain categories of consumers, such as illiterate, rural, or disabled individuals, also may be 
perceived as facing high data protection risk. Staged implementation would help regulators 
increase technical capacity while they minimize customer risk. Regulators may consider staging 
based on data confidentiality (public vs. confidential customer data), service type (simple vs. 
complex financial products), and player size (large vs. small).
LEAD REGULATOR/POLICY MANDATE
Most of the open banking regimes reviewed have a designated “lead” regulator, which usually 
is the central bank or the financial sector regulator. Australia, India, Mexico, and the United 
Kingdom are exceptions, mainly because of the broad sectoral scope of regimes that go 
beyond banking and payments.
In Australia, the regime implicates several sectors, including banking, securities, and 
investments, and several regulators, including the Office of the Australian Information 
Commissioner, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and other applicable sector-focused 
regulators. Given the regime’s competition rationale, the country’s competition regulator—the 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)—acts as lead regulator. 
Since fintechs and financial institutions in Mexico fall under the jurisdiction of the banking and 
payments supervisor, Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV), and clearinghouses 
56 Many open banking regimes do not foresee staged implementation, including Bahrain, the European Union, 
Japan, and Singapore.23
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSand credit bureaus fall under the purview of the Central Bank, both regulators are mandated 
to supervise the open banking regime. Similarly, in India, because the regime is envisioned 
to cover banking, securities, insurance, and pensions, regulation is divided between RBI (as 
lead regulator), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory 
and Development Authority (IRDA), and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development 
Authority (PFRDA).
Although CMA in the United Kingdom imposed the open banking regime as a remedy and 
remains responsible for the regime, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is responsible for 
X2A under PSD2. Further, with the possible expansion to sectors such as energy, pensions, 
and telecoms, regulators of these other sectors also would be implicated in the regulation of the 
data sharing regime.
Implications for EMDEs
As noted, the broader the sectoral and data scope of an open banking regime, the more 
potential benefits regimes have for financial inclusion. However, depending on the financial 
regulator’s mandate, expanding a scheme’s scope beyond banking and payments may 
require the main banking regulator to share jurisdiction with other financial regulators. Equally, 
extending to an open data regime in nonfinancial sectors requires bringing nonfinancial sector 
regulators into the mix. 
Increasing the number of implicated regulators in a regime creates coordination challenges 
that may be difficult to surmount if resources are scarce or priorities diverge. It also may 
lead to delays in implementation, as is currently the case in Kenya where discussions are 
ongoing about which authority should be the open banking lead. An open data regime may 
present even greater challenges to collaboration because of the increased number of potential 
regulators and the need for cross-sectoral collaboration.
To avoid such drawbacks, EMDEs should identify a lead regulator early on. A variety of 
criteria need to be considered to determine which regulator should act as lead. These may 
include the following:
• The regulatory body with the greatest interest in achieving the rationale, such as 
competition, innovation, and inclusion, for open banking in their market.
• The regulatory body with the most power for enforcement.
• The regulator with the most suitable purview. 
• The regulator with the most convening power. 
Once a lead regulator is identified, staged implementation enables additional financial and 
nonfinancial regulators to be added as (and when) they are ready to participate. One example is 
Brazil, whose Central Bank-led open banking regime includes access to consumer transaction 
data from banks, but also to consumer transaction data concerning securities, insurance, 
and pensions. The country’s securities and investment and pension and insurance regulators 
currently are not implementing open banking in their sectors because of other priorities. 
However, this does not preclude the issuance of supplementary resolutions by these authorities 
in the future, when they may be ready and willing to implement data sharing for institutions 24
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
within their purview. Importantly, current communication between Brazil’s Central Bank and the 
other regulators is key to transmitting early learnings and coordinating approaches.
GOVERNANCE
The way an open banking regime is governed may include setting security and API standards, 
determining future changes in scope, provisions for liability and dispute settlement, and the 
cost of data calls (if any). All of these elements can be part and parcel of the implementing 
regulations (as is the case in Mexico and the European Union); decided by a separate entity or 
group set up or convened to make such decisions (e.g., the United Kingdom’s OBIE, the regime 
participants’ convention in Brazil, and India’s Sahamati); or a hybrid of the two. 
As noted, OBIE in the United Kingdom is tasked with implementing open banking, including 
the development of API standards. CMA determines OBIE’s governance, composition, and 
budget, while funding is provided by the nine mandated banks under the CMA order. Under 
the Central Bank’s oversight, Brazil’s open banking regime foresees a convention drafted by 
regime participants that agrees to API standards, the cost of data calls, dispute resolution 
mechanisms, and the eventual future expansion of scope, among other implementation issues. 
In India, the nonprofit entity Sahamati currently is tasked with growing the account aggregator 
ecosystem and running an “umbrella” entity for account aggregators (Datwani and Raman 
2020). In the latter role, Sahamati is undertaking part of the regime’s governance, including 
developing certification guidelines on software and issuing technical standards. 
Implications for EMDEs
Whether a separate governing body is required for the proper functioning of an open banking 
regime is a function of how the initial regime framework is set out, which is itself often dictated 
by a country’s legal framework and law tradition. In all cases, if a regime’s framework does not 
provide guidance on key elements such as technical standards for data sharing (if applicable), 
liability, dispute resolution, and the cost of data calls, it should be assumed that these elements 
are articulated elsewhere—either in secondary regulation or by a governance entity. If the 
governance entity is led by the regulator, resources would need to be allocated, which may be 
a challenge for some EMDEs. 
COST DISTRIBUTION
Implementation of open banking regimes (i.e., putting in place sharing infrastructure such as 
APIs) and their ongoing maintenance (i.e., communication costs for individual requests for, and 
sharing of, data and continuous updates to the sharing infrastructure) entails significant costs. 
Who bears these costs varies greatly across the regimes reviewed, if this is even dealt with in 
the regime framework.57 
In Australia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, the regulator placed most of the 
cost burden on the entities mandated to share data. In Australia and the United Kingdom, the 
burden was part of the “sanctions” imposed on incumbents for prior anti-competitive market 
57 So far, three regimes—Japan, Indonesia, and Malaysia—have not dealt with the issue of the cost burden of 
data sharing in their legislation and regulations.25
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSpractices. In all three jurisdictions, the cost burden reduces barriers to data sharing for TPPs 
and consumers. On the other hand, Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Singapore explicitly 
authorize data holders to charge data users fees for each individual data request, while TPPs in 
Bahrain are permitted to charge consumers. In Bahrain and Hong Kong, fees must be bilaterally 
agreed on, while in Mexico they must be approved by the regulator. In Brazil, beyond a certain 
number of free data API calls, fees must be agreed on by the regime participants’ convention, 
which is overseen by the regulator. 
Whether a regulator imposes the cost burden on a certain party or allows parties to bilaterally 
negotiate appears to depend on a variety of factors, including rationale for the regime and 
relative strength of the regulator compared with industry incumbents. It should be noted that 
in jurisdictions where the regulator imposed the cost burden on incumbents, incumbents 
expressed sharp criticism that the burden may render the open banking regime “commercially 
unsustainable” in the long term. It remains to be seen whether this is the case, or whether those 
bearing the costs can cross-subsidize from other parts of their businesses.
Implications for EMDEs
The inclusion of fees charged by data holders for individual data requests in an open banking 
regime increases costs for data users. It can result in increasing the price and affordability of 
some services, although data users need to absorb other cost elements as well, such as the 
cost of their IT infrastructure. A price increase could disincentivize adoption by the low-income 
population, act as a barrier to access, and help data holders retain competitive power. 
Depending on the level of fees, it also may undermine the ability of open banking-enabled 
service providers to use reduced costs and efficiencies gained from APIs to target low-income 
and unbanked individuals. These fees are separate from initial set-up costs, which are not 
directly passed on to data users and consumers, although data holders may try to recoup 
costs over time. 
Not all services that assist low-income individuals require the same quantity of data calls (see 
Box 4). For example, savings trackers and sweepers require a large number of data calls, while 
utility switching services require only a limited number. Regulators can use this knowledge to 
design a tiered pricing regime that provides for certain free data API calls and certain premium 
calls. Tiered pricing would place the relevant services that assist low-income individuals and 
their corresponding number of average data calls into the “free data API bucket.” (See the Brazil 
case study in Appendix B for details on this approach.) 
Regulators could go further and explicitly prohibit passing along data sharing fees to 
customers. It is not clear whether this would effectively support TPPs to offer more services 
to low-income customers because in each case, they would have to cover costs somewhere 
in their business model. In all cases, regulators should ensure that end-customer pricing is 
transparent—customers typically do not know that they are triggering a data API call. For 
example, it would be problematic if customers were not aware in advance that they are being 
charged for opening a personal financial management app, which then automatically updates 
by calling various third-party data APIs. 
Regime set-up costs could be financed by a state subsidy, by incumbents as a “one off” 
penalty for existing data asymmetry (i.e., the United Kingdom model), or by a cross-section of 26
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
all industry players in proportion to their market presence (e.g., the Brazilian model). Regulators 
should consider the market structure and its resources when making such decisions.
DATA PRIVACY AND PORTABILITY
At least 10 of the reviewed regimes provide for some type of customer consent before customer 
data are shared.58 Jurisdictions that allow the sharing of generic services data or other 
nonconfidential data such as aggregated data  do not require customer consent for this type of 
data. This is logical because the data are usually public and, in all cases, not customer specific.
Since customer consent is a cornerstone of data sharing regimes, we would expect regimes 
to have comprehensive data protection regulatory frameworks as well. This assumption bears 
out in almost all jurisdictions except India and Indonesia. India and Indonesia regulate data only 
on a sectoral basis; however, both have a pending national data protection legislation and India 
has incorporated key data protection measures into the Master Direction governing its account 
aggregator ecosystem.59
Most of the reviewed regimes do not have separate data portability provisions. Although data 
portability is not required for data sharing, it is the other side of the data sharing coin. It gives 
consumers the right to port whatever data they wish instead of solely agreeing to requests 
initiated by TPPs (albeit the customer usually takes the first step in initiating a TPP relationship). 
Data portability can help regulators expand data sharing into sectors beyond open banking, 
such as open data (e.g., Brazil).
Implications for EMDEs
EMDEs often have data provisions in sectoral legislation rather than a general data protection 
law. They also may have a large percentage of the population categorized as “vulnerable.”60 It is 
legitimate to ask whether it is appropriate to implement such an open banking regime without 
a general data protection law or comprehensive data provisions in sectoral legislation. The 
answer revolves around how robust data protection is in the country in question. It is possible 
that sectoral legislation is sufficient or that the introduction of an open banking regime could 
concurrently introduce the necessary level of protection in the relevant sectoral legislation, as is 
arguably the case in India. An assessment of what makes a data protection regime sufficiently 
robust for data sharing is outside the scope of this paper, but it would be an important element 
in any analysis of the appropriateness of open banking regimes in EMDEs. Further research on 
this aspect is recommended.
58 Since the necessary documentation is not available in English we were unable to ascertain whether customer 
consent is required in Indonesia.
59 For banking data in Indonesia, data protection is covered by Law No. 7 of 1992 on Banking, as amended by 
Law No. 10 of 1998 and Bank of Indonesia Regulation No. 16/1/PBI/2014 on Protection of Consumers of 
Payment Systems. The Information Technology Act of 2000, as amended in India, contains provisions for the 
protection of electronic data. RBI issues periodic guidelines and circulars to maintain the confidentiality and 
privacy of client information. However, a draft national data protection bill is in the process of being adopted in 
both countries.
60 The Australia Data 61 survey reported that barriers to adoption of such regimes for “vulnerable” populations 
lie with the lack of understanding of data recipient value propositions and low consumer trust, highlighting the 
importance of data protection for this stratum of the population. See Consumer Data Standards (2019).27
12 dESIgn CoM pon EnTSEven if the data protection regulatory framework is or can become sufficiently robust, the 
question remains whether vulnerable populations, such as those who are illiterate, can even 
“consent” to such a regime or if a different type of data protection framework that goes beyond 
consent would be more appropriate—for example, one that establishes a fiduciary relationship 
between providers and customers (Medine and Murthy 2019).  This also is outside the scope of 
this paper but is worthy of further exploration as part of an analysis of the appropriate elements 
of a data protection framework that are required for EMDEs to adopt open banking regimes.
LIABILITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
The risk of fraud, scams, and customer error can be exacerbated in complex payment initiation 
processes and the enhanced data sharing fostered by open banking regimes. First, all types 
of data access conditioned on screen scraping increase the risk of a data breach. In many 
countries, data access via login details sharing happens even without an open banking regime 
set up. In fact, some open banking regimes, such as in the European Union, explicitly prohibit 
screen scraping and support the use of APIs to minimize these risks. Yet even APIs are not risk 
proof; security and data protection requirements are highly recommended.
Second, the provision of payment initiation services poses greater risk than data aggregation 
or account information services. PISPs not only retrieve customer data, but they also transmit 
payment orders. The addition of third parties such as PISPs in a payment order can increase 
the risk of an incorrectly transmitted or delayed order, which creates further issues if the 
customer wishes to reverse an initial transaction (Carr et al. 2018). Determining ultimate liability 
in fraudulent or erroneous transactions may be challenging in jurisdictions where national 
liability frameworks are not adjusted to account for open banking and data sharing between 
multiple parties (BIS 2019). 
To mitigate the risks introduced by open banking, regimes should consider rules dealing with:
1. Liability for fraud, theft, and technical and customer error.
2. Consumer recourse, including dispute resolution.
Regimes could consider the implications of TPP licensing and accreditation and allow for a 
certain amount of reliance on it by data holders. 
In terms of consumer recourse, many more jurisdictions have existing or planned mechanisms 
to cover open banking issues. OBIE in the United Kingdom has created a dispute management 
system (DMS) to handle requests, enquiries, complaints, and disputes between ASPSPs and 
TPPs on open banking (Carr et al. 2018).
DMS is a voluntary mechanism where participants adhere to a code of best practices, 
including how to handle cases at first instance and how such cases can be taken to mediation, 
adjudication, or arbitration. In Hong Kong, provisions addressing complaints-handling 
mechanisms are included in third-party contracts. Customers should not be responsible for 
direct loss resulting from unauthorized transactions unless the customer acted fraudulently or 
with gross negligence. In Japan, the Association for Electronic Payment Services, a private 
body, is responsible for handling customer complaints related to open banking. In Singapore, 28
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
the Personal Data Protection Commission facilitates complaints between customers and 
providers. India has an Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions (BIS 2019).
Most of the open banking regimes reviewed, however, do not make specific provisions for 
liability rules. The main exception is the European Union. PSD2 sets out a strong customer 
authentication (SCA) requirement for most types of payment initiation as well as liability 
conditions. The requirement places the liability on banks to reimburse customers in the first 
place, even if unauthorized transactions originate from the relationship between the user and a 
third party. 
There are issues with the provisions made under PSD2/SCA rules, which have been criticized 
as being inflexible and too prescriptive to accommodate future developments.61 Technical 
difficulties have resulted in delays in implementing SCA.62 Further, it seems disproportionate 
to place initial liability on ASPSPs, regardless of fault. Commentators have suggested that the 
responsibility should first lie with the bank or third party where the transaction originated (Carr 
et al. 2018). However, all open banking regimes should include rules on liability and security.
Implications for EMDEs
Given the risks at hand, EMDEs should determine the robustness of their current consumer 
protection framework. If the framework is not sufficient, introducing an open banking regime 
could bring the necessary level of protection for new entities entering into the process. An open 
banking regime should set out liability provisions in case of data transmission errors or data 
breach and, if the latter is in scope, the specific risks of payment initiation. Finally, cross-sectoral 
dispute resolution processes should be considered.
61 Various financial services trade associations based in the United Kingdom, such as Payments UK, Financial 
Fraud Action UK, and the UK Cards Association, have raised concerns that SCA does not cater to 
technologies such as wearable payments or internet of things-based devices. This could potentially “quash 
this sort of innovation and other moves toward ‘invisible’ payments.” See the joint response from Payments 
UK, Financial Fraud Action UK, and the UK Cards Association to the EBA Consultation on RTS: https://eba.

63 This report focuses on open banking and financial services since only these types of regimes presently exist. 
If economic sectors extend beyond financial services, they also would become open data regimes. The 
possibility presents the greatest potential for financial inclusion.IMPLICATIONS FoR  
REGIME DESIGN
THE POLICY OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF AN OPEN BANKING 
regime determines which types of services can be provided and which types of business 
models are feasible. A regulator in an EMDE may wish to ensure the possibility of offering 
open banking-enabled products and services—and corresponding business models—that 
alleviate friction for low-income populations. If open banking supports social goals such as 
financial inclusion, then those goals must be considered in the design of the open banking 
regime. Keeping these considerations in mind when designing a regime is what we call 
“financial inclusion by design.” 
Earlier in the paper we identified 12 design components for regulators to consider in general 
when implementing an open banking regime (see Section 3). Of the 12 components, early 
evidence suggests that the four related to scope and the one related to cost would, to a 
large extent, determine whether a regime achieves financial inclusion by design. The choices 
specifically concern (i) regime participants and data reciprocity, (ii) which types of data are 
shared, (iii) which services fall within the regime’s ambit,63 (iv) whether payment initiation is 
enabled, and (v) the cost of data exchange requests.
The wider an entity’s ambit, the greater the number and diversity of new services that could be 
enabled and the greater potential for competition. In this context, bringing fintechs and other 
licensed or accredited TPPs into the regime’s purview would go a long way toward ensuring 
that sufficient actors are in place to support the creation of inclusive open banking products. 
Similarly, the greater the breadth of eligible data types, the more likely that relevant products 
could be developed for low-income individuals. Customer transaction data would be key in all 
instances, and personally identifiable information/customer registration data are necessary in 
the case of CCDD functionality. 
To ensure that even those without a digital financial data trail can benefit, regulators should 
consider going beyond open banking to open data. To that end, telecoms and utilities often 30
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
are a top priority for financial inclusion in many EMDEs. However, they may add a layer of 
complexity given the need for cross-sectoral coordination and increased data security risks. 
If an appropriate payment infrastructure is in place, payment initiation should be enabled to 
ensure that customers can act on the analytics and recommendations their data generate. 
Finally, given the many barriers to adopting digital financial services and the lack of resources 
that low-income populations experience, open banking regimes are likely to have the biggest 
impact on these individuals—if they are not required to pay for the service. As discussed in 
Section 3, another policy question is: Who in the ecosystem picks up the bill?
Table 1 shows how design components can have a practical effect on a regime’s design. It 
maps components to the open banking-enabled products and services we have identified 
for low-income individuals. These products and services include savings trackers and 
sweepers, utility switching, CCDD, budgeting applications with payment initiation, and 
responsible digital credit.
In EMDEs in particular, open banking regimes have been introduced fairly recently. Early 
findings need to be further tested and substantiated through in-depth research in a range of 
countries. Additional research is required particularly on the feasibility of implementing open 
data regimes and the effect regimes have on poor people. More work should be undertaken on 
the implementation staging of open banking and open data and their affect on various scheme 
participants (rural and remote entities, in particular). Customer segmentation work also should 
be considered—the types of data customers possess and how they match with the types of 
services they need. To better understand the role of industry, another area of further study is 
the current and potential governance structures of open banking regimes. Finally, more work 
on data protection is a prerequisite to understanding what makes a data protection regime 
sufficiently robust to ensure a safe data sharing regime—and how these elements can be 
introduced in countries that lack robust data protection regimes. 31

BANKING—A CASE STUDY
IN APRIL 2019, THE CENTRAL BANK OF BRAZIL ISSUED A HIGH-LEVEL 
communiqué that set out the main elements of the country’s open banking regime.64 The 
formal issuance of a Resolution to implement open banking followed on 4 May 2020,65 after 
several months of public consultation with industry stakeholders. The regime’s rationale was to 
“increase efficiency in the credit and payment market in Brazil by promoting a more inclusive 
and competitive business environment while preserving the security of the financial system and 
the protection of consumers.”66 
Open banking in Brazil comes on the heels of recent regulatory reforms that promote 
competition in the financial services sector, including the following regulations:
• Regulation establishing peer-to-peer (P2P) and platform lending.
• Tiered prudential regulation imposing lighter requirements on smaller firms with a narrow 
range of products and low complexity (Cohen Freue 2019).
• Establishment of an instant payments scheme (the PIX instant payment system).
• Regulations to facilitate merchant credit based on merchants’ receivables (without being 
locked into a particular bank).
The open banking regime, which came into force on 1 June 2020 and will be implemented in 
stages between November 2020 and October 2021, has addressed the 12 design components 
previously laid out:
1. Types of services.  As set out in the Resolution, the regime covers all services regulated 
by the Central Bank of Brazil, including banking, payments, credit, and foreign exchange 
operations. Note that data on products and services related to investment, insurance, and 35
BRAzIlIAn opEn BAnkIng—A C ASE S TUdY open pensions are in scope, but institutions in these sectors technically are not under the 
jurisdiction of the Central Bank. There are, however, ongoing discussions on whether these 
sectors will participate in open banking in their own right.
2. Participants.  The regime covers financial institutions, payment institutions, and other 
institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank. There is data sharing reciprocity for 
all scheme participants.
3. Types of data.  The regime requires the sharing of the following data: (i) public product/
services data, including location of service points, product characteristics, contractual 
terms and conditions, and financial costs; (ii) customer registration data, including name, 
affiliation, and address, that can be used for CCDD; (iii) transactional customer data, 
including data related to deposit accounts, credit operations, and other products and 
services contracted by customers; and (iv) data required for the implementation of payment 
services, including initiation of payments, transfers of funds, payments of products and 
services, among others, and the forwarding of loan proposals. Participants in the regime 
convention can extend the scope to other types of data and services. Prior customer 
consent is required for all data sharing except public product data sharing.
4. Payment initiation. In addition to data exchange, the regime supports payment initiation 
and loan proposal forwarding, which allows customers to directly contract with TPPs for 
loans through a digital interface.
5. Mandatory vs. voluntary.  The regime is mandatory for banks categorized as Segment 1 
and Segment 2 institutions (except those that do not provide any of the services in scope), 
as well as all authorized payment institutions in Brazil. Participation by all other financial 
institutions in scope is voluntary, as long as they meet the technical requirements for data 
transmission via an API and are register in the participant repository. 
6. Technical specifications for data sharing.  The regime foresees participants required 
to make APIs available for data transmission. A convention drafted by participants will 
decide on the development of technological standardization, operational procedures, safety 
standards, and API implementation. The convention also will decide other issues, such as a 
dispute settlement mechanism and fees participants must pay for premium data calls. The 
Central Bank will oversee the drafting of the convention.
7. Staged implementation.  The regime foresees staged implementation by data 
sensitivity, data type, and data holder type. In the first phase, public data on service 
channels and basic bank products, such as deposit and savings accounts and credit, 
must be shared. In the second phase, customer registration data and customer 
transaction data on basic bank products must be shared. In the third phase, payment 
initiation and loan forwarding must be shared. In the fourth phase, public data and 
customer transaction data on more complex financial products, such as foreign 
exchange, investments, and insurance, require disclosure.
8. Lead regulator/policy mandate.  Although the lead regulator is the Central Bank, the 
regime includes access to consumer transaction data on securities, open pensions, and 
insurance. The Central Bank does not have jurisdiction over these products, and currently, 36
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
insurance and pensions and securities and investment regulators are not implementing 
open banking in their sectors because they have other priorities. Thus, the open banking 
regime may trigger issuance of supplementary resolutions by these authorities in the future.
9. Governance.  The Resolution envisages the drafting of a convention by regime 
participants, which will set out the agreed on rules on developing technological 
standardization, operational procedures, safety standards, implementation of APIs, a 
dispute settlement mechanism, and fees participants must pay for premium data calls. The 
Central Bank will oversee the drafting.
10. Cost distribution.  The regime incorporates a tiered pricing regime that provides for 
certain free API calls per service/product. Specifically, the following API calls are free: all 
calls concerning all payment initiation; two calls per month per participating institution 
per customer (concerning registration data); and 120 calls per month, per participating 
institution and per customer, concerning customer transaction data. For remaining API 
calls, the data recipient may be required to reimburse the data holder at a cost to be 
determined by the convention.
11. Data privacy and portability.  The regime requires participants to adhere to data privacy 
regulations, including the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD),67 published in 
August 2018 and in effect as of August 2020. LGPD includes both data ownership and data 
portability provisions, which opens the door to expanding the data sharing regime beyond 
open banking to sectors such as telecoms and utilities.
12. Liability and consumer protection.  The regime does not set out liability provisions or 
other consumer protection elements. However, the convention will develop them, including 
establishment of channels for consumer complaints and creation of procedures and 
mechanisms for handling and settling disputes among regime participants.

A CASE STUDY
MEXICO’S “FINTECH LAW, PASSED ON 9 MARCH 2018, INCLUDES 
high-level open banking provisions in Articles 76 and 77.68 Details about the regime 
were set out by secondary regulation issued in March 2020 by CNBV, one of the 
country’s financial sector regulators.69 The secondary regulation sets technical and security 
standards for APIs, plus other open banking regime details on public data, for example, 
products and services offered and locations of ATMs and branches. After its summer 2020 
pilot, CNBV expects to issue similar regulations on customer transaction data and aggregated 
data in 2021 (Deloitte 2020). The Bank of Mexico issued secondary regulation in March 2020 
as well, setting technical and security standards for APIs plus other open banking regime 
details for clearinghouses and credit bureaus.70 The Ministry of Finance, co-author of the 
Fintech Law, chose to develop the main details of open banking in secondary regulation to 
retain legislative flexibility.
Open banking provisions are a minor part of the Fintech Law. Its main provisions focus on 
regulating new players (crowdfunding and e-money institutions) and setting up a regulatory 
sandbox. One of the primary reasons for issuing the Fintech Law was to deal with the growing 
number of crowdfunding and P2P lending platforms in operation, as well as the e-wallet and 
cryptocurrency providers and exchanges that had, until recently, operated in a grey area. 
Another rationale was to support financial inclusion. In the context of financial inclusion, open 
banking is expected to render the marketplace more transparent and ensure that products best 
suited to the unbanked will be developed.38
OPEN BANKING: HOW TO DESIGN FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION
The main contours of the open banking regime are as follows:
1. Types of services. The regime covers a broad range and numerous types of financial 
services, including investments and insurance. Pensions are part of a separate scheme.71 
2. Participants.  All financial institutions, fintechs, clearinghouses, and credit bureaus fall 
within scope. Reciprocity exists between most data sharers and receivers because a 
majority of the same institutions can receive—and must share—data. The sole exception is 
the third parties that specialize in IT, such as BigTech, that may access data but may not 
be required to share in return.72 Sectoral scope is broad; CNBV has jurisdiction over 21 
different types of entities, including credit institutions, brokerage houses, stock exchanges, 
and investment fund operators, among others.
3. Types of data.  Article 76 of the Fintech Law identifies three types of data: (i) 
nonconfidential financial data on financial products and services, plus location of access 
points, (ii) aggregated statistical data on transactions that cannot be disaggregated, and 
(iii) consumer transaction data for products or services. This last category requires explicit 
client consent. 
4. Payment initiation.  Payment initiation is not part of Mexico’s open banking regime. 
However, this type of functionality is possible through the Cobros Digitales (CoDi) overlay 
service to Mexico’s instant payment system (SPEI). Banks are required to adopt the CoDi 
solution, while nonbanks may choose to register through a process established by the 
Central Bank.
5. Mandatory vs. voluntary.  The Fintech Law establishes a mandatory regime for all 
entities in scope.
6. Technical specifications for data sharing.  The Fintech Law foresees API standardization, 
with secondary regulation setting out the technical details. Fintechs and financial institutions 
do not carry special obligations ,73 nor do they require accreditation to share or receive data 
over APIs—beyond compliance with API technical and security standards.
7. Staged implementation.  The Fintech Law does not set out staged implementation but 
is de facto  due to the issuing process of secondary legislation. Public data are released 
before customer transaction data are.
8. Lead regulator/policy mandate.  CNBV oversees how the open banking regime is 
applied to fintechs and financial institutions; the Bank of Mexico has jurisdiction over 
clearinghouses and credit bureaus in this regard. The split follows specific mandates for 
71 The pensions regulator, la Comisión Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (CONSAR), issued 
voluntary API rules in November 2018, which are separate from the open banking scheme set out in 
the Fintech Law. See https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/527504/dispos_operaciones__
compila_29_11_19.pdf .
72 This practice has been criticized by industry stakeholders because it allows BigTech to access data without 
requiring such entities to provide access to their databases—arguably creating an uneven playing field. See 
Section 1, for details. 
73 Only clearinghouses and credit bureaus need to be authorized to access relevant data, as set out 
in the secondary regulations of the Bank of Mexico. See https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.

MEXICA n opEn BAnkIng—A C ASE S TUdY each regulator. The pensions regulator separately oversees voluntary API rules for pension 
fund administrators.
9. Governance.  No separate entity determines governance issues. They are dealt with by the 
relevant regulator in secondary regulation.
10. Cost distribution. All institutions can charge fees for data exchange, but fees must be 
authorized in advance by the relevant regulator. To prevent barriers to access, fees must be 
fair, transparent, and nondiscriminatory.
11. Data privacy and portability.  Mexico has a general data protection law, but no data 
portability provisions. Although data portability provisions are not required for open 
banking, they do allow for the potential extension of data sharing regimes to other sectors.
12. Liability and consumer protection.  Neither the Fintech Law nor its implementing 
regulations have addressed liability and consumer protection.40
