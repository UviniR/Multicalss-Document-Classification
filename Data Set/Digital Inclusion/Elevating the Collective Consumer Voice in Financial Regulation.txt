ExEcu TIvE Summary  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1 A table at the end of the paper summarizes recommendations for funders.DESPITE THE RAPID INCREASE IN ACCESS TO FORMAL FINANCIAL 
services through digital channels, many people either don’t use the services available 
to them or face numerous risks when they do. This paper shows that elevating the 
collective voice of DFS consumers can give them more say and more power in the financial 
sector. Through a stronger consumer voice, regulators will gain a better understanding of the 
risks facing consumers and adapt regulations accordingly, thus making financial services more 
responsible. Such change is even more important in times of economic or other crisis that put 
vulnerable segments at special risk.
Through its research, CGAP has identified three opportunities to elevate the consumer voice 
that deserve support: 
1. Consumer groups such as consumer associations  can play an important role 
in influencing regulations. Consumer risks in finance are often at the top of consumer 
associations’ concerns. This came out clearly in recent research undertaken by CGAP with 
Consumers International, the membership organization for consumer groups around the 
world. The associations need support from funders to understand the complexity of the 
financial sector and to develop sustainable financing mechanisms. 
2. CGAP research also showed that international funders who work at the policy level can 
more systematically promote the emergence of regulatory consultative bodies  to 
integrate the consumer voice into financial regulation. For example, a lot can be learned 
from the experience of regulators in the UK, the EU and Australia in establishing formal 
consultative bodies that include consumers. Evidence shows that such bodies can alert the 
regulators to irresponsible practices in the financial sector. 
3. Finally, social media apps and social media monitoring through suptech,  the use 
of technology to facilitate supervisory activities, enable policy makers to better understand 
consumers’ needs and concerns and detect potential crises. There are also solutions such as 
audio platforms in India that have helped raise the voice of digitally disconnected populations. 
International funders can support the use of such technologies in their work with regulators.
Because these opportunities are still in the early stages, international funders who work in 
inclusive finance can play a key facilitating role to help developing and emerging economies 
pilot such approaches, thereby helping to make finance more responsible.12
ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE CONSUMER VOICE IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
INTRODUCTION
2 In this paper “consumers” includes all people who use or may use financial services, while “customers” refer 
to actual users of such services.
3 We define “vulnerable” broadly in the paper to include individuals who are low-income, women, elderly, youth, 
and refugees. In practice, a country’s vulnerable segments depend on its unique context and will vary over time.
4 The most recent GSMA industry report shows that there is little progress in usage of mobile money with 
about two thirds of people who have an account not using it (GSMA 2020a).
5 Digital channels and the use of agents pose unique risks due to the potential for communication failure, 
identity theft, fraud, and inadequate price transparency and access to recourse (Staschen and Meager 2018). 
6 Customer outcomes regulatory frameworks in FCP shift the focus from requiring provider compliance with 
check-the-box rules (e.g., provide a disclosure form to the customer) to ensuring positive results or outcomes 
(e.g., demonstrate that the customer understands the key features and conditions). Enhancing the collective 
consumer voice helps align FCP regulatory frameworks, provider cultures, and the needs of consumers to 
promote a more responsible and sustainable financial services market (see Izaguirre 2020). THERE IS SOLID EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS OF ENGAGING CITIZENS 
in regulatory processes, especially those who will be impacted by proposed new 
rules (Johns and Saltane, 2016). This makes sense intuitively—but how does it work in 
practice? Who should be included, and how do you go about including them? 
This paper explores the potential impact of incorporating the collective voice of consumers2 
into financial sector policy and regulation, and opportunities for funders to help elevate these 
voices. In this context, “collective consumer voice” describes a set of mechanisms that enable 
consumers’ needs and concerns to be communicated as a group, improving the odds that their 
voices will be heard and integrated. 
Elevating consumer voices, especially those of vulnerable3 segments, is critical for responsible 
delivery of the diverse and rapidly evolving digital financial services (DFS) offered to previously 
unserved and under-served consumers. Despite expanded access to DFS worldwide, many 
customers do not use these services to their full advantage.4 This is mainly because the quality 
of DFS has not always kept pace with increased access, and risks to consumers have persisted 
or even increased as regulators and supervisors strive to keep abreast of the emerging risks.5 
As a result, effective financial consumer protection (FCP)—a basic regulatory enabler of 
inclusive finance–is more relevant than ever. 
Heightened attention to the link between FCP and financial inclusion provides an opportunity 
to raise consumers’ voices as part of regulatory reform efforts. While most countries surveyed 
by the World Bank had an FCP legal framework in place (World Bank 2017a), some are 
moving toward more customer-centric approaches with the goal of improving outcomes 
for DFS consumers (Izaguirre 2020).6 These jurisdictions offer interesting examples of how 3
INTroduc TIoNan outcomes-oriented approach that incorporates the customer’s voice into the design 
of products, services, and regulatory responses can better meet the needs of DFS users, 
particularly those most vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Elevating the collective consumer voice 
is particularly relevant for this innovative approach. 
Our key assumption is that elevating the collective consumer voice in financial regulation will 
make regulatory processes fairer in two ways. First, by being present at the table, consumers, 
particularly vulnerable groups, can advocate for their needs; and second, the collective voice 
can correct asymmetries of information and power in financial markets. This will improve the 
quality of regulation, and in turn, financial inclusion and outcomes for consumers. 
Funders can be an important catalyst in elevating the collective consumer voice. This paper 
describes options for funders to consider that can be incorporated into their existing work 
with financial sector regulators and organizations that represent consumers. By including the 
collective consumer voice in their work, funders will facilitate more participatory regulatory 
approaches7. While not the primary audience of the paper, regulators can also benefit 
from the research findings and examples provided to inspire their own customer-centric 
approaches to FCP. 
This paper builds upon a recent CGAP survey on consumer associations undertaken with 
Consumers International as well as its own research, including more than 35 interviews with 
individuals representing funders, regulators, consumer associations, and other experts.8 Based 
on these and other sources, CGAP identified three opportunities that appear most promising to 
elevate the collective consumer voice: 
1. Consumer groups such as consumer associations; 
2. Regulatory mechanisms, such as consultative bodies; and 
3. Technology, e.g. social media, IVR, and suptech. 
The first section of the paper explores the potential role of consumer associations in elevating 
the collective consumer voice. The second section looks at how regulatory mechanisms can 
help regulators listen to that voice. The final section provides insights on how technology 
can help consumers speak up—and how regulators can better listen. Each section includes 
success stories from different countries along with suggestions on how funders can use their 
systems, practices and programs to elevate the consumer voice.

ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE CONSUMER VOICE IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
SECTION 1
THE  ROLE oF CONSUMER 
ASSOCIATIONS IN  
ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE 
CONSUMER VOICE
CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS WORKED TO CREATE A GLOBAL 
understanding of what consumer protection encompasses, embodied in the   
UN Guidelines for Consumer Protection , including the protection of vulnerable and 
disadvantaged consumers and the promotion and protection of the economic interests of 
consumers (UNCTAD 2016). Associations promote the UN Guidelines’ principles for good 
business practices, which include equitable and fair treatment, disclosure and transparency, 
protection of privacy, and effective redress mechanisms. This section focuses on how consumer 
associations can elevate the consumer voice in policy and regulatory changes in financial 
consumer protection. Most of the examples are from developing and emerging economies.
Consumer associations form a diverse universe with a rich history. UNCTAD (2020b) 
defines consumer associations as “non-governmental civil society organizations that represent 
consumers’ interests, while defending their rights in the marketplace.” It adds: “Although they 
are usually non-profit making, and largely independent from governments or businesses, they 
may be fully, or partially, financed by a government or other agencies.” 
Many consumer associations emerged after World War I. In the United States the first 
fully-fledged consumer association was created in 1928. The International Organization of 
Consumers Unions—now known as Consumers International (UNCTAD 2020b)—was formed in 
1960. The number of associations in emerging and developing economies has increased in the 
past several years. Consumers International now reports more than 200 member organizations 
globally, including 132 members from emerging and developing economies. 
Some associations in high-income countries have more than 100 staff members and 
significant budgets, while staffing is typically modest in emerging and developing economies. 5
THE rolE oF coNS umEr aSS ocIaTIoNS  IN ElEvaTINg THE  coll EcTIvE coNS umEr v oIcE A number of consumer associations serve as umbrella organizations with significant local 
reach. For example, the Rwanda Consumer’s Rights Protection Organization (ADECOR) has 
20 district committees and the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe runs 366 consumer action 
clubs throughout the country (Consumers International Forthcoming). In Peru, the National 
Council of Consumer Protection (Indecopi) recognized 75 consumer associations in 2019 
(UNCTAD 2020a). 
Consumer associations may take different legal forms. Often, they are registered as 
non-government organizations and may be defined or regulated under competition, 
consumer protection, or other laws. In some countries they are quasi-governmental. Local 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also have the ability to raise the collective voice of poor 
people without being registered as consumer associations. 
Consumer associations offer great potential to bring the collective voice into 
financial consumer protection regulation. In a 2013 survey with its members, Consumers 
International found financial services to be the highest priority issue (Consumer International 
2013). In Consumers International’s 2020 survey with 36 members from low- and middle-
income countries, financial services were among the top three issues (Consumers International 
2021). Data protection, which is increasingly connected with financial consumer protection, 
also appeared as a high priority. According to the same 2020 survey, the three most significant 
challenges financial services consumers faced were: (i) the lack of clarity in contracts; (ii) 
hidden or inflated charges or fees; and (iii) unfair contract terms and conditions (Consumers 
International 2021).
The way consumer associations influence policy and regulation can take several forms—such 
as presenting consumer views and experiences to regulators, either out of the associations’ 
own initiatives or prompted by regulators. Consumer associations can protect consumers 
against the risks and harms of using financial services in different ways. For example, they 
can help with complaints handling and dispute resolution. In the Philippines, the consumer 
association Laban Konsyumer collects consumer complaints and shares them with the central 
bank. Associations can also provide consumer debt counseling, conduct market research 
on risks, raise consumer awareness, and support public interest litigation. They can mobilize 
the media to convey a strong message to the public. This function also is a top priority for 
Consumers International members in their financial inclusion work, second only to increasing 
consumer education and raising awareness (Consumers International 2021).
While many consumer associations surveyed reported working on financial services issues, 
the specific nature or segments affected were more difficult to discern. By engaging more with 
grassroots and civil society organizations that focus on women or other vulnerable groups, 
consumer associations can better represent them. In the Consumer International survey, over 
half of consumer associations reported working with other NGOs on a case-by-case basis 
(Consumers International 2021).
Consumer associations face challenges in advancing consumer protection 
regulations.  The complexity of the financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework 
makes it difficult for consumer associations to influence policies and regulations. Given 
the cross-cutting nature of DFS, for example, a central bank, ministry of communication, 6
ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE CONSUMER VOICE IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
competition authority, and data protection authority typically may be involved which requires 
multiple entry points for consumer associations. In addition, few associations have had the time 
or the resources to build in-house the specialized skills required to understand the complexity 
of financial services—both by nature and in the way they are delivered to customers. 
The independence and representativeness of consumer associations varies by country. The 
United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection promote associations that are independent 
(UNCTAD 2016). Potential conflicts of interest could emerge when funding comes from 
governments or industries (UNCTAD 2020b). In some cases, tensions may exist between 
governments and consumer associations. 
In addition, poor people may rarely have the time or the opportunity to actively engage in 
consumer associations or participate in regulatory processes. Unless consumer associations 
reach out to women, youth, those in rural areas, the digitally disconnected and others, those 
groups may not have a voice. 
Finally, consumer associations often struggle with sustainable financing mechanisms, and 
diversifying their sources of income can be challenging. Funding sources typically include BOX 1.   Success stories of consumer associations elevating the consumers’ collective voice
While attributing impact of consumer associations 
on policy change is difficult given the large 
number of actors involved in designing regulation, 
emerging success stories do exist. Some of these 
examples focus on vulnerable groups and others on 
consumers more broadly.
Russia offers an interesting example on how it 
has promoted the rights of vulnerable groups in 
the financial sector. In 2017, KONFOP, a Moscow-
based confederation for consumer societies, 
conducted mystery shopping due to suspicions 
that insurance companies abused certain groups of 
customers when they purchased insurance policies 
to secure a loan such as a mortgage. It found 
significant discriminations against pregnant women, 
people with HIV, cancer patients, and people with 
disabilities. After KONFOP’s results were presented 
to the regulators, the Bank of Russia held meetings 
with insurance companies and in May 2019, the 
central bank issued basic standards that banned 
discrimination. KONFOP monitored the situation and 
found improvements. (KONFOP 2020)In Brazil, the Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do 
Consumidor (IDEC) is advocating for a bill that would 
provide fair debt restructuring for over-indebted 
customers (Leurent 2020).
The growing issue of data privacy is also recognized. 
In India, surveys by the 2018 Consumer Unity 
and Trust Society International (CUTS) with 2400 
consumers, including low-income groups without 
internet access, found that a large portion were 
uncomfortable sharing data. CUTS engaged with the 
regulator and used the survey data to comment on 
the draft Personal Data Protection Law (Consumers 
International 2021).
The rapid development of e-commerce brings with 
it the increased possibility of fraud. In Indonesia, 
the Indonesian Consumer Foundation (YLKI) 
pushed for stronger consumer protections by 
contributing to the 2016 drafting of an amendment 
to Law No. 11/2008 on Electronic Information 
and Transactions,a which now better protects 
consumers against abuses related to electronic 
transactions (GIZ 2019, GIZ 2020).

percent of governments surveyed in 2013 had obligations to fund consumer associations but 
only 33 percent did so (Consumers International 2013). In India, the Reserve Bank of India, 
prompted by CUTS, funds consumer association financial education activities through its 
Depositors Awareness Funds Program (unclaimed deposits of individuals in banks).
How can funders support consumer organizations to raise the collective voice  
of consumers?
Suggestions on how funders can adapt some of their internal systems and existing practices:
• International funders who conduct policy and regulatory diagnostics with regulators can 
systematically encourage engagement with consumer associations. For example, in financial 
consumer protection diagnostics of Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, the World Bank 
recommended that each government engage with consumer associations and provide 
support (World Bank 2014; 2012; 2015). The Asian Development Bank did the same in 
Mongolia (Giannetto, Gangi, and Altankhuyag 2019).
• International funders teams working on financial sector issues can explore with other 
colleagues how to bring in civil society and grassroots organizations that represent relevant 
consumer groups at the table when discussing financial consumer protection issues as well 
as financial sector reforms.
• Funders can facilitate relationships and trust between policy-makers, regulators and 
consumer associations.
• Funders who collaborate with standard-setting bodies can explore how consumer 
associations could play a more prominent role in helping regulators prevent potential 
systemic crises. 
Suggestions on specific programs to support consumer associations to influence regulations:
• Funders can strengthen the technical capacity of consumer associations to better identify 
financial sector issues affecting customers, and translate them into policy messages for 
regulators that can lead to change. In Russia for example, the World Bank provided some 
initial support to KONFOP for its mystery shopping. In Myanmar, USAID and GIZ9 have 
assisted the Myanmar Consumers Union (MCU) to better understand the main concerns of 
consumers with digital financial services using surveys and social media. 
• Consumer associations can benefit from funders’ support to develop sustainable financing 
strategies—a vital requirement for elevating the consumer voice. The GIZ project at the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has organized peer learning for on 
organizational development and financing through the emerging ASEAN Consumer 
Associations Network (ACAN). UNCTAD also has helped consumer associations develop 
long-term financing strategies.

REGULATORS To INTEGRATE 
CONSUMER VOICE INTo 
REGULATORY POLICYMAKING
CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS CAN ELEVATE THE COLLECTIVE 
consumer voice and bring together diffuse (and often weak) interests to strengthen 
engagement in policymaking. Engaging in rapidly evolving or complex financial 
policymaking, however, is an opportunity that most consumers or consumer representatives 
do not have. Regulators need to do more to reach and listen to consumer stakeholders, to help 
inform and drive policy goals designed to improve financial outcomes for them. This section 
discusses three channels for regulators to use to listen: (i) active outreach to meet consumers 
where they are, including through groups that represent them; (ii) public consultation; and 
(iii) formal structures to engage groups in dialogue. The focus is on formal structures such 
as consumer consultative bodies, as they provide the most promising opportunities to build 
permanent and effective channels for the collective voice. 
Building awareness and reaching stakeholders where they are.  Regulators serve the 
public, including providers and consumers. And though regulators may reach many through 
digital channels (see section below), they need to reach out and meet others where they 
are. Direct interactions between regulators and consumers provide valuable insights about 
their experiences, needs and challenges. For example, with the support of the German 
development agency GIZ, the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) established consumer 
relations halls (CRH) that offer free banking guidance and counseling services to those 
struggling with over-indebtedness.10 Through CRH consumer interactions, the PMA can 
identify and take regulatory actions to respond to problems facing consumers, e.g., delays in 9
BuIldINg m EcHaNISmS For r Egula TorS To INTE gra TE co NSumEr vo IcE INT o rEgula Tory pol Icymak INgissuing financial clearance, damaged cash in ATMs or not handing over incoming remittances 
in the requested currency.11 In another example, the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL), with the 
support of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), conducted regional consultative 
meetings with 535 participants including women market traders to discuss key provisions in 
the BSL ’s draft financial consumer protection guidelines and raise awareness about consumer 
rights and responsibilities. Challenges for regulators include securing funding for these efforts, 
reaching and tracking the most at-risk consumers, and systematically integrating information 
across the agency. 
Engaging in public consultation.  As interest in open and deliberative policymaking 
processes increases across the globe, stakeholder participation gains importance throughout 
the policymaking cycle (Johns and Saltane 2016). Through its Global Indicators of Regulatory 
Governance (GIRG) project, the World Bank (2018b) found that “138 out of 186 studied 
economies ministries or regulatory agencies request comments on proposed regulations.”12 
OECD (2012) suggests that governments use a “wide spectrum of consultation tools” and 
modes of consultation to ensure broad and diverse representation. The Government of India 
(2019), for example, used guided website and in-person stakeholder events to gather input 
for its public consultation on a data privacy bill. To encourage consumers and various groups 
to comment, the policy research institution Dvara developed a digital markup tool that made 
reviewing and commenting on the bill much easier.13 Yet challenges persist with reaching 
vulnerable stakeholders in low-income countries, especially if they are digitally disconnected. 
Creating formal consultative structures.  Consultative bodies set up to advise regulators 
are common in OECD countries. They vary depending on the mandate and the extent to 
which regulators identify and seek consultation from experts and stakeholders outside of 
government (OECD 2011). According to the Consumers International analysis, “in cases where 
regular connections are established between consumer advocates and regulatory bodies, 
consumer advocates perceive official structures as more influential” than ad hoc, informal 
meetings or communications (Consumers International 2021). Consultative bodies may be 
one of the most effective ways to engage groups and build a more knowledgeable and expert 
base that represents consumers in financial services policymaking. In its Good Practices for 
Financial Consumer Protection study, the World Bank (2017) advises that rulemaking follow 
a consultative process with stakeholders “either through permanent consultative groups or 
ad hoc consultation during each regulatory reform.” Yet desk research found no examples of 
financial sector consultative groups in low and middle-income countries. 
Those consultative bodies in the financial sector reviewed for this paper are typically 
established by legislation or by an agency; possess varying levels of funding for participation 
and/or research; perform advisory and liaison functions; specify membership and terms; and 
meet once or more per year. Their input may be formal, such as replies to rulemaking proposals 
from the group, public meetings, or informal discussions with agency executives behind

closed doors. Based on initial research and analysis, the following criteria help ensure councils 
effectively incorporate the collective voice into, and provide benefits to, regulatory decision-
making processes: 
• Broad consultation as a core principle  to ensure consumer perspectives are included 
early and throughout the regulatory policymaking process to help identify policy goals and 
assess whether those goals are being achieved.
• Funding of consumer-focused consultative bodies, consumer participation, and 
research  to ensure effective participation of, and research on, consumers. 
• A clear and transparent process  for engaging stakeholders, including defining, 
identifying and outreach to segments of the population that may be hard to reach or that 
regulators may not know well. 
• Systems are in place  that include formal and informal engagements, and insights are 
tracked across the regulatory agency to help identify early warning of problems, reduce 
implementation risks and gain demand-side market and regulatory insights. 
• Technology solutions are applied  when they add value, but the burden remains on 
regulators to ensure that consumers who are the beneficiaries of regulatory actions are 
effectively reached and their perspective included. 
Examples of consultative bodies raising the collective voice demonstrate some of their benefits. 
The European Commission’s Financial Services Users Group (EC FSUG) is composed of 20 
experts, including members who represent the interests of consumers, retail investors and 
micro-enterprises.14 Through research, opinions, and recommendations, it provides inputs and 
insights on risks facing consumers. Its opinion paper on irresponsible lending (FSUG 2019) 
has helped inform the revision of the Consumer Credit Directive (CCD) by highlighting the 
need for the CCD to further promote responsible lending and increase consumer protection. 
For example, the EC’s evaluation (EC 2020) cited FSUG’s paper in identifying continuing 
risks from short-term high-cost lending rollover practices and online data practices and its 
recommendations such as those related to the conduct of business rules for credit providers to 
ensure suitable sales and advice. 
Some consultative bodies specify that membership include representatives of specific 
segments of the population. Last year Australia’s Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), 
whose board includes four consumer groups,15 announced the establishment of a Consumer 
Advisory Panel (AFCA 2019). AFCA directed the panel to include members that represent 
older Australians, Indigenous and Torres Strait Islanders, vulnerable communities, and those 
experiencing financial difficulties. 
In women’s financial inclusion and economic empowerment, there is growing recognition that 
they should be more engaged in policymaking that affects them. “This is particularly the case

directly (UNCDF 2020).” Specifying their inclusion on regulatory bodies would help. For 
example, Zimbabwe’s recently-enacted consumer protection law, which includes five consumer 
association members on its 12-member Consumer Protection Commission, directs the Minister 
of Industry and Commerce to appoint a woman as either chair or vice chair, and “endeavor[s] to 
ensure” that half the appointed members are women (Republic of Zimbabwe 2019).
Challenges engaging consumers.  Assuming regulators are interested in creating a 
formal structure, their key challenge is to secure adequate funding for the structure and for 
consumer participation. According to the Consumers International survey of low and middle-
income countries, approximately 65% of responding associations said they were engaged 
in consultative structures in financial services, but only 6% indicated funding was available 
for participation (Consumers International 2021). Compensating under-resourced consumer 
groups for time engaged on councils is key to effective participation and building their BOX 2.  UK Financial Services Consumer Panel
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) uses an 
outcomes-driven market conduct approach. Its 
Financial Services Consumer Panel (FSCP) is 
an exemplary model for engaging the consumer 
perspective in regulatory policymaking.a The Panel’s 
success is attributed to providing adequate funding 
and support for members to participate; choosing 
individual members who bring relevant skills and 
expertise to the group and speak for (and about) 
vulnerable consumers; and early engagement in 
informal discussions with regulators.b The panel’s 
features include: 
• A legislative mandate that establishes “a general 
duty to consult” and an independent Consumer 
Panel.
• Membership that specifies “consumers, 
or persons who represent the interests of 
consumers.”• Early access to proposals and engagement with 
FCA experts and staff.
• Funding that compensates members for their 
work and for commissioning research. 
• A dedicated secretariat and staff that supports the

expertise.16 Specifying that membership include relevant consumer groups can help regulators 
gain insights about them and their experiences. 
How can funders support regulators to raise the collective voice of consumers? 
Suggestions on how funders can adapt some of their internal systems and existing practices:
• Bilateral and multilateral organizations could systematically include 1) consumer 
representatives in advising on the design of financial regulatory policymaking initiatives and 
2) demonstrated participation of such groups in their criteria and requirements for funding 
policy reforms. 
• Multilateral banks could advise financial regulators in the context of engagements related to 
policy reforms (e.g., Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAP), diagnostics) to create 
consumer consultative bodies, possibly using the experience from regulators that have such 
structures in place.
• Funders, with CGAP support, could share their experience and expertise on supporting 
effective mechanisms to include the perspective of consumers in financial regulatory 
policymaking, and disseminate findings internally.
Suggestions on specific programs to support regulatory mechanisms to enhance the 
collective voice:
• Support the development of financial sector consultative bodies and other stakeholder 
engagements, e.g., roundtable discussions at the country or regional level; identifying 
funding sources; technical assistance to identify funding models and best practices; and 
workshops to design, plan, and implement engagement strategies and councils in ways that 
include and enhance the representation of consumers.
• Funders can support the inclusion of women and representatives of other targeted groups in 
the development, governance and promotion of national financial inclusion strategies (NFIS) 
and connect such NFIS efforts to any financial sector consultative bodies.

(World Bank 2018a).LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY 
To ELEVATE THE  COLLECTIVE 
CONSUMER VOICE
AS INTERNET AND SMARTPHONE PENETRATION INCREASES 
globally, digital technologies represent a channel for policymakers to communicate with 
the public and an opportunity for consumers to make their collective voice heard.17 
Digital technologies that are ideal for capturing the voice of the consumer include: social 
media,18 supervisory technology (suptech)19 focused on social media monitoring, consumer 
portals on regulator websites, and third-party sites that assist consumers with reviews or 
complaints. Consumers should have confidence that their privacy and data are protected, 
particularly when regulators and consumer associations collect their data or speak on their 
behalf. However, 3.4 billion people, especially rural, poor, elderly people and women, live 
in mobile internet coverage areas but still do not use it (GSMA 2020b, Vosloo 2018). Other 
technologies, such as radio and interactive voice response (IVR) platforms, can also serve as 
important avenues to reach less digitally connected or literate populations. 
This section highlights social media usage, IVR, and suptech tools for social media monitoring, 
as promising technologies to elevate the collective consumer voice. 14
ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE CONSUMER VOICE IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
Social media offers great potential for direct engagement between consumers and 
policymakers. With 3.8 billion active social media users around the globe, social media use 
has increased in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs).20 Social media has 
changed the way consumers communicate and hold businesses accountable (Sprout 2017), 
with a similar push toward more open government to hold governments more accountable 
and responsive. The role of social media in promoting government transparency and 
strengthening interactions between citizens and policymakers also has been widely studied 
(e.g. Clarke and Margetts). Although active social media users are not typically representative 
of a country’s population,21 their perspectives can be useful to regulators because these users 
can be strong influencers in their communities. Moreover, the issues they raise may apply 
among a broad range of consumers or have an even greater impact on lower income, less 
visible segments. A few government agencies have begun to use social media messaging 
platforms or have developed their own mobile apps to engage the public—mainly around 
complaints. For example, Peru’s consumer protection authority Indecopi provides several 
ways for consumers to engage with the regulator, including an institutional WhatsApp channel 
(“Fiscalización ciudadana”) and an online “citizen report” that allows citizens to express 
concerns, complaints and dissatisfaction about providers. Consumers in Ghana can contact 
the Bank of Ghana’s Market Conduct Office via post, email, phone, or WhatsApp, the latter 
in response to the growing use of the social media platform in the country22. In its consumer 
protection role, the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce of Colombia developed a 
mobile app that allows consumers to lodge complaints related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Colombian Superintendence 2020). Bangladesh Bank also accepts consumer complaints 
related to banking services via its Android mobile app, BB Complaints.23
However, two key barriers currently diminish social media’s potential as a channel for 
engagement between consumers and policymakers. The first is that many government 
agencies have yet to confer legitimacy on the use of social media for public policy processes—
even though these platforms are a low-cost way for citizens to raise their voices on policy 
concerns, either individually or through consumer associations. Looking at the social media 
channels used by 15 EMDE financial authorities (typically Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), 
regulators were primarily using them as a one-way dissemination tool and engaging very 
little with consumers. Most regulators do not use social media channels to take consumer 
complaints (a few exceptions have been mentioned above). A second critical challenge is 
the need for government agencies to develop resources and capabilities for social media 
monitoring and analysis (see discussion of suptech, below). Due to these resource and capacity 
constraints, some government agencies have yet to take advantage of social media as a 
low-cost channel to reach a broad spectrum of consumers. For example, the Reserve Bank of 
20 Pew research conducted in 2015-2016 found that roughly 40 percent of surveyed adults across EMDEs said 
they used social networking sites – a figure that rose to 53 percent as of 2017 (Pew 2018a). Pew surveys also 
showed a gender gap in social media usage in some countries, with higher rates of men in EMDEs using it 
(Pew 2018b).
21 For example, according to Pew (2018a), it is the younger, more educated, and affluent sub-Saharan Africans 
that go online.
22 With 30 percent of the population using WhatsApp, it is the dominant social media platform in Ghana 
(Zurek 2019).
23 The BB Complaints app can be found at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bd.org.bb.cms15
lEvErag INg TE cHNology T o El EvaTE THE  coll EcTIvE coNS umEr vo IcEIndia does not have an official Facebook account, even though the country has over 260 million 
Facebook users. Without building capacity on this front it will be difficult for financial authorities 
to consider social media as a legitimate avenue for consumers to engage in public policy 
discussions.
Audio platforms can raise the voice of the digitally disconnected. While online social 
media use has increased in EMDEs, interactive voice response (IVR) technology is more easily 
accessible to poorer or illiterate consumers who may only have access to simple feature 
phones. The Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI) conducted an IVR pilot in Cambodia and later 
developed a note to explore how Financial Service Providers (FSPs) can use it to elevate client 
voice (Foelster and Kumari 2020; Kumari and Bansal 2020). 
The social enterprise Gram Vaani  developed Mobile Vaani , a mobile phone-based IVR platform 
akin to social media for consumers with limited or no access to the internet or digital technology 
(see Box 3, below). Its network reaches more than 2 million users in over 15 Indian states, as 
BOX 3.  Mobile Vaani: Social media for vulnerable individuals
• How does Mobile Vaania work? A user places 
a call to a Mobile Vaani number. The platform 
cuts off the call then calls back the user, making 
platform access cost-free. On these calls, the 
user can listen to audio content or record a 
message that other users can listen to after a 
manual moderation process.
• What content is on the platform? The platform 
has three types of content: (i) studio content that 
Gram Vaani creates as part of a campaign (e.g., 
agriculture, livelihood, health and sanitation); (ii) 
content recorded by volunteers, such as local 
news outlets; and (iii) user-generated content (e.g., 
grievances, reactions, experiences). The platform 
enables community members to answer each 
other’s questions, report local news, discuss 
news events, learn about government programs, 
understand various benefits and eligibility, etc. 
Audio recordings are in a local language.
• Who uses the platform? Typical users in rural 
areas are male (70 percent), in their 20s and 30s. 
Half work in agriculture while the remainder are 
service workers (e.g., education, healthcare). Users in urban areas mainly are interstate workers 
in the industrial sector, such as garment workers. 
Gram Vaani’s two platforms exclusively for women 
have experienced strong uptake from adolescent 
girls and young women aged 15 to 25.
Mobile Vaani in action
Gram Vaani launched a COVID-19 response 
network during India’s lockdown (Gram Vaani 
2020b). A user relates how it helped people 
receive government food rations: “‘I’m Prince from 
Jamalpur…. We recently received complaints on 
Mobile Vaani from citizens of Ward 31 that they 
are denied ration entitlements. Ration shop dealer 
Satish Sahu was taking citizen’s fingerprints (as 
proof of receiving ration) even while they had not 
been given ration for the last four months. The ward 
director and councilor Sanam Kumar and Bablu 
Paswan heard these complaints and ensured that 
the dealer went to each household and delivered 
the appropriate ration entitlements.’ In an interview 
with Prince, Kumar and Paswan said they will 
ensure that ration distribution happens seamlessly 
from now on and thanked Mobile Vaani for bringing 
this issue to their attention (Gram Vaani, 2020).”

well as parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Namibia, and South Africa. The model is supported by 
a large network of community volunteers that engage with local civil society organizations and 
local government to address issues raised by community members. While Mobile Vaani offers 
numerous benefits to vulnerable consumers, it also faces challenges. The platform needs to 
address the lower participation of women on general-use platforms as well as scalability of its 
community engagement model, which requires extensive partnership with local civil society 
organizations and volunteers.
Suptech: Social media monitoring to understand consumer experiences—a listening 
tool for financial authorities.  The Financial Stability Institute notes that suptech helps 
financial sector supervisors “achieve their objective of promoting trust by economic agents 
in financial institutions and markets. Suptech is likely to lead to supervision that can adapt 
more quickly in response to a constantly evolving environment” (Broeders and Prenio 2018). 
Monitoring social media and extracting relevant insights is a good example of suptech in 
practice.24 It can be a powerful market monitoring tool to allow financial sector regulators and 
supervisors to understand the experiences and concerns of financial customers in real-time. 
These insights would be an important data source for the financial authority’s risk analysis 
and supervisory functions. Box 4 (below) discusses a social media monitoring tool to protect 
consumers in Ireland and a complaints chatbot recently launched in the Philippines.
While some financial authorities are investing in suptech social media monitoring, these 
tools remain out of reach for many EMDE regulators and supervisors due to a lack of related 
technical capacity, resources and analytical tools. The Financial Stability Institute noted 
that “supervisory agencies have encountered various issues and challenges in the course 
of developing and using suptech applications. These include technical, data quality, legal, 
operational, reputational, resource, internal support and practical issues” (Broeders and Prenio 
2018). Suptech social media monitoring tools also can raise data privacy issues, depending on 
a country’s legal framework (Toronto Centre 2018). 
How can funders leverage technology to raise the collective voice of consumers?
Suggestions on how funders could adapt some of their internal systems and existing practices:
• Funders could share experiences with each other and expose their staff to different 
technologies that can be used to incorporate the collective voice through technology. 
• International funders working with regulators could strengthen the technical capacity of 
financial authorities and consumer associations to develop strategies on the effective use of 
social media. 
• Funders such as multilateral and regional development banks and bilateral agencies that 
work with regulators could provide support to speed up the acceptance of social media 
platforms as two-way communication channels. 
24 For more information on suptech more broadly, see FinCoNet’s latest report on suptech tools for market 
conduct supervisors (FinCoNet 2020) and the World Bank’s roadmap to suptech solutions for low-income 
countries (Appaya et al, 2020).17
lEvErag INg TE cHNology T o El EvaTE THE  coll EcTIvE coNS umEr vo IcESuggestions on specific programs to support technology solutions to raise the collective 
consumer voice:
• Provide grants for mechanisms that support financial supervisors or consumer protection 
authorities to develop and pilot social media monitoring suptech tools. For example, the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Omidyar Network and USAID funded the RegTech for 
Regulators Accelerator (R2A), a pilot initiative which partnered with central banks to develop 
suptech applications such as the BSP complaints chatbot in the Philippines.25
• Provide support to policymakers and consumer associations that wish to broaden access 
and engagement with a wider spectrum of consumers through various media channels, 
such as radio or IVR pilots. For example, the Mastercard Foundation supported the Center 
for Financial Inclusion’s Client Voices project in Cambodia to test the suitability of IVR as a 
cost-effective and scalable solution to understand risks faced by consumers.
25 Ideally, R2A’s successes would be embedded in an institution or through a mechanism that can continue to 
implement assistance with suptech tools in EMDE marketsBOX 4.  Suptech applications leverage social media
Ireland
The Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) monitors social 
media platforms, blogs, websites, and online 
forums in real time against a list of 50 key words. 
The monitoring tool also identifies public mentions 
of dissatisfaction with financial products, services 
or institutions. The data feeds into CBI’s broader 
reporting, risk analysis and supervision of individual 
financial institutions. In 2016, monitoring revealed an 
FSP that appeared to be operating as an unlicensed 
retail credit firm. CBI discovered that the FSP was 
using disposable email addresses and fake names 
and addresses, which led CBI to issue a warning 
and publish the firm’s name. The FSP was forced 
to cease operations as a result of actions to protect 
customers (Central Bank of Ireland, 2017).
Philippines
As part of the RegTech for Regulators Accelerator 
(R2A), the Philippine central bank, Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas (BSP), recently developed and launched a chatbot solution. Known as BSP’s Online Buddy 
or BOB, the chatbot allows consumers to file 
complaints via SMS, Facebook Messenger or 
through a webchat on the BSP website. BOB 
communicates in English and Tagalog, and uses 
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as 
machine learning and natural language processing to 
process complaints, directly respond or escalate to a 
call center that files complaints to a central database 
(di Castri, Grasser, and Kulenkampff 2018). BSP 
uses the data and insights gathered by the chatbot 
and other channels to detect market misconduct. 
Chatbot technology elevates the voice of financial 
customers by highlighting their experience. Soon 
after its launch, the BSP used data from BOB and 
other complaints data to feed into its policymaking 
process to develop regulation, leading to a 
memorandum for supervised FSPs on Sound Risk 
Management Practices to Mitigate Risks from Scams 
or Frauds.a

ELEVATING THE  COLLECTIVE CONSUMER VOICE IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
CONCLUSION
THE NEED TO RAISE THE COLLECTIVE VOICE IN THE REGULATORY 
arena is growing more urgent. A rapidly evolving digital financial services market and 
COVID-19 are accelerating both risks and opportunities. Including the consumers voice 
in regulatory processes increases the likelihood that risks (and their impact on consumers) are 
adequately captured and addressed by regulatory measures. Emerging success stories in the 
three areas discussed above provide ample evidence to justify additional research and pilots. 
Funders who work in financial inclusion, especially those who work at the policy level and/or 
with consumer organizations, can play a critical role by adapting their internal systems and by 
designing initiatives that enhance the collective voice. The table below summarizes a range of 
specific recommendations.
In general, funders may consider the importance of elevating the collective voice of consumers 
in their internal strategies to foster financial inclusion and civil society. When designing new 
financial regulation projects, funders may analyze different mechanisms available in the 
countries concerned to include the collective consumer voice in financial regulation. They could 
also coordinate their approaches and align them to include the collective voice. 
We hope this paper triggers new partnerships and initiatives to elevate the collective consumer 
voice in the financial sector. 19
