1 The FAO TERM PORTAL is available at: fao.org/faotermAGENCY 
The ability to make autonomous choices and transform those choices into desired outcomes. 
Five “expressions” of agency are: freedom from the risk of violence; access to and control over 
property; freedom of movement; decision-making over family formation (e.g family planning, 
divorce); ability to have voice and influence policy (FAO TERM1, under ‘Women’s Agency’).
COMMUNICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT (COMDEV)
A social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about 
seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, 
building policies, debating and learning or sustained and meaningful change. It is not public 
relations or corporate communication. (The Communication Initiative, FAO, and World Bank, 2007).
GENDER
The concept of gender needs to be understood clearly as a cross-cutting socio-cultural variable. 
It is an overarching variable in the sense that gender can also be applied to all other cross-cutting 
variables such as race, class, age, ethnic group, etc. Gender systems are established in different 
socio-cultural contexts which determine what is expected, allowed and valued in a woman/man 
and girl/boy in these specific contexts. Gender roles are learned through socialization processes; 
they are not fixed but are changeable. Gender systems are institutionalized through education 
systems, political and economic systems, legislation, and culture and traditions. In utilizing a gender 
approach the focus is not on individual women and men but on the system which determines 
gender roles / responsibilities, access to and control over resources, and decision-making potentials. 
It is also important to emphasize that the concept of gender is not interchangeable with women. 
Gender refers to both women and men, and the relations between them. Promotion of gender 
equality should concern and engage men as well as women. (OSAGI, 2001)
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT)
ICT includes any device, tool, or application that permits the exchange or collection of data 
through interaction or transmission. ICT is an umbrella term that includes anything ranging from 
radio to satellite imagery to mobile phones or electronic money transfers. (World Bank, 2017).
“Strategic resources for pre-industrial societies were raw materials and financial resources,  
the strategic resource for post-industrial society is information.”
-Delegate of Malawi to the High-Level Consultation on Rural Women and Information (FAO, 2000, p.6)viii
Note for readers
INFORMATION SOCIETY
A concept that responds to the expansion and ubiquity of information. The term has been in use 
since the 1970s, but has gained in popularity and is now widely used in social and political policy. 
Sustained and accelerated growth of media, of education provision and participation, as well 
as computer communications technologies has led many to posit that the attendant information 
explosion distinguishes a new epoch. The information society is one in which information is the 
defining feature, unlike the industrial society where steam power and fossil fuels were distinguishing 
elements. (Oxford Reference, n.d.)
NEW ICTS
Term used in this paper to distinguish digital ICTs developed in recent decades (e.g. mobile phones, 
personal computers, the Internet) from the full range of ICTs. 
WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT
The empowerment of women concerns women gaining power and control over their own lives. 
It involves awareness-raising, building self-confidence, expansion of choices, increased access to 
and control over resources and actions to transform the structures and institutions which reinforce 
and perpetuate gender discrimination and inequality. The process of empowerment is as important 
as the goal. Empowerment comes from within; women empower themselves. Inputs to promote 
the empowerment of women should facilitate women’s articulation of their needs and priorities 
and a more active role in promoting these interests and needs. Empowerment of women cannot 
be achieved in a vacuum; men must be brought along in the process of change. (OSAGI, 2001)1Introduction  
Why a paper on gender and ICTs?
 
Information and communication have always been central to people’s lives and livelihoods. 
However, the effects of accelerated technological progress in recent decades have led many 
to argue that the current age is now defined by information. Advances in information and 
communication technologies (ICTs) have made enormous quantities of information available 
to more people than ever before. These advances have also substantially increased the 
capacity of people all over the world to connect with each other in a continuously expanding 
number of ways. This has triggered an explosion in the production of new information and 
the proliferation of new modes of communication. Other leaps in technological capacities 
are leading to greater mechanisation and automation across many sectors, and are having 
a profound impact on the lives and livelihoods of people worldwide. ICTs are becoming 
increasingly central to social, cultural, economic and political life. The ability to access and 
make use of these resources often marks the difference between those who thrive and those 
who are left behind. For this reason, ICTs should be considered as an inherent need and even 
a right of all people living within the sphere of influence of the ‘information society’. 
Rural women and men in developing and least developed countries (LDCs) have been 
deeply affected by the socio-economic and political shifts that have accompanied the 
global rise of information. However, they have the lowest levels of access to ICTs, and they 
mostly remain an afterthought in ICT policy and private sector outreach. Interventions that do 
target rural areas in the application of ICTs for development (ICT4D) rarely approach the issue 
from the perspective of rural people’s own priorities, needs and preferences. 
Rural women in particular are currently (and have always been) last in line in terms of ICT 
access and use, even though women stand more to gain than most from active participation 
and engagement with these resources. In addition to the numerous material and social 
constraints they face to ICT adoption, they are also hindered from inclusion in the information 
society by environmental factors. Evidence suggests that the ICT sector is both urban- and 
male-centric, ranging from the design of ICTs to the gender of sector employees and decision-
makers. Representation in the media is also predominantly male. Men both report and are at 
the centre of most news stories, especially those related to technology, agriculture and rural 
development, and economy. 
The aim of this paper is to bring rural communities, and women and other marginalized 
groups in particular, back into the centre of conversations on ICTs and ICT4D. Part I reviews 
the available information on the nature and extent of the digital divide and highlights the 
perspectives of rural women and men on issues of importance to them (Chapters 2 and 3). 
Part I also provides a survey of relevant FAO work in support of rural women and men, and the 
key international agreements and events from recent decades that have set the context and 
provide the impetus for adopting inclusive approaches to ICT4D (Chapter 4). Part II focuses 
on the actions that need to be taken to ensure that the information society, and global 
development efforts in general, are inclusive and sustainable (Chapters 5 and 6).

17°16° 18° 17°PART I: OVERVIEW3Measuring the digital divide: where 
do rural women and men stand?
Due to the multifaceted and rapidly evolving nature of new ICTs, it can be difficult to gain a clear 
picture of the challenges and opportunities created by these technologies in rural development 
contexts. Internet and mobile technologies have seen unprecedented rates of adoption since 
their introduction (see Figure 1). The rapid pace of technological development in recent years 
makes for a constantly evolving landscape. According to the 2016 World Development Report :
More households in developing countries own a mobile phone than have access to electricity or 
clean water, and nearly 70 percent of the bottom fifth of the population in developing countries 
own a mobile phone. The number of internet users has more than tripled in a decade—from 1 
billion in 2005 to an estimated 3.2 billion at the end of 2015. (World Bank, 2016, p.2) 
Figure 1: Digital technologies are spreading rapidly in developing countries
Source: World Bank, 2016
These figures suggest that the spread of new ICTs has been so fast that it has actually outpaced 
development in many countries. In fact, Internet use around the world is currently more evenly 
distributed than income (World Bank, 2016). 
This state of affairs represents the crux of the current challenge in using ICTs to promote inclusive 
development. ICTs can serve as powerful tools to enable economic and social development, 
and they hold enormous potential to empower rural men and women. However, because these 
technologies are valuable resources in themselves, their level of adoption is likely to reflect (and may 
even exacerbate) existing inequities in society. Disadvantaged members of society are likely to face 
similar barriers in accessing and using ICTs to those they face in accessing other essential resources. 
The global data reviewed throughout this chapter appear to confirm this hypothesis. The data 
suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to the role of sociocultural and economic 
inequalities in determining the spread and impact of ICTs. Section 2.1 provides quantitative 
information on the size and scope of the existing gap in the ability to access and make meaningful 
use of ICTs. The remaining sections review available data on global trends for a number of factors 
such as the design of ICTs, the relevant policy context, and the media environment, all of which 
play a significant role in reducing or reinforcing existing barriers.

“Probably the four most important characteristics contributing to radio’s success  
as a medium for development are: (1) its pervasiveness, (2) its local nature,  
(3) the fact that it is an oral medium, and (4) its ability to involve communities  
and individuals in an interactive social communication process.”
(FAO, 2003e, p. 8)
“Even when countries appear to have a small gender gap or no gender gap at all,  
deeper analysis can reveal higher gender gaps among certain areas of the country  
or age groups. In Morocco, for instance, the average country-wide gender gap of  
4 per cent in mobile phone ownership is predominantly driven by rural areas,  
where women are 12 per cent less likely to own a mobile phone than men.  
In urban areas, men and women have a similar level of mobile ownership.”
(GSMA, 2016)
452.1 Who is accessing and using ICTs?
In the last five years, mobile broadband subscriptions have increased by more than 20 percent per 
year. Yet there are still half as many mobile broadband subscriptions in developing countries as 
there are in developed countries, while in LDCs, this proportion shrinks to one-quarter (ITU, 2017a). 
More than half of the world’s population is offline. Non-users reside overwhelmingly in the Global 
South. In 2016, three-quarters of Africa’s population was offline. In the Arab States and Asia and 
the Pacific, close to 60 percent of the population was not using the Internet (ITU, 2016a). Within 
countries, disparities in mobile phone usage have decreased between income categories and 
urban and rural populations, but the gap has actually increased with respect to Internet adoption 
(World Bank, 2016; ITU, 2016b). In 2016, mobile-broadband networks (3G or above) were reaching 
84 percent of the global population, but only 67 percent of the rural population (ITU, 2016a). 
Gender disparities in ICT adoption appear to reflect a similar pattern. With very few exceptions, 
women in developing countries and LDCs are less likely than men to use digital technologies, and 
are even less likely to own them (ITU, 2017a; World Bank, 2016; ITU, 2016b; GSMA, 2015). Worldwide, 
the gap between male and female Internet users is 12 percent. In less developed regions, this gap 
widens significantly, reaching 33 percent in LDCs (ITU, 2017a; See Figure 2). 
The trend towards a larger gender gap in lower-income and less connected countries is also present 
for mobile phone ownership and use (ITU, 2016b). According to the 2015 report by the GSM Association 
(GSMA), “over 1.7 billion females in low- and middle-income countries do not own mobile phones”. The 
global gender gap for mobile phone ownership, which stands at 14 percent, varies significantly by region, 
rising to 38 percent in South Asia (GSMA, 2015). Even when women do own phones, they use them less 
often than men, and access fewer services beyond voice communication (e.g. messaging and mobile 
Internet). In India, rural women are 50 percent less likely than men to use IP messaging services, such as 
WhatsApp (GSMA, 2015, 2016). Borrowing and phone sharing is common in many lower-income areas, 
especially among women. This practice can provide certain benefits to women who cannot afford a 
phone, but it also limits their ability to develop technical literacy and use services that require a greater 
degree of privacy (GSMA, 2015). One study conducted in rural communities across India found that 
owning a mobile phone significantly increased the likelihood of users being capable of operating a 
mobile phone. Borrowers, on the other hand, frequently required assistance (Rathinam, 2015).
A note on radio
Radio is among the most ubiquitous ICTs. In 2012, at least 75 percent of households in developing 
countries had access to a radio (UNESCO, 2013). In developed countries, access to radio was 
close to 100 percent around the same time period (Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, 
2014). In some contexts, the advent of new ICTs has made access to radio less relevant, but in 
others it has maintained or even increased its importance. 
In rural areas where there is no electricity and new ICTs remain unaffordable for most people, radio 
often remains the most relevant ICT (Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, 2014). In the 
first half of the 2000s, for example, only 10 percent of rural households in sub-Saharan Africa had 
electricity, but 51 percent had radios (ITU, 2008). During the same time period, the region saw local 
commercial radio grow by approximately 360 percent and community radio grow by about 1 386 
percent (UNESCO, 2013). Given that, in 2017, Africa remains the continent with the lowest proportion 
of households connected to the Internet and the highest gender gap in Internet access (ITU, 2017a), 
it is perhaps not surprising that radio has remained an important source of information and a key 
means of community engagement and empowerment for many rural women and men.2 
2 See for example: FRI, 2011; UNESCO, 2013; Fombad and Jiyane, 2016.6It is worth noting that radio and new ICTs are not mutually exclusive technologies, but rather 
potentially mutually reinforcing tools for development. Radio integrates well with other ICTs. 
Many mobile phone owners use their handsets to tune in to and interact with radio programmes. 
Community radio has successfully been used to introduce rural communities to the Internet 
and provide them with access to online content in local languages. In rural areas especially, 
community radio has been particularly effective in promoting inclusive dialogue and debate, 
particularly when used in combination with other media and traditional communication formats 
(FAO, 2014; UNESCO, 2013; Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, 2014).
2.2 Who is designing new ICTs?
In 2017, the technology industry remains dominated by men. Figures from some of the top 
companies3 in the industry show that women make up around one-quarter to one-third 
of employees, and only 16 to 23 percent of technical staff. Globally, only 6 percent of the 
developers of applications are female. The percentage of Sector Members of the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) with female chief executive officers is around 8.7 percent, and 
the percentage with female chief technical officers/chief information officers is 6.2 percent (ITU, 
2017b). At the regional level, there are some noteworthy deviations from broader industry trends. 
For example, only about 10 percent of the world’s internet entrepreneurs are women, but this 
figure may rise to as high as 35 percent in the Arab world (The Economist, 2013).
The overall lack of women working in technology sector remains a significant cause for concern. 
Devices and applications designed by men tend to be less responsive to women’s priorities 
and needs, and in some cases, can actually discourage women from using them or even raise 
safety issues. For example, early versions of voice recognition software were frequently unable 
to recognize female voices because none of the male developers had thought to perform tests 
with women users (Kleinman, 2016). One study conducted by the American Medical Association 
found that four of the most widely used virtual assistants were effective at providing help to 
address crises, such as a heart attack or even thoughts of suicide. These same assistants, however, 
failed to recognize sexual assault or domestic abuse, responding “I don’t know what that is” when 
prompted (Chemaly, 2016)4. A report by the United Nations Division for the Advancement of 
Women (UNDAW) and UNESCO based on research on gender and user experience (Schroeder, 
2010) concluded that:
The basic premises for developing advanced electronic products, like a TV, a hi-fi- system, 
a mobile phone or a GPS, seem to a large degree to be dominated by male thinking. The 
values that drive the basic specifications, features and the interaction design for these kinds 
of products […] scarcely reflect female values, preferences and life style. Therefore these 
products are not as attractive and useful for the female users as they could be. The value 
proposition of the technology which could enhance women’s lives does not fulfill its potential. 
(p. 2) 
ICT development has so far been largely driven by urban perspectives and concerns. With few 
exceptions, little effort has been made to respond to the needs and priorities of people living in 
rural communities. As a result, rural women are even less likely than their urban counterparts to 
engage with ICT solutions designed with them in mind.

4  For more on the issues inherent to technology products designed for and by men, see; Swanson and Keller, 2000; Morrison, 
2016. For information on how technology can be designed with women in mind, see Schroeder, 2010 and the Design-
People web site at: www.design-people.com/inspired-by-women.72.3 Are sector policies addressing the gender gap in ICT access and use? 
Who is involved in relevant decision-making and regulatory processes?
Policies that take gender and other social dimensions of vulnerability into account are key to 
bridging the gap between rural women and men (and rural and urban communities) in the ability 
to benefit equally from ICTs (Broadband Commission for Digital Development, 2013, 2017; UNECA, 
2010). However, the integration of gender, ICTs and rural development into sector policies and 
strategies remains a significant challenge.
A growing number of countries are integrating gender equality concerns into their agriculture 
sector policies. Very few of these countries have also worked out ICT priorities for the sector 
(although see Chapter 4 for information on recent FAO work in the Asia and the Pacific region on 
developing E-agriculture policies). According to a 2017 report by the Broadband Commission for 
Sustainable Development Working Group on the Digital Gender Divide, gender-related policies 
and ICT policies have frequently remained completely disconnected from each other. Gender 
polices fail to acknowledge the relevance of ICTs as enabling tools, and ICT policies overlook the 
gender dimension of ICT access and use (Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, 
2017)5. Data from the World Wide Web Foundation’s 2014 Web Index confirms this: 
Policy actions to assess and overcome the gender gap have been sluggish. Only 30 percent of the 
Web Index countries score higher than a five for implementing concrete targets for gender equity 
in ICT access and use (see Box 1 for scoring criteria). Almost all of them are high-income countries 
that have already achieved high levels of gender parity in other spheres of life (World Wide Web 
Foundation, 2014, p.14).
More recent data focusing exclusively on low- and middle-income countries paint an even 
bleaker picture. In 2016, an expert survey of 58 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and 
the Caribbean revealed that countries across all three regions are failing to address the digital 
gender gap in their ICT policies. The average score for countries was 2.73 out of 10. Only six out of 
58 countries scored as high as 5 (see Box 1). Not a single country scored higher than a five or had 
any measurable targets for improving women’s access and use as part of a national ICT policy or 
strategy (World Wide Web Foundation and A4AI, 2017).
5  “Stakeholders have often neglected to develop adequate or holistic strategies that ensure gender equality in ICTs. 
Gender-related policies, strategies and action plans frequently fail to acknowledge the importance of ICTs and 
broadband as enabling tools and are often disconnected from ICT-related policies. At the same time, strategies, 
policies and plans aimed at promoting broadband adoption and access often do not have a gender dimension and 
fail to address women’s needs, circumstances, capabilities and preferences.” (Broadband Commission for Sustainable 
Development, 2017, p.23). Box 1: Web Index benchmark criteria for gender targets in ICT policy

Source: World Wide Web Foundation, 20168The low proportion (and in some cases, near absence) of women in high-level ICT-related processes 
is equally worrying. Out of 193 ITU Member States, only 22 have female ICT ministers, and only 12 out 
of 164 independent regulators are headed by women. Current female participation in ITU world 
conferences and governing bodies has increased to 25 percent from 19 percent in 2015. However, 
the proportion of women who serve as chairs or vice-chairs of ITU study groups remains low, at 6 
percent (ITU, 2017b). 
2.4 Who is telling the story, and what story is being told?
Narrative matters. The stories that are told by and about women in the media play a significant role 
in creating the socio-cultural context that informs gender roles and helps to determine women’s 
access to and use of valuable resources, such as ICTs. 
A 2015 report by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) found that women “make up only 
24 percent of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news” 
(GMMP, 2015, p.8). An even smaller proportion (10 percent) are the focus of stories; a figure that has 
held steady since the year 2000. Women make up only one-fifth of the depictions of workers in the 
formal labour force. Among the different thematic areas of news reporting, economic news is the 
least likely to focus on women. Women are much likelier to be portrayed as stay-at-home parents 
(67 percent) or sex workers (50 percent) than as agricultural workers (14 percent) or technology-
related professionals (10 percent). 
Only 20 percent of stories on the topic of ‘rural economy, agriculture, farming, land rights’ and 
25 percent of stories on the topic ‘science, technology, research, discoveries’ include women 
as subjects. Among stories on these topics, only 6 and 7 percent respectively actually include 
women as a central focus of the story or raise issues of gender equality/inequality. ‘Rural economy, 
agriculture, farming, land rights’ is also among the top ten types of stories that are least likely to be 
reported by women.
The report presented several noteworthy findings about female reporters’ voices on the radio and 
online. Women make up 41 percent of news reporters on the radio, a greater proportion than in other 
traditional media, and they report 42 percent of online news. Stories by female journalists are likelier 
to include female subjects than stories by male reporters. The gender difference in the selection of 
sources and subjects is even more pronounced online, with women included in 33 percent of stories 
by female reporters and only 23 percent of stories by male reporters (GMMP, 2015). 
“From the beginning of time, technology has been a key element in the growth 
and development of societies… But technology is more than jets and computers;  
it is the combination of knowledge, techniques and concepts; it is tools and machines,  
farms and factories. It is organization, processes and people. The cultural, historical  
and organizational context in which technology is developed and applied  
is the key to its success or failure.”
(Smillie, 1991, p.3)9Understanding the digital divide: 
ICTs, communication and gender in 
the context of rural development
The issue of rural connectivity is often described in terms of the ‘special challenges’ it presents. This 
narrative belies an underlying but persistent habit of thinking about technology in rural contexts as 
‘distinct from’ or ‘less than’ an imagined urban norm. FAO recognized this trend as early as 1998 in 
the publication, The First Mile of Connectivity  (Richardson and Paisley, eds., 1998):
For many years, people working to enhance telecommunication infrastructure and applications 
have referred to rural communities as being at the “last mile of connectivity.” The concept of the 
“last mile” carries a lot of negative connotations and compels us to assume the perspective of 
an urbanite looking down at the rural margins. (p.2)
… from the perspective of someone living and working in a rural area, we must change our 
language to reflect the need for a more progressive and aggressive way of characterizing the 
need for improvements in rural telecommunication systems around the world. [Titus Moetsabi] was 
the first to coin the term “First Mile of Connectivity” to challenge the prevailing notions that rural 
people, rural communities and rural infrastructure are always backward and always last. (p. iii)
In the context of ‘first mile’ thinking, the true obstacle to achieving equitable access and meaningful 
use of ICTs for rural women and men “is not technical or financial, but political and ideological” 
(Richardson and Paisley, eds., 1998, p.2). The responsibility lies with urban-centric governments, 
as well as private sector and development actors, to shift their perspective in both discourse and 
practice to reflect the priorities and agency of rural people. The fact that almost twenty years 
later, many of the constraints to rural development and connectivity identified in The First Mile of 
Connectivity still persist suggests that the challenge remains to be fully taken up. 
For rural women, the imperative to shift perspective when promoting equitable access to and use 
of ICTs is especially strong. Rural women face the same type of marginalization experienced by 
rural people in general. However, rural women are also usually an afterthought in the discourse, 
technical design and policies related to ICT and development (see Chapter 2). Like all other 
individuals, rural women have valuable information and knowledge to contribute. They have 
unique priorities that shape their decision-making processes, and context-specific constraints 
they must address. Like all other economic actors, rural women are consumers with preferences 
that influence their spending behaviour and choices. To close the digital divide, it is necessary for 
governments, development actors and the private sector to acknowledge rural women’s agency 
and begin viewing them as more than passive recipients of aid and/or consumer products.3
10This chapter aims to support the shift in perspective toward gender-sensitive, rural-centric thinking in rural 
development initiatives related to ICTs. Section 3.1 reviews several key ways in which the experiences 
and viewpoints of people living in rural areas may differ from those of urban populations. Section 3.2 
uses a selection of qualitative studies from different regions to show how contextual information can 
provide a fuller understanding of how rural women and men are (or are not) engaging with ICTs. Both 
sections in this chapter should be read as starting points in a conversation rather than as a complete 
list of relevant factors to take into account in ICT4D interventions. It should be also be noted that the 
kind of ‘global’ information presented here cannot in any way replace localized information gathered 
through participatory processes in the design and implementation of interventions. 
3.1 Specificities of the rural context in developing countries 
In rural contexts, agriculture, income, food security and nutrition, family and community dynamics 
are all inextricably bound up with each other in shaping the character of daily life. The interaction 
among these factors influences all aspects of rural people’s decisions to engage (or not) with 
ICTs, ranging from whether to spend money on ICT ownership and access and how much, to who 
should be using ICTs and how. The sections below discuss three important aspects of life in rural 
areas that can affect decision-making and behaviour related to ICTs.
Smallholders in developing countries face major environmental and structural barriers
Agriculture is central to rural livelihoods. Approximately two-thirds of the developing world’s three billion 
rural people live in small farm households. Family farms make up the vast majority of farms worldwide 
(FAO, 2015b; Graeub et al., 2016). Smallholders are similar to other entrepreneurs in many senses: 
They raise capital from multiple sources and invest in productive assets... They make decisions 
and take both risks and profits. And agriculture involves many decisions: What to plant, which 
inputs to use and how, when to plow, to seed, to harvest; how much to keep for consumption 
in the household and how much to sell to raise cash, or how much to store. (FAO, 2015b. p. 1)
On the other hand, smallholders also differ from other entrepreneurs in a number of important ways 
that affect both the functioning of the rural economy and the way rural people engage with ICTs. 
Smallholders are generally the primary investors in their own farms. It could be argued that they 
are “the largest component of private sector investment in agriculture”, though they are rarely 
acknowledged as such (FAO, 2014). Yet as investors, smallholders operate under challenging 
conditions. They run their businesses and decide how to invest their resources in circumstances of high 
risks (e.g. market and weather instability) and usually in the face of enormous constraints (e.g. lack 
of services, limited infrastructure, and/or political instability). Perhaps most importantly, smallholders 
usually take on these challenges in the midst of poverty, which is overwhelmingly concentrated 
in rural areas. Over three-quarters of the world’s poor are rural people, and 65 percent of poor 
working adults earn a living through agriculture (Castaneda et al., 2016; FAO, 2017e). Due to limited 
resources, smallholders earn a smaller proportion of their income from agricultural production than 
larger farming households, and must rely on a combination of sources of income (e.g. agricultural 
labour, labour in the non-farm sector, transfers and remittances) (FAO, 2015b). 
“In South Asia and the Philippines, family farmers spend more than 25 percent of their monthly household 
incomes on mobile telephony usage, while African family farmers spend between 11 and 27 percent. All of these 
rates far exceed the International Telecommunication Union’s widely accepted accessibility-cost benchmark of 
five percent of monthly income. These studies indicate that family farmers are diverting their limited household 
incomes away from basic needs, such as food and school expenses for their children.”
(FAO, 2014, p.39) 11These constraints have a profound influence on the rural economy. Smallholder households 
spend a large proportion of their budget on food (e.g. up to 81 percent in the United Republic of 
Tanzania). Often, very little money is left for other expenditures. Decisions about how to allocate 
limited time and resources therefore involve high stakes and have important consequences for 
rural livelihoods (FAO, 2015b). As a result, expenditures related to ICTs end up competing with 
other basic needs, such as housing, utilities, or education. ICT-related expenditures can represent 
a threat to food security if over-prioritized. Several female respondents in the studies discussed in 
Section 3.2 mentioned that, for them, the choice often came down to spending on ICT-related 
products and services or food. 
Gender inequality is a significant constraint in rural areas 
Women make important contributions to the agricultural sector as 
labourers, farmers and entrepreneurs. In developing countries, they 
make up 43 percent of the agricultural labour force6 and produce 
60 to 80 percent of the food (FAO, 2011a; World Bank, FAO and 
IFAD, 2009). However, rural women face systemic gender-based 
constraints that both inhibit their empowerment and negatively 
affect overall agricultural productivity and rural development. On 
the whole, rural women have less access to productive resources, 
services and opportunities, including education and agricultural 
information. They operate smaller farms, use fewer inputs, and keep 
fewer and smaller livestock than men. Women often work as unpaid 
family labourers, and when they are employed, they are more likely 
to have low-paying jobs and be paid lower wages for the same 
work as men. Furthermore, rural women disproportionately carry the 
burden of household work and time-consuming manual labour, which limits both their mobility and 
the free time they have available to pursue other activities, such as training or social networking 
(FAO, 2011a). These constraints limit women’s available income and their capacity, time and 
opportunities to access and actively engage with ICTs.
Cultural norms about gender roles both explicitly and implicitly inhibit rural women’s agency. 
In addition to establishing the material constraints discussed above, norms about appropriate 
behaviour and legitimate use of ICTs for women often limit their ability to access valuable ICT-
based content and services (for examples of this, see Section 3.2). A widespread association 
between men and technology also means that technological solutions, including ICTs, are usually 
developed and marketed with men’s priorities and concerns in mind rather than with a focus 
on user-friendliness or labour-saving potential for women. Finally, although the power dynamics 
within rural households can vary greatly from region to region, and even from home to home, a 
gendered dimension to decision-making is almost always present. For example, ideas about men’s 
role as farmers and household heads tend to favour men in terms of bargaining power and control 
over other household members’ income. As a result, men often are the primary decision-makers 
with respect to important financial decisions, including purchases related to ICTs. 
6  The actual proportion of women doing agricultural work is likely much higher. Women’s roles as farmers and producers in 
many parts of the world remain largely unrecognized and underreported, including by women themselves, who frequently 
identify as “just housewives” even when they are performing the majority of agricultural work in a household. Furthermore, 
growing numbers of women in many regions are being left to shoulder the burden of agricultural work as men seek 
income-generating opportunities in other sectors, often migrating to cities for extended periods of time, a phenomenon 
known as the “feminization of agriculture”. (World Bank, FAO and IFAD 2009).“Modern ICTs are not neutral carriers 
of information and communication. 
They are embedded in socio-cultural 
contexts that can aggravate existing 
social exclusion and further deny some 
family farmers, especially women, their 
rights to health, education, employment, 
security, and political participation.”
(FAO, 2014, p.12)12Local values and networks influence adoption of ICTs  
Farmers conduct business and manage knowledge locally. They stimulate the rural economy (both 
farm and non-farm) by spending close to 80 percent of their income on local goods and services. 
They also create employment opportunities for landless neighbours when they hire agricultural 
labour (FAO, 2014). Smallholder producers usually rely upon family and exchange labour to ensure 
the viability of their farms. The most impoverished rural people are heavily dependent upon strong 
kinship ties and community support mechanisms for survival, especially in times of crisis. The high 
levels of interdependence among people living in rural areas often places a strong emphasis on 
collective values (see Box 2 for an example), which have an important influence on decision-
making at all levels (individual, household, community) and on norms for appropriate behaviour. 
In areas where institutions are weak or unreliable, trust and established relationships often take 
precedence for farmers in obtaining information and conducting important transactions (e.g. 
purchasing inputs, selling goods, or obtaining loans). For example, farmers frequently opt to borrow 
informally from known local lenders rather than from formal institutions, even though the terms of 
informal loans are rarely the most convenient financial option (World Bank, 2017). Younger actors 
in the agriculture sector are likelier to see the Internet as a place to find trusted information. Many 
older farmers may favour word-of-mouth or locally produced information from trusted sources over 
official information channels when gathering agricultural information, such as when and how to 
plant, or whom to sell to. This preference is also shaped by the fact that official channels are less 
likely to cater to farmers’ interests and needs with relevant local information that is presented in a 
format and language these farmers can understand. The tendency to gather information within 
existing networks also extends beyond agriculture into most other areas of rural life, including other 
opportunities for generating income, health information, and information relating to government 
benefits and programmes. 
Factors such as trust, personal networks, and community values and norms are all likely to shape 
rural women and men’s engagement with ICTs. The studies reviewed in Section 3.2 below provide 
several examples of how the factors discussed throughout this section can influence rural users’ 
motivations for using ICTs, the type of content they choose to access, and the barriers they face in 
accessing, using and owning ICTs.Box 2: For the Aymara, there is no development without healthy social relations
The excerpt below is taken from the 2015 publication,  Development as freedom in a digital age: Experiences of the rural 
poor in Bolivia  by Björn-Sören Gigler. The excerpt illustrates the centrality of local networks and community values 
in many rural contexts. For the Aymara of Bolivia, who describe themselves as marginalized and forgotten by the 
central government, wealth is measured not in economic terms, but rather in social terms:
Community leaders frequently define development as a process by which individuals and the 
community reach a state of  allin qausay or suma qamana—the Aymara and Quechua concept of  living 
well. Central to this concept are the social relations a person maintains with his or her family and 
community, as well as the overall relationship between humans and nature. According to this 
worldview, a person reaches a situation of “well-being” when she or he lives in peace and harmony 
with family members, the community, and the natural surroundings […]. For the Aymara, the concept 
of poverty has a different meaning than the income-centered Western concept, so that a person is 
considered poor when he or she no longer has social relations with his or her family and community 
or has lost spiritual contact with the natural environment. Considerable emphasis is placed on the 
interrelationships between the individual, the community, and the environment. In Aymara “to be 
poor” is  wajch’äta , literally translated as “to be orphaned.” This concept stresses the importance of 
kinship, social relations, and belonging to a community, whereby material aspects of poverty are 
inconsequential.”(Gigler, 2015, p. 293). 133.2 How are rural women and men engaging with new ICTs? What 
barriers to adoption do they face?
According to the GSMA (2015), the top five barriers preventing women from owning and using 
mobile phones are: cost; network quality and coverage; security and harassment; technical 
literacy and confidence; and operator and agent trust. The GSMA suggests that addressing these 
constraints would significantly reduce the gender gap in mobile phone ownership and usage, also 
acknowledges that the gender gap is “driven by a complex set of socio-economic and cultural 
barriers” (GSMA, 2015, p.7). 
As discussed in Section 3.1, local gender norms and existing disparities between men and women and 
urban and rural people, can significantly influence the ways in which rural women and men engage 
with technologies and experience barriers to access and use. This section will explore aspects of ICT 
access and use in rural areas, and the gender digital divide and its consequences for rural women in 
Latin America, Africa and Asia. It will review qualitative information from four studies:
• Development as freedom in a digital age: Experiences of the rural poor in Bolivia by Björn-Sören 
Gigler. This 2015 publication, which is based on field research conducted by Gigler, explores the 
opportunities and challenges faced by rural indigenous communities in adopting ICTs. The sections 
below will focus especially on findings from Chapter 8 of the book, Enacting and Interpreting 
Technology: Experiences of Aymara women with ICTs, which focuses on the experiences of rural 
Aymara women who received ICT training from a local grassroots organization. 
• Internet use barriers and user strategies: Perspectives from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa 
and Rwanda by Chenai Chair. This 2017 study reviews the results of a multicountry study 
commissioned by the Mozilla Foundation on the challenges that must be met to overcome 
digital inequality. The results are based on focus group discussions conducted with women 
and men in urban, peri-urban, rural, and ‘deep rural’ areas of each of the four countries.
• Use of mobile phones by the rural poor: Gender perspectives from selected Asian countries. This 2016 
report, published by FAO, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and LIRNEasia,  
reviews findings from two studies. The first is a 2011 study examining the digital gender divide among 
the poor in urban and rural areas in six countries: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, 
and Thailand. The second study provides greater context to the results of the first study through focus 
group discussions conducted with men and women in Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
• Mobile phones, gendered poverty and inequality: Experiences from four districts in rural India 
by Usharani Rathinam. This PhD dissertation from 2015 documents the experiences of women 
and men with mobile phones rural India. It includes case studies conducted in four districts: 
Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh) and Tikamgarh (Madhya Pradesh) in the northern part of the country, 
and Anantapur (Andhra Pradesh) and Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu) in the south. 
Box 3: The gender gap is context-sensitive
Research suggests that the extent and nature of the gender gap in access to and use of ICTs is significantly 
influenced by local contextual factors. For example, a well-known study of 12 Latin American and 13 African 
countries found that unfavourable income, education, and employment conditions were the primary cause for 
women’s lower levels of ICT use. Once these variables were controlled for, women turned out to be more active 
users of ICTs than men (Hilbert, 2011). However, a similar study on mobile phone adoption by “Bottom of the 
Pyramid” women and men across countries in Asia found that gender disparities in access and use persisted even 
after controlling for these variables (de Silva  et al., 2011). 
These findings suggest that common constraints to ICT adoption vary in significance depending upon local 
conditions, and that context-specific approaches are necessary to effectively address issues of unequal access for 
rural women and men at the local level.  These studies focus on the ways in which users experience and engage 
with ICTs. Their findings can provide a greater understanding of the 
complex dynamics surrounding rural women and men’s adoption of 
ICTs, and can contribute to policy and programmatic interventions 
that more effectively address the digital divide. Each study presents 
important context-specific differences relevant to local decision-makers 
and practitioners (see Box 3). This section focuses primarily on discussing 
the commonalities that were identified in the studies.
Motivations for using ICTs
In all four studies, private communication and social networking for non-
economic purposes was by far the most important driver for adoption and 
use of new ICTs. The use of mobile phones and the Internet for gathering 
information or generating income was also reported. However, overall, 
these activities were far less common motivators of ICT usage, and 
almost never the primary reason for adopting a new technology. While 
this finding might initially seem irrelevant to development practitioners, it 
is significant for two important reasons:
1. Understanding users’ interests and priorities is central to ensuring 
that the design of ICT solutions feels relevant to target users (see Box 
4). ICT use for economic activities often grows out of social use. For 
example, Rathinam finds that although respondents in India rarely 
made use of mobile phones for economic purposes, those who did 
chiefly used existing networks of family and friends to gain information 
on availability of off-season work, weather conditions for fishing, or 
the status of hard-to-reach farmlands. Almost no information was 
obtained through mobile contact with government institutions 
(Rathinam, 2015). 
2. The fact that women and men primarily engage with new ICTs for 
social purposes means that overall constraints to ICT access and 
use may also emerge from this type of use. Jealousy and the fear 
of extramarital affairs was frequently cited as a source of tension 
around mobile phone and Internet use. Rathinam even documents 
one case in which a woman who was using the phone for economic 
purposes, as part of her active involvement in a local self-help group7, 
was eventually forbidden from using it by her increasingly suspicious 
husband (Rathinam, 2015). 
Several of the studies found differences in the frequency and type 
of ICT use by men and women. In the six Asian countries studied 
by FAO, rural women tended to use mobile phones primarily for 
coordination. Men used the phone more for livelihood activities and 
social connections. Women, who considered the household as their 
main responsibility, dedicated a sizable portion of their phone use to 
household matters (FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016). Male and female 
Internet users in Africa were found to access different types of online 
content (Chair, 2017). In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, rural women

and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA), which promoted the economic empowerment of 
rural women through collective action. For more information, see: http://agropedia.iitk.
ac.in/content/development-women-and-children-rural-areas-dwcraBox 4: Relevance is a key 
determinant of ICT use
Studies consistently show that 
users interact with ICTs in ways 
that reflect their existing interests 
and priorities. Users tend not to 
develop new priorities after a new 
technology is introduced. This can 
help to explain why rural Aymara 
women in the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia who received computer 
training to access the Internet 
valued the basic skills they 
acquired (e.g. word processing, 
Excel) more than the ability to 
navigate online (Gigler, 2015). 
This also suggests that the 
likelihood of an ICT solution 
being adopted by target users is 
highly dependent on how well 
that solution responds to users’ 
needs. For example, a GSMA case 
study on the successful mobile 
money application M-Pesa 
emphasizes that in addition to 
boosting financial inclusion for 
users in Kenya, the application 
actually had a significant impact 
in bridging the gender gap in 
mobile phone ownership in the 
country. As of 2015, the gap is 
down to 7 percent. The application 
was of such value to users that it 
was deemed beneficial enough to 
justify the costs of owning mobile 
phone ownership. As a result, the 
application served as a catalyst for 
increasing women’s ownership of 
phones (GSMA, 2015).
“The concerns, needs, and benefits 
ascribed to the mobile phone are more 
a reflection of people’s existing societal, 
familial, and gender norms prevalent in 
their environments, rather than having 
been elicited by the mobile phone. From 
the perception of the study participants, 
the phone is an enabler of extant human 
need and desire.”
(FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia. 2016, p. xii)15
and men reported different reasons for their interest in the Internet: “Women are much more 
concerned about how the Internet can promote the social good, such as health, child care, 
education, literacy, and malnutrition, while men are much more interested in how the Internet 
can expand productive and economic activities.” (Gigler, 2015, p.xxxiii). 
Mobile phone ownership was considered to be essential by rural people in Asia. Both male and 
female viewed phones as key instruments for connecting to infrastructure and services. Their 
strong motivations for use, combined with limited service options, meant that they tended to 
be less cost-conscious than urban users. Rural people also used the phones for much more than 
connectivity. The phones were used for a variety of purposes, including alarms, clocks, flashlights 
and entertainment for children (FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016). 
Barriers to access and use of ICTs 
A review of the four studies revealed three predominant types of constraint to meaningful use of 
new ICTs for rural women: Cost of ICTs and rural infrastructure; gender roles; and lack of education 
and ‘information poverty’.
A. Cost of ICTS and rural infrastructure  
The cost of purchasing a device and maintaining credit was identified as a major barrier for 
respondents in all categories. Rural people, and rural women in particular experience this constraint 
to a greater degree. Access costs in rural areas tend to be higher. There are also usually fewer 
service providers. Users are often less aware of potential options for reducing costs, and in some 
cases, the availability of these options is more limited (Chair, 2017). Due to limited cash availability, 
rural users often opt for short-term, pre-paid options when purchasing credit, even though these 
options are significantly more expensive in the long run than bundle deals or post-paid options. 
These constraints are compounded by difficulties related to rural infrastructure, such as low access 
to sources of electricity for charging devices, or the long distances that must be travelled to 
purchase credit (Chair, 2017; FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016). 
For rural women, the choice often comes down to spending limited income on credit or on 
basic necessities, such as food (Chair, 2017; FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016; Rathinam, 2015). This 
situation is partly a reflection of the fact that rural women usually have a lower income (or less Box 5: Women value mobile phone ownership
‘Lack of perceived value’ was once a top barrier to mobile phone ownership for women. Recent research suggests 
that the enormous developments in ICT in the last decade have led to a significant shift in perception. In 2015, 
the GSMA interviewed thousands of women (both owners and non-owners) on the value of mobile phones. The 
findings from 11 low- and middle- income countries indicate that: 
• at least 89 percent feel that mobile phones help them (or would help them) stay in touch with friends and 
family;

Adapted from: GSMA, 2015 control over income) than rural men and urban people. It also reflects 
the ways prevailing gender norms influence spending priorities within 
the household. In focus group discussions in Sri Lanka, several female 
respondents, who had worked abroad in the Middle East and had 
purchased the devices used by family members, reported being the first 
to give up their own phones when the household faced financial strain 
((FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016). 
B. Gender roles and communication patterns
In all of the studies, the way rural women and men engage with ICTs reflects 
an extension of existing gender norms and communication patterns. In 
India, for example, the network of contacts for male participants tended 
to extend beyond family and extended family contacts. This was not the 
case for female participants. This difference can be attributed to the 
fact that men are viewed as the primary decision-makers and income 
earners, and consequently their use of phones for these purposes is 
seen as justified. On the other hand, women are primarily responsible for 
household duties and their communications are expected to be related 
to household activities (Rathinam, 2015). 
In the Asian countries that were studied, both rural women and men 
felt that women should have a phone to help them fulfil their household 
responsibilities. Men tended to think that women used the phone too 
much, despite the fact that women used the phone less than men. This 
finding indicates that men’s use of the phone was viewed as legitimate, 
while women’s was not. Men’s role as decision-makers also meant that 
women were often expected to consult with their husbands, brothers, or 
even sons about phone use or phone-related purchases (FAO, IDRC and 
LIRNEasia, 2016). It is perhaps not surprising, then, that in India, increased 
income resulted in increased mobile phone ownership only for men. Female 
ownership remained low in all income categories (Rathinam, 2015).
In all studies, engagement with ICTs was viewed as a threat to rural 
women’s ability to fulfil their reproductive roles. Time spent online or on 
the phone was seen as taking them away from looking after their partners 
and family (Chair, 2017; FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016; Gigler, 2015). 
In Kenya, a peri-urban female internet user describes how the social 
pressure to fulfil household responsibilities ultimately takes precedence 
over individual priorities:
For instance a woman in the village even if she wanted to use a 
cyber she will not do that. Imagine being in the cyber at 7pm and 
you are expected to be at home cooking, taking care of cows etc. 
Even if you have a child abroad and you want to communicate 
with them, it becomes very difficult... (Chair, 2017, p. 34.)
The perceived threat of women ‘straying away’ from household 
responsibilities to go online or use the phone is likely to also be connected 
to the strong association between new ICTs and romantic relationships. “Recharging [mobile phone] 
batteries in villages without reliable 
electricity sources can be a challenge 
[…] The cost of recharging mobile 
telephones is listed in numerous 
farmer surveys as the second most 
common reason they do not use 
mobiles to receive agricultural 
information; the first reason is the 
cost of the phone service itself.”
(FAO, 2014., p. 38) 
 
“Only when my brother gives me the 
mobile phone can I talk. But he does 
not give the phone to me. He keeps 
asking me questions about why 
and who I want to talk to!”  - Rural 
woman, India
(Rathinam, 2015)1617Women and men in all countries perceived social media and phone use as a threat to relationships, 
but power dynamics in rural households led to a disproportionate negative impact on women’s use 
of ICTs. Women often reported that they avoided engaging with ICTs for fear of displeasing their 
partners. In several cases, women were explicitly forbidden by their partners from going online or 
owning a phone (Chair, 2017; Rathinam 2015). In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Aymara women 
were only able to avoid questioning from their families about their internet and computer use 
because it took place in a space that was considered ‘legitimate’ since it was part of ICT training 
sessions conducted by a well-known and trusted local organization (Gigler, 2015). 
C. Lack of education and ‘information poverty’
Education has been found to be an important factor influencing 
users’ ability to engage with ICTs in a meaningful way (Deen-Swarray 
et al., 2012; FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016). Gigler (2015) finds 
that lack of schooling and the consequent lack of skills required to 
navigate the internet was an issue that was especially pronounced 
in rural areas of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, particularly 
among women, who were often non-users before receiving ICT 
training. Aymara women were often hindered by fears of breaking 
computers or making a mistake. Their lower educational attainment 
also meant that they lacked essential information literacy skills. 
The fact that training occurred in a ‘safe space’ and integrated 
information technology and literacy skills was an essential factor for 
ensuring women participants adopted ICTs (Gigler, 2015). 
Rural respondents in Africa and Asia confirmed the association between education and ICT 
capabilities. They frequently cited low educational attainment as a primary constraint to mobile 
phone and internet use (Chair, 2017; Rathinam, 2015). Rathinam also points out that the inability 
to operate mobile phones was further reinforced by gender disparities in ownership and use. 
Men were more likely to own a phone, and therefore to have had opportunities to develop their 
skills. Women, who mostly borrowed from family members and neighbours, had acquired less 
technological know-how and usually relied on the lenders for help (Rathinam, 2015). 
Uneven control over the means of communication also limits women’s ability to socialize and 
gather information, which reduces their decision-making capabilities. Men’s greater freedom to 
develop their personal networks leads to an imbalance in access to information that puts women 
at a disadvantage, a constraint that Gigler (2015) calls ‘lack of information as poverty’. He reports 
that men in the villages often acted as the keepers of information. Less burdened by household 
responsibilities, men had more free time to gather and talk. As a result, they had more access 
to (and power over) valuable information, which they could choose to withhold as convenient. 
The exercise of control over information was especially common among male community leaders 
(Gigler, 2015). Rathinam notes that this dynamic is also present in the relationship between 
government institutions and rural populations, and argues that exploitation of the poor through 
lack of information is an important reason for ‘capability poverty’8 among rural women and men 
(Rathinam, 2015). 
8  Rathinam (2015) defines capability poverty (in reference to Amartya Sen’s capability approach) as “the inability to 
perform certain basic activities which are considered to be necessary and worth aspiring for in life.” Both Rathinam 
(2015) and Gigler (2015) make the point that access to and use of ICTs now falls within the realm of basic activities that 
determine human capabilities and the experience of poverty.“Only a person who has studied at least 
till the 4th or 5th class can operate 
mobile phones”  
– Rural man, India
( Rathinam, 2015)18According to a forthcoming study by the University of Reading, the University of Nairobi, Makerere 
University, and Ahfad University for Women, household structure can be a significant factor in 
determining women’s access to information. In Uganda, women in female-headed households with 
a separate piece of land were found to have greater access to information than their counterparts 
in male-headed households. (S. Cardey, personal  communication, 2017).
Finally, it is worth noting that disparities in educational levels and information literacy may also 
affect the type of online information accessed by users. In the African countries that were studied, 
rural users were found to access less diverse content than their urban counterparts (Chair, 2017).

agriculture and rural development  (FAO, 2016c) also contains detailed accounts of 
FAO’s many efforts to enhance rural women’s visibility and promote the production of 
gender-sensitive information on agriculture and rural contexts. The FAO Gender web 
site provides a wide selection of publications and resources, including links to sources 
of sex-disaggregated statistics. The site is available at:

4.1 Current activities
Research and knowledge-sharing on rural women
Following the 1999 High-Level Consultation on Rural Women and Information and the subsequent 
FAO publication, Gender and Food Security: The role of Information  - Strategy for Action (FAO, 
2000), the Organization has intensified efforts to achieve gender equality for rural women through 
the production of sex-disaggregated data and gender-specific information about agriculture and 
rural livelihoods. In recognition of the fact that “[the] image of women that is portrayed in the 
media is very often limited to their traditional reproductive role” (FAO, 2000, p. 2), FAO works to 
increase the visibility of rural women’s contribution to food security and nutrition. The Organization 
supports the production of relevant, sex-disaggregated information to better identify women’s 
needs and enable rural development actors to allocate and manage resources more equitably.9 
 FAO and the e-Agriculture community also collaborate with the World Bank to raise awareness and 
share knowledge about ICTs in agriculture, including through contributions to the ICT in Agriculture 
Sourcebook (World Bank, 2017) . As part of this collaboration, FAO authored Module 4 of the 
Sourcebook : Extending the Benefits – Gender-equitable, ICT-Enabled Agricultural Development.
In the 2000 Strategy for Action , FAO also recognizes the need to “identify and meet the information 
and communication needs of the rural population, in particular those of women” and work to 
improve women’s access and ability to make meaningful use of ICTs (FAO, 2000). Over the past two 
decades, the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (FAO-RAP) has been especially active in 
taking up this call, gathering knowledge on the constraints faced by rural women to participation 
in the information society, and advocating for improved, gender-equitable agricultural extension 
and technology transfer 10. More recently, FAO-RAP has begun looking specifically into the nature 
of gender and ICT adoption in rural contexts. This work includes research in a number of areas, such 
as the study on gender and mobile phone use among the rural poor (FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 
2016), which was considered in Chapter 3. 
FAO also collaborates with academic institutions to build evidence 
on the impact of rural communication policies and services on rural 
development. In 2017, FAO and the University of Queensland, Australia 
published Inclusive Rural Communication Services: Building Evidence, 
Informing Policy (FAO, 2017c). The publication, which reviews 19 case 
studies of communication mechanisms in rural development initiatives 
from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, 
draws special attention to ICT-based initiatives that demonstrated 
evidence of a positive impact on rural development. Included among 
the selected case studies are interventions with an explicitly identified 
gender dimension and/or focus on women’s empowerment.4
20e-Agriculture
Following the participation of FAO in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in 
2003 and 2005, the Organization was assigned responsibility for the facilitation role of Action 
Line C7 on e-Agriculture in the Geneva Plan of Action. This laid the ground for FAO and a 
group of founding partners to launch in 2007 the e-Agriculture Community of Practice (CoP)11. 
Recognizing that inefficient information exchange is one of the major obstacles to sustainable 
rural development, the e-Agriculture CoP provides an online space that facilitates the exchange 
of knowledge and experiences related to the use of ICTs for agriculture and rural development. 
The e-Agriculture platform is one of the most successful CoPs that FAO manages. As of May 2017, 
the community has over 12 000 registered members from more than 170 countries, 42 000 Twitter 
followers and 9 300 LinkedIn group members (see Figure 4). 
The e-Agriculture platform includes a wealth of information on gender-transformative rural 
development through ICTs. It encourages contributing members to consider the gendered impacts of 
the experiences and good practices, which they share through guided questions in forum discussions 
and a gender-sensitive good practice template. Through the platform, FAO and the e-Agriculture 
Community document achievements and promising practices on an ongoing basis and contribute 
to the annual Reports on the WSIS Stocktaking and other outcome documents produced by ITU.12 
 FAO and the e-Agriculture Community also supported the organization of the 2013 ICT for 
Agriculture (ICT4Ag) Conference in Rwanda. 
FAO recognizes that for ICTs to fulfil their potential to contribute to agricultural development, 
relevant actors must be guided by a coherent national strategy that provides standards, norms 
and methodologies, and fosters the development of individual and institutional capacities where 
gaps exist. Since 2013, FAO and ITU have been collaborating to provide assistance to countries 
in formulating ‘e-agriculture strategies’, which provide a roadmap for the coordination and 
implementation of ICT4Ag efforts based on each country’s specific priorities. 
Figure 4: e-Agriculture CoP Membership

21FAO and ITU supported the development of the world’s first e-agriculture 
strategies through a multistakeholder process in two pilot countries 
(Bhutan and Sri Lanka). They subsequently produced an E-Agriculture 
Strategy Guide (FAO and ITU, 2016), which is now being used to replicate 
the process in several other countries in the Asia and Pacific region. 
The experience has been so successful that the two agencies are now 
working to scale up the initiative at the global level. To effectively address 
key challenges and achieve agricultural goals, ICT strategies must be 
responsive to local realities. The e-agriculture strategy places significant 
emphasis on incorporating context-specific information, including local 
gender dynamics, into the process of formulating a national e-agriculture 
vision and plan of action.13
Communication for development 
FAO has long been a major actor and pioneer in the field of 
communication for development (ComDev). The Organization was 
one of the organizers of the first World Congress on Communication 
for Development, which was held in Rome in 2006. ComDev work 
at FAO uses participatory communication methods to ensure that 
projects are relevant and accountable, access to information is 
equitable, communications are properly targeted, and decision-making 
processes include farmers and rural communities. Key elements of this 
approach include: designing interventions and ICT solutions to respond 
to local needs and capabilities; fostering dialogue and mediation; 
and strengthening local knowledge and communication processes to 
empower and engage local stakeholders. 
FAO supports the institutionalization of ComDev through rural 
communication services (RCS). RCS do not view of ComDev as a 
collection of isolated initiatives. They frame these experiences as 
components of a broader, holistic approach to development (FAO, 
2016e). FAO defines RCS as: 
[A] wide range of demand-led communication processes, 
activities, media applications and institutional arrangements to 
answer to the need of the rural population in a sustained manner. 
It provides a framework to promote policy dialogue on the role of 
communication understood as a public good – to foster inclusion 
in decision-making, the appropriation of ICTs by rural people and 
stronger links between rural institutions, farmer organizations and 
communities. (FAO, 2017g)
Viewing ComDev through the lens of RCS creates the possibility for the 
approach to be mainstreamed throughout rural development policies 
and programmes, which gives rural populations greater ownership over 
local communication processes and decision-making. 
FAO promotes RCS at the local, national and international level through 
technical support and a wide-ranging portfolio of interventions. At 
the local level, the Organization assists rural institutions and producer 
13  The FAO-RAP E-agriculture Strategy Guide is available at: fao.org/asiapacific/
resources/%20e-agriculture“The digital divide in agriculture is 
not only concerned with technological 
infrastructure and connectivity, but is 
characterized by ineffective knowledge 
exchange and management of information 
content, limited individual and institutional 
capacities and the lack of favourable 
enabling environments, as well as 
inadequate sensitivity to gender and the 
diverse needs of different groups.”
(FAO, 2015a, p. xi)
“Setting in place a national e-agriculture 
strategy is an essential first step for 
any country planning on using ICTs for 
agriculture (ICT4Ag). Experience shows 
that committing piecemeal resources to 
ICT4Ag on an ad hoc  basis results in higher 
costs and lower impacts. Any effective 
roadmap for e-agriculture will require a 
holistic, multi-stakeholder approach as 
ICTs are also driving other sectors critical 
for agriculture, namely banking, weather 
monitoring, insurance, logistics and 
e-governance.”
(FAO and ITU, 2017, p. 1)22organizations in the development of ComDev strategies and plans, and community-centred 
ICT applications. At the national level, FAO advocates for inclusive RCS as part of family farming 
and poverty reduction policies. To support this process, the Organization fosters multistakeholder 
dialogue among key global and regional partners and evidence-based approaches to aid the 
development of appropriate policy options for inclusive RCS. Finally, FAO works with several partners 
to enhance capacities on RCS through training and knowledge sharing. In addition to conducting 
regional training on RCS, the Organization has also been instrumental in the development of three 
regional communication platforms (OndaRural, ComDevAsia and Yenkasa Africa) and one global 
knowledge platform on ComDev and RCS (CCComDev) (FAO, 2017g).

The national government of Guatemala, with the  support of FAO’s Integrated Country  Approach Programme, has  
highlighted  the need for more efficient youth-oriented  services in the country, especially  for expanding  access to decent 
jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities. The  FAO ComDev team was tasked to facilitate  the design and implementation  
of ChispaRural.GT, a communication service  to provide  younger generations of Guatemalan family farmers and rural  
entrepreneurs with access to up-to-date  information on opportunities and resources, practical tools, training materials,

To guide the design of an effective  communication service, including the selection of appropriate communication  
channels, contents, and material, the FAO ComDev team developed a participatory communication appraisal in the  
San Marcos department. The  assessment highlighted that young Guatemalans, including the ones living in isolated  
rural villages, are  ‘digital natives’ who are  used to interactions mediated by new ICTs. For example, 90 percent of the  
interviewees owned a mobile phone  and considered social networks as the  most appropriate  channel to receive  and 
exchange information on agricultural or labour issues.  
Nevertheless, the  assessment also showed that women between 18 and 29 years old struggled to access job orientation  
services and agricultural advisory services. Their only  source of information was their family  (i.e. husband, parents,  
and siblings). Only 20 percent of these  women owned a smartphone. Their main channels for external information  
were radio and basic mobile  phones. These  findings were  used to design a truly  inclusive  multichannel digital solution,  
which included an SMS-based information service  among ChispaRural.GT’s communication channels. This service  
has made  it possible for young women to receive  information of interest and engage  in dialogue  with institutional and  
private advisory service providers.

23Dimitra Clubs - Community mobilization and collective action 
FAO endorses a rights-based approach to rural development that uses participatory communication 
and community mobilization for improving livelihoods and promoting the empowerment of 
rural women and men living in underserved, often isolated, communities (See Box 6 below). This 
approach, called FAO-Dimitra Clubs approach, which has been implemented by the Organization 
in sub-Saharan countries for a decade, puts special attention on small-scale farmers and family 
farmers, youth, women, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups. 
Due to the holistic nature of the FAO-Dimitra Clubs methodology, the approach has not only 
succeeded in achieving its central goal of enhancing gender equality and improving rural people’s 
livelihoods in a sustainable way, it has also triggered a broader range of impacts. Some of these 
impacts include improvements in social cohesion and civic engagement, health and sanitation, 
infrastructure, education, and natural resource management. The FAO-Dimitra Club approach 
is among FAO’s best practices and serves as an excellent example of the immense potential of 
gender-sensitive participatory approaches that use communication and ICTs to enhance the 
reach and sustainability of rural development initiatives (FAO, 2016c; ONG, AEDL and APEBA, 2015).
Box 7: The Dimitra Clubs combine social mobilization, communication and gender-sensitive approaches 
to foster rural transformation
At the community level, FAO supports the implementation of the gender-transformative approach of the FAO-
Dimitra Clubs. These clubs provide opportunities for groups of rural women, men and young people to meet 
regularly to discuss their needs, priorities and challenges, and take collective action to solve problems using 
their own ideas and resources. To facilitate the replication of good practices that emerge from this process, the 
experiences of the Dimitra Clubs are shared through community radio stations, using devices, such as mobile 
phones and solar radio sets. Some 2 000 Dimitra Clubs (January 2018) are active in six sub-Saharan countries 
(Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal). The Clubs have 60 000 members 
(two-thirds of whom are women) and have had a positivel impact on 1.5 million people. 
The Dimitra Clubs approach has the advantage of being highly adaptable to local needs. The dynamic nature of the 
Clubs has stimulated significant changes in gender relations and roles at the individual, household and community 
levels. In all of the countries in which the approach has been implemented, the organizational capacities, 
participation and bargaining power of the most vulnerable people have improved. The promotion of dialogue 
and collective action in the Clubs has increased women’s self-confidence and strengthened social cohesion. As a 
result, many communities have seen a number of benefits, including reductions in gender-based violence, food 
taboos, and local conflicts. In Niger, the Dimitra Clubs’ empowering process has also led women club members 
to become candidates in local elections and be elected. This has resulted in women having greater influence over 
local processes that regulate access to land and influence economic opportunities. In the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, when men imposed their farming preference on land that was usually cultivated by women (e.g. 
the cultivation of sugarcane instead of food crops), the women were able to file complaints with the traditional 
authorities through their Clubs. The authorities decided to increase taxes on sugar cane, which resulted in 70 
percent of the land being converted back to fruit and vegetable cultivation, and becoming accessible to women 
again. 
ICTs are used in the capacity development process facilitated by the Dimitra Clubs, but they are not a development 
objective in itself. In rural areas, they are enablers for social inclusion, self-confidence and improved dialogue. By 
making use of ICTs in support of an empowerment process led by rural communities, the Dimitra Clubs ensure 
inclusive participation and ownership of the actions undertaken and strengthen the sustainability of these actions. 
Many stories from the field show how the Dimitra Clubs use ICTs as enablers for collective action, improved food 
security and enhanced resilience. In a remote village in Niger (Mallam Koïra), a women’s Dimitra Club noticed 
that some insects were damaging the millet fields. After discussions, the club decided to take action by sending a 
mobile phone picture to the regional agricultural inspector who was able to promptly advise on actions to stop the 
infestation. Three days later, the agricultural inspector sent the pest control agents who had seen the picture and 
were able to provide the adequate treatment in time. In another commune in Niger (Falwel), youth Dimitra Clubs 
have created a larger network through the WhatsApp application.

As part of the new FAO Digital Strategy, the Organization’s Information and Technology Division is 
developing a portfolio of digital services to address the needs of poor rural households in Africa. 
Currently, the digital services pilot project is focusing on the development of four mobile applications 
(see Box 7) to improve agricultural services and local content in Senegal and Rwanda. The project 
is designed to be adaptable and scalable for use in other countries. Particular emphasis is placed 
on the inclusion of young people, self-employed entrepreneurs and female-headed households. 
As part of the project’s focus on user-centred design, the applications provide adapted content in 
local languages. The applications also help to mitigate potential barriers to use that are related to 
illiteracy by including features, such as video and voice services (FAO, 2017a, 2017b).
E-learning
FAO has begun to incorporate e-learning as a flexible capacity development tool in development 
projects and programmes. An example is the Organization’s work with the International Indigenous 
Women’s Forum on the Programme on Human Rights, Advocacy, Food Security and Nutrition. The 
programme, which is implemented under the umbrella of the Indigenous Women’s Global Leadership 
School, works to empower indigenous women through a combination of e-learning, intensive on-
site training and longer-term monitoring and support to the implementation of advocacy plans 
developed by participants to improve food security and nutrition in their communities. The structure 
of the programme has evolved over time to better meet participants’ learning needs. A review of the 
programme’s first phase of implementation in 2015-2016 revealed that many women had difficulties 
accessing and understanding the e-learning content. Consequently, the structure was revised to 
include an additional face-to-face training before the e-learning course. The addition of this initial phase 
allowed trainers to assess learning needs, levels of internet access and modalities of ICT use in each 
location, and develop a learning strategy accordingly. As a result, learning outcomes have significantly 
improved and women have become more engaged and taken greater ownership over the learning 
process. To date, over 100 women in the India, Peru, the Philippines and the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia have become empowered through the programme. Training activities have been added in El 
Salvador, Panama and Paraguay (FAO, 2016d; FAO, 2017f; E. Mcghie, personal communication, 2017). 
In partnership with like-minded institutions and experts, FAO has also developed and continues 
to update a broad selection of e-learning courses to support agriculture and food security 
professionals in acquiring and enhancing key skills. The courses, which are available free of charge, Box 8: Applications in the FAO Digital Services Portfolio for Africa

additional online resources. The Organization’s e-learning portfolio currently includes courses in 
several thematic areas, including both Gender and Communication. The portfolio also includes 
practice-oriented learning categories, such as Information Management and Knowledge Sharing; 
Social Analysis; Capacity Development; and Monitoring, Evaluation and Impact Assessment. 
These different categories offer tools and methods to help practitioners successfully integrate the 
principles of inclusivity and context-sensitive design at the project level.14 
ICTs across FAO
ICTs are deployed throughout FAO to enhance the ability of the Organization to meet its 
goals. Common uses for information and communication technologies in FAO projects 
include data collection and mapping; services that enable improved market access and 
financial inclusion; and agricultural information for production systems management. FAO 
has also worked with its partners to develop country-level and regional-level early warning 
systems on food and nutrition; extreme weather events such as drought and flooding; and 
pests and diseases affecting important cash crops. An example is SATCAFÉ  (Sistema de 
Alerta Temprana para Café), which was developed to monitor outbreaks of coffee leaf rust 
and help coffee farmers in Mesoamerica make informed farm management decisions.15 
Due to the frequently unreliable nature of public funding for field data collection, SATCAFÉ ensures 
timely and reliable data by crowdsourcing information on outbreaks. This allows all actors in the 
coffee sector to register and contribute to the system through a specially developed mobile 
application. The platform has been so successful that it has evolved beyond its function as an early 
warning system to become an interactive resource for agro-ecological farm management. SATCAFÉ 
helps farmers to measure their farms, provides answers to questions about coffee management for 
which there is often no literature, and creates links to new markets and certification processes (e.g. 
Organic, bird friendly) (FAO, 2017h; Dyer, 2014). 
4.2 Partnerships 
FAO’s partners include many United Nations agencies, private sector, and civil society entities. 
This section a presents a selection of key partnerships that focus on the application of ICTs to rural 
development. Not all of these partnerships make explicit mention of gender equality among their 
goals. However, all of them have the potential to make a significant impact in fostering inclusive rural 
development and achieving equal access and participation in rural areas, if gender is made a priority.
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
In September 2017, FAO and ITU formed a new partnership to leverage the synergies in the 
work of the two agencies and provide better support for the implementation of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) through the use of ICTs. The Memorandum of Understanding between 
the two organizations scales up the existing collaboration on e-agriculture strategies. It also 
focuses on facilitating the development of e-Agriculture policies and regulations, fostering ICT-
based innovation in agriculture at the national and regional level, and “enhancing the capacity 
of rural communities to adopt and use ICTs in agriculture, climate change monitoring and disaster-
prevention”. According to ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao, “A priority will be the fostering of 
digital skills among women and youth in the agriculture sector” (FAO, 2017d).

FAO and Google Maps are working together to foster inclusive innovation and expertise 
in agricultural development, natural resource management and the fight against climate 
change. The partnership is broadening the scope of satellite data to include the monitoring 
of drylands and agricultural productivity. It is also making geospatial tracking and mapping 
products more accessible to enhance the capacity of actors at all levels to collect, 
analyse and disseminate data (FAO, 2015d). For example, FAO’s Open Foris Initiative16 
 has developed a suite of tools that combine open source software and Google technology. The 
tools are free to use and allow governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research 
institutions, and private sector entities to carry out monitoring activities in a broad range of areas 
that pertain to the FAO mandate.
Grameen Foundation
FAO and the Grameen Foundation have been collaborating since 2011, when the organizations 
signed an agreement that allowed the Grameen Foundation to access the information in the 
Technologies for Agriculture (TECA)17 database. The focus of the partnership is currently on 
enhancing smallholders’ “access to knowledge and technologies for sustainable production and 
food security through the use of mobile agriculture supported services” and on “improving farming 
innovation exchange, strengthening small-holder households to gain better access to agricultural 
and rural financial services and competitive value chains” (FAO, 2013a). 
The Grameen Foundation brings to the partnership its wealth of experience developing and 
implementing ICT-based solutions for improving access to information and financial services. 
The Foundation played a pioneering role in the field of microfinance, and innovative, pro-poor 
approaches to mobile agriculture, mobile health, and mobile credit and savings applications (see 
Box 8). The two organizations share a commitment to developing solutions that respond to farmers’ 
actual needs and address context-specific constraints, and achieving substantive behavioural 
change and progress out of poverty (FAO, 2013b).

“The Grameen Foundation’s Community Knowledge Worker projects in Uganda and Colombia exemplify the 
importance of farmer-to-farmer social networks within ICT-based applications. The initiative has developed a 
database and smartphone applications that are used by trained ‘community knowledge workers,’ or local farmers, 
both men and women, who are chosen by their communities to serve as information liaisons. The workers 
travel from farmer to farmer with their smartphones through which they can access, disseminate and discuss 
the information requested by that farmer. The database contains more than 40 000 real-time tips on 46 crops 
and 10 livestock animals as well as weather forecasts, market prices, transportation directories, buyer contact

is popular with women farmers […]” (FAO, 2014, p. 31-31)27Rabobank Foundation
Since 2013, FAO and the Rabobank Foundation have been working together to increase the 
incomes of farmers, improve their access to financial tools, and strengthen their ability to invest in 
improved crop production. The collaboration, which began with three pilot projects in Ethiopia, 
Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, has been scaled up to include other countries in 
Africa, Latin America and Asia. Increased focus has been placed on initiatives aimed at increasing 
purchases from family farmer cooperatives that represent women. The two organizations have also 
agreed to explore ways to make use of mobile technology to increase the sharing of data and 
information, and generally improve young farmers’ access to technology (FAO, 2015c). 
World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC)
FAO and AMARC collaborate in the field of radio and the media. The partnership uses a ComDev 
approach to carry out advocacy and capacity-building activities that promote community 
media as a driver for social change and development in rural areas, especially among family 
farmers. This partnership has succeeded in launching regional ComDev platforms in Africa, Asia 
and Latin America. The two organizations also collaborated to convene the international Forum 
on Communication for Development & Community Media for Family Farming in 2014, during the 
International Year of Family Farming (FAO, 2016e). 
Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA)
SEWA is an Indian membership organization of 1.9 million poor self-employed women workers. Most 
of these women are rural farmers or work in the informal sector. The well-established collaboration 
between FAO and SEWA covers a very broad range of activities, including generating evidence 
and identifying innovative experiences that can contribute to the inclusion of marginalized women 
and young people in the rural economy. Another shared objective involves “strengthening the 
capacities of poor rural people to organize themselves and put in place sound governance 
practices, gender equality measures and to use these to engage in lobbying and advocacy 
to help bring about policy change” (FAO, 2016b). A number of tools are used to achieve these 
objectives, including the participatory use of 
traditional media, such as radio and video. 
The two organizations have also committed to 
leverage their knowledge and experiences to 
benefit countries facing similar development 
challenges by generating online tools and 
technical materials for use by actors outside 
the areas in which the partnership operates 
(FAO, 2016a).

294.3 Timeline: Milestones in gender equality and ICT that set the 
context for the work of FAO 
1995
The Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace 
The Conference produced the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Platform for Action18. One of the 
key areas of concern highlighted at the Conference was the emerging gender divide in access to, 
control over, and ability to benefit from developments in ICT. Research carried out by the United 
Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (UNCSTD) in advance of the 
Conference indicated that the “information revolution appeared to be bypassing women”, and 
that ICT-related research and projects were failing to address the specific circumstances of women 
(UNDAW, 2005). As a result, the issue was included as a critical area of concern to be addressed in 
Section J of the Beijing Platform for Action (see Annex 2 for full text). 
At the Conference, FAO organized an ‘Emphasis Day’ on rural women’s livelihoods together with 
other United Nations agencies and NGOs and announced the introduction of a revised Plan of 
Action for FAO and its membership to work toward implementing the Beijing Platform for Action in 
the Organization’s areas of expertise (United Nations, 1995). 
Beijing Platform for Action, Section J: “Women and the Media”
• Strategic Objective J1: Increase the participation and access of women to expression and 
decision-making in and through the media and new technologies of communication
• Strategic Objective J2: Promote a balanced and non-stereotyped portrayal of women in the media.
1998
The First Mile of Connectivity
FAO was among the first to highlight the urban-rural digital divide in it seminal publication, The 
First Mile of Connectivity19. The collection of articles highlights issues surrounding the introduction 
of ICTs in rural areas and advocates for a focus on people rather than technologies in ICT-related 
development interventions. Despite being almost two decades old, many of the issues raised by 
this publication remain relevant (see Chapter 3).
1999
High-level Consultation on Rural Women and Information
The Consultation, which was held in Rome, was convened by FAO. The objective of the Consultation 
was to improve the generation and dissemination of information about rural women to better 
identify and respond to women’s needs and priorities20. The major outcome of the Consultation was 
the 2000 Strategy for Action , which served to guide much of FAO’s subsequent work on gender.21

Task Force on Gender and ICTs of the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender 
Equality
This task force was formed to ensure that a gender perspective was included in the preparations 
for and outcome of the WSIS. The task force, which was managed by ITU and included FAO in its 
membership, produced information and advocacy materials on gender and ICT for phase I of WSIS 
in 2003. 
2003
47th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 47) 
The thematic issue of focus for the CSW 47 was: ‘Participation and access of women to the media, and 
information and communication technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the 
advancement and empowerment of women’. This was the first time that the CSW had directly focused 
on the issue of ICT and the empowerment of women. The session produced agreed conclusions that 
acknowledged the global digital divide, highlighted the double-edged potential of ICTs to either 
perpetuate existing inequalities or become central tools for empowerment and the promotion of 
gender equality, and called on all relevant actors to implement a set of 24 recommended actions.22 
Though none of the recommended actions specifically focused on rural women and girls, several 
are highly relevant to the work of FAO, including: the need to integrate gender perspectives and 
measurable gender-specific targets in all ICT-related programmes and projects; support research 
into all aspects of the impact of ICTs and the media on women and girls; foster increased access 
and ability to make meaningful use of ICTs for women and girls; and promote local content 
production and knowledge systems (see Annex 3 for full text). 
“Bridging the Rural Digital Divide”
The activities of the FAO Bridging the Rural Digital Divide Programme23 served as a platform for 
the Organization’s participation in the 2003 and 2005 WSIS. Through the programme, FAO was 
one of the main actors in the WSIS process and became a founding partner of the e-Agriculture 
community (FAO, 2014; FAO, 2015a). The programme, which included an emphasis on rural 
women, highlighted synergies between information management and ComDev and emphasized 
innovative approaches to exchanging knowledge using both new and traditional ICTs (FAO, 2002). 
2003 and 2005
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)
FAO was a member of the High-level Summit Organization Committee that assisted ITU in the 
organization of WSIS. The first phase of the Summit took place in Geneva in December 2003 and 
produced the Geneva Declaration of Principles and Geneva Plan of Action. The outcomes of 
the second phase, which was held in Tunis in November 2005, were the Tunis Commitment  and 
Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. All four documents acknowledge the digital divide and

girls, the rural poor and other marginalized or underserved groups.24 Under action line C7 of the 
Geneva Plan of Action, FAO was assigned the responsibility for organizing activities related to the 
application of ICTs in the area of e-agriculture. Among other things, this led to the creation of the 
e-Agriculture CoP.
Geneva Plan of Action
Action line C7. ICT Applications: E-agriculture
a. Ensure the systematic dissemination of information using ICTs on agriculture, animal husbandry, 
fisheries, forestry and food, in order to provide ready access to comprehensive, up-to-date 
and detailed knowledge and information, particularly in rural areas.
b. Public-private partnerships should seek to maximize the use of ICTs as an instrument to improve 
production (quantity and quality).
The Geneva Declaration and Tunis Commitment also reaffirmed commitments to key principles of 
free speech and the right to information for all, including the principles outlined in Articles 19 and 
29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
From the Geneva Declaration of Principles:
“4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. 
Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of 
all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have 
the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information 
Society offers.
5. We further reaffirm  our commitment to the provisions of Article 29 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, that everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full 
development of their personality is possible, and that, in the exercise of their rights and freedoms, 
everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose 
of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting 
the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. 
These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles 
of the United Nations. In this way, we shall promote an Information Society where human dignity is 
respected […]
55. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of 
information, as well as those of the independence, pluralism and diversity of media, which are 
essential to the Information Society. Freedom to seek, receive, impart and use information for the 
creation, accumulation and dissemination of knowledge are important to the Information Society. 
We call for the responsible use and treatment of information by the media in accordance with the 
highest ethical and professional standards. Traditional media in all their forms have an important 
role in the Information Society and ICTs should play a supportive role in this regard. Diversity of 
media ownership should be encouraged, in conformity with national law, and taking into

imbalances affecting the media, particularly as regards infrastructure, technical resources and the 
development of human skills.”
2006
The First World Congress on Communication for Development 
The Congress, which was organized by the World Bank, FAO, and the Communication Initiative, 
promoted ComDev as necessary to the achievement of the overall development agenda. The 
event, which was held at FAO headquarters, attracted over 900 participants and about 200 
journalists and representatives of media outlets. One of the outcomes of the Congress was the 
Rome Consensus, which produced a commonly agreed upon definition of ComDev as:
[A] social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about 
seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, 
building policies, debating and learning or sustained and meaningful change. It is not public 
relations or corporate communication. (The Communication Initiative, FAO, and World Bank, 2007, 
p. xxxiii)
The Rome Consensus outlines strategic requirements and key recommendations for development 
actors to enable them to better prioritize and integrate ComDev in their efforts. 
At the Congress, specific recommendations were also formulated for the application of ICTs. 
In these recommendations, it was agreed that capacity development was key to ensuring 
meaningful adoption of ICTs by users, and that a “focus on addressing gender and other forms 
of social discrimination” would be an essential part of this process (The Communication Initiative, 
FAO, and World Bank, 2007).
The Rome Consensus, Strategic Requirements: 
“Development organizations must assign a much higher priority to the essential elements of 
Communication for Development process, as shown by research and practice:
• The right and opportunity people have to participate in the decision-making processes that 
affect their lives
• Creating opportunities for sharing knowledge and skills
• Ensuring that people have access to communication tools so that they can themselves 
communicate within their communities and with the people making the decisions that affect 
them—for example community radio and other community media
• The process of dialogue, debate, and engagement that builds public policies that are relevant, 
helpful and which have committed constituencies willing to implement them—for example on 
responding to preserving the environment
• Recognizing and harnessing the communication trends that are taking place at local, national, 
and international levels for improved development action—from new media regulations and 
ICT trends to popular and traditional music
• Adopting an approach that is contextualized within cultures
• Related to all of the above, assigning priority to supporting the people most affected by 
the development issues in their communities and countries to have their say, to voice their 33perspectives, and to contribute and act on their ideas for improving their situation—for 
example indigenous peoples and people living with HIV/AIDS”. (The Communication Initiative, 
FAO, and World Bank, 2007, p. xxxiv).
2013
FAO Gender Policy 
The FAO Policy on Gender Equality: Attaining Food Security Goals in Agriculture and Rural 
Development  calls on the entire Organization to contribute to its overall goal of “[achieving] equality 
between women and men in sustainable agricultural production and rural development for the 
elimination of hunger and poverty”(FAO, 2013c, p.6). The policy, which provides a framework for 
guiding the Organization’s efforts to achieve gender equality, outlines an accountability structure 
to assess and ensure the achievement of results 
Information and Communication Technologies for Agriculture (ICT4Ag) Conference 
FAO and the e-Agriculture Community supported the organization of the ICT4Ag Conference in 
Rwanda.25 The conference, which brought together over 400 practitioners, donors and policy-
makers, represented a milestone for the promotion of ICT in the development of the agriculture 
sector. A session on gender and ICTs was held at the conference. Included among the 
recommendations put forth at the conference was the need to strengthen youth’s and women’s 
involvement in ICT4Ag initiatives.26 
2014
WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015
As part of the review of progress and developments in the first ten years since the original WSIS, a 
new vision was defined for the application of ICTs in development beyond 2015. In this new vision, 
the mandate for the e-agriculture Action Line and the role of FAO as its facilitator was extended 
significantly.
WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015: e-agriculture
c. “As part of national ICT strategies, foster the development and implementation of national 
e-agriculture strategies focusing on providing reliable and affordable connectivity and 
integrating ICTs in rural development to support food security and hunger eradication. 
d. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing in agriculture via electronic communities of 
practice, including the e-Agriculture Community, in order to showcase and promote models, 
methodologies, good practices and the adoption of Open Access and interoperability 
standards, for effective and equitable use of ICTs for sustainable agriculture and rural 
development. 
e. Promote the creation and adaptation of content including in local languages and contexts 
from reliable and trusted sources, including, to ensure equitable and timely access to 
agricultural knowledge by resource-poor men and women farmers, foresters and fisher folk in 
rural areas.

consideration local needs and constraints by providing appropriate learning opportunities for 
all which will enhance individual and collective decision-making skills. 
g. Promote the use of ICTs to reinforce the resilience capacity of states, communities and 
individuals to mitigate and adapt to natural and man-made disasters, food chain challenges, 
socio-economic and other crises, conflicts and transboundary threats, diseases, and 
environmental damages. 
h. Promote Public-Private Partnerships in cooperation with relevant CSOs/NGOs, cooperatives, 
farmer organizations, academia, research institutions in the agricultural sector (which also 
includes forestry and fishery) for inclusive, efficient, affordable and sustainable ICT services 
and initiatives in agriculture and rural development which will promote the wide scale use of 
ICT and foster sustainable agri-business models.”

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The 17 SDGs are outlined in transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.27 
The 2030 Agenda, which was agreed upon by the 193 countries of the United Nations General 
Assembly, is centred on the pledge to “leave no one behind”. Several SDGs and their targets 
directly relate to the achievement of both gender equality and equitable access to information 
and communication. SDG5, which is dedicated to the achievement of gender equality and the 
empowerment of all women and girls, includes a specific target on enhancing the use of ICTs 
to promote women’s empowerment. According to UN Women, “digital solutions can contribute 
directly to all the [SDGs] and to over half of the 169 targets through the potential of these solutions to 
improve people’s quality of life, foster equitable growth and protect the environment” (UN Women, 
2016, p.1). The 2030 Agenda calls for the mainstreaming of a gender perspective across all of the 
goals, stating that “[the] achievement of full human potential and of sustainable development is 
not possible if one half of humanity continues to be denied its full human rights and opportunities.” 
Sustainable Development Goals: selected goals and targets
SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
• Target 5.B: Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and 
communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women
SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and 
foster innovation
• Target 9.C: Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and 
strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries 
by 2020
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide 
access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
• Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at 
all levels

2015: Principles for Digital Development
The Principles for Digital Development were developed to help reduce the occurrence of 
predictable and preventable failures in digitally enabled development projects and programmes28. 
The set of nine principles, which were developed by the Principles for Digital Development Working 
Group, are intended as a living guidance to enable practitioners to successfully apply digital 
technologies to development programmes. They place special emphasis on the need to design 
solutions with users rather than for them. This strategy is key to ensuring that the needs of women 
and other marginalized groups are addressed. The Principles are currently endorsed by a number 
of private sector and non-profit actors, and several United Nations agencies. 
Principles for Digital Development
• Design With the User
• Understand the existing ecosystem
• Design for Scale
• Build for Sustainability
• Be Data Driven
• Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation
• Reuse and Improve
• Address Privacy & Security
• Be Collaborative

FAO IT/Digital Strategy 
The FAO IT/Digital Strategy recognizes the increasing importance of digital technologies to the 
Organization’s ability to deliver its services effectively and remain relevant. The strategy, which 
outlines the proposed approach FAO should take to digital transformation, proposes improvements 
to both internal processes and the field-level solutions offered by the Organization. At the field level, 
the strategy addresses the challenge of managing and scaling up individual projects’ successful 
innovations in ways that avoid wasteful duplication of efforts across the Organization. It proposes a 
tripartite approach to innovation management that involves information technology projects led 
by divisions; enhanced partnerships with key private sector actors and United Nations agencies; 
and the establishment of an innovation fund (FAO, 2017i).

PART II: THE FUTURE
37Much of the discourse around ICTs and rural development focuses on the potential of these 
technologies to accelerate development and stimulate positive change. However, it should be 
noted that ICTs are already affecting rural areas for better and for worse, in areas where they are 
in use and areas where they are absent. The increasingly knowledge-based global economy and 
the rapidly expanding influence of ICTs, mechanisation and automation on almost all aspects of 
people’s lives has consequences for everyone, not only those living near technology hubs. The 
sooner rural development actors come to terms with this fact, the better equipped they will be to 
respond appropriately to the challenges related to ICTs. 
In practice, determining the best way to incorporate ICTs into development efforts is a complex 
endeavour. On one hand, the information society is a reality that institutions and individual 
practitioners ignore at their own risk. Practitioners who continue to view ICTs as something that 
concerns only information technology specialists will both miss opportunities for enhancing the 
effectiveness of project and programme delivery, and ensure that their work becomes increasingly 
irrelevant. On the other hand, it is important to remember that ICTs are not self-determining forces 
of nature. They are tools for communication and information exchange that society is constantly 
developing, interacting with and learning to understand. ICTs tend to reproduce existing social 
dynamics, but they can also be shaped to reflect the highest ideals and serve common goals. 
The application of ICTs to rural development holds enormous potential for fostering major 
improvements in agriculture, rural livelihoods, food security and nutrition. They also create space 
for empowerment, improved quality of life, and a culture of inclusion to flourish among rural 
people. However, as of yet there is no unified approach to guide practitioners as they navigate the 
complexities inherent to working with ICTs in development contexts. The final two chapters of this 
paper argue that developing and implementing such a unified approach should be a priority for 
FAO and its partners. These chapters introduce the idea of inclusive ICT4D as a possible conceptual 
foundation to guide future efforts in this area. 
“FAO has a massive opportunity to exploit digital transformation to further its mission and not only to maintain 
its competitive advantage but also to extend it. Conversely, FAO cannot ignore the digital trend - it is not going 
to go away. FAO’s future impact will increasingly depend on its ability to leverage digital technologies rapidly. 
If FAO does not take this opportunity then others will, creating the risk of FAO’s products and services becoming 
increasingly irrelevant.”

The main conclusion of this paper, and the argument put forth in this chapter, is that a new 
approach is needed to ensure equitable, sustainable, ICT-enabled development in rural areas. This 
argument is based on a review of the current state of ICT access and use by rural men and women, 
and the strengths and gaps related to the application of ICTs in rural development practice.
Inclusive ICT4D is the idea that people-centred approaches, such as ComDev and other gender 
sensitive initiatives, should be integrated with the strategic application of ICTs throughout efforts 
to promote development and equal rights for all. Conceptually, it brings focus to two important 
points: 
• ICTs are not the exclusive purview of information technology specialists. They pertain to almost 
all aspects of socio-economic life, and consequently, to development. Development actors 
have a responsibility to at least be familiar with the ‘ICT toolbox’ if they are to select the most 
effective strategies for achieving results. 
• Top-down approaches to development are rarely effective or sustainable. Perhaps more 
importantly, they fail to acknowledge the ‘recipients’ of aid as active participants in their own 
development. These approaches increase the risk of interventions creating new problems or 
worsening inequality in communities. 
Inclusive ICT4D is born of the recognition that the primary focus of a project or programme should 
always be on identifying the most effective way to achieve positive impact for the people targeted 
by the intervention. An intervention’s impact cannot be considered positive if those it affects do 
not consent to and endorse the action, or if it benefits some to the detriment of others.
A conceptual framework and methodology are necessary to translate this idea into practice. 
This chapter attempts to make the case for FAO and its partners to develop an inclusive ICT4D 
approach and implement it throughout their work. Section 5.1 reviews a selection of potential 
ways in which ICTs can help to foster gender equality and empower rural women and other 
vulnerable groups. Section 5.2 examines the contribution that people-centred approaches that 
consider gender issues and ComDev, can make to ICT4D efforts. Section 5.3, which looks at the 
complementary aspects of gender- and communication-based approaches, proposes that a 
harmonized approach would contribute to enhanced effectiveness.5
395.1 How can ICTs enhance efforts to achieve gender equality and 
empower rural women? 
As discussed in Chapter 3, the nature of rural women and men’s engagement with ICTs often 
differs significantly from the development goals and objectives that practitioners have in mind 
when designing interventions that include ICT-related components. However, this disparity need 
not be an obstacle. Accounting for the interests and priorities of stakeholders can serve to 
strengthen intervention design, and increase the probability of uptake and active engagement 
from beneficiaries. This section discusses six major areas in which ICT-based solutions can support 
gender equality and women’s empowerment if participatory principles are properly applied:
1. Greater access to services 
Rural women face many barriers in accessing services, including health, education, and financial 
services. When women do gain access to these services, the potential benefits are great. Mobile 
financial services, for example, can help women to overcome mobility restrictions30 and save 
women significant amounts of time and money on transportation. These services increase women’s 
ability to open a bank account and access credit, and free up income to invest in their businesses 
and/or improve family food security. In addition to lowering transaction costs for providers and 
clients, mobile finance has made it easier for rural women to receive remittances from contacts 
overseas. It has also created new opportunities for them to participate in the labour force, including 
through remote work. Perhaps most importantly, evidence suggests that mobile finance allows 
women to gain greater control over their income by making it easier for them to save money and 
make their own decisions about how to spend it (World Bank, 2017).
2. Increased opportunities for learning and accessing information
A growing body of evidence suggests that ICT-based solutions may be key to bridging education 
and knowledge gaps for the most disadvantaged populations. These solutions can create 
opportunities for people who live in isolated areas or face time constraints to engage with content 
in ways that are flexible and best suit their needs. In addition to improving the physical accessibility 
of materials, ICTs can help to overcome the obstacle of illiteracy by making use of video, radio, 
and talking books (see Box 9) to produce information in local languages. Participatory radio has 
proven to be an especially effective tool for increasing rural people’s knowledge on agricultural 
practices, natural resource management, nutrition and other issues that affect their livelihoods. 
30  These can be both physical and social, and due to a number of factors, including excessive work burden and/or restrictive 
social norms.Box 10: How the Talking Book Technology Works
 “The Talking Book is a small portable recording device (12 cm × 12 cm × 6.5 cm, weighing 225 g without 
batteries), built to withstand dry dust storms and tropical rain, and storing 140 hours of audio content. It is 
affordable, simple to use, and runs on batteries. The device features indented touch buttons, to facilitate use by 
visually impaired people and by all users at night. With a simple audio menu offered in a range of local languages 
and dialects, users can select the information that interests them. The audio content can be replayed as needed, 
played for family and friends, and easily loaned to third parties.
The Talking Book disseminates information created and recorded by local experts for rural communities. 
Recordings may feature agricultural extension agents describing farming techniques—such as fertilizer 
preparation, seed spacing, and livestock care—or microfinance institutions offering business guidance and 
explaining topics such as credit and rotating savings plans.”
(World Bank, 2017, pp. 83-84)40ICT-based resources can also improve learner retention and engagement when they complement 
face-to-face learning. They can also facilitate the creation of interactive networks, in which users 
can consult with their peers and with experts on matters of interest to them. (FAO, 2011b; FRI, 2014a 
and 2014b; UNESCO, 2012; World Bank, 2017).
Figure 6: Potential contributions of ICTs to gender equality and women’s empowerment
3. Empowered rural organizations and social movements
New and traditional ICTs can greatly strengthen social networks, informal groups and rural 
organizations, which are central to the livelihoods and resilience of poor rural women and men. 
ICTs can enhance connectivity among family, friends and business contacts. New ICTs can also 
enable rural organizations to better serve a widely dispersed or isolated membership and provide 
new opportunities for training and adding value to local products so they can reach more lucrative 
markets. Online networks, radio and other media also make it possible for rural organizations and 
social movements to organize and share information more effectively, and amplify the voice of 
constituencies that normally remain unheard. GMMP (2015) points to a:
growing number of women who are turning their backs on traditional media and ‘doing 
it for themselves’, with an increasing proliferation of self-made online stations and podcasts, 
particularly aimed at women in rural communities that might otherwise be isolated. (p.53). 
4. More responsive and transparent governance
In addition to giving rural women and men a voice, ICTs create the possibility for them to 
demand accountability and engage in dialogue with local and national decision-makers. Digital 
technologies in particular can facilitate the implementation of measures to make governance and 
administrative processes more efficient and transparent. This could include, for example, making it 
easier for marginalized individuals and communities to record tenure rights. According to the World 
Bank (2017):
more accurate and transparent recordkeeping can identify the gender gaps in land 
administration and provide information to advocacy groups supporting women’s land rights. 
For women traders and entrepreneurs, increasing the efficiency of registering a business and 
conducting customs transactions can ease time burdens and may also reduce opportunities for 
corruption (p.82).
415. Enhanced capacity to fill key information gaps
The amount and types of data that can be gathered on the lives of rural women and men has 
greatly expanded with the advent of new ICTs, particularly mobile and satellite technologies. 
Perhaps more importantly, digital technologies have the capacity to process and analyse 
enormous quantities of highly detailed information. It is now possible to gain a far more nuanced 
understanding of the dynamics influencing major development challenges. A recent paper on the 
potential of ‘big data’ to help measure the well-being of women and girls considers several exciting 
prospects. For example, the use of satellite imagery could significantly improve the spatial resolution 
of country-level sex-disaggregated data, which would make it possible to more effectively support 
the targeting of local policies and programmes within countries. The correlation of geospatial data 
to social and health indicators, such as literacy and stunting, also allows for predictions to be made 
about areas for which data is not available. (Data2X, 2017).
6. Improved productivity, efficiency and resilience along agricultural value chains
For rural women and men, the application of ICTs to agriculture represents one of the broadest and 
most significant areas of the potential impact these technologies will have on their livelihoods. The 
versatile nature of ICTs makes them especially well-suited to addressing the complex challenges 
faced by women at all stages of agricultural value chains. Depending upon context, a variety of 
different solutions, which may include a combination of ICTs, can be used to address a given issue 
(e.g. increasing women’s access to production-related information). A single solution can also 
address several constraints at once, including constraints that cross several nodes of a value chain. 
For example, Farmerline’s Women Advancing Agriculture initiative uses voice-messaging technology 
to provide information on farming practices, weather, market prices, financial management and 
women’s health. Esoko’s mobile market information service provides commodity market prices, 
connects users with potential buyers and sellers of produce, and enables agricultural institutions 
to reach out to farmers. In addition to addressing visible bottlenecks, ICTs can also simultaneously 
address underlying constraints that negatively affect value chain functioning. For example, the 
potential of ICT applications to provide a necessary service and at the same time reduce gender-
based constraints, such as time poverty and limited mobility, can represent an efficient and cost-
effective way to promote sustainable and gender-equitable value chain development. (FAO, 
2016f; World Bank, 2017).
5.2 How can gender and communication contribute to ICT4D?
ICT projects are complex and highly risky to implement. They have high failure rates in both 
the public and private sector. In a 2011 evaluation of all of its ICT-related work, the World Bank 
acknowledged the ‘high-risk/high-reward profile’ of ICTs (IEG, 2011). The evaluation noted that 
despite the significant potential benefits offered by ICT applications, almost half of the World Bank’s 
projects with ICT components had design shortcomings that could affect outcomes. The report 
also found that modest project results were often due to a failure to “take a holistic view of linkages 
between sector and IT components” (p.xvi). It is worth noting that of the 11 recurring design and 
‘linkage’ problems identified in the evaluation, at least eight might have been mitigated (or even 
eliminated) by incorporating a gender-sensitive, communication-focused approach to design 
and implementation. These are discussed in Table 1.42Table 1: The value of people-centred approaches in ICT projects
Common issues affecting ICT  
project outcomes (IEG, 2011)What Gender and Communication  
have to offer
• Excessive complexity and number of 
components
• Insufficient readiness of client for 
implementation 
• Failure to account for capabilities and 
needs
• Inappropriate capacity building 
• Neglecting country, social, economic and 
cultural context
• Absence of a clear ICT strategy and 
policyBy focusing on the needs, priorities and preferences of stakeholders, 
the analytical tools used in development communication and 
gender-based approaches help to ensure the relevance and 
effectiveness of project design. The use of participatory methods to 
analyse local gender and power dynamics or assess capacity levels 
and communication needs can provide project managers with the 
necessary information to determine the most appropriate project 
strategy, activities, and modalities of implementation. In-depth 
knowledge of the local context allows practitioners to assess risks 
and identify solutions early on rather than attempting to take 
corrective action later.
• Poor ownership and commitment
• Lack of attention to change management 
processesAmple evidence suggests that appropriate, gender-sensitive 
targeting and the adoption of inclusive, two-way communication 
methods is key to ensuring mutual understanding and building 
consensus among all stakeholders, which in turn enhances the 
likelihood that stakeholders will be engaged and committed to 
achieving project objectives. A strong sense of ownership among 
everyone involved is central to the success of any change process, 
and also helps to ensure sustainability beyond the end of the 
intervention.
• Procurement delays
• Cumbersome processes and procurement 
in a rapidly evolving sector
• Limited information technology sector 
skillsSome implementation bottlenecks relate more to the machinery 
of development interventions than they do to local context and 
stakeholders, and as such require solutions of a different nature.
However, it is also worth remembering that both gender and 
communication are fundamentally about people, and as such, 
their relevance extends beyond the realm of beneficiaries and 
development targets to include all actors involved in the practice 
of development. The functioning of organizational procurement 
and human resource processes is not only sensitive to cultures of 
inequality and inefficient communication, it also reproduces these 
at the level of project and programme delivery. A lack of attention 
to these issues not only affects the ability of a project to achieve 
planned outcomes, it also creates the risk of causing or exacerbating 
inequality beyond the scope of the project.a

2013. For resources on implementing gender-responsive procurement and incorporating gender into public sector 
management, see ADB, 2012 and the UN Women web page on gender-responsive procurement at: www.unwomen.org/
en/about-us/procurement/gender-responsive-procurement.
In theory, gender and communication are often mainstreamed into ICT projects. However, there 
is often a limited understanding of these concepts and a lack of political will to implement the 
needed measures so that they are fully integrated into proposed activities. This often means that 
gender and communication remain present only at the most superficial level. They are simply 
‘buzz words’ to be mentioned from time to time. However, considerable evidence suggests that 
ignoring the specificities of local contexts and adopting a one-way or top-down approach to 
communication increases the likelihood of project failure and/or unintended consequences for 
affected communities. 43
ICT initiatives that do not take measures to capture women’s voices are likelier to reflect men’s 
needs and priorities. This strengthens the association between men and technology, reinforces 
men’s control over information, and potentially accentuates existing inequalities in access to ICTs 
and other vital resources. Even initiatives aimed specifically at rural women run the risk of being co-
opted by men or thwarted entirely if local power dynamics, norms and values are not accounted 
for, and community members are not adequately engaged throughout the implementation 
process. As Mefalopulos (2008) points out, “When not involved from the beginning, stakeholders 
tend to be more suspicious of project activities and less prone to support them” (p.9). Mefalopulos 
also highlights several sources that confirm a causal relationship between lack of stakeholder 
involvement and project and programme failure, and other studies that suggest that top-down 
management approaches to development are less effective than participatory ones. 
5.3 Gender analysis and communication for development?
The core principle in social and anthropological theory is that it is not just what people say that 
is relevant, but also what they do and how their environment influences their range of choices. 
Gender analysis brings focus to the importance of understanding context to ensure appropriate 
project design and implementation. Gender analysis helps practitioners obtain information on the Box 11: Gender-sensitivity and communication are not necessarily ‘expensive’
Evidence from as early as the 1980s suggests that the involvement and active participation of local stakeholders 
in development interventions has led to “much more [being] achieved with much less, even in sheer financial 
terms” (Rahnema, 1993). And yet, it is still common among development practitioners to perceive inclusive, 
participatory approaches to development as desirable but financially impracticable. The three examples below call 
this assumption into question. 
Farm Radio International (FRI) has conducted several impact evaluations of the participatory radio campaigns 
(PRCs) it supports.  The results of these evaluations  suggest that PRCs can be a highly effective  method for reducing 
(or even eliminating) the gender knowledge gap and stimulating uptake of agricultural innovations. The findings 
also point to the cost-effectiveness and broad reach of the approach. An evaluation of four demand-driven PRCs 
that promoted climate-smart and nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices in Ethiopia, Malawi, Uganda and the 
United Republic of Tanzania found that the campaigns reached an estimated 2 million listeners at a cost of USD 
0.03 per  listener. The  cost of reaching a  listener who practiced  one of the  improvements  discussed  on the radio was 
USD 0.70 (FRI, 2014a). In Ethiopia, a study of a PRC on the introduction of row planting for teff farming found that 
about 800 000 farmers introduced the technique as a result of exposure to the PRC, at a cost of about USD 0.50 per 
adopting farmer, and with an income gain for farmers of about USD 50 per hectare (FRI, 2014b).
The FAO-Dimitra Clubs approach has a well-established record of applying development communication methods 
to strengthen the livelihoods of rural women and men, promote gender equality and stimulate a broad range of 
other positive impacts in the communities reached by the project (see Chapter 4). The costs of implementing the 
approach can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the country of implementation, the ‘remoteness’ 
of target areas and the capacity levels of local partners. However, a rough estimate puts the cost of creating a club 
and supporting it for two years between USD 1 000 and 3 000 (Dimitra Team, personal communication, 2017). 
Considering that many of the clubs become self-sustaining after the initial two-year period of support, and their 
impact is felt not only by the clubs’ members, but the entire community, the investment to impact ratio can be 
considered extremely favourable.
The 5Q Approach, which was developed in collaboration by two CGIAR research programmes, the International 
Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), as a way 
to monitor large-scale agricultural projects, uses a combination of participatory methods and low-cost ICTs. The 
approach is designed to be simpler, more adaptable, responsive, effective and inclusive than traditional monitoring 
and evaluation methods. It enables development actors to adjust programme activities as necessary throughout 
project implementation and gather valuable information that can contribute to the fight against poverty and 
hunger. Unlike traditional monitoring and evaluation methods, the 5Q approach becomes increasingly cost-
effective as the number of stakeholders being surveyed increases. Gathering feedback from 1 000 farmers through 
five rounds of data collection costs an estimated USD 44 000 total, but doing the same with 10 000 farmers only 
raises the estimated total to USD 55 000 (CGIAR, n.d.).44risks and opportunities an intervention is likely to face. It considers a range of factors including the 
division of productive, reproductive, and community labour; access to and control over resources 
and income; distribution of decision-making power; and local norms and customs. Gathering this 
type of information also helps to uncover constraints and vulnerabilities (both gender-related and 
non) that may lead to the exclusion of some stakeholders if not addressed. 
There are well-established methods for conducting gender analysis to identify stakeholder needs 
and constraints. However, the process of developing and implementing solutions to address 
these constraints remains a major challenge for practitioners working to empower rural women 
and achieve gender equality. The identification of solutions tends to be left up to the ingenuity 
of practitioners. This frequently leads to ‘cookie-cutter approaches’ that attempt to replicate 
documented good practices, often with mixed results. The locus of the problem lies in the fact that 
most gender-based constraints relate to complex and deeply entrenched social norms, values 
and power dynamics, which by nature are difficult to tackle and highly resistant to change. 
As a discipline centred on the process of effecting change, development communication provides 
a useful methodology and tools to address this gap. ComDev initiatives tend to focus on fostering 
inclusive dialogue and exchanges, developing two-way communication, and promoting collaboration 
among stakeholders rather than implementing top-down training sessions or information dissemination 
campaigns. Instead of attempting to ‘sell’ a predetermined message to stakeholders, the approach 
encourages them to participate actively in the process of questioning the status quo, gathering 
and exchanging information, determining priorities and formulating solutions. Evidence suggests 
that adopting this approach leads to more profound and long-lasting transformation. For example, 
communities with active Dimitra Clubs have implemented changes that address some of the most 
intractable issues faced by rural women today, including insecure access to land, information and 
education, uneven distribution of decision-making power, and harmful practices such as gender-
based violence and female genital mutilation (FAO, 2016c; ONG AEDL & APEBA, 2015).

implementing inclusive ICT4D
FAO has a major opportunity to be at the forefront of efforts to apply ICTs to rural development and 
bridge the gender and rural-urban divide in the information society. The Organization’s experience 
in the area of hunger reduction and rural development, its pioneering contributions to the field 
of development communication, and its long-standing role as a champion of equality and the 
rights of rural women and other vulnerable groups put it in a unique position to lead the process 
of developing and implementing a more inclusive, effective and sustainable approach to ICT4D.
This chapter proposes a series of recommended actions for FAO and its partners to harmonize 
their efforts in the area of ICT4D. Section 6.1 focuses on building the necessary knowledge base to 
inform the development of a more equitable approach to ICT4D. Section 6.2 outlines key actions 
for implementing and institutionalizing such an approach. 
“Access to the internet is critical, but not sufficient. The digital economy also requires a strong analog foundation, 
consisting of regulations that create a vibrant business climate and let firms leverage digital technologies to 
compete and innovate; skills that allow workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants to seize opportunities in the 
digital world; and accountable institutions that use the internet to empower citizens […][These factors] are the 
foundation of economic development. But digital technologies add two important dimensions. First, they raise the 
opportunity cost of not undertaking the necessary reforms. They amplify the impact of good (and bad) policies, so 
any failure to reform means falling farther behind those who do reform. With digital technologies, the stakes have 
risen for developing countries, which have more to gain than high-income countries, but also more to lose. Second, 
while digital technologies are no shortcut to development, they can be an enabler and perhaps an accelerator by 
raising the quality of the complements.” 
 (World Bank, 2016. p. 4)
6.1 Increasing knowledge on gender and ICTs in rural development 
FAO is a global hub for knowledge and information about rural development. It is ideally placed to 
promote ‘first mile’ thinking and advocate for the inclusion of rural women and men’s perspectives, 
priorities, and needs in the conversation about ICT4D. The first step in achieving this is to address 
the scarcity of available evidence on rural women and men’s adoption and use of ICTs, and the 
impact of ICT-related development interventions in rural contexts. 6
46Build evidence on existing patterns of ICT access and use among rural women and men
FAO can step up efforts to expand the knowledge base on the role of ICTs in rural areas and 
support the design of projects and programmes in a number of ways.
• Multicountry studies like the one carried out by FAO on mobile phone use among poor rural 
women and men in Asia (FAO, IDRC and LIRNEasia, 2016) should be replicated in other regions 
and expanded to include information on the use of other ICTs. 
• Individual projects and programmes can produce detailed information on gender and ICTs at 
the local level in a number of ways. By carrying out surveys on gender and ICT from the early 
stages of implementation, practitioners can create a baseline to measure impact against 
in later stages and gather valuable contextual information to inform project design. In 2017, 
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) published the Gender and 
ICT Survey Toolkit, which provides guidance on survey preparation, data collection and data 
analysis, and a suite of quantitative and qualitative tools for exploring a variety of thematic 
areas.31 Practitioners should also keep in mind that ICTs are not just for information dissemination. 
New ICTs lend themselves to two-way information exchange. ICT projects and programmes 
that incorporate a data collection aspect will be able to respond and adapt to identified 
issues throughout implementation, and have the potential to capture valuable information 
about the context in which they are operating (World Bank, 2017).
• National Statistics Offices  and other partners at the country level should be supported to 
incorporate data collection on indicators related to gender and ICT in rural areas. FAO can also 
advocate for the inclusion of rural women and men in data collection on ICT and contribute to 
efforts to improve the availability and quality of ICT indicators and data in developing countries 
by joining the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development32.
• FAO can also leverage existing partnerships with media to increase the visibility of rural women 
in conversations about the digital divide. 
Take stock of FAO’s work related to ICT
There is currently no centralized mechanism guiding and tracking work related to ICT4D within 
FAO. Interventions with ICT components can be found throughout the work of the Organization 
in all regions. FAO should take stock of existing projects and programmes with ICT components to 
get a better sense of the current state of ICT4D within the Organization, highlight ongoing efforts, 
promote knowledge exchange, and streamline future efforts in this area.

that caused project delays of more than 20 years. The company’s cost estimate for these delays is USD 278 million. 
Currently Hydro-Quebec and indigenous people in Canada have developed a working partnership that allows a 
dialog aimed at addressing issues from both perspectives and that has eliminated most of the past problems and 
conflicts. (Mefalopulos, 2008, p. 136)47A future step will be to evaluate the impact of these interventions, 
both in terms of the success and sustainability of the intervention, 
and in terms of the positive or negative impacts felt by the 
community in which the intervention took place. There is no 
established theoretical model for assessing the gendered impact 
of ICTs in communities (S. Cardey, personal communication, 
2017). It may be of special interest to develop and test out such 
a model as part of this investigation. An attempt should also be 
made to capture local values and priorities in measuring the 
success or failure of each intervention. As discussed in Chapter 3, 
community measures of success often differ significantly from the 
individualistic development standards applied by practitioners.
Put together a business case for inclusive ICT4D
Chapter 5 outlines a number of sound reasons for mainstreaming gender and communication 
into projects with ICT components. However, the most effective way to convince decision-
makers to invest in making systemic changes is to provide concrete information on the costs 
and benefits involved in implementing such an approach. A strong business case will:
• compare implementation costs to achieved outcomes in projects that do implement the 
approach; and
• compare the results achieved by these interventions with those attained by similar projects 
that do not include gender or communication components. 
The strength of gender-transformative and development communication approaches rests 
largely on the prevention of negative impacts and on the achievement of ‘intangible’ results, 
such as empowerment and social cohesion. For this reason, it is essential that the business case 
contain both of the analytical dimensions listed above. Mefalopulos (2008) suggests that:
The impact of communication becomes more apparent when reviewing the significant body 
of evidence about the cost of non-communication, indicating how much time and money 
have been wasted because of problems that could have been avoided if communication 
approaches had been applied from the beginning of the initiative (p. 136.). 
Decision-makers can be more effectively motivated to implement substantive changes if they 
are helped to see not only the moral imperative and development potential for mainstreaming 
gender and communication, but also the costs that are already being sustained through 
inaction on these issues.“Without data there is no visibility; 
without visibility there is no priority 
The paucity of sex-disaggregated 
ICT data, particularly from 
developing countries, makes it 
difficult, if not impossible, to make 
the case to policymakers for their 
consideration of gender-related 
issues in ICT policies, plans and 
strategies.”
(UNCTAD, 2014. p.3.)486.2 Harmonizing efforts and promoting inclusion throughout ICT-
related work
The complex and rapidly evolving nature of ICTs has left most practitioners without a solid theoretical 
base or institutional approach to guide the design of ICT-related interventions. As a result, the 
implementation of ICT4D interventions across most sectors tends to occur in a disjointed and 
uneven manner. Providing a methodological and institutional foundation to guide ICT4D efforts 
and ensure their inclusivity is essential to enhancing capacity on all sides and scaling up this area 
of work throughout FAO. 
Develop evidence-based guidelines on inclusive ICT4D 
To mainstream an inclusive ICT4D approach throughout ICT-related rural development interventions, 
the first step is to provide a conceptual framework, methodology and tools that FAO practitioners 
and rural development partners can refer to for guidance. A useful set of guidelines on inclusive 
ICT4D could be developed by:
• Building upon existing conceptual foundations: It should be kept in mind that much of the 
conceptual work on the requirements for inclusive ICT4D in rural development has already been 
done. A literature review of existing resources, including several seminal FAO publications33 
and good practices collected by the e-Agriculture community, can provide a selection of 
guiding principles and recommended methods to refine and update as necessary. 
• Incorporating up-to-date evidence : To be effective, an inclusive ICT4D approach needs to be 
based on solid core principles and at the same time remain responsive to rapid changes in the 
field of ICT. The guidelines should be formulated based on the types of information discussed 
in Section 6.1. The guidelines would address current realities and challenges and then be 
updated at least once every 5 years to reflect social and technological developments.
• Working with key development partners and experts: Several of the partners FAO works with 
in the United Nation system, the research community and academia partners have extensive 
ICT4D knowledge and experience that can complement the Organization’s rural development 
expertise. They can make a significant methodological contribution to the process of converting 
a broad collection of principles, methods and information into a coherent approach.
Institutionalize inclusive ICT4D in the work of FAO
The FAO IT/Digital Strategy mentions harnessing new ICTs to enhance rural development efforts. 
However, the Organization does not yet have a comprehensive policy covering all aspects of 
ICT4D and all types of ICTs, including non-digital ICTs, such as radio. Such a policy would do much 
to harmonize ICT4D efforts, permit effective monitoring and enhance the overall impact of the 
Organizations’s work, especially if it is based on the principles of inclusive ICT4D.
• Relevant international commitments made by FAO should form the basis for the policy. These 
include, but are not limited to: the Beijing Platform for Action, the Geneva Declaration of 
Principles and Tunis Commitment, the Rome Consensus, the WSIS +10 vision for WSIS beyond 
2015, and the SDGs
• The Principles for Digital Development should be endorsed by FAO. Together with the guidelines 
for inclusive ICT4D, these can be used to inform the implementation strategy and monitoring 
plan that accompany the policy. 
It is also recommended that future updates or new iterations of existing sector-specific policies 
33 See: Richardson and Paisley, 1998; FAO, 2003d; FAO, 2003e; FAO, 2015a49within FAO take the opportunity to integrate the principles of inclusive ICT4D. These include, but 
are not limited to: 
• The FAO Policy on Gender Equality.  The policy currently does not address directly technical 
issues, but it does outline a number of objectives and minimum standards that are related 
to achieving improvements in this area. To effectively work toward inclusive ICT4D, both this 
policy and the 2000 Strategy for Action on the role of information for gender and food security 
(see Chapter 4) would need to be combined with auxiliary policy commitments to address 
issues of ICT access and use or rural women’s representation in the media. 
• The FAO IT/Digital Strategy: The strategy currently does 
not elaborate a plan for ensuring the inclusiveness of 
its proposed activities. Mainstreaming people-centred 
approaches, such as gender-sensitive initiatives and 
development communication, into the process of scaling up 
innovation and sustainable ICT-based solutions throughout 
the Organization’s work is essential. This could be achieved 
by either updating the current strategy or integrating it with 
the proposed overall policy on ICT4D. “ICTs enable the production of 
different experiences of being human, 
and consequently new and different 
knowledge about ourselves and the 
nature of gender. They expand the 
possibilities of human identity.”

communication in rural areas 
Mass media (commercial, private, public) 
Radio • One of the most powerful and accessible means for reaching isolated rural areas; a 
channel for education, awareness-raising and knowledge acquisition; a tool for 
influencing the dynamics of social relations and addressing gender inequalities; close to 
listeners in the case of rural and community-based radio. 
• Issues to consider: many women do not own a radio and/or have no access to one; 
languages in which programmes are broadcast; need to choose topics of interest to 
women or young people (male and female); can be combined with other channels of 
communication to enable interaction (e.g. listeners’ clubs). 
Television • Channel for propaganda, great impact (positive or negative) on young people; 
awareness-raising and source of knowledge; a persuasive and attractive method for 
drawing policymakers’ attention to issues relating to rural populations, especially 
women. 
• Issues to consider: absence of coverage and electricity in rural areas, and hence lack 
of accessibility; expensive to produce/receive; rural and agricultural issues (and 
rural women in particular) not covered; often monopolised by powerful interests; no 
interaction with viewers. 
Press • Dissemination of news; possible role in a democratic context with a critical or 
opposition press. 
• Issues to consider: illiteracy, especially among women; print media not distributed in 
rural areas; cost. 
Traditional media
Song, dance, music, 
stories, poetry, 
masks, proverbs, 
puppets, etc. • For generations, rural populations, both men and women, have relied on oral traditions 
and other traditional forms of communication as a means of sharing knowledge and 
information and providing entertainment. They are important channels for promoting 
learning, behavioural change and participation. Traditional communicators are 
respected and influential. 
• Issues to consider: traditional channels of communication may lack prestige compared 
with modern media; they require close collaboration between development practitioners 
and traditional folk artists and, above all, a great deal of skill to incorporate 
development messages advocating change (in gender roles, for example). 
Audio-visual and written tools (support materials) 
• Valuable for motivating and assisting in training and working groups, as well as promoting self-confidence and 
empowerment; cheap; persuasive; enable interaction; equipment now more affordable, lighter and more suitable 
for use with women and men in rural areas. 
• Issues to consider: to be used at the most convenient times and places for community members, particularly 
women, who often have less free time; cost of the equipment; training needed for participatory use of these 
media; men and women must be able to identify with the images and topics chosen. 
Film screenings Video 
forums Generate enthusiasm because seen as an ‘event’; used to relay information and stimulate 
debate; can be used to discuss problems and as the first step to raising awareness; separate 
screenings and debates for men and women, depending on the topics discussed. 
Photographs Picture 
boxes Participatory 
video A range of uses for various purposes: picture box for technical illustration, to visualise a 
situation (photos, photo novels, illustrations). These materials can be produced by the 
populations themselves. Rapid developments in small-format technology mean that 
participatory video or photography is a powerful means of communication which can help 
communities  take ownership of their  own development;  it can also help  to enhance  women’s 
status within their communities and organisations. 
Posters, leaflets  Allow a simple message to be conveyed in multiple locations simultaneously; can be made 
visually appealing through balanced use of text (kept to a minimum) and illustration (as 
many photos and pictures as possible). 56Communication methods
• Communication methods and knowledge-sharing tools boost self-confidence and enable interaction, exchange, 
debate, collaboration, participation, etc. 
• Issues to consider: these methods and tools often require a high level of gender awareness and sensitivity to 
group and interpersonal dynamics. Women are often subject to various kinds of constraints that prevent them 
from travelling outside their village for visits, training or events. Speaking in front of mixed groups may be 
problematic. These constraints must be addressed in order to foster active participation by women and young 
people. The language of communication must be the everyday language of the community. 
Group discussions, 
debateOpportunities to get people together (large or small groups, mixed or single-sex). Issues 
to consider: risk of the discussion being monopolised and the “powerless” (often young 
people and women) having no say; some subjects are off-limits. 
Theatre-debate Can be produced and acted by the population with the help of a drama team and followed 
up with fruitful discussions. Possibility of forming separate groups. 
Exchange visits, 
trainingHelp to raise awareness and enable exchange of experiences and solutions; participants 
feel comfortable about speaking because they are familiar with the subject matter; widens 
horizons; unlocks potential. 
Fairs, events Opportunity to highlight experiences and reach a large audience (through advertising); 
boost self-confidence and self-esteem. Issues to consider: mobility issues for some groups 
within the population; offering guidance and assistance at the fair/event to make it easier 
for everyone to participate, using tools such as the World Café, the carrousel, peer assist, 
proverbs, knowledge tree, etc. (see tools at www.kstoolkit.org). 
New Information and Communication Technologies (new ICTs) 
Mobile telephones, 
telecentres, networks, 
Internet, etc. • Used effectively, new ICTs can help to combat isolation, forge alliances, create 
platforms, promote knowledge of the world and boost empowerment. 
• Issues to consider: cost, inaccessibility in rural areas, illiteracy (particularly among 
women), lack of user training and infrastructure, languages used.

Action
J. Women and the media
234. During the past decade, advances in information technology have facilitated a global 
communications network that transcends national boundaries and has an impact on public policy, 
private attitudes and behaviour, especially of children and young adults. Everywhere the potential 
exists for the media to make a far greater contribution to the advancement of women. 
235. More women are involved in careers in the communications sector, but few have attained 
positions at the decision-making level or serve on governing boards and bodies that influence 
media policy. The lack of gender sensitivity in the media is evidenced by the failure to eliminate 
the gender-based stereotyping that can be found in public and private local, national and 
international media organizations. 
236. The continued projection of negative and degrading images of women in media 
communications - electronic, print, visual and audio - must be changed. Print and electronic media 
in most countries do not provide a balanced picture of women’s diverse lives and contributions to 
society in a changing world. In addition, violent and degrading or pornographic media products 
are also negatively affecting women and their participation in society. Programming that reinforces 
women’s traditional roles can be equally limiting. The world-wide trend towards consumerism has 
created a climate in which advertisements and commercial messages often portray women 
primarily as consumers and target girls and women of all ages inappropriately. 
237. Women should be empowered by enhancing their skills, knowledge and access to information 
technology. This will strengthen their ability to combat negative portrayals of women internationally 
and to challenge instances of abuse of the power of an increasingly important industry. Self-
regulatory mechanisms for the media need to be created and strengthened and approaches 
developed to eliminate gender-biased programming. Most women, especially in developing 
countries, are not able to access effectively the expanding electronic information highways and 
therefore cannot establish networks that will provide them with alternative sources of information. 
Women therefore need to be involved in decision-making regarding the development of the new 
technologies in order to participate fully in their growth and impact. 
238. In addressing the issue of the mobilization of the media, Governments and -99- other actors 
should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in policies and 
programmes. 
Strategic objective J.1. Increase the participation and access of women to expression and 
decisionmaking in and through the media and new technologies of communication

Priority Theme: “Participation in and access of women to the media, and information and 
communication technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement 
and empowerment of women”
“1. The Commission on the Status of Women recalls and reiterates the strategic objectives and 
actions of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome document adopted at 
the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled “Gender equality, development 
and peace in the twenty-first century”, on the potential of the media and of information and 
communications technologies to contribute to the advancement and empowerment of women. 
It also recalls the United Nations Millennium Declaration and its Development Goals to promote 
gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger 
and disease, to stimulate development that is truly sustainable and to ensure that the benefits of 
new technologies, especially information and communications technologies, are available to all. 
2. The Commission notes that, globally, there are substantial differences in participation in, 
access to and use of media and information and communications technologies, their content 
and production. Such differences have important implications for policy development at 
national, regional and international levels. A focus on the gender dimensions of information and 
communications technologies is essential in order to prevent and combat any adverse impact 
of the digital revolution on gender equality and the perpetuation of existing inequalities and 
discrimination, including the sexual exploitation of women both through the traditional media 
and new technologies. The media and information and communication technologies also offer 
tools for enhancing women’s full access to the benefits of information and new technologies and 
can become central tools for women’s empowerment and the promotion of gender equality. 
Efforts are therefore necessary to increase women’s access to and participation in the media and 
information and communication technologies, including in their decision-making processes and 
new opportunities created through information and communication technologies. 
3. The Commission welcomes the convening of the World Summit on the Information Society, 
which is to be held in Geneva in December 2003 and in Tunis in 2005, and urges all participants to 
take the following recommendations into account and to integrate gender perspectives in every 
facet of the Summit. It further encourages the participation of women in the Summit, to include 
significant numbers of gender equality experts and women experts in the field of information and 
communication technology as members of national delegations, organizations of civil society and 
the business community. 
4. The Commission urges Governments and, as appropriate, the relevant funds and programmes, 
organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations system, the international financial 
institutions, civil society, including the private sector and non-governmental organizations, and 
other stakeholders, to take the following actions: 
a. Prioritize the integration of gender perspectives and ensure women’s early and full participation 
in the development and implementation of national policies, legislation, programmes, 
projects, strategies and regulatory and technical instruments in the field of information and 
communication technologies (ICT) and media and communications, and create monitoring 
and accountability mechanisms to ensure implementation of gender-sensitive policies and 62regulations as well as to analyse the gender impact of such policies in consultation and 
collaboration with women information technology specialists, women’s organizations and 
gender equality advocates; 
b. Encourage regulatory bodies, where they exist, to promote full participation of women in the 
ownership, control and management in the ICT and media sectors; 
c. Include gender perspectives and measurable gender-specific targets in all programmes and 
projects on ICT for development, as well as specific activities, as appropriate, for women and 
girls as active users of information; 
d. Remove ICT-related infrastructural barriers that disproportionately affect women and girls 
and promote the establishment of affordable and accessible ICT-related infrastructure for all 
women and girls, bearing in mind the specific needs and interests of women and girls living in 
countries in the process of peace-building and reconstruction; 
e. Invite, as appropriate, through partnerships, or through the use of self-regulatory gender-
sensitive guidelines and self-regulatory gender-sensitive guidelines for media coverage and 
representation, public and community media to work in support of gender equality, bearing in 
mind the importance of providing financial resources and other support; 
f. Support research into all aspects of the impact of the media and ICT on women and girls, in 
particular into their information needs and interests, review existing media and ICT policies 
and find ways to adapt ICT to the needs of poor and, in particular, illiterate women, in order to 
overcome barriers and support women’s empowerment; 
g. Make education, formal and non-formal, a priority in particular for the development of ICT and 
take measures to promote girls’ education so as to enable girls and women to gain access to 
ICT; 
h. Include, at appropriate levels of government, ICT education for girls and women in curricula at 
all educational levels, from early childhood to tertiary level, as well as in continuing education, 
in order to promote and ensure women’s full participation in the information society; 
i. Take concrete steps to increase the number of female students at all educational levels in 
media- and ICT-related subjects, including science, mathematics and technology, including 
through such methods as distance- and e-learning; 
j. Establish or, where they already exist, expand skills training, vocational and employment training 
and capacity-building programmes for women and girls and women’s non-governmental 
organizations on the use, design and production of ICT, including preparing them to take 
on leadership roles and promote their participation in the political process, and integrate a 
gender perspective in ICT training programmes for teachers and in training programmes for 
media professionals; 
k. Enable equal access for women to ICT-based economic activities, such as small business and 
homebased employment, to information systems and improved technologies and to new 
employment opportunities in this area, and consider developing tele-centres, information 
centres, community access points and business incubators; 
l. Strengthen partnerships among all stakeholders to build the capacity of women to fully 63participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the information society, including e-governance, 
where it exists and as it is developed, and participatory approaches; 
m. Ensure equal opportunities for women and monitor gender representation in different 
categories and levels of work, education and training in the media and ICT areas, with a view 
to increasing women’s participation in decision-making at all levels of ICT and the media; 
n. Provide management, negotiation and leadership training for women, as well as mentoring 
systems and other support strategies and programmes to enhance women’s capabilities and 
potential for advancement in the media and ICT sectors; 
o. Take effective measures, to the extent consistent with freedom of expression, to combat 
the growing sexualization and use of pornography in media content, in terms of the rapid 
development of ICT, encourage the media to refrain from presenting women as inferior beings 
and exploiting them as sexual objects and commodities, combat ICT- and media-based 
violence against women, including criminal misuse of ICT for sexual harassment, 3 sexual 
exploitation and trafficking in women and girls, and support the development and use of ICT 
as a resource for the empowerment of women and girls, including those affected by violence, 
abuse and other forms of sexual exploitation; 
p. Respect the value of different and local languages and promote and encourage local 
knowledge systems and locally produced content in media and communications, support the 
development of a wide range of ICT-based programmes in local languages, as appropriate, 
with content relevant to different groups of women, and build the capacity of girls and women 
to develop ICT content; 
q. Encourage South-South cooperation to facilitate transfer and exchange of low-cost 
technologies and appropriate ICT content between developing countries for the benefit of 
women and girls; 
r. Strengthen and encourage the use of existing information and communication technologies, 
such as radio, television, telecommunications and print, in parallel in order to enhance the use 
of new technologies for gender equality and the economic, political and social empowerment 
of women as leaders, participants and consumers and recognize that women and girls are 
potentially large-scale consumers, users and producers of ICT and media; 
s. Collect, share, positively recognize and widely publicize good practices to counter gender 
stereotyping, negative portrayals and exploitation of women in all forms of the media and ICT 
as part of their efforts to eliminate discrimination and violence against women; 
t. Increase efforts to compile, and disaggregate by sex and age, statistics on ICT use, in order to 
develop gender-specific indicators on ICT use and needs and to collect gender-specific data 
on employment and education patterns in the media and in ICT professions; 
u. Provide adequate and appropriate resources for innovative, affordable, accessible and 
sustainable media and ICT programmes, projects and products that support gender equality 
and gender mainstreaming, are relevant to the concerns of women and girls and provide 
support to women’s online communities and networks that promote gender equality; 
v. Prioritize the allocation of resources to support programmes, projects and strategies that 
aim at increasing women’s participation in, and equal access to, the information society, 64including vocational, scientific and technical training, literacy training and capacity-building 
programmes; 
w. Enhance, for the benefit of women and girls, international cooperation in support of national 
efforts to create an enabling environment to reduce the digital and information divide between 
developed and developing countries and promote, develop and enhance access to ICT, 
including the Internet infrastructure by facilitating access to, and transfer of, knowledge and 
technology on concessional, preferential and favourable terms to the developing countries, 
as mutually agreed, taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights and 
the special needs of developing countries; 
x. Strengthen the capacity of national machineries for the advancement of women, including 
through the allocation of adequate and appropriate resources and the provision of technical 
expertise, to take a lead advocacy role with respect to media and ICT and gender equality,

Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have 
made information available to more people than ever before. These 
advances have also substantially increased their capacity to connect 
with each other in a continuously expanding number of ways.
Rural women are currently (and have always been) last in line in terms 
of ICT access and use, even though women stand more to gain than 
most from active participation and engagement with these resources.  
Evidence suggests that the ICT sector is both urban- and male-centric, 
ranging from the design of  ICTs to the gender of sector employees and 
decision-makers. Representation in the media is also predominantly 
male. 
The aim of this paper is to bring rural communities, and women and 
other marginalized groups in particular, back into the centre of 
conversations on ICTs and ICT4D
