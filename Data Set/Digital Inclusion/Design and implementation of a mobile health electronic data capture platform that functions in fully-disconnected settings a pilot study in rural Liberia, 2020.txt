Abstract
Background: Mobile phones and personal digital assistants have been used for data collection in developing world
settings for over three decades, and have become increasingly common. However, the use of electronic data
capture (EDC) through mobile phones is limited in many areas by inconsistent network connectivity and poor
access to electricity, which thwart data transmission and device usage. This is the case in rural Liberia, where many
health workers live and work in areas without any access to cellular connectivity or reliable power. Many existing
EDC mobile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected settings, allowing a user to collect data while out
of range of a cell tower and transmit data to a central server when he/she regains a network connection. However,
few tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-disconnected settings, where a user will never have access to
the internet or a cell network. This led us to create and implement an EDC software tool that allows for completely
offline data transfer and application updating.
Results: We designed, pilot-tested, and scaled an open-source fork of Open Data Kit Collect (an Android
application that can be used to create EDC systems) that allows for offline Bluetooth-based bidirectional data
transfer, enabling a system in which permanently-offline users can collect data and receive application updates. We
implemented this platform among a cohort of 317 community health workers and 28 supervisors in a remote area
of rural Liberia with incomplete cellular connectivity and low access to power sources.
Conclusions: Running a fully-offline EDC program that completely bypasses the cellular network was found to be
feasible; the system is still running, over 4 years after the initial pilot program. The users of this program can
theoretically collect data offline for months or years, assuming they receive hardware support when needed. Fully-
offline EDC has applications in settings where cellular network coverage is poor, as well as in disaster relief settings
in which portions of the communications infrastructure may be temporarily nonfunctional.

Mobile phones and personal digital assistants have been
used for data collection in developing world settings for
over three decades, and have become increasingly com-
mon [ 1–7]. Potential advantages of electronic methods
over paper-based methods include lower error rates [ 3,
6], reduced likelihood of data loss [ 1], higher data com-
pleteness [ 2,3,6], reduced time needed for data collec-
tion [ 2,3,6,8], feasibility of advanced data quality
strategies [ 9], and in some cases decreased costs [ 2,6,
10]. This class of techniques, known as electronic data
capture (EDC) has been shown to be feasible among
users with little or no prior experience with data collec-
tion or mobile phone use in a number of different set-
tings, provided that they are given some basic training
[1,2,5], and has been largely seen as acceptable by man-
agers, users, and data collection subjects [ 2,5,6,10,11].
Additionally, the use of mobile phones may help to
reinforce both clinical and non-clinical processes, lead-
ing to improved quality of care and greater efficiency
[12,13]. Thus, it represents an attractive option for re-
searchers, governments, non-governmental organizations
and others interested in large-scale data collection.
However, the use of EDC through mobile phones is
limited in many areas by inconsistent network connect-
ivity and poor access to electricity, which thwart data
transmission and device usage. Many existing EDC mo-
bile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected
settings , allowing a user to collect data while away from
the cell network and transmit data to a central server
when he/she has a network connection. However, few
tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-discon-
nected settings , where a user will never have access to
the internet or a cell network.
One setting in which these issues are quite common
is rural Liberia, where much of the population lives in
areas without access to cellular connectivity. Among re-
mote communities of Rivercess County (those greater
than five kilometers from the nearest health facility),
31.8% of the population lives in a community that does
not have any cell network reception [ 14]. Additionally,
there is no traditional power grid, and only 4.1% of
Liberia ’s rural population owns an electrical generator
[15]. Rivercess is one implementation site of a national
community health worker (C HW) program supported
by the Liberia Ministry of Health and Last Mile Health
(LMH), a non-governmental organization that works
with government and other partners to design, demon-
strate, scale, and advocate for national networks of pro-
fessional CHWs. Because of the connectivity and power
issues in Rivercess, program managers could not imple-
ment a traditional EDC system to collect data from
CHWs; this necessitated the creation of a new tool that
could function despite these i nfrastructural challenges.The objective of this paper is to describe key features
and lessons learned from the development and imple-
mentation of a fully-offline mobile phone EDC platform
among a cohort of CHWs in a remote area of rural
Liberia with incomplete cellular connectivity and low ac-
cess to power sources. While some implementations of
EDC software packages use offline data transfer as a
backup mechanism, the system we describe is the first to
be documented that intentionally bypasses the cellular
network, instead using offline data transmission and ap-
plication updating.
Implementation
Overview
We designed, pilot-tested, and scaled an open-source
fork of Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect, an Android appli-
cation that can be used to create EDC systems [ 16]. This
fork is called “ODK-Liberia ”and is freely available online
as a licensed open-source application [ 17]. The applica-
tion was initially implemented among a small pilot test
group of seven CHWs and one supervisor. Later, the ap-
plication was scaled to a cohort of 317 CHWs and 28
supervisors in remote areas of Liberia, representing the
entire network health workers supported by LMH at the
time. The overall objective of pursuing EDC technology
was to increase the quality and efficiency of CHW-
provided clinical care by increasing data quality, timeli-
ness, completeness, and usage.
Application development
Between February and April of 2015, ODK-Liberia was
forked from the latest stable ODK Collect source code
(v1.4.5) and developed. The primary functional addition
was a Bluetooth-based data transfer system, which al-
lows an end user to transmit data to another ODK-
Liberia user in the absence of cell network or internet
connectivity. This enabled the transfer of application up-
dates (a set of ODK “blank forms ”) and/or collected data
(a set of ODK “completed forms ”) from one user to an-
other. From a technical perspective, this modification
was simple. All blank forms in ODK Collect are stored
as XML documents, conforming to the JavaRosa subset
of the XForms 1.0 specification [ 18], in the odk/forms
directory of the Android filesystem. Completed forms
are stored as individual XML documents in the odk/in-
stances directory. Our new feature allowed for these files
to be transferred from the respective directories in the
source device to those in the destination device. In the
case of the application update, the contents of the source
device are unchanged and the contents of the destin-
ation device are deleted and replaced by the new files. In
the case of the transfer of collected data, files in the
source device are moved to a new directory ( odk/arch-
ive) in the same device (as a data backup mechanism)Kenny et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:39 Page 2 of 8and copied into the odk/instances directory of the des-
tination device. Data can be transferred any number of
times between different Android devices.
Although this paper focuses on the Bluetooth transfer
functionality, there were several secondary modifications
made as part of the ODK-Liberia fork. One modification
was a system that allowed for role-based access to forms,
such that distinct user groups, such as CHWs and super-
visors, would have access to different sets of forms. The
many-to-many relationship between forms and roles is
specified within a simple custom XML file which defines
these associations. Any mobile device with ODK-Liberia
installed can take on any role at any time; an administra-
tor simply has to use a password-protected section of
the user interface to change the value of a configuration
variable. We also made several user interface modifica-
tions, including disallowing the deletion of completed
forms and minor stylistic changes.
Additionally, we created an open-source Windows
native application [ 19] to facilitate analogous data
transfers between an Android device and a Windows
computer. When receiving completed forms, the
Windows application concatenates all forms with a
custom delimiter in between and saves this as a sin-
gle file with a custom file extension. This is done to
facilitate easy upload into LMH ’s custom web-based
database application [ 20], which parses the data into
JSON format, checks for file integrity, adds several
metadata attributes, and sends the resulting dataset
into a MySQL database cloud-hosted on a virtual
private server. Note that the process described in
this paragraph does not need to be replicated to
take advantage of ODK-Liberia ’s Bluetooth offline
data transfer functionality; collected data could just
as easily be sent to a ODK-compatible server, such
as ODK Aggregate [ 21], once a user gains connect-
ivity. A high-level snapshot of the overall data sys-
tem architecture is given in Fig. 1below.Forms were built using XLSForm and were designed to
simultaneously function as both clinical decision support
tools and data collection tools. For example, the “sick
child form ”supported the integrated community case
management (iCCM) intervention, through which CHWs
treated simple cases of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia
at home and referred complicated cases to the nearest
health facility. This form collects data, while guiding
CHWs to arrive at the correct diagnosis and treatment for
a particular disease. Other forms similarly rely on the use
of automated skip logic, pre-programmed clinical algo-
rithms, and form validation to help guide CHW workflows
and provide individual decision support. Several screen-
shots of the application are shown for illustrative purposes
in Fig. 2below.
Equipment
We chose to use BLU Product ’s mobile devices for our
EDC system based on a comparison of advertised battery
life, durability, and price-point among a selection of An-
droid devices. We primarily used the BLU Advance 4.0
model, which has a 4-in. 480 × 800 pixel display, a 1600
mAh battery, 4GB of internal storage space, and 512 MB
of RAM. However, following the discontinuation of the
Advance 4.0 model, we have also tested and imple-
mented a variety of other BLU phones. To help prevent
against damage during Liberia ’s seven-month rainy sea-
son, we also procured waterproof cases, which allow for
the device to be used while it is inside the case (through
a touch-sensitive clear plastic front panel). In addition to
these items, we equipped each CHW with an Anker 15
W Solar Panel and an Anker 15,600mAh battery pack,
as no power grid or generators are available in many of
the communities served by the program. CHWs were
instructed to use the solar panel to charge the battery
pack during the day, and then use the battery pack to
charge the mobile phone in the evening. They were also
given detailed instructions on how to prevent damaging
Fig. 1 Data System ArchitectureKenny et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:39 Page 3 of 8the device (not using it in the rain, not giving it to chil-
dren to play with, etc.). At times, we also employed a
battery exchange process (particularly during the rainy
season), in which supervisors would swap out depleted
battery packs with fully-charged replacements, and then
charge the depleted packs once they reached a power
source (typically a generator). To reduce battery drain
and unintended device usage, we installed custom-built
kiosk software (source code will be made available soon)
on each device, which restricted users from accessing
any Android functionalities other than a small set of spe-
cified applications. The total initial equipment cost was
$123 per CHW (excluding shipping costs), and we have
observed that each piece of equipment usually lasts
roughly 2 –3 years. Shipping was provided as an in-kind
donation; actual shipping costs could vary widely de-
pending on location and program scale and should al-
ways be accounted for.
Pilot phase
We tested the EDC platform during an initial pilot
phase, which lasted from February 5th to April 9th,
2015. The initial pilot phase included seven CHWs and
one supervisor, selected purposively because of their
close physical proximity to one of our field site offices.
Participants were given a two-day training on EDC tools
and processes, which included an overview of equipment
usage, mock clinical scenarios, and form practice. Partic-
ipants were given field manuals, which provided graphics
on how to use different features of the EDC application
such as touching, swiping, and putting devices in sleep
mode. Two forms were used for the pilot, the sick child
form described above and a form used to screen patients
for Ebola, as active CHW surveillance for Ebola symp-
toms was still ongoing at the time.To evaluate the pilot phase, we conducted post-
training and a post-implementation focus group of all
training participants and reviewed unstructured field
notes taken by implementers. The focus group lasted a
full day, and involved asking participants open-ended
questions around overall successes and challenges, as
well as directed questions around software usability,
hardware challenges, community member reactions to
the program, and perceptions of the pilot (see Appendix
1for the focus group questionnaire).
Scale-up phase
The scale-up phase lasted from July 1st, 2015 until De-
cember 15th, 2016; however, the program is still fully
operational as of December 2019. For this phase, train-
ing lasted roughly 12 h and was embedded into existing
programmatic training modules. Topics covered and ma-
terials used were similar to those covered in the pilot
phase. The current training materials are available as an
Appendix . CHWs were equipped with a redesigned ver-
sion of the iCCM form, as well as a form to capture data
on routine monthly home visits. The supervisor forms
captured information on supervision activities and sup-
ply chain. Notably, the supervision form included both a
geo-tag and a timestamp, which helped to prevent data
falsification. During biweekly supervision visits, supervi-
sors were responsible for transferring all CHW-collected
data to their mobile phone, as well as transferring any
updates to the CHW ’s phone. When the supervisors
returned to the central office for meetings and stock re-
fills, they would in turn transfer their data to the phone
of a staff member on the LMH monitoring & evaluation
team. In this sense, the flow of data paralleled the flow
of physical commodities, such as medications. The LMH
Fig. 2 Select application screenshotsKenny et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:39 Page 4 of 8staff member would then transfer data to their laptop
and upload it to the LMH database.
To evaluate the scale-up phase, we conducted a number
of semi-structured interviews of both CHWs and supervi-
sors, reviewed metrics of data quality and completeness,
and reviewed field notes taken by implementers.
Results
Pilot phase
The pilot phase (2/5/2015 –4/9/2015) involved seven
CHWs and one supervisor in Grand Gedeh County. Of
the initial piloted participants, only one CHW had ever
used a smartphone. Of the three CHWs that reported
owning non-touch screen mobile phones, all reported
that their community had mobile network access.
Participants reported that it took one to 3 weeks of
field-based use to become comfortable with the use of the
phones and application. Of note, all EDC tools were mod-
eled after a paper-based equivalent, on which the CHWs
were already trained; this likely contributed to the ease
with which participating CHWs were able to learn. Some
CHWs requested for more advanced functionality to be
added, such as automatic populating of form fields and
longitudinal patient visit records. When asked to compare
paper forms to EDC, CHWs reported that EDC was easier
to use, decreased time spent writing, and lightened the set
of materials that needed to be carried around during pa-
tient visits. One CHW noted, “I never get a form [sent
back] to me with an error ”. They also mentioned that it
improved their perceived status in their communities and
that they felt that their capacity was being built to learn
new technologies. When asked to identify weaknesses of
the EDC platform, CHWs reported specific application
bugs in the tools, as well as the lack of more advanced ap-
plication functionality, including the ability to dynamically
access previously-entered data. When asked about com-
munity perceptions of the system, one CHW noted, “It
[provides a great morale boost] for patients to be treated
by [a health worker with] a computer ”.
The solar charging scheme proved to be effective.
There was not a single reported instance of a CHW be-
ing unable to complete a form because of lack of power.
However, the pilot was conducted during Liberia ’s dry
season, and as noted below, we experienced charging
difficulties due to equipment malfunction once the pro-
gram scaled up, especially during rainy season.
Due to the technical feasibil ity and enthusiastic accept-
ance by CHWs, the pilot phase was generally viewed in-
ternally as a success and paved the path for the subsequent
scaling of the program.
Scale-up phase
The scale-up phase (7/1/2015 –12/15/2016) involved 317
CHWs and 28 supervisors across Rivercess and GrandGedeh Counties. During this period, 63,092 individual
forms were submitted, including 22,824 iCCM forms,
36,978 routine visit forms, 1420 supervision forms, and
1870 restock forms.
We also found that many CHWs would conduct client
visits without their mobile device. They would then
retroactively complete the forms during the evening, ei-
ther from written notes or from memory. We initially
identified this through field observations, and subse-
quently through an analysis of the timestamps automat-
ically taken at the start and end of each form, noticing
that batches of forms would often be filled out at the
end of the day by a CHW. Within the time period ana-
lyzed, the median time between forms (excluding the
time between the last form of a given day to the first
form of the next day) was 10 min, which implies that the
majority of CHWs were simply using the phones for
retroactive “data entry ”rather than using them as
decision-support tools during the actual patient inter-
action. This finding led to field-based retraining of
CHWs to encourage use of the phones as intended.
The median length of time it took for a routine visit
form to reach the database (calculated as the database
INSERT timestamp minus the form completion time-
stamp) was 24 days (IQR: 17 days), and the median time
for an iCCM form was 27 days (IQR: 22 days). The me-
dian time for a supervision form to reach the database
was just 17 days (IQR: 19 days), which can be explained
by the fact that the data generation for this form is hap-
pening “one step upstream ”of the CHW-generated data,
and was thus able to reach the database in less time.
While not ideal, these delay lengths were considered ac-
ceptable, in part because the biweekly frequency of
supervision placed a limit on how quickly data could be
collected in the field and in part because the data cap-
tured through this system was routinely used the follow-
ing month (rather than the current month) by program
managers.
The main issue that plagued the scale-up phase was
device malfunction. Because of ongoing delays in pro-
curement (caused by various issues, such as the difficul-
ties associated with shipping large quantities of devices
powered by lithium ion batteries), many CHWs
remained without one or more pieces of equipment for
months at a time. Often, when the solar charger, power
bank, or USB cable was broken, CHWs utilized local
generator-powered commercial charging booths. Unfor-
tunately, we did not collect detailed data on device mal-
function rates or accessibility of alternative power
sources.
Discussion
Overall, we found that ODK-Liberia was usable and ac-
ceptable to CHWs, and served as an effective technicalKenny et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:39 Page 5 of 8solution for the connectivity issues. This was not sur-
prising, given previous feasibility assessments of EDC [ 1,
2,5]. Data generated through the EDC program is now
used regularly within various data reports and tools as
part of their routine programmatic monitoring system.
These tools include reports on under-five child treat-
ment, form completion, supervision performance, and
routine visit activities, disaggregated at various levels
(e.g. by county, by district, or by CHW).
The primary advantage of ODK-Liberia over the major-
ity of existing EDC platforms is that transfer of both data
and application updates (i.e. blank forms) can happen in
the complete absence of connectivity. This allows for data
collection to occur indefinitely among user groups who
have no access to a cell network or the internet for long
periods of time (on the order of months or years). This
functionality enabled the implementation of an EDC sys-
tem which has been up and running for over 4 years,
eventually among 317 CHWs and 28 supervisors. The
most widely-used EDC packages either do not have this
functionality, can only do one-way offline data transfers
from the users to the server, and/or have functionality that
requires a skilled technician (e.g. using a laptop to update
a phone) and may be prone to human error. Additionally,
although it is not currently used in this particular imple-
mentation, ODK-Liberia maintains its native data ex-
change capabilities, so if connectivity is present or
regained, data can be transmitted over the cell network or
internet. Thus, even though our implementation collected
and transferred 100% of the data offline, it is very much
possible for “hybrid ”implementations to be deployed in
which some users can submit data and receive updates
over the cell network and others can do so offline. Simi-
larly, individual users can utilize both data transfer mecha-
nisms depending on what is the most feasible at any given
point in time.
It should be stressed that ODK-Liberia was a tool cre-
ated for the specific needs of the Liberia CHW program.
Although the software is open-source, stable, and usable
by anyone, the authors recommend that the creators of
widely-used EDC platforms develop and implement
similar functionality within their own tools.
We see two general use cases for this functionality. The
first use case is data collection within settings that have
similar connectivity issues to those of rural Liberia. Any
group who wants to run an EDC program but has strug-
gled to do so because of connectivity constraints can do so
with ODK-Liberia or with software that contains similar
functionality. The second is during disaster relief efforts.
Natural disasters often cause severe damage to existing
communications infrastructure [ 22,23], which may make
the use of a traditional EDC system impossible. Data col-
lection during natural disasters can be extremely challen-
ging for a variety of economic, political, and technicalreasons [ 24], and since having strong data collection sys-
tems can lead to more effective and coordinated responses
and relief efforts [ 25], an EDC system with the offline-
transfer functionality of ODK-Liberia could play a vital
role.
With both use cases, offline data transfer may be far
cheaper than existing alternatives such as satellite-based
data transfer, and possibly cheaper than paper-based alter-
natives when the costs of data quality assurance, aggrega-
tion, and reporting are taken into account. Because of
potential costs savings, a fully-offline data system should
not be viewed only as a backup mechanism, but as a po-
tential option for the main means of data collection. With
a fully-offline system, there is no need to purchase SIM
cards or cellular credit, resulting in immediate savings.
Furthermore, given that an often-recommended solution
for EDC platform users who live in disconnected areas is
to travel to another community to send their data to a ser-
ver via the cell network, a fully-offline implementation
may result in savings in terms of staff time and travel costs.
Projected cost savings is the primary reason that the
Liberia CHW program uses offline transfer as the sole
mechanism for data exchange, rather than as a backup
mechanism, even for CHWs who live in communities with
reliable cell network. This being said, the costs of equip-
ment, training, and staff time were substantial, (especially
relative to the per capita GDP of a country like Liberia)
and any government or organization considering imple-
menting an EDC program should conduct a comprehen-
sive cost-benefit analysis to assess whether it is the correct
decision.
There are limitations to both the software tested and to
this pilot study. The main limitation of a fully-offline data
transfer workflow is that there can be substantial delays
between when the data is generated and when it hits a
central database. This makes this sort of system insuffi-
cient for data capture programs in which such a delay is
unacceptable, such as an infectious disease outbreak sur-
veillance system. Other limitations include the need to
manage and monitor data completeness within a more
complex data transfer pathway, greater potential for hu-
man error, and the potential for technically-savvy “up-
stream ”users to tamper with the data. Human error can
potentially be decreased through additional automation of
the bidirectional data transfer process, and data tamper-
ing, while not a realistic concern in our setting, could be
mitigated through software changes that would encrypt
underlying data and disallow editing by secondary users.
Limitations of this pilot study include the lack of a formal
evaluation, restriction to a single country and imple-
menter, and restriction to the single use case of data col-
lection within a community health worker program.
Additionally, we did not collect pre-implementation data
or data from a control group on quantitative indicators ofKenny et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2020) 20:39 Page 6 of 8data quality, such as completeness or accuracy; this would
have allowed us to better understand the benefits and
drawbacks of the EDC system as compared to the previ-
ous paper-based system.
Conclusions
Running an electronic data capture program that by-
passes the cellular network was found to be feasible. The
users of this program can work offline indefinitely, as-
suming they receive hardware support when needed.
Fully-offline EDC has applications in settings where the
density of cellular towers is low, as well as in disaster re-
lief settings in which portions of the communications in-
frastructure may be temporarily nonfunctional.
