1. Overview   
Digital  harassment  of women  leaders  can encompass  acts of gender -based  violence  that are 
committed,  abetted  or aggravated,  in part or fully, by the use of information  and communication  
technologies  (ICTs),  such  as mobile  phones,  the internet,  social  media  platforms,  and email.  New 
forms  of online  violence  are committed  in a continuum  and/or  interaction  between  online  or digital  
space;  it is often  difficult  to distinguish  the consequences  of actions  that are initiated  in digital  
environments  from offline  realities,  and vice versa.  Social medi a has become  a significant  arena  for 
the perpetration  of psychological  violence  against  women  parliamentarians  and activists . The most  
common  forms  of violence  are sexist  and misogynistic  remarks,  humiliating  images,  mobbing,  
intimidation  and threats . Thes e acts – whether  directed  at women  as civil society  leaders,  voters,  
political  party  members,  candidates,  elected  representatives  or appointed  officials  – can restrict  the 
political  participation  of women  as a group.1 
This report  looks  at the evidence  currently  available  on digital  harassment  of women  leaders  under  
the headings  ‘scale  of the issue’,  ‘impact’,  and ‘effectiveness  of interventions’,  and makes  a light-
touch  assessment  of the quality  of that evidence , or where  non-academic  evidence  is included  a 
rationale  is given  for its inclusion . A parallel  query  (Q210)  will summarise  the key points  or lessons  
from the evidence .

 Overall,  there  is very limited  research  directly  on digital  harassment  of women  leaders , and none  
assessing  the effectiveness  of interventions  to address  the issue  (see table  below  for further  details) .  
Most  of the studies  were  empirical  studies  with relatively  small  sample  sizes , or desk  reviews . Since  
many  of these  materials do not fit the criteria for scoring the evidence quality of  conventional research 
materials  highlighted in Section 2 , a rationale is given for their inclusion.  
Evaluating  the overall  strength  of the evidence  base  on digital  harassment  of women  leaders  
(using  DFID’s  2014  How to Note  on Assessing  the Strength  of Evidence)  
Scale of the issue  Limited:  Moderate ‐to‐low quality  studies,  medium  size evidence  body,  low levels  
of consistency  due to different  methods  used . Some contextually  relevant  studies  
(e.g. from India  and multi -country  study) . No primary  research  directly  assessing  
the proportion  or number  of women  leaders  affected  by digital  harassment.   
Impact  it has at 
individual  and 
collective  levels  Limited:  Moderate ‐to‐low quality  studies,  medium  size evidence  body,  with some  
evidence  on the impact  of the issue,  for example  reducing  women  leaders’  
credibility  and legitimacy,  distracting  female  leaders,  instilling  fear for women  
leaders’  safety,  and dissuading  women  from running  for offices . Studies  largely  
from high-income  countries  and not always  contextually  relevant.  
Effectiveness  of 
interventions  to 
address  the issue  No evidence : Some  studies  outlining  interventions,  with some  recommendations  
given,  but limited  assessment  of the effectiveness  of specific  interventions.  No 
evaluation s found.  No studies  directly  assessing  the effectiveness  of 
interventions  that address  digital  harassment  of women  leaders.  Any available  
studies  are of low quality,  and are contextually  irrelevant.  
 
2. Methodology   
Searches : For existing  systematic  reviews  or evidence  reviews  on VAW  in politics,  digital  harassment,  
female  activists  and digital  security,  online  VAW,  women  human  rights  defenders  and online  violence  
were  all used . In addition,  searches  using  Google,  Google  Scholar,  PubMed,  Web of Scienc e  and 
other  relevant  electronic  databases  using  key search  terms  including:  ‘violence’,  ‘abuse’,  ‘harass’,  
‘women’,  ‘female’,  ‘digital’,  ‘online’,  ‘social  media’,  ‘politicians’,  ‘activists’,  ‘human  rights  defenders’,  
‘MP’,  ‘parliamentarians’.  
Given  the strong role played  by civil society  organisations  in this space  the search  also extend ed to 
sites hosted  by these  organisations  such  as https://www.genderit.org/indepth , and 
https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/work/research/  and grey literature.  This is necessary  in light of the 
fact that this is a very rapidly  evolving  issue,  with the latest  reports  not always  available  in journals.   
Details  of the searches  carried  out are in the table  below.  The database  searches  were  filtered  for 
relevance  with only the most  relevant  studies  chosen.

Inclusion  Criteria : To be eligible  for inclusion  in this rapid  mapping,  reports  will have  to fulfil the 
following  criteria:  
 Geographical  focus:  Global  
 Language:  English  
 Time  period:  5 year time period,  completed  between  January  2013  and September  2018,  
extending  to 10 years  if insufficient  literature  is found  
 Format:  Evaluation,  journal  article,  research  studies  
 Study  design:  All study  types,  designs,  and methodologies  including  primary  and secondary  
studies   
 Quality:  High-quality  studies  
Exclusion  Criteria : Reports  were  excluded  on the following  basis:  
 Literature that is only about concepts or theories.  
 References with no citations of references, or too few references cited (exception would be if the 
reference is entirely based on original field work or under Chatham House rules but from an 
established source.)  
Quality  assessment : Reports  were  anecdotally  assessed  out of 10 for quality.   Each  piece  was also 
categorised  according  to: 
1) Type of report  e.g. Systematic review, peer reviewed journal article, an in -house evaluation report, 
academic working paper, Policy paper, UN special ra pporteur report etc.   
2) Name of the organisation   
3) Scope of the report  (e.g. single country case study, comparative study across three countries, 
systematic review, etc.)  
4) Methodology used  (statistical analysis, household surveys, key informant interviews et c). 
The quality  assessment  was rapid  and anecdotal  to give a rough  assessment  of the quality  of the 
literature  and the quality  assessment  should  therefore  be treated  with caution . Section  3 
provides  a detailed  assessment  of quality  and key findings.

900,223  tweets  in run-
up to 2017  UK election  
to explore  abuse  of 
women  politicians.  Also 
draws  on online  poll 
with Ipsos  MORI  about  
women’s  broader

of abuse  and 
harassment  on social  
media  platforms  across  
eight  countries  (UK, 
USA,  Spain,  Denmark,  
Italy,  Sweden,  Poland  
and New Zealand) . The report  notes  that women  who speak  out 
about  certain  (often  feminist)  issues  and/o r 
are public  figures  are at high risk of online  
abuse  and harassment , including  journalists,  
politicians  and women's  rights  activists.  
Analysis  of tweets  before  UK election  found  
that online  abuse  targets  different  identities,  
with Diane  Abbott,  the Shadow  Home  
Secretary  and  first black  female  MP in the UK 
- alone  - receiving  almost  half (45.14%)  of all 
abuse  against  women  MPs active  on Twitter  
in the UK during  this period.  
Violence  is often  intersectional  - Scottish  
Parliamentarian  and Leader  of the Oppos ition 
Ruth  Davidson  told Amnesty  International  that 
the abuse  she faces  is both misogynistic  and 
homophobic.

 The report  highlights  how women  who take up

politically  charged  issues,  are often  treated  as 
trespassers  in a male  space.  In response  to 
gender -based  abuse  and harassment,  some

chosen  to delete  their accounts.

technology  as tool for 
abuse  and as a means  
of redressing  the issue.  For women  entering  political  life or holding  
public  positions,  new ICTs  are frequently  used  
as tools  of gender -specific  electoral  and 
political  violence.  There  is evidence  of ICTs  
being  used  to perpetrate  a broad  range  of 
violent  acts against  women  during  elections,  
especially  acts inflicting  fear and 
psychological  harm.  Specific  characteristics  of 
ICTs  are particularly  adapted  to misuse  in this 
manner.  Despite  these  significant  challenges,  
ICTs  also offer groundbreaking  solutions  for 
preventing  and mitigat ing violence  against  
women  in elections  (VAWE).  Notably,  ICTs  
combat  VAWE  through  monitoring  and 
documenting  violence,  via education  and 
awareness -raising  platforms  and through  
empowerment  and advocacy  initiatives.

example,  nearly  all participants  in a program  
for aspiring  women  leaders  in the UK stated

methodology  using

posts.  Little  discussion  
of limitations  in the 
article.  Whilst  
geographically  limited  it 
shows  how the social  
media  platforms  can be 
a means  to document  
violence  and 
simultaneously  enabled  
networke d activism.  The qualitative  coding  and analysis  revealed  
recurring  patterns  around  the themes  of 
violence  against  women,  the power  of taboo  
topics  and silences,  the role of everyday  
political  speech  and online  resistance  
narratives,  and the power  of affect ive 
networked  storytelling.  
Networked  conversations  about  everyday  
rights  and affective  stories  about  shared  
experiences  of injustice,  underpinned  by the 
affordances  of social  media  platforms  for 
sharing  and discussing  information  and 
participating  in everyday  politics,  can emerge  
as viable  forms  of networked  feminist  activism  
and can have  real impact  on the discursive  
status  quo of an issue,  both in the digital  
sphere  and beyond  it.  
Although  the hashtag  campaign  did not 
directly  generate  any legislative  reform,  it 
shifted  the tone of public  debate  about  sexual  
harassment  from abstract  and shameful  to 
personal  and persistent.

Innovative  crowd -
sourcing  methodology;  
provides  interesting  
contrast  between  male  
vs. female  politicians,  as 
well as geographic  
spread  (UK, South  
Africa  and Chile).  The study  found  that male  and female  
politicians  received  similar  levels  of 
derogatory  comments  overall,  but women  
were  three  times  more  likely  to see 
derogatory  or sexist  comments  directly  
related  to their gender.   
Women  leaders  experienced  a significantly  
larger  volume  of conversation  about  their 
physical  appea rance  and family  life. 
Comments  about  their appearance  and 
relationship  status  are also considerably  more  
negative  than those  towards  their male  
counterparts.  Online  abuse  has various  
negative  impacts:  
• Delegitimising  women  as leaders  and 
questioning  their right to take political  roles  
• Depersonalising  female  leaders,  by raising  
the cost of sharing  personal  information;   
• Intentionally  distracting  female  leaders  from 
focusing  on substantive  work;   
• Instilling  fear for their physical  safety  and the 
safety  of their families,  and compelling  them  to 
implement  new security  measures;  and 
• Dissuading  women  from running  for office.

systematic)  review  of 
the literature  in this field 
and it showed  that there  
is a clear lack of 
research  into diverse

adults  – useful  
background  framing  
(but no information  on 
harassment  of women  
politicians/activists .  Technology -facilitated  sexual  violence  (TFSV)  
refers  to a range  of behaviors  where  digital  
technologies  are used  to facilitate  both virtual  
and face-to-face sexually  based  harms.  While  
there  is a growing  body  of research  into 
technology -facilitated  harms  perpetrated  
against  children  and adolescents,  there  is a 
dearth  of qualitative  and quantitative  research  
on TFSV  against  adults.   
Preliminary  studies,  however,  indicate  that 
some  harms,  much  like sexual  violence  more  
broadly,  may be predominantly  gender -, 
sexuality -, and age-based,  with young  women  
being  overrepresented  as victims  in some  
categories.

 When  digital  sexism  succeeds  in pressing  
women  out of digital  spaces,  constrains  the 
topics  they address  publicly,  or limits  the ways  
they address  them,  we must  consider  the 
democratic  costs  of gender -based  
harassment,  in addition  to the personal  ones.  
Internet  misogyny  parallels  gendered  
harassment  in physical  spaces,  suggesting  
that the heart  of men’s aggression  toward  
women  is a ‘generalized  offense  at women’s  
public  presence  in ‘men’s’  spaces  – in politics,  
at law schools,  online’   
Abuse  that distorts  political  discourse  such  
that the most  visible  representatives  of key

speech  is raced,  classed,  and gendered,  the

shrinks  for fear of retaliation,  and ‘high -risk’ 
perspectives  go unspoken  thwarts  not only 
those  who opt to avoid  risk, but democratic

have  been  effective  and gender -sensitive  
implementation  at an institutional  level. Notes  
that the effectiveness  of legislation  is limited  
by: 
 National Response Center  for Cyber Crime 
(NR3C) being “criminally understaffed” 
leading to severe backlogs (p.10)  
 Procedures of the NR3C also raise several 
concerns in terms of evidentiary 
requirements, gender -sensitisation and 
confidentiality  
 Not enough judges in  the “cybercrim e” 
courts  
 The organisation responsible for regulating 
online crime (Pakistan 
Telecommunications Authority) lacks the 
capacity to act on individual cases and is 
notoriously non - transparent in its content

 Social media companies based in fo reign

remedies  for cases  of technology -related

and capacity  building,  and case  studies  on 
women’s  and girls’ experiences  of attempts  to 
access  justice  for technology -related  VAW  
offences.  
Key lessons  include:  
 The focus must be on redress rather than 
criminalisation, and particular attention must 
be paid to the provision of effective 
protective orders and the availability of 
support services  
 Comprehensive capacity building – including 
rights -based education – should be 
undertaken by all institutions  
 Laws should include a comprehensive 
definition of VAW that includes psychological 
violence  
 It is c rucial to develop a technology -related 
VAW law that takes into account the 
gendered nature of the violation and 
addresses it as a social phenomenon  
 Adequate budgets and resources should be 
allocated by states to address VAW.  
A strong  network  of and coopera tion between  
women’s  groups  and organisations  can lead 
to meaningful  exchanges  and discussions  on 
strategies  to employ  around  technology -
