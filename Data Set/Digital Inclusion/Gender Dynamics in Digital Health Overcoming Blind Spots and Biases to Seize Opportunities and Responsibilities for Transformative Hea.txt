ABSTRACT
Much remains to ensure that digital health af ﬁrms rather than retrenches inequality, including for gender. Drawing from literature and from the
SEARCH projects in this supplement, this commentary highlights key gender dynamics in digital health, including blind spots and biases, as well
as transformative opportunities and responsibilities. Women face structural and social barriers that inhibit their participation in digital heal th, but
are also frequently positioned as bene ﬁciaries without opportunities to shape such projects to better ﬁt their needs. Furthermore, overlooking
gender relations and focussing on women in isolation can reinforce, rather than address, women ’s exclusions in digital health, and worsen
negative unanticipated consequences. While digital health provides opportunities to transform gender relations, gender is an intimate anddeeply structural form of social inequality that rarely changes due to a single initiative or short-term project. Sustained support over time, acros s
health system stakeholders and levels is required to ensure that transformative change with one set of actors is replicated and reinforced
elsewhere in the health system. There is no one size prescriptive formula or checklist. Incremental learning and re ﬂection is required to nurture
ownership and respond to unanticipated reactions over time when transforming gender and its multiple intersections with inequality.

RESUMEN
Resta mucho por hacer para que se consolide la salud digital y se reduzca la desigualdad, inclusive para el géne ro. Basándose en la literatura y los
proyectos SEARCH en este suplemento, este come ntario destaca la dinámica de género clave en la salud digital, incluyendo los puntos ciegos y las
parcialidades, también las oportunidades y responsabilidades transformat ivas. Las mujeres enfrent an barreras estructurales y sociales que inhi ben su
participación en la salud digital; pero también se las posiciona como bene ﬁciarias sin oportunidades para forma r tales proyectos de modo de ajustarse
mejor a sus necesidades. Además, ignorar las relaciones de género y focalizarse en las mujeres aisladas puede reforzar, en lugar de abordar, las
exclusiones de las mujeres en l a salud digital y empeorar las consecuenc ias negativas no previstas. Si bien la sa lud digital brinda oportunidades par a
transformar las relaciones de género, el género sigue siendo una for ma de desigualdad social muy personal y muy estructural que raramente cambia
debido a una iniciativa simple o a un proyecto a corto plazo. La ayuda conti nua en el tiempo, presente en todas las partes interesadas y los niveles de
los sistemas de salud se necesita para garantizar que el cambio transform ativo con un grupo de participantes se r eplique y refuerce en todo el sistema

RÉSUMÉ
Il reste encore beaucoup à faire pour établir que la santé numérique maintient plutôt l ’inégalité au lieu de l ’éliminer, et cela touche le genre. En
s’appuyant sur la documentation et les projets de recherche de ce supplément, ce commentaire met en évidence les principales dynamiques
liées au genre dans le secteur de la santé numérique, y compris les zones d ’ombre et les idées préconçues, ainsi que les occasions et
responsabilités de transformation. Les femmes se heurtent à des obstacles structurels et sociaux qui les empêchent de participer à la santénumérique, mais elles sont également réduites, la plupart du temps, en béné ﬁciaires sans possibilité de concevoir de tels projets pour mieux
répondre à leurs besoins. En outre, négliger les relations entre les sexes et mettre l ’accent sur les femmes isolées ne peut que renforcer plutôt
que résoudre les exclusions des femmes en matière de santé numérique tout en aggravant les conséquences négatives inattendues. Bien que lasanté numérique offre la possibilité de transformer les relations entre les sexes, le genre constitue une forme d ’inégalité sociale intime et
profondément structurelle qui change rarement grâce à une initiative unique ou un projet à court terme. Un soutien accru dans le temps, par
l’entremise des parties prenantes et des niveaux du système de santé, est nécessaire pour faire en sorte qu ’un changement en profondeur
impliquant un ensemble d ’acteurs soit reproduit et renforcé ailleurs dans le système de santé. Il n ’existe pas de formule ni de liste de véri ﬁcation
normalisées et universelles. Un apprentissage progressif et une ré ﬂexion sont nécessaires pour favoriser l ’appropriation et réagir aux réactions
imprévues au ﬁl du temps lors de la transformation du genre et de ses multiples rami ﬁcations avec l ’inégalité.

Introduction
Electronic, mobile and wireless technologies are near ubiqui-
tous in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Theirincorporation into health offers an unprecedented opportun-
ity to strengthen health systems and improve health outcomes
in innovative ways. Despite this potential, much remains tobe done to strengthen how digital health af ﬁrms rather than
retrenches inequality, including that involving gender.
Gender inequalities are often detailed as differences
between girls and boys, women and men in binary and het-
eronormative ways. While gender analysis entails understand-
ing these differences, it acknowledges the ﬂuid and socially
constructed nature of gender. It goes further to examine thepower relations that shape the different identities, experiences
and opportunities within and among different groups of
women, men and gender-diverse people, or gender non-conforming people, including transgender and intersex peo-
ple. This includes understanding how these varied forms of
experiencing gender intersects with other social markers suchas age, sexuality, disability, ethnicity, class and geographic loca-
tion. It also entails identifying pathways for redressing such
inequalities and transforming their underlying power relations.
Drawing from existing literature and experience working
with a cohort of projects featured in this supplement andfunded by Canada ’s International Development Research
Centre and under the collective title of ‘SEARCH ’(The
‘Strengthening Equity through Applied Research Capacity
building in eHealth ’(SEARCH) cohort, funded by IDRC,
supported research projects in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Peru and Vietnam. These pro-jects examined if, how, and in what contexts digital health
can meet key challenges faced in delivering quality health
services and inform policy discourse to ensure that no oneis left behind. In addition to the individual project results,
analysis was conducted across the cohort on some cross-
cutting issues, including gender dynamics.), this commentaryoutlines gender dynamics in digital health, including blind
spots and biases. We go on to re ﬂect on efforts to
strengthen gender analysis within the SEARCH cohort. Indoing so, we encourage seizing opportunities and responsi-bilities for realizing the transformational potential digital
health hold for more equitable health systems.
Understanding digital health gendered
blind spots and biases
Given their disadvantage, girls and women are often targeted
as key bene ﬁciaries of programs. Yet they may continue toGENDER DYNAMICS IN DIGITAL HEALTH ii7Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/suppl_2/ii6/5126968 by National Science & Technology Library user on 10 December 2022
be missed if digital health is blind to gendered social rela-
tions that govern access to digital technologies. Women inlow-income countries, while not a homogenous group, are
overall far less likely to own or have independent control
over mobile and wireless technologies than men.
1As a
result, men can sometimes dominate digital health programs,
even if they were primarily intended for women. In Uganda,
men participated twice as much as women in an SMS-basedHIV campaign and in the Democratic Republic of Congo
over 80% of callers on a family planning hotline were men.
2,3
It is crucial to meet men ’s health awareness and needs, and to
recognize marginalized gender dynamics and power relationsamong men given that they are also not a homogenous
group. But this should not inadvertently widen pre-existing
gender inequalities in access to information nor supportmen’s appropriation of programs designed for women.
In being blind to social relations, digital health interven-
tions may not only miss key intended populations, but mayalso potentially further place them at risk. Many demand
side digital health programs require that bene ﬁciaries have
access to mobile phones —a pre-requisite that can serve to
exacerbate existing inequalities in the promotion of and
access to health services. Digital health programs which pro-
vide mobile health information content to pregnant andpostpartum women have the potential to increase women ’s
self-ef ﬁcacy to breastfeed newborns or practice family plan-
ning. However, they may also threaten men and/or broader
familial relationships if the messaging empowers practices inconﬂict with prevailing social norms.
4Supply-side digital health
programs may offer the potential to improve the quality of care,
through decision support or data capture. However, if individualpatient records are not tracked or stored in a con ﬁdential man-
ner, inadvertent disclosures can compromise women ’s privacy
and autonomy.
5,6Understanding existing gender dynamics and
working with men, women and other key family and commu-nity members that replicate gender power relations within digital
health programs can help to avoid such negative outcomes.
Not only do girls, women and other marginalized gender
identities face structural and social barriers that inhibit their
equal participation in digital health, they are also frequently
positioned as bene ﬁciaries of projects without opportunities
to actively engage in and shape such projects to better ﬁt
their needs. Digital health programs must do more in fore-
grounding the voice and agency of marginalized populationsin shaping program design and delivery strategies. In add-
ition, rather than target girls and women as homogenous
groups and in isolation from social context, given the reper-cussions in shifting gender power relations with communityleaders, parents, in-laws, spouses and/or older siblings, it is
imperative to consult and engage with these key gatekeepersfor broader social and structural change to be realized.
Seizing digital health opportunities to
transform gender inequality
Despite gendered blind spots and biases, digital health has
great potential to make a positive impact on gender rela-
tions. A systematic literature review7found that digital health
initiatives can improve couple communication, women ’s
decision-making, social status and access to health resources.
The latter is particularly important for remote rural areas
where there is a dearth of health professionals and servicesand for poor and marginalized communities for whom the
cost of travel to reach health services is exorbitant. In
Vietnam, minority ethnic women had limited knowledge andaccess to care. The text messages sent via the mMOM plat-
form addressed some of these vulnerabilities.
8In Peru, given
that husbands did not attend prenatal check-ups due to workobligations, women reported appreciating accessing and shar-
ing information from trusted sources such as health provi-
ders through the Internet with their partners.
9
Enhancing women ’s autonomy enables them to be more
involved in health seeking and health decision-making, both
for themselves and other family members, and produces
better health outcomes.10Among the SEARCH cohort,
receiving actionable health education via digital health bol-
stered the con ﬁdence of ethnic minority women in Vietnam.
Being more informed and con ﬁdent also improved their
interactions and relationships with health providers.8Future
research should ideally explore intersectionality between gen-
der, ethnicity, age, parity and marital status, among a rangeof contextually relevant social markers, for the women andfamily members involved in the project.
Apart from addressing gender dimensions on the demand
side of health care services, digital health solutions also haveimplications for supply-side gender dynamics. By supporting
supervision, data use, protocols for decision-making, training
and better referral, digital health programs may fosterinnovative ways of enhancing the skills, competencies, social
status and effectiveness of frontline workers, who are often
women.
10In Peru, WawaRed, the integrated mobile phone
system, enhanced the status of midwives and promoted
greater equity among health workers in primary health cen-
ters as everyone could access the e-records.9In Burkina
Faso, mobile phone capabilities improved the communitystatus of female health workers equipping them with newii8 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTHDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/suppl_2/ii6/5126968 by National Science & Technology Library user on 10 December 2022
skills that enabled them a broader professional remit.11,12
Mobile phones also improved the social status of Health
Extension Workers (HEWs) in Ethiopia and the improved
data quality also motivated them further.12
Gendered digital health responsibilities:
minding gender gaps to transform health
systems
The SEARCH cohort was designed with a number of cross-
cutting areas of analysis within a developmental evaluation.13
Among these was a strong focus on gender and equity. As
central parts of the SEARCH initiative, and given that
IDRC ’s emphasis on gender within their research funding
and grant management, each SEARCH project had dedi-cated sections for gender analysis in their proposals.Moreover, analysis of research teams and initial engagement
with them revealed existing capacity for gender analysis and
responsiveness to strengthening consideration of genderwithin their work. Despite this clear intention and engage-
ment, the mid-term review revealed this awareness and
interest was not necessarily operationalized throughoutresearch undertaken by the SEARCH cohort. Initial project
responses were largely women centered without necessarily
demonstrating engagement with the gendered power rela-tions and social contexts of female bene ﬁciaries, including
their diverse family formations. For each of the seven pro-
jects, an external review, dialog and follow up was initiated.Additional resources and concrete ideas for action were pro-vided to further prioritize and strengthen gender analysis in
the projects and across the cohort as a whole.
As mentioned earlier, a critical ﬁrst step is to understand
existing gender inequalities and the power relations that
underpin them. Consulting marginalized women and under-
standing their social context and relationships is vital toensure that digital health addresses their needs and does not
further harm them. However, addressing gender inequality
does not mean working only with women. Men, leaders, deci-sion makers and gatekeepers need to be involved and sup-
portive of the overall digital health initiative, and also their
gender transformative potential. In Lebanon, this entailedreaching out to men when they were available, which differedfrom when women were available.
14In Vietnam, program-
ming was expanded beyond women to target messaging at
men after identifying an interest among this demographic.8
It also entails exploring how gender intersects with other
social strati ﬁers to in ﬂuence experiences of marginalization,
including among frontline workers. In Ethiopia, for example,researchers recognized how gender intersects with education,
age and language ability to affect power dynamics betweenhealth workers and individuals across household, community
and health system levels, including supervisors who were
predominately older men.
12
While digital health solutions may provide opportunities
to transform gender relations, gender is an intimate and
deeply structural form of social inequality that rarely changesdue to a single initiative or short-term project. Sustained
support over time, across health system stakeholders and
levels is required to ensure that transformative change withone set of actors is replicated and reinforced elsewhere inthe health system. In Burkina Faso, male community health
workers were intentionally involved in the training of female
participants, fostering a system of collaboration and support,rather than opposition. However, acceptance by husbands,
who were not initially included in programming, took more
time, and only occurred after their initial reluctance wasidenti ﬁed and addressed by the research team.
11
Positive gains without further review and support may fail to
sustain transformation. In Ethiopia, while digital health solutionsempowered one set of HEWs, inequalities between HEWs with
mobile phones versus those without deepened. Due to the time
required to input data, the digital health solution also displacedHEW time from other responsibilities and led to HEW out ofpocket additional costs for downloading data.
12
Given that digital health solutions are spread across
diverse health system interfaces and levels, there is no onesize prescriptive formula or checklist. Incremental learning
and re ﬂection is required to nurture ownership and respond
to unanticipated reactions, particularly when shifting powerrelations underpinning gender inequality.
15Addressing gen-
der in digital health projects requires sustained attention to
avoid gender from fading away during implementation.10
What next? Embracing gendered digital
health toward positive transformation
The evidence base on how digital health addresses gender
relations and supports gender equality is relatively thin.
Changes in gender power relations and equality are rarelyexamined as an outcome, and even more rarely consideredfrom the outset of projects. Furthermore, how gender inter-
sects with other social strati ﬁers to in ﬂuence experiences of
marginalization is even more rarely explored. Studies oftenfail to suf ﬁciently understand key stakeholders and their
social networks, including program participants, supporting
actors and gatekeepers. Data are often drawn fromGENDER DYNAMICS IN DIGITAL HEALTH ii9Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/suppl_2/ii6/5126968 by National Science & Technology Library user on 10 December 2022
interviews with either women or men, at time without
appreciating diversity within those categories, and rarely tri-angulate ﬁndings across women and men in the same pro-
ject. Positive effects are often assumed or inferred by the
authors, and negative effects are rarely measured.
7
Ongoing monitoring, evaluation and research are required
to understand more precisely the circumstances under which
digital health solutions interact with gender intersecting withother social relations in partial or fully transformative ways,
with intended or unintended consequences. Key questions
include:
Do girls, women and other marginalized gender groups
have suf ﬁcient literacy, autonomy and ICT-access to
effectively use digital health?
In each context, what are other markers of social inequal-
ity and how do they interact with gender to affect digitalhealth programs?
How will use of digital health impact on and change exist-
ing gender power dynamics and relationships among keygender stakeholders, whether girls, boys, women, men,
gender non-conforming people, other family or commu-
nity members, at home, in communities, markets, orhealth services? What are the innovations in mapping andunderstanding these contextually con ﬁgured and ﬂuid
power relations, particularly since perceived power may or
may not translate into actual power?
What kinds of engagement with those who enforce gender
power relations, usually but not always men and boys,
are necessary to transform gender relations in a positiveway that increases both the effectiveness of digital health
and improves the status of those marginalized by gender
power relations, who are usually, but not always girls andwomen?
All digital health programs take place in a particular social, eco-
nomic and political context. While informed by this context,
they also provide the opportunity to transform some aspects of
it. Recognizing this interactive dynamic between gender anddigital health, we must support positive synergies between
them, rather than allow gender inequalities to undermine digital
health or have digital health further ignore and exacerbate gen-der inequalities. Gender inequalities operate in health systems at
multiple levels and must be addressed at individual, community,
program and policy levels if digital health is to achieve itsfull potential. Ongoing engagement with intended bene ﬁ-
ciaries to understand and respond to the social relations
and contexts they are embedded in, sustained over timewith critical review and re ﬂection, is vital for ensuring thatdigital health solutions actually support gender equality,
rather than assume to do so.
