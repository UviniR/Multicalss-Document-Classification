 Mobile Banking – An Answer to Financial 
Inclusion in Hilly Rural India . 
 
Anil Mehta; Deepankar Chakrabarti; Rajeev  Srivastava; Ranjeet Mehta  
Abstract:  Financial Inclusion  is still a major challenge for 
the India , despite of being one of major agenda since 
2004 -2005, due to difficulty in reaching far flung areas of 
the country comprising 600,000 villages . This has huge 
implications on economic development of the country. 
Ther efore there is regular thrust from  Government o f 
India (GoI) to bring everyone to the ambit of formal 
banking system through various schemes. Mahatma 
Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MGN REGA ) is 
one of the major GoI schemes  that have  contributed 
significantly to financial inclusion in India.  India has 
more mobile connections  compared to banking accounts, 
therefore GoI in Economic Survey 2014 -15, proposed JAM 
(JanDhan Yojana, Aadhar Number and Mobile Number) 
trinity  to use ICT for more efficient and effective spread of 
formal banking even to the hilly areas where brick and 
mortar banks are difficult to build and sustain. Hence to 
understand the constructs of mobile banking adoption for 
financial inclusion in Champawat district of Uttrakhand, 
India under MNREGA, this research  discusses revised 
technology acceptance model (TAM) a nd carefully picked 
constructs from literature review which were w eaved 
together by using  Total Interpretive Structural Modeling 
(TISM) to form  a conceptual model  for Champawat 
District of Uttrakhand, India.

 Mobile technologie s not only helping business houses in 
improving operations, cost cutting, new customers and 
markets reachout, it has also created altogether new ways to 
do business and helped in designing and developing new 
industry/workforce.  .In the same lines, banking across the 
globe is no longer the same traditional business now. Mobile 
technology has re volutionized the banking sector ( More, 
2016 ). In recent years, there has been very rapid and 
considerable growth happened in all facets of technology  
And most importantly, Information & Communication 
Technology has been the quickest consumer level 
technology which covered both depth and breadth in history 
of human society  (Ali & Kaur, 2015; Jack&Suri, 2011).  
The customer interface with the service providers have been 
positively impa cted due to evolution and breakthroughs in 
few of the major areas of mobile technology and also 
brought many innovative techniques to infuse money in 
economy (Bhel 2016 ). Similarly, the significant 
development in information  & communication technology 
gave industries a new way to think of designing and 
developing avenues for business and the applications are 
industry agnostic. In the same way mobile banking provided 
a channel to customers to access all banking services 
without visiting banks and also indep endent from location of 
customer or bank.  (Donner & Tellez, 2008)  
One of the major significance  of mobile banking is that it 
has reduced the physical distance between customers and 
banks, which have made banks more accessible. Also, now 
various banking transactions can be done irrespective of  
time and location  (Klein & Mayer 2011 ; Kleijnen et al., 
2004;  Herzberg, 2003 ). The above is validated by T elecom 
Regulatory Authority of India report  on mobile subscribers 
in India, by June 2018 there were more than  116 Crore 
active mobile connections  in India ( Economic Times, Aug 
2018 ). The number clearly indicates the amount of diffusion 
of mobile technology even in far flung villages of India and 
therefore mobile banking can be one of the most successful 
and effic ient tool to enhance financial inclusion.    
After agricultural and industrial revolution, ICT has been 
considered as the biggest evolution . However, despite of 
such diffusion of mobile technology, adoption and usage of 
mobile banking is very bleak . (Behl  & Pal, 2016 ; Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch Report, 2015 ; Upadhyay  & 
Jahanyan, 2016 ; Magotra, 2016 ; Singh, 2015 ; Nayak et al, 
2014 ; Bamoriya & Singh, 2011 ). 
The literature review shows many studies were done on 
mobile banking and its adoption under various demography 
and geographical setup, however there is dearth of research 
on mobi le banking in Champawat district of Uttrakhand, 
India.

 II. OBJECTIVE  
Identification of constructs , resulting in  the adoption of 
mobile banking in Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India  
To develop a conceptual model to understand  the effect of 
BI on mobile banking  usage  in Champawat district of 
Uttrakhand, India.  
III. LITERATURE REVIEW  
During all these years various studies were undertaken  by 
using Theory of planned behavior (TPB), Theory of 
reasoned action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM)  to understand the behavioral intention in using 
information and  communication technology.  
The above mentioned  models are the most studied and 
researched models to understand and predict behavioral 
intention of users towards technology under different 
geography and demography (Szajna, 1994 ; Gefen & Straub, 
2000; Gefen, 2000 ; Igbaria et. al, 1995; Chau & Hu, 2001 ).  
TAM, (Davis 1986 ) is maximum studied model to 
understand behavioral intention of users towards adoption of 
information technology. (Hong et. al 2002 ) argued, one of 
the principal advan tage to use TAM  is that it gives  a 
structure  to study and examine  influence of external 
variables on adoption and usage  of new system . The 
external variables could fall under any category whether it is 
a humanitarian aspect, knowledge aspect or logistics aspect.  
Many studies were undertaken using TAM to understand the 
adoption of Mo bile Banking across globe. ( Kumar et al., 
2017; Mortimer et al., 2015; Jeong & Yoon, 2013; Norzaid i 
et al., 2011 ; Luarn & Lin, 2005 ). This resea rch took  revised 
TAM framework (Davis, 1989) which was further 
undertaken many  empirical  studies which emphasized that 
PEoU and PU  mediated effect of exterior  factors on 
behavioral intention of users to adopt and use technology  
(Kesharwani & Singh 2012; Kim et. al 2008; Zhou et. al, 
2007 ), and found that  attitude did not mediate  PEoU and PU  
while influencing b ehavioral intent  of users  to adopt and use 
of technology  (Gefen et. al, 2003; Hong et. al, 2001 ; 
Venkatesh and Morris, 2000; Lopez & Manson, 1997; 
Igbaria et. al, 1996;  Szajna, 1996; Venkatesh and Davis, 
1996 ).  (Barroso &  Flores, 2014) opined that consumer 
adoption intention towards mobile banking was affected 
mainly by c onvenience and ease of use.  
Mobile phone  has been used  from mobile commerce 
(shopping , banking etc.) to entertainment services,  therfore  
mobile technology  has been the favorite piece of researchers 
to verify and validate the application of TAM  and 
understand the user adoption. (Wessels & Drennan 2010; 
Wu & Wang, 2005; Luarn & Lin, 2005; Nysveen et al., 
2005 ). 
 
Fig 1 – Revised TAM , Davis 1989  
Revis ed TAM was suggested by Davis in the year 1989, as 
shown in Figure 1,  where behavioral intention is dep endent 
on PU and PEoU , here former is defined as “the measure  of 
belief  of an individual  has perceived that his/her work will improve by using a given system” . (Kumar et al. 2017;  
Mortimer et al. 2015; Hanafizadeh et al. 2014) , showed that 
perceived usefulness positively effects the behavior 
intention towards u se of mobile banking. Revised TAM , 
defined that PEoU  “the measure  of belief a n individual  
perce ives the working with given  system is effort less ” 
(Davis 1989 ). 
It is implicit to adopt anything we need to have access to it. 
(Kim et. al, 2019 ; Al-Qeisi et. al, 2014, Brown et. al, 2012, 
Park et. al, 2012, Hsiao & Yang, 2011 , Lin&Lu, 200 0; 
Davis, 1989 ) indicated that accessibility is an impor tant 
influence on the adoption of information technology . (Ives 
et. al, 1983 ), introduced convenience of access as factor 
impacting adoption of information systems.  Various studies 
undertaken to understand the adopt ion of mobile and e -
learning system observed accessibility as major influencer. 
(Almaiah & Alismaiel, 2018;  Salloum & Shaalan, 2018; 
Debei, 2014 ). 
Accessibility removes the physical and spatio -temporal 
limitation of a service and the statistical correlation  linking 
Perceived Accessibility and Perceived Ease of U se (PEoU)  
was observed by (Hsiao & Yang, 2011).  (Suoranta M, 
2003), found that accessibility as one of the most significant 
triggers for the adoption of mobile banking.  
Another most studie d construct  in technology adoption is 
the influence of society. Subjective norm have been 
embedded in TAM as influencer of behavior intention to 
adopt technology. (Samodra & Mariani 2013; Legris et al., 
2003; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000;). The subjective norm 
refers to “individual’s perception about opinion of other 
individual, whose perception and beliefs are important for 
him or her, to use the given system ” (To et. al 2018; Yean 
et. al, 2015 ). There were many studies which show s the 
influenc e of subjective norm towards the intent of using 
mobile banking ( Binaymin et. al 2018; Tan & Lau, 2016; 
Sripalawat et al., 2011; Dasgupta et al., 2011; Puschel et al., 
2010; Riquelme & Rios, 2010; Amin et al., 2008; ).  
(Park et. al, 2012 ) points out that  trust is yet another 
construct to understand the better rate of diffusion of 
technology. On the same lines (A fshan & Sharif, 2016, 
Zhou , 2011 ; Gu et al., 2009; ) observed that helping 
customers to overcome security & privacy risks to devel op 
trust will contribute in adoption of mobile banking. (Schnall 
et. al 2015) opined that trust came out as prominent 
influencer in case mHealth technologies . 
(Bhatt&Bhatt, 2016 ) found faster responses from service 
providers help customers in adopting mobi le banking 
services. The same observations were also done by (Hoehle 
et. al, 2012 ) and concluded that responsiveness in 
completing a transaction is one of the key constructs to 
control choice for any particular technology. (Kesharwani & 
Singh, 2012, Shu & Strassmann 2005 ) supported the 
argument that responsiveness helps to increase the 
satisfaction level of customers and improves its willingness 
of technology usage.  
(Venkatesh and Davis, 2000; Davis et. al, 1992 ) used 
extended TAM in their respective studies and found quality 
of the output as the major contributor towards Perceived 
Usefulness  (PU) in case of Information & Communication 
Technology (ICT).

 In similar direction,  it was found by  many earlier  researches  
that information  quality  effects the perception towards 
usefulness of information (Chopra & Sherry, 2014; Pelletier 
et. al, 2011; Loo et. al, 2011). A study was conducted by 
(Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)  with respect to multiple 
technologies in banking and finance sector and found that 
customers opt for technology with greater output quality.   
Improper terminology used in information systems was 
found a major problem in adoption of technology (Hong et. 
al 2002 ). Terminology used in any system aid much 
efficient use of resources and provides effective navigation 
through the same (Hong et. al, 2002; Kim, 2006 ). A research  
was performed  by (Vatsa et. al, 2010 and Puri 1997 ), which 
argues that mismatch in terminolog y used by information 
seeker and terminology used by information provider makes 
communicate with system  difficult  and also impedes 
maximization of the probable  system  benefits .  
Self efficacy for a system can  be defined as one’s perception  
with respect to the capability  to utilize  the system. 
(Compeau & Higgins, 1995 ). Further, various empirical 
studies have shown correlation  of technology self efficacy 
and Perceived Ease of U se (PEoU) (Jeong & Yoon, 2013; 
Sripalawat et al., 2011; Wang et a l., 2006; Luarn & Lin, 
2005). Self efficacy was included as an external factor in 
revised TAM which can impact both PU and PEoU 
(Kesharwani & Singh, 2012; Kim et. al 2008). In some of 
the studies it was found that usage of system gets influenced 
by perceiv ed usefulness and self efficacy (Alalwan et. al - 
2016;  Hong et al., 2002 ; Karahanna & Straub, 1999; Igbaria 
et al., 1997;).  
(Hu et. al 2019; Tan & Teo 2000)  stated that adoption of 
new technology is influenced by Government support. Many 
studies in past where TAM was studied with respect to 
different technologies and geographical regions,  it was 
found that intent to adopt technology was influenced 
majorly by government support. (Mandri & Chong 2018; 
Kirana et. al 2018, Marakarkandy & Dasgupta 2016; Haderi 
2014; Moon & Bretschneider 1997 ). In an empirical study 
on online banking (Chong et. al 2010 ) supported the 
argument that government support plays major role  in 
helping customer technology adoption.   
Many previous studies on adoption of new technologies 
established that technical support plays very vital role in 
decision making of users in choosing technol ogy ( Zheng et. 
al 2018; Borchers & Bewly 2015; Russell  & Bewley 2013; 
Chang et. al 2007 ). In terms of Information and 
Communication Technology applications like Internet 
Banking, Mobile banking, Mobile Computing Devices, 
personal computing, many researchers have found that 
intent to adopt and use the technolo gy is influenced by 
technical support.  (Son et. al 2012; Riquelme & Rios 2010; 
Chung & Kwon 2009; Shih & Fang 2004; Igbaria et. al 
1997).

  Therefore it is  very important to study and understand  the 
linkages between the constructs  identified. T o establish 
relationship between all the identified constructs Total 
Interpretive Structural Modeling  (TISM) has been used to 
develop a conceptual model.  
The steps discussed below and shown in Fig ure 2 are 
involved in TISM (Prasad et. al 2018; Jena et. al 2 016) –  
Step 1 : Identification of the constructs  
The identification of constructs for mobile banking was 
done literature review as discussed above.  
Step 2 : Identification of  links  between the constructs   
In this step, relationship between constructs will be 
established by understanding the effect of one constructs on 
other constructs.  
Step 3 : Relationship  Interpretation  
Once relationship has been established, each identified 
construct will be compared to other constructs one by one. 
Therefore, there will be 156 pairs of comparison for 13 
identified constructs. The existence or relationship will be 
depicted by “Y” whereas non existence will be shown by 
“N”. Further, against each “Y”, one interpretive questi on 
about the way construct – A effects construct -B will be 
asked and answered.  
Step 4 : Develop ment of  Interpretive logic -knowledge base  
In this step, each construct will be put into comparison with 
other constructs and existence or non -existence of 
relatio nship will be represented with letter “Y” or “N” 
respectively and for each “Y” further interpretation is done 
to understand the relationship.  
Step 5: Formation of  Reachability Matrix  
Reachability matrix , as shown in table 2,  will be formed by 
entering “1” for each existing relationship representing row 
construct is driving column construct. Final reachability 
matrix , as shown in table 3,  was obtained by testing 
transitivity in an iterative approach and inserting the same 
into initial reachability matrix.  
Step 6 : Reachability M atrix – Level Partition   
Under this step, reachability and antecedent set has been 
identified from initial reachability matrix , as shown in table 
4, table 5, table 6  and table 7 , through iterated process  of 
level partitioning. A construct with similar intersection and 
antecedent set has been assigned a level and excluded from 
analysis.   
Step 7 : Construction of digraph  
Digraph , as shown in Figure 3,  is the pictorial representation 
of relationships between constructs. It shows construct and 
direction of relationship through node and directed lines 
respectively. The direction is obtained as per reachability 
matrix. Direct relationships were shown with solid lines 
where as indirect relationships are shown with dotted lines.  
Step 8 : Development of i nterpretive matrix  
This binary matrix /MICMAC analysis, as shown in Table 8 , 
will be developed by using digraph, mentioning 
relationships among various constru cts from the 
interpretation given in interpretative logic -knowledge base. 
In this matrix 1 indicates the direct and transitive relation 
between constructs.  
Step 9 : Total Interpretive Structural Model  
In the final step, TISM model will be developed using 
interpretive matrix and digrah. This will be final figure , as 
shown in Figure 4,  showing all the relationships along with 
interpretation of the same. Each interpretation will be 
illustrated by the side of respective arrow link.   
Fig 2 – Basic Steps Involved in TISM  
For the current study 17  experts were consulted  to 
understand the relationship between various identified 
constructs. Expert group comprised of experts  from various 
institution (Bank officials  in the geographical area under 
study, Block Officers, MGNREGA executives, RBI, TRAI)

Analysis and Discussion  The research provides a TISM 
based conceptual model to enhance the mob ile banking in 
Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India  to improve 
financial inclusion. Both the driving and dependence of 
constructs will be established by direction of the link.  The 
model depicts that mobile banking usage is primarily 
depends on PEoU and PU. It was also observed that in 
addition to core constructs influencing  each other , six out of 
nine identified external constructs  further influence these 
core constructs.  After analysis it was also found that C7 
(Response Time), C8 (Output Quality) and C9 (Terminology Clarity) doesn’t influence the behavior 
intention and further actual usage of mobile banking in 
Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India . All these 
constructs come under “Aut onomous” category in 
MICMAC analysis. This indicates the variety of constructs 
which influences the adoption of mo bile banking in 
Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India . Therefore, to 
further push adoption of mobile banking services to improve 
financial inclusion would need determined endeavor on 
various facades. Further, these “Autonomous” constructs 
have higher dependence. This highlights that driver 
constructs  are most important working on which will 
improve adoption of mobile banking.

Fig 4  - TISM for mobile banking adoption  
 
V. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS  
Authors were not able to find any systematic study which 
will help to improve the adoption of mobile banking usage 
in Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India . This research 
will facilitate all the stakeholders involved in influencing the 
identified constru cts and impacting their correlation. The 
MICMAC analysis clearly shows that constructs coming 
under “Driver” category would need maximum attention to 
improve the usage of mobile banking in the Champawat 
District .  Most of the time, lot of efforts were put into 
dependence and lesser driving power constructs which leads 
to wastage of time. Therefore it’s very important to lay a 
strong foundation by working on “driver” constructs like 
perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, accessibility, 
trust, technology self efficacy, subjective norm,  technical 
support and government support  to sustainable adoption 
strategy for mobile banking.  
VI. CONCLUSION  
This paper develops a conceptual model  using TISM to 
present and interpret the hierarchical rela tionships b etween 
identified constructs  for mobile banking adoption . Further, 
driver constructs and dependence constructs out of the 
identified constructs were segregated using MICMAC  
  
analysis. This paper has endeavored to present a conceptual 
model to all the stakeholders working towards adoption of 
mobile banking to enhance financial inclus ion in 
Champawat district of Uttrakhand, India . In various studies, 
Mobile banking has been highlighted as the biggest 
disruption in the recent times which will and have bee n in 
some cases transformed the methods to do banking 
transactions. However, it is found that still lot of efforts is 
needed to bring the potential of mobile banking to reality as 
far as rural India is concerned . The categorization of drivers 
and dependent s constructs will help government and 
industry to prioritize the factors.  
Scope for  further study  
This may be the  first system atic studies on constructs of 
mobile banking  adoption  in Champawat district of 
Uttrakhand, India . It gives a foundation to carry out further 
research in this area and help bankers, government and 
citizens to enhance adoption of mobile banking and further 
improve the financial inclusion. Future study can be under 
taken to test and research these relat ionships formed by 
conceptual model. Also, develop strategies to work on 
indentified constructs for better adoption and actual usage of 
mobile banking.
