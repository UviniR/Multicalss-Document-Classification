Abstr act
Backgr ound: Globally , the rapid growth of technology and its use as a development solution has generated much interest in
digital health. In line with global trends, Bangladesh is also integrating technology into its health system to address disparities.
Strong political endorsement and uptak e of digital platforms by the government has influenced the rapid proliferation of such
initiati ves in the country . This paper aims to examine the implications of digital health on access to health care in Bangladesh,
considering who uses electronic devices to access health information and services and why.
Objecti ve: This study aims to understand how access to health care and related information through electronic means (digital
health) is affected by sociodemographic determinants (ie, age, gender , education, socioeconomic status, and personal and household
ownership of mobile phones) in a semiurban community in Bangladesh.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 854 households (between October 2013 and February 2014) and 20 focus group discussions
(between February 2017 and March 2017) were conducted to understand (1) who owns electronic devices; (2) who, among the
owners, uses these to access health information and services and why; (3) the awareness of electronic sources of health information;
and (4) the role of intermediaries (family members or peers who helped to look for health information using electronic devices).
Results: A total of 90.3% (771/854) of households (471/854, 55.2% of respondents) owned electronic devices, mostly mobile
phones. Among these, 7.2% (34/471) used them to access health information or services. Middle-aged (35-54 years), female, less
(or not) educated, and poorer people used these devices the least (α=.05, α is the level of signif icance). The lack of awareness,
discomfort, differences with regular care-seeking habits, lack of understanding and skills, and proximity to a health facility were
the main reasons for not using devices to access digital health.
Conclusions: Although influenced by sociodemographic traits, access to digital health is not merely related to device ownership
and technical skill. Rather , it is a combination of general health literac y, phone ownership, material resources, and technical skill
as well as social recognition of health needs and inequity . This study’ s findings should serve as a basis for better integrating
technology within the health system and ensuring equitable access to health care.

Introduction
Backgr ound
Globally , there has been an impressi ve growth in the number
of cell phones and internet users, and the price of services and
devices has decreased [1,2]. Mobile phones have become a
thriving mark et, characterized by 7.7 billion (estimated)
subscribers in 2017. Globally , the proportion of the population
covered by at least a second generation (2G) netw ork grew from
58% in 2001 to 95% in 2015. Internet penetration grew from
6.5% in 2000 to 43% in 2015, and the proportion of households
with internet access at home increased from 18% in 2005 to
46% in 2015 [3,4]. The mobile-cellular subscription per 100
inhabitants has exceeded 100% in developed countries, and
both developing and least developed countries (LDCs) are racing
toward similar levels. Since 2005, most subscriptions have come
from developing countries and LDCs, and the gap between these
and developed countries is reducing (Figure 1) [3].
According to the International Telecommunication Union, a
10% increase in internet speed can increase economic growth
by 1.3% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [5,6].
Given such growth and potential, both national and personal
spheres are now influenced by digital innovations, as
governments strate gize to expand coverage of developmental
initiati ves by reaching remote areas or individuals who engage
in web-based shopping or personal banking. In 2014, the
mobile-cellular industry generated US $3 trillion, which
contrib uted to 3.8% of the global gross domestic product, and
this number is expected to rise to 4.2% by 2020 [7]. This
economic contrib ution came about largely by linking previously
unconnected communities, financial inclusion through
eCommerce (use of electronic means including mobile phones
for financial purposes such as transferring mone y, everyday
banking etc), and designing and delivering innovative solutions
for impro ving quality of life (eg, sharing information, providing
services, technologies for mass production). Examples include
Tigo Kilimo by Tigo in Tanzania (launched in 2013) [7] and
Airtel Green SIM in India (launched in 2007) for eAgriculture
(use of electronic means including mobile phones to provide
and access information regarding farming techniques and related
products and mark et) [8,9] and TradeNet in Ghana [10] and
bKash in Bangladesh [11,12] for eCommerce and mCommerce
(using technology including mobile phones for financial
transactions) as mobile wallets. M-Pesa by Vodafone is one of
the largest mobile-based financial services in the world, used
by millions across Africa, Europe, and Asia [13-15]. The
information and communications technology (ICT) industry is
now a popular area for emplo yment worldwide. In 2014, the
mobile industry directly emplo yed approximately 13 million
people and indirectly supported 12 million more [7,16-18].
Similar to other development domains, health is also exploring
the potential of technology in impro ving the well-being of
people, including health-related well-being, which can range
from impro vement in health ailments to acquiring the necessary
information about health conditions or services.The integration of technology within health began as electronic
health (eHealth), the use of electronic platforms for the provision
of health information and services, data collection and
management, etc. When mobile phones are used to do the same,
it is called mobile health (mHealth) [19]. Currently , because of
the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, eHealth
and mHealth are now called digital health. Although digital
health indicates a much broader and smarter technology horizon,
eHealth and mHealth remain the major forms of technology
that are being endorsed for system integration to impro ve health
system performance and increase peoples’ access to health care
[20]. Therefore, there is a growing number of conferences,
workshops, websites, apps, and publications regarding how
electronic platforms can be implemented and integrated within
the health domain [1,2,21-23]. Bangladesh is also in the process
of doing the same. Currently , the country has 4 mobile cellular
operators and a signif icant subscription base (149 million).
Evidence suggests that a large proportion of households own
mobile phones (81%) [24-28]. The government’ s commitment
to digital development, popularly known as Digital Bangladesh,
has helped in fostering strate gic and polic y direction to adopt
ICT in health care (and other development domains) [29-32].
Due to the large subscription base and strong political mandate,
there are ≥42 internet-, SMS text messaging–, and call
center–based eHealth and mHealth initiati ves in the country
providing awareness regarding maternal health, drug and alcohol
abuse, smoking cessation, HIV/AIDS, and general health care
[19,29,33-36]. Despite these initiati ves, there is little systematic
evidence of the impact of technology on equitable access to
health services and information, especially in resource-poor
settings such as Bangladesh.
Access to health includes availability , geographic location,
affordability , and acceptability (by the community) of services.
Considering these dimensions, the challenge is to ensure that
everyone, irrespecti ve of their social group, gender , etc, can
access the required health care [37]. Bangladesh, despite its
successes, has several health system challenges and prevailing
health disparities, resulting in limited access to and utilization
of quality health care [38,39]. Globally , one of the assumptions
of the integration of technology for health care (and other
development initiati ves) is that digital health can contrib ute to
equitable access to health care, especially in LMICs. However,
there is evidence that access to electronic platforms can be
hindered because of sociodemographic, gender , and geographic
barriers—a state of disparity called the digital divide [40,41].
This divide bears great importance, especially when technology
is being endorsed for system integration to impro ve access to
health that can ensure universal health coverage (UHC) in
Bangladesh [42]. Considering the growth of ICTs and the
proliferation of digital health initiati ves, a frame work that
defines the dimensions of access to health information and
services through electronic means can contrib ute and is crucial
to this integration. This is because the rapid growth of ICTs and
related development solutions can often be misinterpreted as
being equivalent to access and use.

Objecti ve
This study aims to understand the degree to which ICTs enable
Bangladeshi people to increase their access to information and
impro ve their well-being by exploring the factors that influence
whether people have access to, and use, digital health
information and services (this refers to non-AI–, machine
learning–, or big data–based initiati ves, previously called
eHealth and mHealth). It focuses on who owns electronic
devices and uses their device to access health services and/or
information and the implications of this for health equity . The
findings can be useful in devising a frame work to ensure
equitable access to digital health information and services in
Bangladesh and relevant conte xts.
Methods
Study Setting, Population and Data Collection Tools
and Techniques
The data presented in this paper were collected using a mixed
methods design. The quantitati ve data, supported by research
funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council,
comes from a household survey to understand the role of ICTs
in health information seeking conducted between October 2013
and February 2014 in a subdistrict of Bangladesh called
Mirzapur in the Tangail district. Mirzapur was chosen because
it is semiurban with typical sociodemographic characteristics
of other such periurban subdistricts in the country [43]. As there
were no previous variance estimates of outcome variables, 0.5
was used to calculate the required sample size to obtain 95%
CIs with plus or minus 10% precision and a design effect of 2.
Thus, a sample size of 2401 was obtained, which finally became
2527, considering a 5% nonresponse rate. This was calculated
for 3 settings: urban (Dhaka), rural (Chakaria), and semiurban
(Mirzapur). Therefore, each setting ended up with a subsampleof 842. In Mirzapur , the sample size reached 854 households.
Sample households were selected from 28 villages (30
households per village) using systematic cluster sampling from
a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) [44].
Approximately 81% of the information was gathered from the
household head or the spouse of the head. Where neither the
head nor the spouse was present or able to take part, an adult
child of the head or the child’ s spouse was intervie wed. The
survey questionnaire was developed and pretested both in
Bangla and English (the Bangla version was used to collect
actual data) on a browser-based, open-source platform using
locally available 7-inch tablets with Android version 4.0. The
use of digital means to seek health information or services was
explained to the respondents as if the respondent (and/or any
member of the household) had heard of or used phones or
computers to seek information about any health issues or
services via voice call, SMS text messaging, or internet
browsing.
To further unpack the survey patterns and findings, 20 focus
group discussions (FGDs) were conducted from February to
March 2017 as part of the first author’ s PhD fieldw ork.
Respondents, who had never used electronic devices to seek
health services or information, were selected from 6 FGD groups
constructed from the HDSS using typical demographic and
economic traits: 8 rich and poor young female and male (colle ge
students) groups, 8 rich and poor middle-aged female and male
groups, and 4 rich and poor elderly female and male groups.
Data Analysis
The principal component analysis technique was used to elicit
asset scores, and its distrib ution was arranged in quintiles to
create the income groups. The lowest 2 quintiles were grouped
as poor, and the highest 2 quintiles were grouped as rich. The
distrib ution of the middle quintile was halved, and the lower
half added to the poor group and the upper half to the rich group

RenderXto remo ve the comple xity of constructing the FGD groups. As
it was a qualitati ve exercise, further discussion was conducted
with the group during the FGDs to subjecti vely triangulate the
accurac y and related homogeneity of the participants' income
status. Each group consisted of 4 to 5 participants, and the
discussions took place at locations preferred by the participants,
that is, households (for female respondents) and local gathering
places (for men). Each session lasted approximately 30 min,
facilitated by the first author (male and a PhD student). During
discussions, although agreements in opinions were sought,
disagreements were also noted along with the respondents’ body
language. A female notetak er was present during discussions
of the female groups. Discussions were conducted and later
transcribed in Bangla and then into English for internal
consistenc y.
The sociodemographic analysis was conducted by identifying
the frequencies of the respecti ve characteristics/traits.
Information on socioeconomic status (SES) was collected from
the HDSS as asset scores, a popular method called the asset
index. The range of scores was divided into 3 equal categories
(lowest as poor, middle, and highest as rich), and frequencies
of a sample belonging to the respecti ve categories were
identif ied. The ownership of electronic devices and the use of
devices were analyzed for (1) seeking information; (2) health
services or information; and (3) demographic factors such as
age, gender , education, and income to stratify the results. A
quantitati ve analysis, including tests of signif icant, was
performed using STATA version 14 (made by StataCorp), and
Microsoft Excel was used to construct graphs and some amount
of data management. The patterns indicated by the quantitati ve
analysis were further explored qualitati vely using content
analysis techniques [45,46]. Altogether , 3 broad themes
emer ged: (1) reasons for not using mobile phones or other
electronic devices, (2) the extent of awareness of electronic
sources of health information, and (3) the role of intermediaries
(family members or peers who helped to look for health
information using electronic devices). These were analyzed by
reference to the gender , SES, and education of respondents.
Both analyses were part of PhD studies supported by the
International Development Research Centre.
Ethical Consideration
Ethical appro val was obtained from the institutional review
boards of the survey partners: International Centre for Diarrhoeal
Disease Research, Bangladesh, and Institute of DevelopmentStudies, University of Susse x (for qualitati ve data collection).
Before data collection, the study was explained to the
participants, and written consent or thumbprints were obtained.
During data collection (both qualitati ve and quantitati ve),
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Results
Sociemographic Profile of the Respondents and
Ownership of Electr onic Devices
Tables 1-3show the sociodemographic characteristics and
ownership of electronic devices of the survey households and
respondents. The mean age of the respondents was 41.3 (SD
14.5) years, and 67.2% (574/854) of the respondents were
between the ages of 25 and 54 years. A total of 38.3% (327/854)
had less than primary education, and a small proportion (26/854,
3.0%) were graduates and above. More than half (494/854,
57.9%) of the households had 4 to 6 members, representing the
usual Bangladeshi family size [47]. In all, 71.9% (614/854) of
the respondents were female. There were more female
respondents because the survey was conducted during the
daytime when male members were away. A total of 73.1%
(625/854) of the respondents were not emplo yed (being a
house wife is not considered a job in Bangladesh), which was
not intentional. Conversely , 77.3% (660/854) of the household
heads were emplo yed. A total of 95.9% (819/854) of households
had a regular income, and 92.6% (791/854) of households had
no social security card (in Bangladesh, having a social security
card indicates that the corresponding household belongs to the
extremely poor socioeconomic group), a common feature of
semiurban Bangladesh. In all, 55.2% (471/854) of respondents
had personal electronic devices and 90.3% (771/854) of the
households owned at least one, which was almost always a
mobile phone. The personal ownership was considerably low,
perhaps because the survey population had male:female ratio
of 1:3 and in a conte xt like Bangladesh, women have less access
(in this case ownership) to devices compared with men.
However, in the case of household device ownership, family
members tend to share electronic devices, and there was always
a chance of a lack or less use of devices due to the influence of
other family members. Therefore, to understand the equity
implications of access to electronic devices, although lower,
personal ownership was considered in this study rather than
shared ownership.

Access to Health-Related Information or Services by
Respondents Who Owned Electr onic Devices and
Influence of Sociodemographic Characteristics
Tables 4and 5show that everyone who owned mobile phones
or laptops/computers had used those to communicate or seek
information, which included day-to-day conversations to seeking
specif ic services, such as agriculture or other government-related
information. It also showed that the predominant means of
seeking information was voice calls, followed by SMS text
messaging. Analysis of health information seeking for any health
concern, including information only, or services showed that
of all people who sought health information, a number (22/34,65%) reported seeking information/services for minor health
issues. Although everyone had used their device to seek some
form of information, only 7.2% (34/471) sought health services
or health information.
The use of electronic devices by the people who owned personal
devices was stratif ied by sociodemographic characteristics of
age (P=.02), sex (P=.41), education (P=.004), and SES (P<.01;
Table 6). Although overall use was low, the pattern suggests
that among those who used their devices, people who were
middle-aged (35 to 54 years), women, and poorer people who
had less or no education used them less than others. The
difference in use was found to be signif icant on the chi-square
test.

Barriers to Accessing Health Information and/or
Services by the Owners of Electr onic Devices
People who did not use electronic means to access health care
or information were further intervie wed over FGDs to explore
their reasons. Almost everyone has accessed some form of
electronic information at some point using mobile phones,
mostly through voice calls to an office (ie, local agriculture
office or bank) to ask for information. However, despite ample
promotion and publicity , the provision of electronic health
information or services and the words digital health were
unfamiliar to many. One male student mentioned:
I have never heard the word digital health until today .
No one told us that one can get health-r elated
information in this way. But sometimes we make calls
to some office to know about things. In this way we
can get information easily .
Female students had slightly different views. They preferred to
call their friends and/or family for information, as one explained:
We use mobile phones to talk about many things. If
we need to know about something , we call our friends
or elder s. But I can’t remember if we have ever talked
about digital health.
Nonetheless, some of them also use mobile phones to seek
health-related information despite a lack of familiarity with
formal words such as digital health. Most of the participants
had asked for advice from a family member or from someone
who had relevant knowledge. As a result, most were reluctantto use electronic means, and only a few had used their device
to seek health information, such as the internet and call center .
This indicates that people use their phones to ask advice from
friends, family , or social acquaintances but are not aware of or
do not use formal digital health services. As one of the
middle-aged female participants said:
We are ignor ant people , we don’t under stand all
these . Besides we don’t need this [digital health], it’s
enough if you can receive and make a call using a
phone .
The reasons mentioned in the FGDs for not using electronic
means to seek health information and/or services can be
summarized into 4 major reasons.
Awareness of Digital Health Services
Many participants were not aware of eHealth services. This was
usual in Bangladesh, given the ongoing promotion of the
telecom industry in Bangladesh. A few younger respondents
could mention GrameenPhone’ s health helpline (789), but most
of them had a general lack of understanding of eHealth services.
Respondents knew that 789 is a service to call physicians using
GrameenPhone mobile phones but did not know how it worked.
Other than lack of skill to navigate the device and the platform,
lack of awareness regarding associated costs and how to talk
about personal health ailments was a major concern for the
participants.
Most of the participants were confused by the promotional
activities undertak en by telecom companies. Mirzapur has an
abundance of kiosks and shops that offer a range of mobile

XSL•FO
RenderXphone–related services and products with colorful banners and
posters displaying information about these services. Considering
the overflow of information on display , FGD participants
described it as “difficult to distil information related to digital
health services. ” One of the male participants said:
The local shops are full of pictur es and words about
hundr eds of offers. Among those , I don’t remember
any explaining the availability of such type of health
service [digital health]. If we can’t find one, how can
we be awar e that such services exist?
The young and educated participants were more aware of digital
health services compared with others. However, even among
this group, most did not know much about these services. Some
of them were aware of social media–based health initiati ves and
promotions. Almost everyone had a Facebook account and had
seen adverts and information related to health. Although social
media (including Facebook) mostly presented information on
diet, health y lifestyles, and beauty tips, some serious issues such
as cancer , HIV, and AIDS have also been presented. As one of
the female students explained:
We don’t know what it is [eHealth] and how can we
get health information through it. Or how does it
work, how much mone y it takes etc. Most of us use
Facebook or at least have seen it. I sometimes get
posts related to beauty or diet-r elated tips. Sometimes
I get information on cancer . But I don’t know what
eHealth is. I think if digital health services can be
made as easy as Facebook, then everyone will come
to know about it.
Personal Comf ort and Acceptance
During FGDs, respondents (mostly women) expressed specif ic
concerns regarding not knowing the counselor/pro vider
personally and were hesitant to talk about personal issues and
illnesses. One female respondent said:
We are rural ignor ant people . How can we talk about
illnesses to someone , whom we don’t know or see?
We are shy and just can’t do it.
Middle-aged respondents expressed their lack of trust in the
accurac y and quality of digital health information and preferred
face-to-f ace interactions with the person providing the
information and advice. Almost everyone preferred to discuss
health care needs with their friends and family first, then with
local drug sellers and village doctors (quacks) before taking
them to formal medical providers. If someone advised them,
only then did they consider seeking health information or service
electronically . Young and educated respondents were more
inclined to use eHealth as they percei ved it as ensuring one’s
confidentiality and privacy. However, they had concerns about
cost. A young male participant said:
It takes up mone y from mobile account balance . Both
internet and talk time are expensive . But it’s true that
you can say many things over a phone which is rather
difficult in a face to face consultation with a person
whom you know .Literacy and Skills
Some participants mentioned that they lacked the skills needed
to access digital health effectively. This ranged from proficienc y
in and with English (and Roman letters) and technical ability
to navigate the device and its softw are (ie, specif ic app, browser,
and internet settings). For example, calling a call center entails
the ability to press specif ic numbers in response to questions
or directions. Alternati vely, browsing the internet requires
English literac y and technical skills to set their devices for
internet use. One of the middle-aged participants said:
It’s easier for young people . They know how to do
this using their mobile phones or computer s. They
also have the skills to do that. That’ s why I don’t have
internet in my phone .
Some young participants also felt that lack of proficienc y in
English is a barrier to accessing information and services
electronically . One of them mentioned:
We are Bengali people and Bangla is our langua ge.
We are not very good at English which, in my opinion,
is our main problem
Some of the young participants mentioned that family members
had asked them (or their friends) to look for health information
electronically , but they never looked for it themselv es. One of
the elderly respondents said:
We are old and that’s why we don’t know much about
it. We can only receive and make calls. Sometimes if
someone sends an SMS, we take the phone to the other
member s of the house to find out what it is. We do the
same when we want to know something about the
phone .
Proximity to Health Facilities
One of the reasons why respondents did not engage with digital
health in Mirzapur was the availability of and access to
conventional, formal health services within their vicinity .
Mirzapur has a public hospital, the Upazila (subdistrict) Health
Comple x, and a philanthropic hospital (Kumudini). For any
medical emer gency, anyone can visit these hospitals instead of
using a call center or other digital health services. During
discussions, participants agreed that it could be one of the
reasons for their reluctance to use digital health services,
including information. One of the middle-aged participants
mentioned:
Kumudini hospital was established long time ago and
is just beside our house . It is much easier and more
comfortable for us to visit this hospital when needed.
Besides we also have the upazila hospital.
Discussion
Principal Findings
This study aims to examine the current linear understanding
that access to technology results in access to health care by all.
Considering digital health services as a proxy for the integration
and implementation of technology for providing health care and
information, it has used sociodemographic characteristics to

RenderXexplore which population groups have access to technology and
have accessed digital health services. In more elaborate terms,
it focuses on the degree to which ICT and technology has
enabled Bangladeshi people to increase their access to
information and impro ve their well-being by exploring the
factors that influence whether people have access to electronic
devices (namely , mobile phones or personal computers/laptops)
and use these devices to access health services and/or
information digitally . The findings show that although there is
high household ownership (771/854, 90.3%) of mobile phones,
personal ownership is much lower (471/854, 55.2%). Everyone
who owned a personal mobile phone used it to seek information
and services electronically , but only a small proportion (34/471,
7.2%) used it to seek health-related information or services.
Although the data suggested younger men and those with a
higher education and SES chose to use their devices to access
digital health, there was little statistical evidence that
sociodemographic factors influenced the use of digital health
information and services. According to the findings from the
FGDs, nonuse of devices to seek health-related information or
services was related to the perception of digital health as an
unfamiliar health care–seeking model. Other factors were lack
of technological skills and related literac y to seek electronic
information or services, associated cost of accessing information,
lack of awareness about digital health services, and proximity
to functioning health centers.
In the conte xt of rural Bangladesh, previous works have reported
slightly lower household ownership of mobile phones, but with
an upward trend [28,31,48]. The data reported in this paper were
collected later, and in a semiurban conte xt (Mirzapur), which
is adjacent to Dhaka. Mirzapur is thus likely to have greater
access to technology and resources than rural Bangladesh. The
high ownership of electronic devices found in this paper is
consistent with what others have reported. However, if
ownership of devices is used as a proxy for access to digital
technology , the data show that only about half of the respondents
have personal devices. As there is a dearth of evidence regarding
the personal ownership of devices in Bangladesh, it was not
possible to compare the findings with the situation in other parts
of the country . Nevertheless, the general idea that high
household ownership and subscription to mobile-cellular
netw orks means high access to technology needs to be
reconsidered and explored further .
Socio-Demograph y of the Use of Digital Health
Although this paper has shown that only a small proportion
(7.2%) of owners have used their phones to access digital health
for health services or information, in the rural conte xt, use of
devices to access digital health has been reported to be even
lower (2%) [28]. The difference in the spread of technology
over time and conte xt and related access (semiurban versus
rural) can be the reason for this difference. However, such low
use of devices generally to access digital health does not indicate
that everyone is unable to access services or information
digitally . In line with these findings, globally (including
Bangladesh), male, young, educated, and wealthier groups are
more likely to use their electronic devices to seek general
information and health information or services [49-52]. A
recently published paper , based on the findings from Mirzapur ,reported that the use of mobile phones to access health
information at least once in the last 12 months was 45% in
colle ge students (young and educated adults) compared with
18% in the general population. It also reported that internet
users were predominantly (two-third) male phone owners [26].
Therefore, this paper strongly argues that any attempt to
integrate technology in the health systems of Bangladesh (and
similar conte xts) and to endorse related digital health
innovations must take into account sociodemographic attrib utes
and the fact that services are more likely to be accessed by
young, educated, and male populations. Although this represents
a potential disparity in access to digital health, it also positions
young and educated people to help the diffusion of technology
in the community as change agents and therefore paves the way
toward the much discussed and desired integration of technology
into the health system to meet the challenges of UHC in
Bangladesh and related conte xts [42].
Other Factors Influencing the Use of Digital Health
The other reasons for the low uptak e of digital health include
lack of awareness about digital health in terms of its modus
operandi and availability , lack of personal comfort and
acceptance of this form of health service or information, lack
of literac y and skill for using digital health technology , and
proximity to other health facilities that provide emer gency care.
However, these reasons are not mutually exclusi ve, and the
relationship within and between them must be examined further
in terms of underlying equity challenges. Awareness regarding
digital health initiati ves is possibly the first and foremost of
these reasons, yet communicating the potential of digital health
is not, as discussed above, straightforw ard. Many middle-aged
residents have access to household resources and the relevant
educational achie vements (Table 1) that would make accessing
digital health possible, but they are not sufficiently informed
and do not have the technological skills (Table 2). They are
simultaneously disinclined to pursue health services or
information provided in this manner because they are unfamiliar
with and do not trust the mode of delivery. Moreo ver, should
they or their family members have a health need, particularly
an urgent or emer gency one, they would be able to access
Mirzapur’ s other health facilities. Young people, by contrast,
are aware of the potential of digital health and have the relevant
skills and literary sophistication required (Table 1). As indicated
by others, they do not have the material resources and influence
that would support and facilitate access to digital health (ie,
financial resources and decision-making capacity in health care
need) [26]. As a result, they tend to use this service when, as
shown above, older people who have the necessary resources
request that young people engage with digital health services
or information. Young people, like the older generations, have
access to Mirzapur health facilities when there is an emer gency;
however, their primary health concerns are, as others have
reported and the earlier discussion indicates, private, nonur gent,
and often deemed unnecessary , such that their concerns are
dismissed and they are treated with disrespect [26].
The importance of sociodemographic and economic factors and
related material factors was highlighted in other
technology-based health interv entions in Bangladesh. One of
the popular mHealth interv entions in Bangladesh called

RenderXAponjon, supported by the United States Agenc y for
International Development and implemented in 2012, was
designed to provide voice or text message–based pregnanc y
and newborn care. After studying the impact of the interv ention,
it was concluded that exposure to Aponjon messages was not
associated with impro ved maternal and child health outcomes,
such as the presence of skilled birth attendance at birth,
breast-feeding practices, or facility delivery. Rather , higher
sociodemographic and income status of the mother was more
signif icantly associated with reported impro vements [53].
Another interv ention study was piloted to understand the
feasibility and acceptability of a mobile phone-based
interv ention that combined counseling and the payment of cash
transfers to impro ve the perception of both maternal nutrition
during pregnanc y and nutrition of the infant in rural Bangladesh.
Although the study could not conclude the interv ention as
effective, it highlighted other material issues such as charging
the mobile phone or spending cash (obtained from the project)
to feed one’s family rather than focusing on the nutrition of the
pregnant mother or infant as major barriers to the effectiveness
of such mHealth interv entions [54].
Conclusions
There is high awareness and use of electronic devices to access
electronic information and/or services across various
sociodemographic categories in Bangladesh. Global trends
suggest that access to the use of mobile phones and computers
is expanding, including conte xts like Bangladesh [15,31].
However, Mirzapur’ s respondents continued to avoid digital
health initiati ves. Why? The only paper that has tried to explain
the reason for such low use in Bangladesh concluded that,
although the community has some technological readiness and
will to use mHealth, lack of adequate human resources and
technological abilities of the people may have restricted the use
of electronic devices for health services or information [55].
Inequitable access to health care is one of the major health
system concerns for LMICs, including Bangladesh. Expansion
of coverage of health care provision and implementing efficient
polic y making and governance activities is critical for impro ving
population access to health care. At the same time, adopting an
equity focus can ensure the inclusion of various population
groups. The central question in this paper is, therefore, does
high access to technology mean that various sociodemographic
groups can access digital health services, thereby having higher
access to health care and information? The answer lies in how
technology interf aces with other social determinants of health
to produce equity and inequity . Shankardass et al [56] argued
that health inequities are caused by comple x social, economic,and political factors (ie, the influence of gatekeepers,
affordability of services, provision of quality health care, and
strate gies to secure access of poor and vulnerable groups to
health). These factors limit recognition of the need for and
creation of proequity policies. Digital health promises to address
access to health services and information [57], and, in
demonstrating substantial growth in technological access, it
gives the impression that challenges in access to health services
and information are being addressed, leading to a decrease in
the digital divide. However, as shown in this paper , this
approach of ubiquitous access to technology obscures how
inequity in access to health plays out. As Embrett and Randall
[58] argue, addressing health inequity is dependent on generating
public awareness to develop sufficient political incenti ves for
change. However, the lack of access to health services and health
information that, for instance, young people experience is not
socially ackno wledged. Digital health information and services
offer some potential to address this challenge, with young people
having appropriate awareness, sufficient skills, education, and
literac y that would make this an attracti ve option, but they lack
the English sophistication required to articulate health needs
and use, and they do not have the necessary resources to turn
this into a reality . Addressing inequity in digital health requires
action to increase not only device ownership and the technical
skills necessary to operate these devices but also the material
resources to encourage their use and social recognition of health
needs and inequity .
This paper presents evidence on the implications of the adoption
of digital health services on equitable access to health. To
capitalize on the growth of technology , it is important to
recognize that without appropriate recognition, digital health
services may result in underused services and can influence
further disparities such as information-rich poor groups. This
means that without the required approach, whereas some social
groups will have more access to health care because of their
better health, technology , and general literac y, others may
become vulnerable and marginalized with restricted access.
This should serve as a basis for any future attempt in devising
(and adopting) operational frame works that envision both
accountability and equity for effective integration of ICT
platforms (digital health) to address disparities and related health
systems challenges for Bangladesh and other LMICs.
Limitations of the Study
This survey was undertak en with the expectation of high levels
of digital health usage. As a result, insuf ficient attention was
paid to the use of mobile phones for health information through
casual conversations among peers and kin.
