Abstract  
Background: The proper use of Partograph supports to capture key maternal and fetal data. Paper -
based Partograph are prone to err or, incompleteness, delaye d decisions and loss of clients’ 
information. Electronic (e -Partograph) enables to easily retain and retrieve client data to ensure quality 
of care. Mobile technologies found an opportunity for resource -limited countries to improv e access and 
quality of he alth care. Evidences were lacking on end users’ acceptance to e -Partograph.  
Objective: This study aimed to assess obstetric care providers’ willingness to use mobile based e -
Partograph and its associated factors.  
Methods: Institutional based cross -sectiona l study was conducted from December 30, 2016 to January 
21, 2017. A total 466 obstetric care providers were selected using multistage sampling technique in 
North Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A structured self -administe red questionnaire was used to 
collect the data. The data were entered in to Epi info version 7 and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. 
Cronbach’s Alpha test was calculated to evaluate the reliability of data. A multivariable logistic 
regression analysis wer e used to identify factors associa ted with dependent variable. Adjusted odds 
ratio with 95%CI was used to determine the presence of association.  
Results: The study found that 460(99.6%) of care providers owned mobile phone. Smartphone owners 
accounted only  102(22%). Of them, 205(46%) were willing to use mobile -phone for e -Partograph. Care 
providers aged >30 years (AOR=2.85, 95% C.I: 1.34 -6.05), medical doctors and higher level clinicians 
(AOR=8.35, 95% C.I: 2.07 -33.63), Health Center (AOR=4.41, 95% C.I: 0.10-9.26), favorable attitude 
towards  Partograph (AOR=2.76, 95% C.I: 1.49 -5.09) and related in -service trainings (AOR=7.63, 95% C.I: 
3.96 -14.69) were enabling factors for willingness to use mobile phone.  
Conclusions: Almost all obstetric care providers had ac cess to mobile phone, however; sma rtphone 
ownership is still low. Willingness to use mobile -phone for e -Partograph was low. Younger aged, lower Willingness to Use Mobile ba sed e -Partograph and Associated Factors among Care Providers in

Background  
In the sub -Saharan Africa region, maternal mortality accounted fo r 62% (179,000)the global 
maternal deaths [ 1]. Maternal mort ality ratio was 412 per 100,000 live births in Ethiopia [ 2]. The 
majority (70%) of deaths attributed to obstructed labor and ruptured uterus [ 3]. The ultimate 
concerns of delivery care are to achi eve a healthy mother and baby with the least possible level of 
intervention, early detection and management of complications. Thus; prevention of prolonged 
and obstructed labor by using partograph during labor is a key intervention in the reduction of 
mate rnal and perinatal morbidity and mortality [ 4]. 
Partograph i s one of the strongest and cost -effective tools to prevent unnecessary delay and serve 
as frontrunner for obstetric caregivers [ 5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 
using the Partogr aph to follow labour and delivery with the objective to redu ce maternal and fetal 
morbidity and mortality [ 6]. Partograph is less expensive tool designed to offer a continuous 
pictorial view of labour progress and to analyze cervix dilation, uterine contra ction and fetal heart 
rate in relation to time. It helps to predict deviation from normal progress of labour, and supports 
timely and proven intervention. Key measurements, including cervical dilation, fetal heart rate, 
duration of labour and vital signs a re recorded on the Partograph in graph format. It also helps  to 
facilitate responsibility to the person attending labour [ 7]. 
Evidences showed that Partograph is underutilized and misused in health facilities which reflect 
poor monitoring of mothers in labour and/or poor pregnancy outcome due to poor knowledge and 
attitude towards the tools [ 8-10]. Paper -based Partograph are prone to error, incompleteness, delay 
and loss of client information in the health care system [ 11]. Despite long years of training s and 
investments on partograph in low -resource settings, the p aper-based partograph is still 
underutilized [ 12,13 ]. To have an intended pregnancy outcome proper use of a Partograph to record level clinicians, Hospital based workers, unfavorable attitude on Partograph and lack of in -service 
trainings we re main factors for non -willingnes s. Hence awareness creation on partograph use and 
digital capacity building are crucial for effective e -partograph management.

key maternal and fetal data is critical. A digital Partograph wi ll make it easy to retain patient 
information and to access cli ent data [ 14]. It also reduces bulk of paperwork and helps to improve 
timely decision [ 14]. High penetration of mobile technologies has become an opportunity for 
resource -limited countries to i mprove access and quality of health care delivery [ 15-18]. The use 
of e-partograph exhibits limitations due to unreliable connectivity, power sources, low levels of 
technical training, maintenance and scalability costs [ 19]. 
This study was intended to asse ss willingness of obstetric care providers’ to use mobile phone  as 
electronic (e -Partograph) and associated factors. Therefore, the findings of this was aimed to give 
insight for researchers in formulation of appropriate interventional studies to curb exis ted 
problems.  
Methods  
Study design and setting  
Institutional ba sed cross -sectional study was conducted from December 30, 2016 to January 21, 
2017 in North Gondar zone. This Zone has a total population of 2,929,628, of whom 1,486,040 
were men and 1,443,588 women [ 2]. In the zone, 23 Woredas (districts), around 1,107 ob stetrics 
care providers in 9 hospitals and 126 health centers were serving the catchment population. In this 
study the source population was all obstetric care providers who were working in pub lic hospitals 
and health centers in North Gondar Zone. Obstetri c care providers were a certified midwife, nurse, 
Health Officers, Integrated Emergency Obstetrics and Surgery & Medical Doctors who provide 
care for the woman during labor and delivery. Consid ering unknown magnitude of willingness to 
use e -partograph(p=50 %) and finite population correction formula and design effect of 1.5; a total 
of 466 participants were included in this study. Care providers who were working in delivery units 
either on regula r basis, by rotation or at night duty time were included in the  study. Four hospitals 
and 56 health centers were randomly selected from 9 hospitals and 126 Health centers. Finally, the 
study participants were proportionally selected from each selected faci lity using multistage 
sampling technique.  
Data collection tools  and techniques  
The dependent variable of the study was willingness to use mobile phone for e -Partograph. 
Independent variable includes: socio -demographic characteristics (age, sex, marital sta tus, religion 
and residence), Mobile phone access (accessibilit y, type of mobile phone); professional 
characteristics (type of profession, year of experience, qualification level, pre -service training, and 
in-service training on Partograph) and Facility re lated factors (type of facility and working unit). 
Providers’ k nowledge and attitude on partograph were also addressed as independent variables. 
Obstetric care providers who scored mean value and above to knowledge related to Partograph 
questions were dete rmined to have good knowledge [ 20]. Obstetric care providers wh o scored 
mean value and above to attitude related to Partograph questions were also determined to have 
favorable attitude [ 21]. Willingness to Use Mobile ba sed e -Partograph and Associated Factors among Care Providers in

A self -administrated questionnaire was used to collect the data u sing a structured English 
questionnaire. The questionnaire was adopted from previously published articles. The 
questionnaire consists of sociodemographic characteristics, qualification, current working 
department, knowledge and attitude about Partograph, a nd previous obstetric care training.  
Before the actual data col lection, the questionnaire was pre -tested. Training was given for data 
collectors for two days.  
Data processing and analysis  
Data clean up and cross -checking was done before analysis. All the q uestionnaires were checked 
visually, coded and entered into Epi -info7 and exported to SPSS version 20 software package for 
analysis. Furthermore, the Cronbach’s Alpha test was calculated to evaluate the reliability of the 
tool. Both bivariate and multivari able logistic regression were used to identify any association 
between the dependent and independent variables. Association and strength were presented using 
Crude and adjusted odd’s ratios, 0.05 level of significance and 95% confidence intervals.

Discussion  
In low income settings, the ubiquity and penetration of mobile devices provided a potential 
opportunity for using m -Health applications in hard -to-reach areas. Access and type of mobil e 
phone technology are precondition among other required infrastructures to enable use of m -Health 
technology in the health care delivery.  
In this study, 460(99.6%) of the obstetric care providers in public health facilities were accessed 
to mobile phone. Evidences also showed that Mobile computing devices were increasingly being 
used by health care professionals and soon will become ubiquitous i n clinical environments [ 22]. 
In this study, however, smartphone ownership was low which accounted only 102(22%) and the 
rest 358 (78%) were basic cellphone owners. This evidence couldn’t be in line with the prospect 
of smartphone applications on massive d evelopment globally to be widely used by health 
professionals for health care services [ 23]. The growing penetrat ion rate of the mobile technology 
still gives optimism to reach the envisaged visions.  
Studies in health information technologies often focused  on the design and implementations; little 
attention is payed for end users’ acceptance and reaction to the techn ologies [ 24]. Evidences 
showed that underuse, resistance, and overrides, sabotage, and abandonment of the technologies 
were some of the scenari os [25,26 ]. This study tried to assess willingness of end users (obstetric 
care providers) to use mobile based e -Partograph in their routine care. The finding shown that 
205(44%) of the participants were willing to use mobile based e -Partograph. It indicat es that care 
providers’ acceptance to e -Partograph were lower as of the envisioned penetration. It also known 
that in a hospital and clinical settings, the deployment of new digital data recording technologies 
often faces poor acceptance by clinicians [ 27]. Willingness to Use Mobile ba sed e -Partograph and Associated Factors among Care Providers in

The multivariable logistic regression analysis identified that age of care provider, level of 
profession, worki ng place, type of mobile phone owned and received in -service training related to 
Partograph were main factors associated with willingness to us e mobile phone for e -Partograph. 
Care providers aged >30 years were 3 times (AOR=2.85, 95% C.I: 1.34 -6.05) higher  likely to be 
willing to use mobile based e -Partograph than younger aged care providers. Medical Doctors and 
higher level clinicians were more (AOR=8.35, 95% C.I: 2.07 -33.63) likely to be willing than 
Nurses. Those care providers working at Health Centers were more (AOR=4.41, 95% C.I:.10 -
9.26) likely willing than Hospital based workers. This finding seems inconsistent with general 
truth in which Hospitals consists of higher level care providers, better infrastructure and budget 
that would tend the care prov iders to be willing to use mobile, while the finding was inversely 
happened. Likewise, smartphone owners were 61% less (AOR=.39, 95% C.I: .21 -.74) likely 
willing to use mobile based e -Partograph. This finding was also deviated from the general truth 
that s martphone owners tends to be willing for e -Partograph.  
Provision of in -service training related to Partograph was enabling factor (AOR=7.63, 95 % C.I: 
3.96-14.69) for willingness to use mobile phone for e -Partograph. Similarly, studies conducted in 
low inco me countries showed that lack of training was a barriers to proper partograph use 
[10,28,29 ]. According to evidences, even primary health care workers with little or no formal 
education can be effectively trained to use the partograph [ 30]. Care providers with favorable 
attitude towards Partograph were more (AOR=2.76, 95% C.I: 1.49 -5.09) likely willing to use 
mobile than the counter parts. The fi ndings supported each other in which attitude is largely a 
result of extensive training.  
Limitation  
The study did  not include obstetric care providers in private health facilities; so, this finding may 
not be generalizable to all obstetric care providers North Gondar zone.  
Conclusion  
Almost all obstetric care providers had access to mobile phone, however; smartphone ownership 
is still low. Willingness to use mobile -phone for e -Partograph was low. Younger aged, lower level 
clinicians, Hospital bas ed workers, unfavorable attitude on Partograph and lack of in -service 
trainings were main factors for non -willingness. Hence  awareness creation and providing in -
service training on partograph use and digital capacity building are crucial for effective e -
partograph management.
