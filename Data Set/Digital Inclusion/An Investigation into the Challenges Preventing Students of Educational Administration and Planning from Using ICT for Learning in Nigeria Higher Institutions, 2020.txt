  The main purpose of this research work is to investigate the challenges 
preventing students of educational administration and planning from using 
ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions: a case study of university of 
Abuja, Nigeria. The sample for this study was all the students in university of 
Abuja. 50 students from each level of the department of educational 
administration and planning t otaling 200 were randomly selected from the 
department using simple random sampling technique. One hypothesis and 
three research questions were postulated as a guide to this study and a seven 
sub-items questionnaire divided into two sections was used to ge t the required 
information. A simple percentage and chi -square were used to test the 
hypotheses at 0.95% level of significance. It was found out that there are 
challenges preventing students of educational administration and planning 
from using ICT for lea rning. The challenges preventing students of educational 
administration and planning from using ICT for learning includes; unstable 
power supply, lack of personal laptop or computer system, unstable ICT 
Network services, lack of computer literacy by the st udents, High cost of ICT 
services, poor infrastructural facilities of ICT in higher institutions and poor 
computer literacy of the lecturers. Base on the findings, the researchers 
recommends that the government should increase the funding of education in 
Nigeria to enable schools administrators provide necessary ICT facilities in 
their various schools.  Keyword s:

1. INTRODUCTION  
Nigeria has a federal system of government with 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory 
of Abuja. Within the states, there are 744 local governments in total. Education is administered by 
the federal, state and local governments. The Federal Ministry o f Education is responsible for overall 
policy formation and ensuring quality control, but is primarily involved with tertiary education. 
School education is largely the responsibility of state (secondary) and local (elementary) 
governments. The country is multilingual, and home to more than 250 different ethnic groups. The 
languages of the three largest groups, the Yoruba, the Ibo, and the Hausa, are the language of 
instruction in the earliest years of basic instruction; they are replaced by English in Grad e 4. Nigeria’s 
education system encompasses three different sectors: basic education (nine years), post -basic/senior 
                ISSN : 2721 -3056

secondary education (three years), and tertiary education (four to six years, depending on the program 
of study).  
According to Nigeria’s Na tional Policy on Education [1], basic education covers nine years 
of formal (compulsory) schooling consisting of six years of elementary and three years of junior 
secondary education. Post -basic education includes three years of senior secondary education.  At the 
tertiary level, the system consists of a university sector and a non -university sector. The latter is 
composed of polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education. The tertiary sector as a whole 
offers opportunities for undergraduate, graduate , and vocational and technical education.  The 
Nigerian higher education system is comprised of Universities, Polytechnic and Colleges of 
Education offering programs in areas such as teacher education and agriculture. It is the largest and 
most complex high er education system on the continent.  
The National Universities Commission (NUC) in Nigeria is the only body saddled with the 
responsibility of managing the Nigerian universities. The commission in different times has come up 
with policies to integrate ICT  into the Nigerian Universities education system for a total development 
of the country. According to Akuegwu et al.  [2] who noted that National Universities Commission 
(NUC) in Nigeria has prescribed that there should be at least one computer to every fou r students 
and one PC to every two lecturers below the grade of lecturer I, one PC per senior lecturer and one 
notebook per reader/ professor. NUC has gone further to establish e -learning platforms fitted with 
twenty smart boards in twelve Federal universi ties for the promotion of the use of ICT in teaching 
and learning. Majority of the Nigerian universities have not achieved this recommended system ratio 
for their faculties, though some have made giant or notable strides in campus wide area networking 
and e-learning course deliveries. Institutions like Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) and 
University of Nigeria, Nsukka boast of its best -developed ICT system in the country with a personal 
VSAT access to the internet and a campus wide intranet services.Univers ity of Jos which is blazing 
the trail for content development and e -learning in addition to the campus networking . 
The used of ICT in the Nigerian universities both public and private have not been 
encouraging. According to Adavbiele [3] very few of Public  higher institutions in the country are 
capable of meeting the ICT needs of their staff and students. The question now is what happens to 
the rest institutions? Many university lecturers and students have to go to commercial cyber cafés in 
town before they  have access to a computer that is internet connected or at best buy private models 
with which they are able to connect to the internet.  
The private universities seem to be better off since majority of them like Covenant University 
(CU), Afe Babalola Univ ersity, American University of Nigeria (AAUN), etc have 24 -hour internet 
connectivity in their campuses but the population of lecturers and students compared to public 
universities are few. At AAUN for instance, each student is provided a laptop with the c ost factored 
into the fee structure. That of course will not be within the reach of many students [3].  
Cheung and Huang [4] emphasized the use of ICT as an effective teaching tool in university 
education as many university teachers now publish their cours e materials via the internet. They 
suggested that it is insufficient for only university to use ICT for good job combination leaving out 
the students’ ability to do same. Educational technologists have cited may reasons as to why an 
education system based on ICT can more effectively result in positive pedagogic outcomes than one 
based only on conventional techniques  [5-9]. 
Students formed the largest part of any academic community and their viewpoint has to be 
respected. Considering the role they play in an y activity that takes place in the school settings, 
psychologist argued that student should be seen as dynamic and integral members of the learning 
community not just as aloof beneficiaries or even a mere consumers. Abubakar  [9] is in the feeling 
that ICT evacuates issues concerning space and time where students can correspond with their teacher 
and exchange information anywhere, anytime. As a rule the students can bring from a worldwide 
pool of learning as ICT makes serving and sharing of information simpler. The learners can 
exclusively and/or together make notes and presentations therefore enlist their advancement and use 
it for examinations along these lines they are additionally prepared for future support in worldwide 
exploration and correspondenc e. Once more, partners in the field of instruction technology agreed 
that ICT in training will promote students cognitive qualities through higher order thinking, critical Int. J. Adv. Data Inf. Syst.  ISSN: 2721 -3056  

reasoning, enhanced relational abilities and profound comprehension of the learning apparatuses and 
ideas to be taught. Promoting a strong, intuitive educating and learning environment by making more 
extensive learning correspondence and hence give learning instruments to students particularly those 
with exceptional needs. Utilizing compu ter produced design to outline connections of numerous 
types particularly methods that can't be represented manually by individual [13].  
There are many challenges that prevents students of higher institutions in Nigeria from using 
ICT for effective learnin g. This paper is aimed to  investigate the challenges preventing students of 
educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions: 
a case study of university of Abuja, Nigeria.  
 
2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  
According to Adavbiele [3] there are significant bodies of research relating to the obstacles 
of ICT integration in teaching and learning in the developed countries such as US and UK, but in the 
developing countries like Nigeria, especially at the universi ty level, such publications are few and 
scanty in scope, if they exit at all. Whereas such publications are valuable information sources for 
countries which would like to improve and make a success on ICT tools integration in teaching and 
learning. Apagu a nd Wakili [14] observed that most of the research works on ICT in education 
focuses on the availability of the ICT facilities and the perceptions of the use of ICT in the nation`s 
institutions. There have been many researchers in ICT uses in primary school s, ICT application in 
senior secondary schools and challenges confronting ICT uses in higher institutions but none of the 
researchers have narrow research to the students of educational administration and planning students. 
It is against this back ground t hat I decided to research on this study to investigate the challenges 
preventing students of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning in 
Nigeria higher institutions: a case study of university of Abuja, Nigeria and to suggest pos sible 
solutions to the challenges identified in the study.  
 
3. LITERATURE REVIEW  
3.1. Concept of Educational administration and planning in Nigerian Higher institutions  
Educational administration and planning was introduced into the Nigerian Higher 
institutions wi th the aims of producing educational administrators and planners for all phases of the 
educational sector in Nigeria. Educational administration and planning is offer in most Nigerian 
universities as a programme or department. Educational administration an d planning is also offer as 
an elective course in 400 levels.  The nomenclature of the programme is Bachelor of Arts education 
i.e B.A [Ed] Educational administration and planning. The duration of the programme is four [4] 
academic section. The minimum cre dit unit required for graduation is 148. The admission 
requirements entry into the programme in universities is five Credits at SSCE, GCE ‘O’ Level, 
NECO and NABTEB Including English Language, Mathematics and other relevant three credit 
passes and Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination [UTME], the candidate shall be required to 
pass the University post UTME Screening test before being admitted for hundred level [100L] . 
 
3.2. Objectives of educational administration and planning in Nigerian Higher institution s 
Here it is the objectives of educational administration and planning in Nigerian higher 
institutions  
a. To raise an educational administrators and planners who are confidence, independence, efficient,  
visionary and innovative and problem solving in the educational sectors;  
b. To create in students the awareness and enthusiasm for educational administration and planning;  
c. To generate in students an appreciation of the importance administration and planning in 
education, economic, technological and social cont ext; 
d. To provide students with the knowledge and skill -base for further studies in projection, 
forecasting, statistics, micro -planning, data management and demography;  
e. To provide a broad and balance foundation, knowledge and practical skills in educational 
administration and planning.  
The students offering educational administration and planning in Nigerian higher institutions 
are many. The knowledge of ICT is very important for them due to their functions and responsibilities                 ISSN : 2721 -3056  
 International Journal of Advances in Data and Information Systems , Vol. 1, No. 2, October 2020  :  69 – 79 72 
as an edu cational administrator s and planners. As leaners in the universities, they need to be computer 
literate. It is strongly believed that ICT can facilitate the teaching methods and encourage learners` 
understanding as can be seen in using softwares like CAI, CAL, CBT etc. Numerous  studies have 
discovered constructive outcome connected with innovation supported teaching and learning [13-
16]. 
Abubakar [9] Modern instructional techniques required the use of ICT which provide a more 
simplified and reliable teaching and learning methodologies. From the students` viewpoint the 
integration of ICT education helps  in both cooperative and self -paced learning. Stud ents can adjust 
their learning paces with immediate feedback and self -assessment in an institution where the new 
technologies are being used. Such students extend their learning capabilities beyond classrooms as 
they can communicate with peers from everywh ere around the globe. This novel achievement of the 
21st century is presently not fully employed in the north -eastern region of Nigerian public secondary 
schools. This negative development might not be unconnected with the lack of ICT facilities in our 
public schools, negligence from the authorities concerned or the misuse of the available ICT 
equipment on the ground by the teachers. This unfortunate situation is in fact, what motivates the 
researcher to evaluate the level of ICT usage in our public seconda ry schools.  
According to Sherrell [17], a 21st century student is one who learns or works collaboratively 
with class mates and other peers around the world in a global classroom. Unlike in the past, where 
students see as someone who goes to school, spent a  specific amount of time take recommended 
subjects receive a passing grade  and finally graduate.  
 
3.3. Uses of ICT in Educational institutions in Nigeria  
Chinwe  [18] carried out a research to investigate Implementing ICT Techniques in Teaching 
for effective implementation of the new nine years UBE curriculum is the objective of this research 
study. The study investigated the effective implementation of ICT in the new nine years UBE 
curriculum. The survey was based on four research questions. A sample total of 3048 science and 
non-science teachers consisting of 551 science teachers from private primary and 823 science 
teachers from public junior secondary schools, and 7 31 non -science teachers from private primary 
and 943 non -science teachers from government owned junior secondary school from the six different 
educational zones in Anambra State. A questionnaire titled “implementing ICT Techniques in 
Teaching for Effective  Implementation of the New UBE Curriculum” (IICTEINUBEC) was used for 
data collection. Data was analyzed using mean ratings. The Findings include that the schools did not 
have ICT course outlines specifying the progressive topics to be learnt by primary an d Secondary 
school students, science -based subjects which require the use of ICT for its effective teaching / 
learning are not being used.  
Adeyemi  and Olaleye  [12] did a study to investigate the use of information communication 
and technology (ICT) for eff ective management of secondary schools in Ekiti State, Nigeria. The 
study was a descriptive survey. The study population comprised all the 182 secondary schools in the 
State. Out of this population, a sample of 160 secondary schools was taken and selected through the 
stratified random sampling technique. Out of the 6,278 teachers in the schools, 812 teachers made 
up of 160 principals and 652 teachers were selected for the study. The method of selection was also 
through the stratified random sampling techniq ue. The instrument used to collect data for the study 
was a questionnaire while the data collected were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages and 
Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis. It was found that the level of provision of ICT 
equipment to secondary schools in the State was low. The level of principals’ management of schools 
was also low. The intermittent disruption of electricity and inadequate funding were found as major 
problem inhibiting the usage of ICT equipment for the management o f schools in the State. It was 
concluded that the State government was not fully ready to imbibe (ICT) for the effective 
management of secondary schools in the State. It was recommended that the State government should 
supply the necessary ICT equipment to  all secondary schools in the State. Government should also 
improve the training of principals, teachers and computer personnel in the use of computers and other 
ICT equipment through seminar, workshop and in -service training.  Int. J. Adv. Data Inf. Syst.  ISSN: 2721 -3056   
 
An Investigation into the Challenges Preventing Students of Educational  (Ogunode Niyi Jacob)  73 
Abubakar [9] the application  of information and communications technology in Nigeria and 
in African countries generally is increasing and dramatically growing. Over the past few years, ICT 
has turned out to be a step by step more imperative to schools at all levels and to the entire education 
system at large. There exist an extensive variety of researches focused on the investigation of the 
utilization of ICT in the process of teaching and learning in Nigerian secondary schools. This study 
aimed to assess how ICT is used in teaching a nd learning in Nigerian public secondary schools 
particularly those from the Northeastern States from the viewpoint of students, instructors and 
administrators. Built on the three central research questions, the objective of this study is to assess 
the deg ree of usage of the ICT facilities in teaching and learning practices. In this study, a mixed -
methods approach for data gathering was applied by using questionnaires and interviews to collect 
data from students, instructors and administrators in the studie d states. The responses were then 
analyzed based on the research questions outlined in chapter one. The result shows that the use of 
ICT facilities is very low and this is attributed to the poor policy implementation, lack of basic social 
amenities and ins ecurity.  
Adavbiele  [3] observed that today, information and communication technology (ICT) is very 
important in the learning and teaching process at all levels of education. However, in Nigeria the use 
of ICT is still at its infancy. If the educational sy stem in Nigeria is to match with global requirements, 
there is need to incorporate the use of ICT that facilitates knowledge acquisition within and beyond 
the classroom. This paper examines the gap and challenges facing the use of ICT in university 
educati on in Nigeria. The study is a descriptive survey that assessed five universities for the most 
urgent solution. The population of the study was 120 respondents and this is made up of university 
lecturers and the students. Findings revealed that there is a g ap between the university teachers and 
students and ICT usage in classrooms and many university lecturers and students have to go to 
commercial cyber cafés in town before they have access to a computer that is internet connected, 
teachers are faced with so me challenges and barriers of availability of facilities which prevent them 
to employ ICT in the classroom, the solutions proffered include funding, provision of facilities and 
technical expertise in Nigeria universities.

5. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
The research design adopted for this study was survey design. This design is used in this 
study in view of the fact that the research is undertaken when there are qualitative and quantitative 
analysis of the research. This research was carried out in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria 
using university as a case study. The population of the study consisted of 12,000 students in all.  
Stratified random sampling was employed as sampling technique to select two hundred 
students of educational administration and planning students of the university in the faculty of 
education. After stratification, a simple random sampling technique was adopted to select the 
respondents in the department of educational administration and planning, faculty of education. Two 
hundred students fifty from each level makin g it a total of two hundred respondents. The instrument 
used for data collection was a Questionnaire titled: An investigation into challenges preventing 
students of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning questionnaire 
(AICPSEA) . The research instrument was constructed and developed by the researcher and given to 
experts in educational administration and planning to face validate and ascertain the degree of 
accuracy with which the instrument measures what it was designed to measu re. The reliability of the 
instruments was established through a trial test. The measures of the instruments used in this study 
were scored on a four point Likert scale format. The data was analyzed using simply percentage and 
Chi-square test statistical t ool.

Result from research question one and table one for item one showed that  140(70%) of the 
sampled respondents agreed that unstable power supply is one of the challenges preventing students 
of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions 
while 60(30%) disagreed.  
Item two on table one showed that 180  (90%) of the sampled respondents agreed that lack 
of personal laptop is another challenge preventing students of educational administration and 
planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions while 20(10%) disa greed. This 
result is in line with Abubakar [9] who observed that teachers and school administrators are skeptical 
about the challenges facing the integration of ICTs in teaching -learning process. These include; poor 
electric power supply, lack of knowledg eable ICT support personnel, inadequacy of trained teachers 
in the field of lCT, lack of funds and high cost of ICT equipment.  
Result of item three on table one also revealed that that 130(65%) of the sampled respondents 
agreed that unstable services is on e of the major challenges preventing students of educational 
administration and planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions while 70(35%) 
disagreed. This result agreed with the discovered of Fakeye (2010) who reported that in Ibadan  that 
in a large portion of schools studied don't have PCs, henceforth are not associated with the web 
(internet).  
Item four result on table one showed that that 127(63.5%) of the sampled respondents agreed 
that lack of computer literacy by students of educational administration and planning is one of the 
major challenges preventing students of educational administration and planning from using ICT for 
learning in Nigeria higher institutions while 73(36.5%) disagreed.  
Result of item five on table one also revealed that that 163(81.5%) of the sampled 
respondents agreed that high cost of services of ICT network is among the challenges preventing 
students of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher 
institutions while 37(18.5%) disagreed. This result of item four and five is in agreement with the 
opinion of Abubakar [9] who observed that teachers and school administrators are skeptical about 
the challenges facing the integration of ICTs in teaching -learning process. These include; poor 
electric power supply, lack of knowledgeable ICT support personnel, inadequacy of trained teachers 
in the field of lCT, lack of funds, high cost of ICT equipment, materials and accessories, 
government’s payment to support the implementation of ICT policies, inadequate telephone services, 
lack of proper maintenance of the broken down equipment and facilities and shortage of ICT 
facilities.  
 Result of item six on table one showed that that 137(68.5%) of the sampled respondent s 
agreed that poor ICT infrastructural facilities in higher institutions is another major challenges 
preventing students of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning in 
Nigeria higher institutions while 63(31.5%) disagreed. This r esult supported the findings of  
Item seven result of table one revealed that that 123(61.5%) of the sampled respondents 
agreed that poor computer literacy of the lecturers is one of the major challenges preventing students 
of educational administration an d planning from using ICT for learning in Nigeria higher institutions 
while 77(38.5%) disagreed. This result According to Osakwe [19], acquisition, deployment and 
management of information technology resources and services for teaching depend on electricit y. 
Studies have shown that poorly maintained equipment and poor network infrastructure are prominent 
obstacles to the integration of ICT tools in teaching.

agreed that all the students of educational administration and planning have personal laptop system 
or computer system while 172(86%) disagreed. This result implies that majorities of the students of 
educational administr ation and planning in Nigeria higher institutions do not have personal laptop 
system or computer system.

Responses on  if Students of educational administration and planning do used ICT for 
learning of educational administration and planning regularly in the school on table three revealed 
that 23(11.5%) of the sampled  respondents agreed that students of educational administra tion and 
planning used ICT for learning of educational administration and planning regularly while 
177(88.5%) disagreed . This result means that higher institutions in Nigeria do not regularly used ICT 
for teaching and learning.   
 
6.4. Test of Hypothesis  
The chi -square test was adopted to test the hypothesis. The level of confidence chosen is 
95% using the Murray’s formula: The formula is stated as follows:  
 
𝑋2=∑(𝑂𝑖−𝑒𝑖)2
𝑒𝑖 
where:  
X2= Measurement of discrepancy existing between the observed a nd expected frequencies  
Oi= observed frequencies  
Oe= expected frequencies  
Σ= summation  
The decision rule with regards to the above statistical formula is that where the computed 
value of X2 exceeds its critical or table value, the ‘null hypothesis’ (Ho) is rejected and the 
‘alternative hypothesis (Hi) is accepted. But where the computed value of X2 equals or is less than 
that of the critical or table value, the null hypothesis (Ho) is accept ed. 
 
6.5. Hypothesis one  
Ho: There are no challenges preventing students of educational administration and planning from 
using ICT for learning.  
Hi: There are challenges preventing students of educational administration and planning from using 
ICT for learning.

Decision Rule: As the table 8 shows the table value shows the table value 150 is greater than 
the critical value. Using  the decision rule, the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected while the alternative 
hypothesis (H1) which states that there are challenges preventing students of education al 
administration and planning from using ICT for learning is accepted.  
 
6.7. Interpretation  
Since the calculated value X2 = 150 is greater than the computed value. We rejected the hull 
hypothesis  (Ho) and accept the alternative hypothesis (Hi). There are challenges preventing students 
of educational administration and planning from using ICT for learning  is accepted.  
 
6.8. Decision  Rule  
Reject Ho, if X2 > X20 
Accept Ho, if X2 ≤ X20 
There are challenges  preventing students of educational administration and planning from 
using ICT for learning . 
 
7. CONCLUSION  
This result collected established the fact that there are challenges preventing students of 
educational administration and planning from using  ICT for learning. The paper established the 
following challenges preventing students of educational administration and planning from using ICT 
for learning to includes; unstable power supply, lack of personal laptop or computer system, unstable 
ICT Networ k services, lack of computer literacy by the students, High cost of ICT services, poor 
infrastructural facilities of ICT in higher institutions and poor computer literacy of the lecturers.
