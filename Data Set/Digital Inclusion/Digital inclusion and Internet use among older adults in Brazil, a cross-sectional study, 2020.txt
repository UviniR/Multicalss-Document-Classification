Diniz JL, Moreira ACA, Teixeira IX, Azevedo SGV, Freitas CASL, Maranguape IC. INTRODUCTION
With the advance of technological innovations, the Internet 
has become an essential part of the daily life of almost all indi -
viduals. In Brazil, about two thirds of the population (69.8%) has 
an Internet connection(1). Similarly, as the number of older adults 
grows worldwide, the interest of this population in virtual spaces 
grows(2). In the country, the proportion of older adults who access 
the Internet has increased from 24.7%, in 2016, to 31.1%, in 2017(1). 
Yet, this increase is still not enough to remove older adults 
from the process of “digital exclusion”(3). For many, the virtual 
environment represents a functional alternative to television or 
radio, and websites and social networks are attractive for their 
innovative character and fast access to information(4). 
Thus, the Internet is considered a space where older adults 
can enjoy information related to multiple interests, which involve 
knowledge, leisure, work, interaction/communication, and espe -
cially health benefits(5). Therefore, the digital inclusion of older 
adults is seen as a way to increase their autonomy and quality of 
life. Despite the challenges faced by this population when using 
new technologies, a study reported that older adults are willing 
to adopt new technologies when their usefulness and usability 
outweigh feelings of inadequacy(6). Situations like this can be 
seen when older adults are motivated by the interaction with 
grandchildren and relatives and feel encouraged to learn and 
adopt digital technologies. 
Thereby, this study aims to identify the most common means 
of internet access used by Brazilian older adults and the purpose 
of Internet use, with the objective of supporting the development 
of health promotion strategies/interventions for this population 
through the use of digital technologies, as the use of these tech -
nologies for this purpose can be extremely broad. In this context, 
the study contributes to technological, social and gerontological 
sciences. In particular, we recognize the fundamental role of 
the nurse in health promotion for older adults, through health 
education actions within the Brazilian Unified Health System, 
and the need to use digital technologies to improve their clinical 
practice, demystifying the idea that older adults are not part of 
this reality. The combination of education and digital inclusion 
can support planning and implementation of qualified actions 
in health promotion(7).
The results of this study may help understanding that the use 
of the Internet and social media brings several benefits to older 
adults, improving the quality of life of this population. It is under -
stood that this tool can favor the communication process, foster 
interpersonal relationships, reduce social isolation, stimulate cogni -
tion and increase closeness to friends and relatives, even if there 
is physical distance. Thus, the study provides multi-professional 
knowledge, as it will describe how older adults use the Internet. 
OBJECTIVE
Describe the profile of Brazilian older adults who use the In -
ternet, the means of Internet access and the purpose of Internet 
use. In addition, it sought to verify the existence of an association 
between socio-demographic variables and variables related to 
Internet use.METHODS
Ethical aspects 
The research respected the ethical and legal recommendations 
of the Resolution of the National Health Council No. 466/12. The 
study was appreciated by the Research Ethics Committee of the 
State University of Vale do Acaraú.
Participants who were interested in collaborating in the research 
accessed the link published on Facebook and WhatsApp and received 
an online Informed Consent Form (TCLE). After reading the form, the 
participant had to choose between the options: “I accept to participate 
in the research” and “I do not accept to participate in the research” . 
When the older adult selected the option “I accept to participate 
in the research” , they were automatically sent to the data collection 
instrument; if they chose otherwise, the survey was concluded. 
Design, setting and period
This is a quantitative cross-sectional study. The study was de -
scribed according to the checklist Strengthening the Reporting of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)(8). 
The research was carried out through the internet. Data was 
collected from September to December 2018.
Population and sample; inclusion and exclusion criteria 
The selection of the older adults was carried out using the 
“snowball sampling” technique, in which the first participants 
indicate new participants, who also indicate others, and so on, 
until reaching the proposed goal(9). Thus, already knowing about 
the existence of groups of older adults on Facebook, it was pos -
sible to reach the first participants through the identification of 
13 groups: Terceira idade, Terceira idade conectada, Longevidade 
saudável, Portal terceira idade, Núcleo de Apoio à Terceira Idade, 
Grupo da terceira idade, Renascer da terceira idade, Terceira idade 
melhor, Integrar terceira idade, Idosos mãos solidárias, Grupo de 
idosos zuquinha, Grupo de idosos de bem com a vida, Longevidade. 
The sample was calculated based on the sample size for a preva -
lence study design with an infinite population. The parameters were 
a prevalence of at least 50% (p ) of older adults who use the internet 
to search for health benefits, level of confidence (Z1-α /2) of 95% and 
maximum absolute error (d ) of 0.05. Thus, using the formula (, the 
sample size was 385 older adults. 
Thus, 384 older adults freely participated in the study. Participants 
met the following inclusion criteria: people aged 60 or over, of both 
genders, Brazilian, who used the internet through the social networks 
Facebook and WhatsApp, regardless of frequency of use. Two older 
adults were excluded for not answering the entire instrument or 
giving disconnected responses. 
The reasons for using these social networks as part of the inclusion 
criteria for the research participants were: they are free for the user 
and widely used by the entire population, regardless of the age group; 
their tools have potential to enhance knowledge and/or learning of 
certain subjects; the user does not need expertise in creating the 
space or any training to start activities; and they enable moments of 
interaction, regardless of the time and space in which individuals are(10).3

Diniz JL, Moreira ACA, Teixeira IX, Azevedo SGV, Freitas CASL, Maranguape IC. Study protocol 
The questionnaire was developed on the Google Forms platform 
and made available through a link. It included questions related to 
socio-demographic data (gender, age, place of residence, civil status, 
level of education and occupation) and to the use of the internet 
(means of access, time of access, purposes and perceived benefits).  
The questionnaire was linked to the account of the main author 
to ensure the security of the information. The questionnaire was 
completed from September to December 2018. Data was col -
lected through an online questionnaire made available through 
a link in the feed of the aforementioned Facebook groups, when 
allowed by the administrator of each group, or individually on 
Messenger, or even on WhatsApp, when the contact information 
of the older adult was available. It should be noted that no data 
was extracted from these social media.
Analysis of results and statistics
Data were compiled on Excel, statistically analyzed with the 
support of the software R for Windows version 3.6.2 and synthe -
sized in tables. The descriptive analysis of the data included the 
calculation of absolute and relative frequencies. The association 
between categorical variables and socio-demographic data was 
analyzed using the Chi-square test for independence or Fisher’s 
exact probability test, according to the expected frequencies of 
each category. The prevalence ratios and respective 95% con -
fidence intervals were used to measure the magnitude of the 
relationship between these categorical variables. In all inferential 
calculations, the level of significance was set at 0.05.
The association between the quantitative variable of age and 
the qualitative variables was verified with the Mann-Whitney test. 
This is an alternative to the T-test for two independent samples, 
when the data does not follow a normal distribution. In this study, 
normality was verified using the Lilliefors test.
RESUL TS
A total of 384 Brazilian older adults who used Facebook and/or 
WhatsApp participated in the research. The socio-demographic 
data of the participants are shown in Table 1.
The socio-demographic data of the sample reveals that the 
female gender was slightly predominant (52.08%), the mean age 
was 64.60 years, most participants were married (72.99%), almost 
half had completed high school (48.44%) and 67.61% were retired. 
In addition, almost half of the sample lived in the Southeast and 
Northeast regions (23.44% and 23.18%, respectively).
Table 2 shows results regarding the devices most used by 
older adults to access the internet, the activities carried out in the 
virtual environment and the use of internet to obtain information 
about health care.
There was no statistically significant association between socio-
demographic variables and activities carried out on the internet. 
Table 3 shows the association between benefits of Internet use, 
time spent online, daily internet access and the gender variable. 
Among the benefits of using the internet pointed out by the 
participants are interaction, learning and entertainment (74.5%, 19.02%, 19.02% respectively). The variables that showed a statistically 
significant difference according to gender were: updating (p = 0.03), 
entertainment (p = 0.02), learning (p=0.007) and time spent online 
(p=0.008). It was found that not considering updating as a benefit 
was 33% more prevalent among female participants (PR=0.77– 95% 
CI: 0.62- 0.95). The benefits of entertainment and learning were more 
frequent among male participants, with 65% and 45%, respectively 
(PR=1.65– 95% CI: 1.05- 2.59; PR=1.45– 95% CI: 1.09- 1.94). In addi -
tion, spending more than 2 hours on the Internet was 36% more 
frequent among women (PR = 1.36– 95% CI: 1.08-1.72).

Diniz JL, Moreira ACA, Teixeira IX, Azevedo SGV, Freitas CASL, Maranguape IC. Table 4 refers to the associations between the region of 
residence of the older adult and the main means of obtaining 
information, the most prevalent levels of education, daily internet 
access and time spent online.
There were statistically significant differences between the 
regions of Brazil and the factors: main means of obtaining informa -
tion, television and internet (p=0.014); the most prevalent levels 
of education, high school and university (p=0.001); daily Internet 
access (p=0,001); and time spent online (p=0.001). The media most 
used by the older adults were the television and the internet (n= 
380). Radio, newspapers, and printed books were also cited. The television was the preferred source of information among 
older adults in the Southeast and Center-west, and the Internet was 
preferred among older adults in the North, Northeast and South. This 
fact stands out when comparing the level of education, since most 
older adults in the North and Northeast regions have a secondary 
level of education. Regarding internet access, almost all older adults 
in the Northeast and South regions accessed the internet every day, 
compared to around 85% in the Southeast and Center-west regions, 
and only 63.63% in the North region. In addition, most older adults 
in the North region did not access the internet for more than two 
hours a day (16.4%). The Center-west region presented a similar

Diniz JL, Moreira ACA, Teixeira IX, Azevedo SGV, Freitas CASL, Maranguape IC. result, as only 25.7% of the older adults would stay online for more 
than two hours. In other regions of the country, 40% or more of the 
older adults stayed online for more than two hours.
In addition, bivariate analysis between the predictor variable 
occupation and some outcome variables showed statistically 
significant association between the variables daily Internet access 
(p=0.002) and answering health questions on the internet (p= 0.01), 
which were respectively 34% (PR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.18- 1.53) and 
21% (PR= 1.21; 95% CI:1.06- 1.38) more frequent among older 
adults who worked. Similarly, there was a statistically significant 
association (p=0.01) between the variable civil status and the 
time spent online. Accessing the Internet more than once a day 
was 30% more frequent among older adults who did not have a 
partner (PR= 1.30– 95% CI: 1.15- 1.46).
In addition, statistically significant differences were also identified 
between age and daily internet access, time spent online and the 
following benefits: autonomy, independence, and interaction. Older 
adults who used the internet daily (average rank 64 vs. 66; p = 0.01) 
and for more than 2 hours (average posts 62 vs. 65; p = 0.004) were 
the youngest. Similarly, autonomy and independence were more 
often seen as a benefit by the young-old (average rank 61 vs. 64, 
p<0.001). In contrast, interaction was most often pointed out as a 
benefit by the older participants (average rank 65 vs. 62, p<0.001). 
DISCUSSION
This study describes the use of the internet among Brazilian 
older adults, especially those who use the social networks Face -
book and WhatsApp via cell phones, given that there is a greater 
number of older adults who use the internet by other means. 
Because of the success and adherence to these social networks, 
an unprecedented scale of social relationships diffuses across 
this vastly interconnected system, affecting public behavior and 
knowledge construction(11). It is understood that both men and 
women use these technological tools in their daily lives, so there 
was practically no difference between the number of women and 
men in this investigation, although studies demonstrate that they 
use these tools with different purposes(12-13).
The use of cell phones as the main means of internet access 
by older adults can be explained by the advantages of portable 
devices, as they can be used anywhere, are easy to use, are less 
complex than other interfaces and do not require any wires. In 
addition, the financial cost of this technology is lower compared 
to other devices and it provides the convenience of accessing 
the internet in your own home.(14).
In relation to the regions of Brazil where the older adults lived, 
it was observed that there were statistically significant differences 
regarding the sources of information, level of education and in -
ternet access, and the minority of participants were in the North 
and Center-West regions. The difference in the number of older 
adults who use the internet by region may be directly related to 
social and educational conditions or, still, to population density. 
According to the Continuous National Household Sample Sur -
vey(15), the Southeast region had the highest percentage (81.1%) 
of households with internet access, followed by the South (76.7%) 
and Northeast (64%) regions. Despite this rate and the fact that 
most older adults in the Southeast have a higher education level, the television is their preferred source of information according 
to the results of this study.  
It is worth mentioning that 85% of the sample was composed 
of older people under 68 years of age, who are considered young-
old(16). In this context, it was found that older adults who used 
the internet every day and for more than 2 hours were younger 
than the others and pointed to autonomy and independence 
as benefits of the internet more often. Researchers report that 
the young-old have the ability to be more active in society, with 
preserved functional capacity and with an interest in expanding 
their possibilities in the human, social and educational fields, 
with the goal of learning(17). 
In the sample of young-old adults in this study, it was found 
that about 32% of the participants were still working, and that 
those participants accessed the internet and answered their 
health doubts more frequently than those who were retired. 
This can possibly be explained by the fact that they use these 
technologies in work activities and/or were already familiar with 
digital tools(18).
However, the internet is rarely used for work purposes among 
older adults, as the primary motivations for using social networks 
usually involve social bonding, bridging, curiosity and responding 
to family members requests(19). In addition, a study revealed that 
older adults use Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICTs) to find information and because of the need and desire to 
communicate with others and to be entertained(20). This result 
was confirmed in this study, as the main activities of the older 
adults on the internet were reading, listening to music, playing 
games, watching videos and photos; talking to people; meeting 
new people and/or seeking a romantic relationship; research and 
study; and accessing social networks.
The use of ICTs for teaching and learning purposes is still a 
challenge for older adults. In this sense, a recent study investi -
gated how this population view its own digital skills, the barriers 
experienced and the social and institutional support system 
that help gaining digital literacy, and found that older adults do 
not have digital literacy and support systems are limited(21). The 
barriers faced may be linked to the level of education, although 
it has been found that this is not necessarily a limitation. In this 
study, it was found that the level of education did not prevent 
older adults from enjoying the internet, since two participants 
were illiterate and 15 had only elementary education, which 
demonstrates the importance of motivation for human beings.
With the finding that 65% of the participants used the internet 
to solve health concerns and considering the importance of health 
promotion through ICTs, four important aspects of an ICT for older 
adults can be pointed out: usefulness of learning (responding 
to the personal and social needs of older adults), cooperation 
and collaboration (focusing on teamwork, support, cohesion 
and interaction to achieve more proactive learning), promoting 
social inclusion and autonomy (being protagonists in their own 
learning)(14). These points converge to the benefits most cited by 
the participants in this study: interaction, pointed out by 75% of 
the sample and more often by those who were older, followed by 
learning and updating, pointed out by a quarter of the sample.
As for the benefits listed, interaction was the most prevalent 
and entertainment, learning and updating were associated with 6

Diniz JL, Moreira ACA, Teixeira IX, Azevedo SGV, Freitas CASL, Maranguape IC. gender, with the first two being most pointed out by women. In 
addition, women usually spend more time online according to 
this study. The difference observed may be related to individual 
characteristics, such as motivations for use, personality, self-
esteem and time of use. Social networks are recreational and 
public and thus are associated with a greater inclination towards 
social activity and relationships and a tendency to find, interact 
with and share information with other users(24-25). 
Almost all older adults in this study accessed the internet every 
day, and more than once a day. This frequency of access was 30% 
more frequent among older adults who had no partner. In this 
sense, the study identified that the use of digital technologies 
enables older adults to seek relationships, resulting in a reduc -
tion in feelings of loneliness and abandonment and becoming a 
tool in the search for companionship. In this context, emotional 
involvement is understood as the most relevant feeling men -
tioned by the elderly(26). 
However, it is necessary to recognize that, with increase of 
internet use for this purpose, older adults become vulnerable to 
digital abuse in romantic relationships, a phenomenon interna -
tionally known by the term Cyber Dating Abuse(27). This phenom -
enon includes threats, insults, humiliations or jealous behavior, 
partner controlling behavior (such as requiring passwords from 
cell phones or e-mail accounts), sharing photos or videos of a 
partner without their permission, pressuring a partner to send 
sexually explicit photos or videos or to engage in sexual acts 
against their will through the internet or cell phone(27-29). Scholars 
claim that, on one hand, digital abuse emerges from violence 
between intimate partners, and, on the other, it is closely related 
to the development of communication technologies and their 
insertion in the social environment(30). 
Therefore, it is important that health professionals are attentive 
to the sexual dimension of the older adults’ life, especially in the 
digital age, when this population expanded their possibilities of 
satisfying sexual needs and desires. However, understanding how 
older adults think and feel about their sexuality is necessary not 
only to understand the aging process and sexuality, but to identify 
and develop strategies that minimize the effects of senescence 
on sexuality, contributing to a positive and healthy experience. 
This depends on professional follow-up free of prejudice, taboo 
and, above all, of criticism(31-32).
The use of the internet among older adults has been a major 
concern in the search for a more inclusive society, with the ob -
jective of solving the demands related to aging process and the 
various changes in digital and communication technologies(33-35). 
Therefore, the Internet can favor social inclusion among older 
adults, as it can provide more effective communication between 
family and friends and increase the possibilities of updating, 
learning, interaction, and others.
The internet can insert older adults in the contemporary social 
world, bringing new perspectives for social interactions. The 
relevance of accessing, using and learning about technological 
resources in the context of aging can be highlighted. One of the 
goals of healthy aging is to continue learning to adapt to the 
changes of the aging process and to acquire skills to remain ac -
tive and productive. In this sense, it is believed that the Internet 
use among older adults can favor this objective(36).Study limitations 
The cross-sectional design of the study can be considered 
a limitation, as it does not allow for causal inference. However, 
the national coverage and the target audience minimized this 
effect. In addition, the inclusion criterion of older adults who used 
two social networks and the difficulty to get in closed Facebook 
groups were characterized as limitations.
Therefore, new studies with mixed approaches should be carried 
out to get a deep understanding of the universe of internet use 
among older adults, including data such as shared information, 
most accessed links and social and health repercussions after 
using the internet. In addition, it is necessary to develop studies 
that can clarify the verified associations and contribute to the 
discussion of the theme in nursing, since nurses must provide 
care to older adults considering all human needs, including the 
use of technologies as a means of providing health.
Contributions to the nursing area
In the health area, especially in nursing, the existing technologies 
must be combined to promote health. Nurses have a significant 
role in the assistance to older adults, as they are the closest to 
this population. Thus, the use of the internet by nurses and older 
adults can enable a more effective assistance, since it contributes 
to faster and more dynamic monitoring and guidance(34).
Therefore, nurses need to understand technologies and Internet 
use to offer multiple perspectives on the expansion of informa -
tion for this population, favoring and enabling interaction and 
collective construction of knowledge. In addition, these profes -
sionals need to provide opportunities for improving the quality 
of life of this population, so that social and health repercussions 
can be provided to older adults in an appropriate and safe way.
From this perspective, based on the findings of this study, 
health professionals are able to provide assistance, develop 
prevention and health promotion actions and create public 
policies to include older adults in society through the use of the 
powerful tool of the internet as support in health.
The use of data from this research can support the improvement 
of health professionals in digital and information technologies 
and communication, providing countless possibilities of using 
this tool as a means of reaching older adults. In this sense, the 
internet can influence health behaviors and become an efficient 
tool for health promotion in the targeted population. 
CONCLUSION 
This study showed the main characteristics of Brazilian older 
adults who use the internet, more specifically through the so -
cial networks Facebook and WhatsApp, making it possible to 
recognize the possibilities of health care strategies in the virtual 
space. Brazilian older adults who use the internet through these 
social media had a mean age of 64.60 years, were predominantly 
married, retired, with secondary level of education and from the 
Southeast, Northeast or South regions. They used the Internet 
predominantly via cell phone and to perform activities such as 
reading, listening to music, watching videos and photos, playing 7

relationship. It was noticed that health information is a potential 
focus of interest for these older adults when they browse the 
internet and social media, since 65% of the participants said 
they used the internet to answer questions about health care. 
There was a statistically significant difference between the dif -
ferent Brazilian regions and the variables related to the sources 
of information, level of education, daily internet access and time 
spent online. The bivariate analysis between occupation and the variables daily internet access and solving health concerns 
on the internet showed a statistically significant association. 
Similarly, the association between civil status and frequency of 
internet access revealed that accessing the Internet more than 
once a day is a behavior 30% more frequent among older adults 
without a partner. 
In addition, there were also statistically significant differences 
between age and daily internet access, time spent online and the 
following benefits: autonomy, independence, and interaction.
