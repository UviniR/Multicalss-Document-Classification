Abstract
The agriculture sector in Pakistan faces enormous challenges of lack of farm knowledge adoption due to the
farmers’ lack of access to the latest information. Recently various mobile phone-based farm advisory services
(FAS) have been introduced as an alternative to the conventional extension methods. Despite many ICT
initiatives, the performance of these projects remains unsatisfactory. The current study was designed to
identify these FAS, farmers’ extent of use, and factors associated with their adoption. Two hundred and forty
farmers were surveyed in the rural areas of district Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected using a
structured questionnaire and analysed with SPSS software. Findings revealed that 77.08% of the sampled
farmers were using mobile-based FAS. Telecom and private sector FAS were reported to have the highest
share of users (37.08% and 25.83% respectively). Results of the logistic regression showed that farmers’
educational level, mobile use skills, mobile possession duration and the number of mobile phones in a family
were found positively significant, while farmers’ age and contact with extension agents were negatively signif-
icant. The findings conclude that education and digital literacy are essential for the use of mobile-based
alternatives and emphasize the need for training and educating the farmers.

Introduction
In the current era, access to information has become
crucial in every field of life. Like many other sectors,
access to updated knowledge and smooth transfer of
information has always been important in agriculture,
but has become more needful in view of emerging
global issues such as climate change and food inse-
curity. Farmers’ access to updated farm knowledgesuch as innovative farm technologies and availability
and market prices of various farm inputs and products
has become mandatory (Aldosari et al., 2017).

Farmers’ access to information determines the adop-
tion of farm innovation and any failure in communi-
cation leads to the poor adoption of farm
technologies, which ultimately results in severe losses
in agriculture (Ajuka et al., 2015).
In Pakistan, one of the main reasons for low crop
yields is farmers’ inadequate access to updated farm
knowledge (Rehman et al., 2015). This is a very
alarming situation for a country like Pakistan, where
the agriculture sector holds a central position in the
national economy, as it generates nearly 20 %of the
national GDP and employs almost 50 %of the coun-
try’s population (Ministry of Finance, 2015). Provi-
sion of updated farm information is crucial as farming
communities aim to meet the food requirements of the
country’s rapidly growing population. Farmers, par-
ticularly the marginalised and small growers, are
needful of advisory services for their farming opera-
tions (Iqbal et al., 2016).
Generally, agricultural extension and advisory
systems assist farmers with regard to various farm-
related issues, but in Pakistan, the existing agricul-
tural extension system is unable to meet the
information needs of the growing population of farm-
ers (Maqsood, 2015). A colossal asymmetry prevails,
as the delivery of agricultural advisory services is
biased towards the big landlords and influential farm-
ers, while resource-poor farmers – particularly the
small growers –remain underprivileged (Abid et al.,
2015). In this scenario, ICT-enabled alternatives,
mainly mobile phones, have emerged as a useful com-
munication tool to help solve this information deliv-
ery challenge and bring the farmers into the
mainstream (Obong et al., 2018; Javaid, 2017).
The application of ICT in agriculture initially
started in developed countries and was then adopted
by various developing countries, including Pakistan.
During the last few years, the mobile phone, due to its
affordability and user-friendly nature, has become
more popular as compared to other communication
tools such as landline telephones, TV and radio (Aker,
2011). The world witnessed the rapid adoption of
mobile phones from around 15 %in 2000 to about
76%in 2010, and more than 75 %of the world’s
mobile phone subscribers were reportedly found in
developing countries, indicating its adoption by mar-
ginalised and underdeveloped nations (Donovan,
2012). Statistics show that the planet had more than
5 billion mobile subscribers by 2017 (Okeleke et al.,
2017). This trend is similar in Pakistan, as a swift rise
in mobile users has been seen during the last decade,and the country had reached 152 million mobile
phone users by the end of July 2018 (Pakistan Tele-
communication Authority, 2018) (Figure 1). This
rapid growth of mobile phone coverage is considered
to be one of the remedies for the communication prob-
lems in the agricultural sector of the country.
In Pakistan, many ICT-based initiatives have been
taken in agricultural extension. The country started its
landline agricultural helpline during 2002–2003
(Khan et al., 2010). More recently, various mobile
phone-based (voice call and SMS) helplines have
been started to provide timely information to farmers
(Maqsood, 2015). These services are launched by the
government agricultural department, private sector
input suppliers, and the telecommunication sector
(mobile phone network providers in the country).
These services are a substitute for formal extension
approaches which provide regularly updated informa-
tion to farming communities. It has been found that
despite various initiatives oriented towards farm
knowledge transfer using ICT like mobile phones, the
outcomes are not satisfactory because of poor use of
these services in remote areas (Javaid, 2017; Khan
et al., 2010). There is thus a need to explore the fac-
tors linked with the use of mobile phone-based farm
advisory services.
Research objectives
Globally, several studies have focused on mobile
phone application and use in agriculture (Aker and
Ksoll, 2016; Aldosari et al., 2017; Tadesse and
Bahiigwa, 2015). However, in Pakistan, very little
literature is found related to perception and use of
ICTs (Maqsood, 2015; Javaid, 2017), and no study
considered the factors related to the use and adoption

To fill this gap, the present study aimed to consider
the following research objectives:
1. to explore the various mobile phone-based
farm advisory services offered in the study
area.
2. to assess the farmers’ use of these mobile
phone-based farm advisory services.
3. to identify the determinants of farmers’ use of
these mobile phone-based farm advisory
services.
Research methodology
Description of the study area
The study was conducted in Faisalabad district of
Punjab province, which is the leading contributor to
the country’s agricultural GDP. Faisalabad district
was selected, firstly because this district has massive
production of agricultural and livestock products, and
secondly because all the mobile phone-based farm
advisory services available in the province are opera-
tional in this district. Faisalabad is the second largest
district in the Punjab province, consisting of 6 tehsils
(sub-districts/cities) with a total area of 5,856 square
kilometers. The total population of the district is 7.87
million, with an overwhelming majority living in the
countryside and associated with agriculture and
related businesses (Paki stan Bureau of Statistics,
2017). The district contributes over 20 %of Punjab’s
GDP, with an average annual share of $20.5 billion
(Ministry of Finance, 2015).
Sampling and data collection
Faisalabad was purposively selected from the Punjab
province followed by a multi-stage random sampling
approach. In the first stage, the Punjab province was
selected. In the second stage district, Faisalabad was
selected as the main study area. In the third stage, two
tehsils (sub-districts) were randomly chosen out of six
tehsils of the district. In the fourth stage, four union
councils (a local administrative unit of the local gov-
ernance system of Pakistan) were randomly selected
by choosing two from each tehsil. Only rural union
councils were selected, following Pakistan village sta-
tistics (Agricultural Census Organization, 1998). In
the fifth stage, eight villages were randomly chosen
(two from each union council). In the final stage, a
total sample of 240 respo ndents was generated by
selecting 30 farmers from each village (using thefarmers’ database obtained from the district agricul-
ture department). Figure 2 shows the sampling
approach used. Data were collected through face to
face interviews with the help of a structured question-
naire (see Appendix B). Data were collected in
August 2018 with the help of two enumerators hired
from the local university. Interviews were initially
conducted in the local language and later converted
into English. Data were managed and analyzed using
SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences)
software.
Empirical modeling for measuring the determinant of
mobile-based FAS
Various contingent valuation models have been used
to measure the adoption of technologies among farm-
ing communities. However, many studies show that
these approaches are only valid when measuring the
extent of adoption or use of technologies. Similarly,
the commonly recognised Heckman model has also
been used in similar cases but in the case of the cur-
rent study, this model also appeared unsuitable as it is
only applicable to non-random samples. Considering
the nature of the current study, a binary logistic
regression model was chosen because our dependent
variable was a binary variable. In this study we
assigned a numerical value 1 if the farmer was a user
of any of the mobile-based FAS, otherwise we
assigned a value 0.

of this model (Blog, 2013).Description of explanatory variables used in the
model
Many studies argue that various factors are associated
with the use and adoption of the mobile phone in
agricultural information dissemination (Aldosari
et al., 2017; Obong et al., 2018). For instance, farm-
ers’ socioeconomic characteristics like age and edu-
cation are shown to be crucial in determining their
behaviour regarding use of the mobile phone for
accessing farm information (Ali and Kumar, 2011).
Farmers of various age groups use a mobile phone for
exchanging different types of agricultural informa-
tion, but this trend is undoubtedly more pervasive in
younger farmers, the majority of whom are educated
(Rahman and Fadol, 2013). Studies also show that
related characteristics of farmers’ mobile use, like
digital literacy and mobile phone skills, play a pivotal
role in understanding its adoption and farm-related
use (Koyu et al., 2018).
Considering the literature, the availability of data
and the context of the study, 10 explanatory variables
were selected for the current research (Table 1). These
variables included farmers’ socioeconomic character-
istics (farmer’s age, education, income, tenancy sta-
tus, household head status, contact with farm advisory
agents, and farm size) and mobile phone use related
attributes (numbers of mobile phones in a family,
duration of mobile phone ownership, and skills of
mobile phone use).Table 1. Descriptive statistics of explanatory variables used in the model.

Farmers use of mobile phone-based farm advisory
services
Our study identified three types of mobile phone-
based farm advisory services (FAS) offered to the
farmers of the study area. These were:
1. public sector FAS, which include SMS and
call helplines offered by government agricul-
tural and livestock departments.
2. FAS offered by the private sector (private farm
input suppliers and other helplines that provide
farm assistance to the farmers in addition to
selling their products).
3. FAS offered by the telecommunication sector,
which includes four FAS offered by telecom-
munication network providers in the country.
Jazz, Telenor, Ufone, and Zong are the four
mobile networks providers in Pakistan, which
offer their farm advisory services, locally
named as Jazz Bakhabar Kissan ,Telenor
Khushal Zamindar, Ukissan, andZong Kissan
Portal. Details of these services are given in
Table A1.
The findings revealed (Figure 3) that the telecom-
munication sector’s FAS have the biggest share of
subscribers (37.08 %), followed by private sector FAS(25.03 %), while users of public sector FAS
accounted for 18.33 %of subscribers. Findings further
revealed that out of 240 sampled respondents, 55
(22.92 %) did not use any of the FAS. Figure 4 pre-
sents the detailed distribution of users concerning the
use of FAS. The detailed statistics of respondents are
presented in Table A2.
TheJazz Bakhabar Kissan service has the biggest
share among the telecom sector’s FAS. The Jazz
Bakhabar Kissan and Telenor Khushal Zamindar ser-
vices were reported as having more subscribers
(17.50 %and 16.25 %respectively) than Zong Kissan
Portal andUkissan due to the higher network cover-
age and toll-free nature of the services.
In the public sector’s FAS, the agricultural depart-
ment helpline reported more users (10.83 %)c o m -
pared to its livestock department helpline (7.50 %).
In Pakistan, the public sector FAS are solely to guide
farm operations and do not provide any product or
input; hence farmers prefer to approach the private
sector’s input suppliers. The findings also indicate the
inefficiency of public sector institutions and lack of
interest, due to which, farmers tend to communicate
with alternatives sources.
Similarly, in the private sector, 16.67 %of the
respondents obtained farm related information from
various farm input suppliers (private enterprises),
which rank second highest and are greater than theTable 2. Parameters estimates of logistic regression model.

Data Source: Field survey 2018Khan et al: Farmers’ use of mobile 5public sector FAS. The other private sources, which
include private helplines of various farming organi-
zations, accounted for 9.17 %. These findings indicate
the efficiency of the private sector in terms of assist-
ing the farming communities and meeting their infor-
mation needs. These results are in line with a study
conducted in India, which also found that farmers
prefer to contact private companies and input suppli-
ers because they provide products and inputs in addi-
tion to advisory services (Verma et al., 2014).Our study also attempted to identify the type of
service used by the farmers, such as voice or SMS
(short message service). The FAS mentioned above
are delivered to the farmers through a short-recorded
voice (IVR) or an SMS-based content. The type of
service used determines the farmers’ behaviour and
convenience and the effectiveness of a particular ser-
vice. Findings (Figure 5) show that farmers mainly
used voice-based FAS in the private sector and tele-
communication sector (nearly 70 %on average), while

(The sum is higher than 100% because a farmer can use more than one advisory service simultaneously N ¼240).
Data Source: Field survey 20186 Information Development XX(X)as regards the public sector FAS, farmers mostly
indicated the use of SMS-based service. The Punjab
Directorate of Agriculture (Information) stated that
the government agricultural department’s FAS are
provided solely through SMS. No voice call or
IVR-based content is delivered; instead farmers are
required to call the agricultural helpline themselves
(Directorate of Agriculture (Information) (2017).
Despite the fact that the public sector departments
do not provide voice-based content on a regular
basis, more than one third of users dialed their call
helplines. This shows the farmers preferences in
using voice-based service in order to obtain farm
information.
In the telecom sector, FAS are based on both
voice and SMS services, and farmers preferred the
voice-based service, which is delivered in their local
language (Jazz, 2018; Global System for Mobile
Association, 2017). These findings indicate that the
user’s choice of service type is based on conveni-
ence and other associated factors such as literacy
and mobile phone operating skills. Farmers in the
study area lack these attributes because most of
them attained only primary level of education and
had basic mobile use skills (basic skills referred to
voice calls only) (Table 1). Hence most farmers
preferred voice-based content as compared to SMS,
which requires a higher level of education and
mobile phone use skills. The detailed statistics are
presented in Table A3.Descriptive statistics of farmers’ socioeconomic and
mobile related characteristics
The average age of the farmers was 46.56 years,
which shows that most of them belonged to the mid-
dle and old age groups. The majority of farmers had a
low level of education, as the mean of their years of
schooling was 5.05 years. These findings are sup-
ported by similar studies showing that most farmers
in developing countries belong to the middle and old
age groups with low education level (Roy et al., 2018;
Rahman and Fadol, 2013). Regarding farmers’ land
ownership and household status, the means for these
two variables were 0.731 and 0.644 respectively,
which shows that most of the farmers owned their
land, while more than half of the respondents were
head of the farm household. The majority of the farm-
ers had possessed a mobile phone for more than 3
years (mean 3.43) and the average numbers of mobile
phones in a family was 2.72. Parallel with the findings
of Tadesse and Bahiigwa (2015), our study further
revealed that farmers had very basic (mean 0.288)
mobile phone use skills which were limited to voice
calls. The detailed statistics of explanatory variables
are given in Table 1.
Determinants of farmers’ use of mobile-based farm
advisory services
The study further identified the factors that influence
the farmers’ use of mobile phone-based FAS. Logistic
Figure 5. Distribution of users according to the type of service used.
Data Source: Field survey 2018Khan et al: Farmers’ use of mobile 7regression was employed to measure the impacts of
explanatory variables on farmer’s mobile phone use
for accessing FAS. The parameter estimates of the
regression model are given in Table 2 in which coef-
ficients show the direction of the effect of the expla-
natory variables on farme rs’ use of mobile-based
FAS. For instance, the positive value of coefficient
shows a positive relation, and a negative sign repre-
sents the case otherwise.
According to Table 2, the factors which have been
found positively significant with farmers use of mobile-
based FAS included farmers’ educational level,
farmers’ skills of mobile use, mobile phone possession
duration, and number of mobile phones in a family,
while farmers’ age and formal contact with extension
agents were reported as negatively significant.
Farmers’ age
Age is another pivotal attribute which has a crucial
role in farmers’ behaviour regarding various deci-
sions. A farmers’ age represents his experience and
knowledge and understanding of the social system
and the community. According to the results of this
study, farmers’ age was highly significant (0.000) in
relation to the use of mobile-based FAS. The negative
value of the coefficient indicates a decrease in the use
of mobile phone-based FAS with the increase in farm-
ers’ age. These findings illustrate that older farmers
have a lesser tendency (1.095 times) of using mobile
phone-based FAS compared to the younger farmers. It
is argued that farmers’ age can also indirectly affect
the use of the mobile phone for FAS, as old farmers
lack operational skills, education and interest in ICT
of the modern age like cellular phones, and hence do
not prefer their use over c onventional information
sources. Roy et al. (2018) found in his study in India
that the old farmers are very strict in following their
traditional beliefs and indigenous knowledge system
and do not rely on the new ICT.
Farmers education level
Education is considered an essential factor in the
farmers’ use of ICT for accessing farm information.
Many studies have reported that farmers’ education
level plays a pertinent role in their use of modern
technologies like a mobile phone (Gichuki and
Mulu-Mutuku, 2018; Saroj et al., 2017). In the current
study, farmers’ years of schooling was shown to have
a significant relationship with the use of mobile
phone-based FAS at 0.003 significance level.According to the parameter estimates of logistic
regression model (Table 1), the positive value of coef-
ficient indicates a positive correlation of education
with the use of FAS, which means farmers with higher
educational level have a 1.024 times greater tendency
to use the mobile phone for agriculture-related pur-
poses. These findings are parallel with another study
which showed that educated farmers have more
knowledge about the services and useful information
sources, and hence have a higher rate of mobile phone
adoption and use for farming matters (Obong et al.,
2018). It can be concluded that farmers’ educational
level determines the use of the mobile phone for
accessing farm advisory services.
Number of mobile phones in a family
Our study identified that the total number of mobile
phones in a family was positively significant in relation
to the farmers’ use of mobile-based FAS (sig. level
0.005). A farmer having a higher number of mobile
phones in the household has 1.588 times more tendency
to use the mobile phone for farming purposes. This
might be due to the fact that a higher number of mobile
phones in a farm household enables family members to
have a bigger communication circle. Moreover, individ-
uals’ mobile phone use skills are more developed when
there is more than one mobile phone user in a farm
family, because the other family members can create a
better learning environment for those who lack mobile
operational skills (Obong et al., 2018). We can conclude
that the number of mobile phones in a farm family also
shapes the farmers’ use of mobile-based FAS.
Duration of mobile phone ownership
Duration of mobile phone ownership has also been
reported with a significant positive relationship
(0.000). This indicates that farmers who have owned
a mobile phone for a longer duration have 1.225 times
higher inclination towards farm-related uses as com-
pared to those who have owned a phone for a shorter
duration. This might be because farmers using the
mobile phone for a prolonged duration have more
understanding regarding mobile operations and have
developed a big circle of useful contacts and helplines
which can lead towards the increased use of the
mobile phone for accessing agricultural information.
These findings show that mobile phone ownership,
w h i c hi nt h ec a s eo ft h ec u r r e n ts t u d yi sv e r yl o w
(3.431 years), could also emerge as a potential chal-
lenge regarding the adoption of mobile-based FAS.8 Information Development XX(X)Farmers’ skills in mobile phone use
In our study, we defined mobile phone skills as
‘basic’ if farmers had skills limited to voice calls
only, while ‘advanced skills’ refers to the use of
smartphone, SMS services, and Internet-based
mobile services. The findings show that the farmers’
skills in various mobile pho ne operations have a sig-
nificant positive relationship with the use of mobile
phone-based FAS at 0.002 level of significance. This
shows that farmers who have advanced skills in
mobile phone operations, like, SMS, and use of
Internet-based mobile applications, have a greater
tendency (18.775 times) to use mobile phone-
enabled FAS. Similar findings have been reported
in another study which showed that farmers with
higher levels of digital literacy have a higher ten-
dency to use mobile phones for farm information
(Roy et al., 2018). This study also concludes that
farmers’ use of mobile phone-based FAS services
is determined by their m obile operating skills.
Farmers contact with extension agents
Findings of the current study have also shown that
farmers’ contact with agricultural extension agents
(farm advisory personnel) has a significant negativerelationship with the use of mobile-based FAS (sig.
level 0.000). Regression results indicate that a farmer
having regular formal meetings with or visits from
agriculture extension agent has 20 times less tendency
to use mobile-based FAS. This shows that when farm-
ers do not have access to formal extension and advi-
sory services, they tend to rely on mobile phone-based
information services as a substitute. It is argued that
farmers only try to obtain information from other
sources if the formal extension and advisory services
do not meet their information needs (Aker and Ksoll,
2016).
Schematic framework of farmers’ use/adoption
process of mobile-based FAS
The process of farmers’ use or adoption of mobile
phone-based FAS is illustrated in the schematic
framework shown at Figure 6, which is based on the
analysis of the field data. This framework serves as a
useful tool to understand the use or adoption process
of mobile phone-based farm advisory services offered
to farmers in the study area (Figure 4). The various
socio-economic and mobile phone-related attributes
of the farmers (Table 1) are illustrated with respect
to their effect on the use of mobile-based FAS. In

relationship. Similarly, the smooth orange lines indi-
cate a significant negative relationship, while the

relationship between the dependent and independent
variables.
Conclusions and implications
To meet the information needs of farming commu-
nities, various mobile-based FAS have been started
in Pakistan since the start of the current decade.
These services provide farm assistance to the farm-
ing communities regarding various agronomic
operations, livestock, market updates, and other
farm-related matters. A lthough many ICT initia-
tives have been taken in agricultural extension in
Pakistan, their performance has remained question-
nable. The current study focused on identifying
farmers’ use of the mobile-based FAS offered in
the study area and analysing the factors associated
with their use.
The findings revealed that more than three quar-
ters of the sampled farmers indicated that they used
various mobile-based FAS (77.08 %). Detailed sta-
tistics of all FAS revealed that the private sector’s
input suppliers and the telecom sector’s Jazz Bakha-
bar Kissan holds the highest share of users, while
the public sector’s agricultural department and live-
stock department helplines had the lowest share of
total users. The lower use of the public sector’s FAS
shows certain problems with their delivered content
and indicates the lack of in terest from these institu-
tions in the provision of updated and needs-specific
information. This study findings urges the con-
cerned authoritie s to consider the adoption of a con-
temporary mode of e-extension equipped with the
latest information based on the farmers’ actual
requirements.
This study further found that the majority of the
farmers preferred voice-based content compared to
the SMS-based information, because voice content
was provided in their local languages. The farmers’
low educational level and lack of mobile use skills
could also be a reason for less use of SMS-based
information, as most of the farmers might not be able
to read SMS. These findings suggest that Punjabgovernment’s agricultural and livestock departments
should provide voice-based content as most of the
farmers are illiterate.
Our study has also analysed certain socio-
economic and mobile use-related factors which were
closely linked with the use of mobile phone-based
FAS. For example, farmers’ educational level is one
of the determinants which positively influence farm-
ers’ use of FAS. A higher education level among the
farmers leads to the greater adoption and use of
mobile-based FAS. In the current study, where farm-
ers’ average years of schooling are critically low, this
could be a major constraint in the use of mobile-based
FAS. Similarly, farmers’ age has been reported to
indicate a decrease in the use of mobile-based FAS
among the older farmers. These findings highlight the
significance of education and awareness regarding the
use of mobile-based FAS among the illiterate, older,
and middle-aged farmers. Based on these findings,
policy makers and practitioners in the field of ICT-
enabled agricultural extension services should con-
sider farmers’ socio-economic traits prior to adopting
alternatives like mobile phones for farm information
dissemination.
The farmers’ mobile phone-related characteris-
tics, such as their mobile operating skills, duration
of mobile phone ownership and total numbers of
mobile phones in a family, have been found posi-
tively significant in relation to the use of mobile-
based FAS. These findings highlight the importance
of digital literacy in the application of mobile
phone-enabled solutions in agricultural extension,
and point to the need for the training of farmers
in the study area, as the majority of the farmers lack
mobile related skills. Th e provincial government
should integrate public and private sector institu-
tions in advisory provision and jointly launch train-
ing campaigns and workshops for the farming
communities. This will improve the compatibility
of delivered content with farmers’ actual informa-
tion needs, and hence increase the practical feasibil-
ity of these mobile-based FAS.
