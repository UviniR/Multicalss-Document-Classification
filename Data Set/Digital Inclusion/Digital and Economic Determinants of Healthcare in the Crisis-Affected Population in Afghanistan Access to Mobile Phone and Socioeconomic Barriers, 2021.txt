Abstract: Despite recent progress in Afghanistan’s health system from the support of international
donors and NGOs, protracted conﬂicts combined with a series of natural disasters have continued to
present substantial health risks. Extreme poverty has still aggravated social determinants of health
and ﬁnancial barriers to healthcare. Little is known about the context-speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing ac-
cess to healthcare in the crisis-affected population. Using a subset of data from ‘Whole of Afghanistan
Assessment (WoAA) 2019’, this study analyzed 31,343 households’ data, which was collected between
17 July and 19 September 2019 throughout all 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The outcome measured
was access to care in the healthcare facility, and multivariable binary logistic regression models
were used to identify the speciﬁc factors associated with access to healthcare. Of 31,343 households
exposed to complex emergencies in Afghanistan, 10,057 (32.1%) could not access healthcare facilities
when one was needed in last three months. The access to healthcare was signiﬁcantly associated
with displacement status, economic factors such as employment status or total monthly income, and
the distance to healthcare facilities. Signiﬁcant increase in healthcare access was associated with
factors related to communication and access to information, such as awareness of humanitarian
assistance availability and mobile phone with a SIM card, while disability in cognitive function, such
as memory or concentration, was associated with poorer healthcare access. Our ﬁndings indicate
that the crisis-affected population remains vulnerable in access to healthcare, despite the recent
improvements in health sectors. Digital determinants, such as access to mobile phone, need to be
addressed along with the healthcare barriers related to poverty and household vulnerabilities. The
innovative humanitarian ﬁnancing system using mobile communication and cash transfer programs
would be considerable for the conﬂict-affected but digitally connected population in Afghanistan.

1. Introduction
Despite a fragile economy and an infrastructure devastated by decades of conﬂicts
and instability, Afghanistan’s health system has made signiﬁcant improvements in recent
years [ 1–3]. In the early 2000s, the maternal mortality ratio was recorded as being at
the bottom of the international ranking (1600 per 100,000 live births) and the mortality
rates of infants and children both ranked as the fourth highest in the world (165 and
257 per 1000 live births). Less than 10% of the population had access to health services

within a one-hour walk to a health facility [ 4]. Since 2003, however, the Ministry of
Public Health (MoPH) has strived to develop the healthcare system through the Basic
Package of Healthcare Services (BPHS) and Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS)
by contracting public health services with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a
semiautonomous agency within the health ministry [ 1,5]. These packages have involved
signiﬁcant increases in the number of functioning primary health care facilities and the
quality of care in publicly ﬁnanced facilities, which have enabled the increase of health
facility deliveries and in antenatal care from a skilled provider [ 1,6]. Standard clinical and
administrative management have been provided to supply basic health care services [ 2,4,7].
In spite of substantial progress in the war-torn health system, Afghanistan still faces
health challenges due to a lack of sustainable health ﬁnancing and workforce and a high
reliance on international donors [ 8]. In the last decade, economic hardships have been
aggravated in many households, impacting on the social determinants of health through
complex pathways for those trapped in poverty [ 9,10]. The epidemiological transition with
non-communicable disease has been an additional burden on the rapidly growing popula-
tion. In a fragile health system without sustainable health ﬁnancing, health services are
often delayed or inaccessible, resulting in preventive deaths or chronic diseases that result
in lost income and higher healthcare costs [ 6]. Given those economic barriers and extreme
poverty, cash transfer programs have been considered as innovative intervention models to
increase human capital in poor households [ 11]. In Afghanistan, international actors have
operated pilot cash transfer programs, although they are still limited by risks of corruption,
diversion, and inﬂationary effects in the complex operational environment [12–14].
In this context, humanitarian concerns have been raised particularly about the complex
health consequences of protracted conﬂicts, coupled with political instability, and a series
of natural disasters. The crisis-affected population has been forcibly and continuously
displaced, both cross-border or internally, leaving more than 7 million people at health
risk without adequate access to primary health services [ 3]. In 2019, an average 36,181
persons were displaced each month by conﬂicts, following the displacement of more than
200,000 due to drought in 2018. There were 430,000 returnees from Iran after its economy
was substantially slowed down under sanction [ 15]. The crisis-affected population is at
higher risk of physical and mental illness, including trauma and disabilities, requiring an
uninterrupted provision of essential care [ 2,3,16]. The death toll was the highest in 2018,
with almost double the number of civilian deaths and injuries compared with 2009 [ 17].
Afghanistan still suffers with the poorest health indicators, such as the highest maternal
mortality ratio of 327 deaths per 100,000 live births in the regions.
Although substantial numbers of people are known to be exposed to the dual conse-
quences of complex emergencies and their additional impacts on the fragile health system,
little is known about context-speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing access to healthcare in the crisis-
affected populations. Moreover, we do not know about how these populations are more
marginalized under Afghanistan’s health system, and whether and how innovative hu-
manitarian programs, such as cash transfer programs, can ﬁll their healthcare gaps. Using
the dataset from ‘Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WOA Assessment) 2019’, this study
aimed to examine demographic, socioeconomic, and implementation barriers to health
care in the crisis-affected population and to identify context speciﬁc modiﬁable factors for
future humanitarian programs and health system reforms in Afghanistan.
2. Methods
2.1. Design and Data Collection
‘Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoA Assessement) 2019’ was designed as a
descriptive study to investigate the humanitarian needs of the population affected by the
crisis. This is a multi-sectoral needs assessment was carried out within the framework of
the Inter-Cluster Coordination Team (ICCT) and co-facilitated by Renewed Efforts Against
Child Hunger and undernutrition (REACH) [ 18], in close collaboration with the United
Nations Ofﬁce for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Between 17 July andHealthcare 2021 ,9, 506 3 of 10
19 September 2019, structured household surveys were conducted using Open Data Kit
(KoBo Toolbox) amongst a sample of 31,343 displaced and crisis-affected households in
accessible areas throughout all 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The household survey was
based on a random cluster sample.
2.2. Variables
The variables included the demographic characteristics of the household affected
by the crisis (number of family members, age, marital status) and the vulnerability of
the households’ head (female household head, sensory difﬁculty, movement difﬁculty,
cognitive difﬁculty, chronic illness). Displacement status of the household was also asked.
Socioeconomic factors included highest education level achieved by household members,
literacy (at least one household member over the age of 10 can read and write), employment
status (number of adults worked outside), total monthly income, total debt, bank account
(at least one household member has a bank account registered to their name), and phone
with a subscriber identiﬁcation module (SIM) card in household. The mean income by main
source for families of Afghanistan was collected by their working and most of the spending
of each Afghan family was categorized by items necessary for living. We also assessed
whether respondents knew of information on assistance or were aware of humanitarian
assistance availability, as indicator of the Afghan family support system. To assess access
to health care facilities, respondents were asked: In the past 3 months, have you had access
to a comprehensive health center in your village or close to your village where you could
receive healthcare services?”, with response choices of “yes” or “no”; furthermore, the
distance to healthcare facilities was also collected.
2.3. Ethical Consideration
Ethics approval for this human-subject database research was obtained from the
institutional review board of (IRB No. DKU-IRB-NON2020-006) Dankook University.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize participants’ general, socio-demog-
raphic, and health-related characteristics related to access to healthcare facilities. Results
are presented as sample frequencies with weighted percentage or weighted mean estimates
with 95% conﬁdence intervals as appropriate. Inter-group comparisons were performed
using the Rao–Scott corrected chi-square test for categorical data, and sampling design
weighted univariable linear regression for continuous data [ 19]. We performed multivari-
able binary logistic regression analysis to explore the factors related to healthcare facility
access. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) estimates are
reported. To produce unbiased estimates of population characteristics, the Taylor-series lin-
earization was employed for variance estimation to account for the complex sample design
of WoAA 2019 survey [ 20]. The data were analyzed using Stata/MP version 16.1 (StataCorp
LP , College Station, TX, USA). The alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered as a
threshold for statistical signiﬁcance.
3. Results
A total of 31,343 representative samples of households affected by the crisis in
Afghanistan were included in this analysis. Among those crisis-affected households,
61.3% were of displaced populations originating from regions other than those where the
interviews were conducted. The mean age of the household head was 43 years old, and
91.0% were ever married. Most households were headed by a male, while only 8.9% were
headed by a female. The proportion of males to females was 48% females and 52% males
in all age groups. The mean number of family members was 6.2. Education level was low,
as 42.6% responded that they had never been educated. Only 56.0% of households had
at least one individual over the age of 10 who could read and write. Regarding economic
status of households, 15.8% did not have adults working outside, and the mean totalHealthcare 2021 ,9, 506 4 of 10
monthly income was AFN 10,800 (USD 138.6) [ 21]. Total average debt of households was
AFN 66,000 (USD 847.2) and health expenditure was reported as the most common reason.
Approximately 5.1% of households had at least one person who had a bank account in
their own name. For communication and access to information, 53.1% owned a phone
with a SIM card registered to at least one family member. About 10% of the households
reported having information about assistance or being aware of the current availability of
humanitarian assistance. Related to disability of the household head, respondents reported
difﬁculties in sensory function (seeing or hearing with aid, 15.8%), motor function (walking,
15.6%), or cognitive function (memory, concentration, or self-care, 19.9%). Despite the
low rate of screening and diagnosis of non-communicable disease in Afghanistan, 19.8%
responded that they had a chronic illness. For the distance to health care center, 77.8% of
households were within a 5 km radius of healthcare facilities.
Of 31,343 households exposed to complex emergencies in Afghanistan, 10,057 (32.1%)
could not access a healthcare facility when it was needed in last three months. With
regard to accessibility to health services, it was identiﬁed that these demographic (number
of family members, marital status) and socioeconomic factors (education, literacy, job
status, total monthly income), communication and access to information (phone with a
SIM card, knowing about information on assistance, awareness of humanitarian assistance
availability), the distance to a healthcare facility, and displacement status resulted in
signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) (Table 1).

In order to explore the relating (predicting) factor for health care facility access in the
crisis-affected households, multivariable binary logistic regression was performed ( Table 2 ).
Among households exposed to any type of complex emergency, their displacement sta-
tus was signiﬁcantly associated with access to healthcare (non-displaced vs. displaced,
OR = 1.369, p= 0.008, 95% CI = 1.086 to 1.726). Economic factors such as employment
status (one adult: OR = 1.448, p= 0.001, 95% CI = 1.158 to 1.811; two or more adults:
OR = 1.605, p= 0.033, 95% CI = 1.039 to 2.480), and total monthly income (OR = 1.016,
p< 0.001, 95% CI = 1.008 to 1.025) were associated with access to healthcare when it was
needed. Signiﬁcant increases were found in households with positive factors related to
communication and access to information, such as awareness of humanitarian assistance
availability (OR = 1.642, p< 0.001, 95% CI = 1.234 to 2.186) and phone with a SIM card
(OR = 1.692, p< 0.001, 95% CI = 1.299 to 2.204). Meanwhile, disability of household head in
cognitive functions such as memory or concentration (OR = 0.606, p= 0.039, 95% CI = 0.377
to 0.974) were associated with lower access to healthcare. Not surprisingly, compared with
those living within 5 km of healthcare facilities, a greater distance was associated with a
signiﬁcant decrease in access to care (6 to 10 km: OR = 0.463, p< 0.001, 95% CI = 0.339 to
0.631; >10 km: OR = 0.374, p< 0.001, 95% CI = 0.277 to 0.504).

4. Discussion
Over the last decade, relative stability and accelerated improvements have been made
in Afghanistan’s health system. Since 2003, the Basic Package of Healthcare Services
(BPHS) and Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS) have been implemented to
provide essential healthcare service to the entire population. The number of functional
health facilities has increased from 496 in 2002 to 3135 in 2018, providing nearly 87%
of the population with access to health facilities that are within two hours distance by
any means of transport [ 22]. Health system improvements have substantially resulted in
improvements in key health indicators, such as under-ﬁve mortality reduced from 191 per
1000 live births in 2006 to 50 per 100 live births in 2018 [ 23]. The progress in healthcare
provision is undoubted, despite signiﬁcant gaps that still remain.
These improvements in the health sector, however, have not been evenly distributed
across social, economic, and regional strata. Health disparities persist or are even ag-
gravated among marginalized groups in Afghanistan. Distance to health facilities, high
medical cost, insecurity, rural and urban disparities, and gender inequality have been
reported as barriers to access to health service [ 8,22]. In particular, as this study focused,
the crisis-affected population is at serious risk of exclusion from the health system progress
that has been accomplished in the last decade [ 15]. Access to essential public health was
limited in more than thirty percent of the population in hard-to-reach regions living under
insecurity [23].
Our analysis of Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoA assessment) 2019 conﬁrms
that there was substantial inaccessibility to healthcare in the crisis-affected population.
After decades of conﬂict, one-third of crisis-affected households could not access healthcare
facilities when needed. In the crisis-affected population, signiﬁcant disparities were found
among those who experienced displacement. Although 77.8% of the respondents live
within 5 km of healthcare facilities, a greater distance to a health facility was signiﬁcantly
related to poor access to healthcare, as it related to more expenditure for transportation,
which would constitute a signiﬁcant barrier given the extreme poverty in the region [ 6,7].
Compared with disability rates in general population, such as functions of seeing (4.8%),
hearing (2.0%), walking (11.9%), and remembering (5.3%) [ 22], 15.8% of household heads
in the crisis-affected population reported disabilities in sensory function and 15.6% re-
ported disabilities in motor function. Additionally, 19.9% suffered from impaired cognitive
function. All disabilities resulted in increased vulnerabilities of households in terms of
livelihood, employment, health, and nutrition.
Although overall health ﬁnancing has risen substantially to USD 169 million in
2012 [ 24], Afghanistan’s health system has relied heavily on international donors, such as
USAID, EU, and World Bank, accounting for 19.4% of total health expenditure, leaving only
5.6% from the government-ﬁnanced public sector [ 25]. The rapid expansion of the for-proﬁt
health sector has resulted in parallel informal payments and out-of- pocket expenditure to
ﬁll the ﬁnancial gap, with 75.5% of total health expenditure being spent by households [ 25].
The expansion of health markets is believed to have improved the health service coverage
in the hard-to-reach areas, but has created ﬁnancial barriers in the provision of essential
health care [ 26]. This study shows that the poor economic status of the crisis-affected popu-
lation, indicated by lower monthly income, is signiﬁcantly associated with inaccessibility
to healthcare in the crisis-affected population. Households with more employed adults
have signiﬁcantly better access to care.
These ﬁndings of economic barriers imply the need of and strategies for a multisec-
toral approach, especially cash transfer programs, in consideration of the aggravating
poverty and livelihood struggles in Afghanistan [ 13]. Between 2007 and 2016, people living
below the poverty line has more than doubled, affecting an estimated 80 percent of the
Afghan population [ 9]. In 2019, entrenched conﬂicts and violence, exacerbated by natural
disasters of ﬂash ﬂooding and chronic droughts, left the most vulnerable groups to face
complex burdens of displacement, unemployment, and chronic illness and disabilities, all
of which exacerbate poverty. In Afghanistan’s health system, which relies on out-of-pocketHealthcare 2021 ,9, 506 8 of 10
expenditure, coverage of essential health service is difﬁcult to increase among populations
living in growing poverty. As the study results show, additional costs, such as transporta-
tion expenditure for health facilities, would be signiﬁcant economic barriers. Given the
multisectoral impact of extreme poverty in healthcare and other social determinants of
health [ 10], it would be unavoidable for humanitarian actors to operate comprehensive
ﬁnancing models such as conditional or unconditional cash transfer programs. However,
the design and implementation of cash transfer programs need careful consideration given
the heterogeneous and still uncertain impact on diverse operational contexts in low- and
middle-income countries [ 12,27,28]. In particular, context-speciﬁc ﬁnancing models are
required in the conﬂict-affected regions, where pursuit of a livelihood is often limited by
security concerns.
In Afghanistan, the operational health system was not established by the government’s
own capacity but through extensive partnerships with NGOs. A provision of essential
healthcare, such as the Basic Package of Healthcare Services (BPHS) and Essential Package
of Hospital Services (EPHS), was outsourced to 40 national and international NGOs in 31
out of the 34 provinces. As this study indicates, factors related to access to information of
assistance, especially awareness of humanitarian assistance availability potentially related
to those non-governmental providers, are signiﬁcantly associated with access to health-
care. Meanwhile, the disability in cognitive functions such as memory or concentration,
potentially related to poor access to relevant information or communication, are negatively
associated with healthcare access. Signiﬁcantly, this study’s results highlight that mobile
phones were associated with signiﬁcant improvements in access to care in Afghanistan’s
health system. In the fragile transition of a health system, healthcare barriers are not only
rooted in limited resource but also in the instability and discontinuity of care provided
by separated healthcare providers in public and private sectors. Mobile phones have
great potential as essential communication tools for connecting patients to decentralized
healthcare resources more effectively and delivering relevant health information in more
affordable ways [ 29–31]. Recent studies also support the potential impact of mobile phones
in the growth of household economies, gender equality, and empowerment [ 32]. To miti-
gate negative consequence of complex emergencies on depleted economic resources and
healthcare, our ﬁndings suggest strengthening communication and access to information
on assistance, especially through mobile phones. Particularly given the aggravating human
immobility under COVID-19 pandemic, an innovative health ﬁnancing system using mo-
bile communication and cash transfer programs would be considered critical for ﬁlling the
healthcare gaps in the conﬂict-affected but digitally connected population in Afghanistan.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, despite undoubtable progress in recent years, Afghanistan’s health
system still shares many features with post-conﬂict-affected zones in other parts of world,
such as a high reliance of health ﬁnancing from international donors, the dependency of
health services on NGOs, and substantial out-of-pocket expenditures by households. Given
the health system impact of high levels of insecurity and sharp increases in poverty, this
study highlights that the crisis-affected population, especially displaced persons, are more
vulnerable to exclusion from essential healthcare services provision. Financial barriers such
as extreme poverty and unemployment are imposed more on the population affected by
crisis and displacement, and thus impede their access to healthcare in the fragile health
system. Therefore, digital determinants, such as access to a mobile network, along with
addressing barriers to healthcare access, need to be reﬂected in the innovative ﬁnancing
models of future humanitarian programs.
