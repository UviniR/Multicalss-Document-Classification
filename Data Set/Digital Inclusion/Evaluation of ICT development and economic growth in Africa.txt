Abstract
This paper evaluates the impact of information and communication technology (ICT)
on economic growth in Africa based on a sample of 54 countries from 2005 to 2015.
The sample is further divided along five sub-regions and the outcomes measured
by estimating pooled ordinary least squares, random and fixed effects and systemgeneralised method of moments models. The ICT indicators are individuals using
the internet, mobile subscribers and fixed telephone subscribers with trade openness
and inflation rate as control variables. Findings, among others, reveal that (1) ICTdevelopment has a statistically significant positive relationship with economic
growth, (2) the output elasticities of the three ICT indicators are significantly differ-
ent, (3) the “leapfrogging” hypothesis holds, (4) mobile subscription has the largestoutput elasticity across all specifications and has the biggest potentials to enable
Africa to skip traditional developmental stages, (5) regressions for the sub-samples
show statistically significant differences of the output elasticity of ICT indicators.The study recommends that concerted efforts must be directed towards harnessing the
inherent benefits of ICT usage which includes reducing the rising cost attributable to
the usage of communication technology facilities such as the cost of buying a cellularphone, internet connectivity rates, subscription rates and so on.

1 Introduction
Several factors determine economic growth which refers to a rise in the output that an
economy produces over a period of time. Such factors include, but are not limited to,
human capital development, institutional framework, natural resources development,labour productivity, physical capital and information and communication technol-
ogy (ICT). It is noteworthy that a country’s socio-economic development hinges on
the rate of growth of its productivity, hence, the study of economic growth is still
gaining relevance in the contemporary literature. Needless to say that developmental
progress is not feasible without economic growth. Importantly, productivity growthunderpins the foundation for improvements in the standard of living, and investment
in ICT is a prominent driver of growth. In relation to Africa, the continent became
the world’s third-fastest growing region after its economy enhanced post-2000 [ 19]
and this growth was largely attributable to the increase in domestic investment in the
services sector largely influenced by better ICT usage and efficiencies [ 1,2]. Particu-
larly in rural African settings, the usage of ICT services has contributed to the positive
transformation of lives and livelihoods evidenced by job-creation, increased income,
cost minimisation, reduction in uncertainty and risk, familial bonding to mention a
few [2, 3,22].
ICT, on the other hand, is a general term that includes any communication device
or application, encompassing cellular phones, computers, network hardware and soft-ware, satellite systems and so on. It comprises the storage, retrieval, conversion andtransmission of information in addition to the automation of processes, controls and
information production. It is a major factor in shaping the new global economy which
produces rapid changes in societies and in recent times it has basically changedcommunication patterns and business engagements. At country-level, ICT allows
countries to sidestep traditional stages or processes required for development and
capability building, a situation termed as “technology leapfrogging” [9, 14,17,22].
In other words, it is the ability to use ICT to skip traditional paths through “bypassingsome of the processes of accumulation of human capabilities and fixed investmentin order to narrow the gaps in productivity and output ”[17]. According to United
Nations [20]a n dW o r l dB a n k[ 22] Reports, ICT is the bedrock for economic growth
from the experiences of the emerging economies of Asia, such as China, South Korea,Hong Kong, and Singapore who have been able to skip production and developmen-
tal stages due to the massive adoption of ICT while Africa, on the other hand, is yet
to fully harness the opportunities of ICT for growth perhaps due to the cost outlay ofICT infrastructures and the vast majority of the population who are largely unskilled
and unequipped with the necessary technological skills [ 6,9]. Though, the continent
has recorded successes in the use of ICT for mobile money transfers, and as a tool to
save travel time thereby reducing transaction costs [22].
The ICT-economic growth relationship has been extensively documented in the
literature, particularly for developed and emerging economies [ 4,14,21] with sparse
exclusive studies on Africa [ 3,5] owing largely due to a lack of data on ICT variables.
Hence, this study fills that gap and differs from similar works on the ICT-growthnexus by engaging a new discourse which is to exclusively examine the impact of ICTEvaluationofICTdevelopmentandeconomicgrowthinAfrica
development on economic growth in Africa within the context of the “leapfrogging”
hypothesis. That is, can Africa use ICT to skip some developmental stages throughits impact on economic growth? To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to
evaluate the ICT-growth relationship for Africa within the “leapfrogging” hypothesis
framework. The study has three objectives: (1) to show whether the “leapfrogging”hypothesis holds, (2) to analyse the impact of ICT on the economies of African
countries in a bid to draw out its significance and (3) to assess if it possesses growth-
stimulating potentials. The outcome of this study will motivate policy discussions on
developing the ICT sector for greater contributions to economic growth and by exten-
sion engender a new dialogue on how Africa can use ICT opportunities to advancethe socio-economic goals of the continent best. As defined by Steinmueller (2001),
for the ‘leapfrogging’ hypothesis to hold, the output elasticities of ICT effect for the
three indicators should differ significantly across the five sub-regions: Central Africa,East Africa, North Africa, South Africa and West Africa.
1That is, the output elas-
ticities that are largest among the three ICT indicators should provide evidence onwhich indicator enables Africa to skip traditional developmental stages in addition tosubstantiating the positive growth effect of ICT.
To analyse the ICT-growth relationship, we show whether the contributions of ICT
to output growth significantly differ among Africa’s five sub-regions. Our empiri-cal approach modifies the methodology outlined in Niebel [ 14] and differs in several
aspects: (1) the sample contains all of Africa’s 54 countries, (2) the focus is on theICT boom era, that is, 2005-2015, and (3) four empirical techniques - pooled ordinaryleast squares (POLS), random effects (RE), fixed effects (FE) and system generalised
method of moments (sys-GMM) are applied. The rapid increase in ICT adoption and
usage during these periods deem it an interesting phenomenon to be investigated.Furthermore, an augmented Cobb-Douglas production function which consists of
gross fixed capital formation, labour force participation rate, internet users, mobile
subscribers and fixed telephone subscribers is employed with trade openness and
inflation rate as control variables. All data is sourced from the World Bank [ 23].
The rest of the study is structured as follows: Section 2reviews relevant empirical
literature and details stylized facts on the trend of ICT among African countries,Section 3outlines the empirical approach and data, Section 4discusses the results
while Section 5concludes.
2 LiteraturereviewandreviewofICTusageinAfrica
A large number of macro-level studies on the relationship between ICT develop-
ment and economic growth have been carried out with opposing results which isoften attributable to the scope of study and the econometric methodologies adopted.
1Niebel [14] in his article “ ICT and Economic Growth - Comparing Developing, Emerging and Developed
Countries” posited that a ‘leapfrogging’ effect will imply that the output elasticities of ICT in developing
and emerging countries should be larger than those in developed countries.N.Adeleye,C.Eboagu
Some studies analyse ICT in relation to economic growth, inclusive growth, finan-
cial intermediation, human capital development, and knowledge economy to mentiona few. For instance, Niebel [14] using various panel data regressions across a sam-
ple of 59 developed, emerging and developing countries from 1995 to 2010 confirms
that the contributory effects of ICT-capital on output growth is higher in developedeconomies. In the same vein, Dedrick, Kraemer, and Shih [ 7] from a sample of 45
upper-income developing and developed countries for the period 1994 to 2007 showthat output elasticities of ICT stock is slightly larger in developed than in the upper-
income developing countries. Likewise, Papaioannou and Dimelis [ 15] find that the
effect of ICT capital stock on labour productivity growth is stronger in developed
than in developing countries from a sample of 22 developed and 20 developing coun-
tries for the period 1993 to 2001. Similarly, the study by Jorgenson and Vu [ 11] with
particular reference to Asia, provides evidence on the contribution of ICT to growth
in developing, emerging and developed countries and likewise Vu [21]s h o w st h a t
among a panel of 107 developing, emerging and developed countries, ICT is a strong
predictor of economic growth.
On studies related to Africa, Batuo [ 3] using a sample of 44 African countries
from 1990 to 2010, finds that ICT investment is subject to increasing returns, demon-strating that an increase in telecommunications investment produces further growth.Adopting both system GMM and OLS estimation techniques, the results further sug-
gest that real per capita GDP rises between 0.5% and 0.8%, following an increase
in teledensity by 10 people per 100 inhabitants providing evidence on the positivecontribution of telecommunications to Africa’s regional economic growth. Similarly,
Chavula [5] from a sample of 49 African countries (1990 to 2007) uses an endoge-
nous growth model to provide evidence on the significant impact of telephone mainlines and mobile telephony on living standards while Internet usage does not show a
significant influence on productivity. Also, Asongu and Le Roux [ 1] with a sample
of 49 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries from 2002 to 2012, show that policiesdesigned to boost ICT (mobile phone, internet, telephone) penetration will increase
inclusive development in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. Likewise,Kuada [ 12] shows that the knowledge economy is central to economic and human
developments. However, Ejemeyovwi and Osabuohien [ 8] from a panel of 15 West
African countries from 2004 to 2014 show that mobile subscription has a statisti-cally insignificant effect on inclusive growth which somewhat refutes the positive
and significant role of ICT on growth.
Using three ICT indicators – mobile subscribers, individuals using the internet
and fixed telephone subscribers, a review of some African countries reveals that onmobile subscription, Nigeria has consistently maintained the lead as having the high-
est number of mobile cellular subscribers with 18.59 million subscribers as at 2005to 151 million in 2015, representing a growth of 711%. Closely following is Egypt
with a surge in the number of mobile phone subscribers from 13.63 million in 2005 to
99.7 million in 2013 representing an increase of 631%. Ranked third is South Africawith a growing mobile subscription base from 33.96 million in 2005 to 87.99 millionEvaluationofICTdevelopmentandeconomicgrowthinAfrica
in 2015 representing an increase of 159.13%. As at 2015, the countries with less than
1 million mobile subscribers are: Sao Tome and Principe with 132,000; Seychelleshas 148,244; Djibouti, 314,350; Comoros with 424,786; Eritrea, 475,000; Equatorial
Guinea, 533,336; Cabo Verde, 602, 779 and Swaziland with 941,000.
On the number of individuals using the internet (% of population), statistics reveal
that Seychelles recorded the highest with 58.12% in 2015, followed by Moroccowhich has consistently maintained an increasing percentage across 2012 to 2015
covering 55.4% to 57.08% while South Africa ranks third with 51.91%. As at
2015, the countries with the lowest percentage of individuals using the internet
are Eritrea (1.08%); Somalia (1.76%); Niger (2.22%); Sierra Leone (2.5%); Chad(2.7%); Guinea-Bissau (3.54%); Congo, Dem. Rep. (3.79%); Madagascar (4.17%);
Central African Republic (4.56%); Guinea (4.7%) and Burundi (4.86%). Statistics on
the number of fixed telephone subscriptions show that Egypt consistently has main-tained the lead from 2005 to 2015. The country’s number of subscribers grew from
10.32 million in 2005 to 11.85 million in 2008 which later dropped to about 6.24 mil-
lion in 2015. South Africa follows closely with 4.8 million subscribers in 2005 butexperienced a later decrease to about 4.131 million in 2015.
The countries
2with the least number of fixed telephone subscribers are Central
African Republic (1,881); Sao Tome and Principe (7,000); Liberia (9,000); EquatorialGuinea (11,334); Malawi (14,462); Comoros (14,599); Rwanda (16,983); Congo,
Rep. (17,000); Sierra Leone (17,000); Chad (17,029) and Gabon (18,758). Lastly,
using regional delineation, Southern Africa has the highest average internet usersand fixed telephone users at 11.07 and 639,786.1, respectively, while North Africa
records the highest average mobile subscribers at 23.6 million. Overall, relative to
other ICT indicators, statistics show that mobile cellular subscriptions have increasedsubstantially. This is due to the convenience of using mobile phones in addition to
multiple subscriptions to different service providers or networks.
3D a t a a n d m o d e l
The study uses data on 54 African countries from 2005 to 2015 with all variables
sourced from World Bank [ 22,23] World Development Indicators (WDI). The main
reason for limiting the sample period is because pre-2005, most African countries
show considerable missing values for the ICT variables. Hence, there is the need to
restrict the period to allow more countries in order to make the sample size morerepresentative of the continent. In addition, since the aim of this empirical study is to
compare the contribution of ICT to economic growth in Africa, it is essential to divide

the full sample into five sub-samples across regional delineations3– Central Africa,
East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa – to show variations
across the five sub-regions.
3.1 Theindicators
In line with similar studies, the main variables are gross domestic product ( GDP)
which is the measure of economic growth; gross fixed capital formation ( GFCF );
labour participation rate ( LABOUR); individuals using the internet (% of population)
(INTERNET ), mobile cellular subscription ( MOBILE ) and fixed telephone subscrip-
tion (TEL ). For robustness, two control variables, trade openness ( TRADE )a n d
inflation (INFL ) are included. The economic growth variable has been extensively
explained in the introduction, hence other indicators are explained in brief.
Grossﬁxedcapitalformation is the net increase in physical assets within the mea-
surement period. It does not account for the consumption (depreciation) of fixed
capital, and also does not include land purchases. This indicator is included because it
captures absorptive capacity to produce, which in turn affects economic growth [ 18].
It is expected that a positive relationship exists between gross fixed capital formation
and economic growth.
Labourforceparticipationrate is the proportion of the population aged 15 and older
that is economically active. That is, all able-bodied individuals who supply labour
for the production of goods and services during a specified period. This variable is
used because labour is a key production factor in developing countries due to the highcost of acquiring capital. It is therefore important that necessary technical skills and
education are acquired to enhance labour productivity in the course of attaining a high
level of growth. Thus, the significance of the variable in this model is to capture theexistence to which labour input affects economic growth and a positive coefficient is
expected.
Internet users are individuals that use the internet from any location. It refers to
the world-wide public computer network that offers access to several communica-
tion services including the world wide web which carries email, news, entertainmentand data files. The internet can be accessed via computers, internet-enabled mobile
phones, digital television, and game machines.
Mobilecellularsubscription refers to the number of subscriptions to a public mobile-
telephone service that provides access to the public switched telephone network
3The list of countries and their respective regions are shown in Appendix Table 8.EvaluationofICTdevelopmentandeconomicgrowthinAfrica
(PSTN) using cellular technology. The indicator applies to all mobile-cellular sub-
scriptions that offer voice communication excluding subscriptions via data cards orUSB modems, public mobile data services, private trunked mobile radio, radio paging
and telemetry services.
Telephonelinesubscription captures the active number of analogue fixed telephone
lines, voice-over-IP (V oIP) subscriptions, fixed wireless local loop (WLL) subscrip-
tions, ISDN voice-channel equivalents and fixed public payphones. It is hypothesized
that an efficient use of ICT variables will have considerable boost on economic growth.
For the control variables, t rade openness shows the extent of integration among
countries within the continent and with the rest of the world and it is expected thatincreased trade will have positive impact on growth. Lastly, inflation, a rising price
level is expected to have a non-linear relationship with economic growth. This is
because at the initial stage, inflation is expected to stimulate (drag) economic growth
after which it becomes a drag (inhibitor) on growth upon attaining certain thresholds.
Hence, the expected sign of the coefficient is indeterminate.
3.2 Summarystatisticsandcorrelationanalysis
The relative statistics of these indicators are shown in Table 1for the full sample
and across the five sub-regions. The average gross domestic product (GDP) for the
full sample is US$34.9 billion with Nigeria having the highest at US$547 billion in2014 and Sao Tome and Principe shows the lowest in 2011 with US$126 million.
Likewise across regional classification, average GDP ranges between US$13.7 bil-
lion (East Africa) and US$93.9 billion (North Africa). Average gross fixed capital
formation (% of GDP) which is highest in North Africa at 26.65 and lowest in West
Africa at 20.67 shows the relative absorptive capacity of both regions. The largestaverage labour participation rate occurs in Central Africa with 72.45% followed
by East Africa at 71.94%. The highest average trade openness (% of GDP) occurs
in Southern Africa with 89.874 and the lowest is recorded for Central Africa with73.84.
Also, the average inflation rate is lowest in West Africa at 5.74% while the high-
est is in East Africa at 199.15% (with contributions from Zimbabwe at 24,411.33%,1,096.68% and 302.12% for periods 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively). On the
ICT variables, per 100 people, Southern Africa has the highest average number of
internet users and fixed telephone users at 11.07 and 639,786.1, respectively, whileNorth Africa records the highest average number of mobile subscribers at 23.6 mil-
lion. A close scrutiny of the data shows that relative to others, Egypt has the highest
number of fixed telephone users ranging between 11.8 million (2008) and 6.235 mil-lion (2015) while Nigeria has the highest number of mobile telephone users ranging
between 113 million (2012) to 151 million (2015). The correlation matrix with the
natural logarithms of the variables in Table 2shows that gross fixed capital forma-
tion and all the ICT indicators have a positive and statistically significant associationN.Adeleye,C.EboaguTable1 Summary statistics

with economic growth while labour and trade openness have a negative and statisti-
cally significant association. However, a strong and positive correlation is detectedbetween mobile subscribers and fixed telephone subscribers (0.682).
3.3 Themodel
A common model used in investigating the effects of ICT investments on output
growth is the neoclassical model by Solow [16] where the technological factor, ortotal factor productivity,
4is a parameter of great importance. It includes all other
factors of production that cannot be explained by capital and labour alone. Sincegrowth is influenced by technology, which often is determined by factors such as newinnovations, externalities, human capital and investment decisions, there are reasons
to believe in a positive relationship between the Solow residual and ICT indicators
making the neoclassical model suitable to use in this context. In addition, to evaluate
the impact of ICT using the full and sub-samples, the study adopts a Cobb-Douglas
production function, represented as:
Y
it=AitLα1
itKα2
iteuit,i=1,2,...,N ;t=1,2,...,T (1)
where Yis output stock, Ais the technological parameter affecting the productivity of
KandL;KandLare the stocks of capital and labour, respectively. This empirical
4Also known as Solow residual.EvaluationofICTdevelopmentandeconomicgrowthinAfrica
approach modifies the methodology outlined by Niebel [14]. To achieve the study
objectives, a column vector of ICT variables, Z/prime, a row vector of control variables,
X/primeand regional dummy variables (to capture variations across the five sub-regions)
are included. Without imposing constant returns to scale and using natural logarithmtransformation, the model becomes:
lnY
it=α0+α1lnLit+α2lnKit+α3Z/prime
it+α4X/primeit+γi+ϕt+uit(2)
With ln Yitbeing the natural logarithm of GDP; ln Kit, the natural logarithm of
gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP); ln Lit, the natural logarithm of labour par-
ticipation, Z/primeitis the vector of natural logarithms of ICT variables (internet usage,
mobile subscription and fixed telephone subscribers); X/primeitis the vector of con-
trol variables (trade openness and inflation rate) in natural logarithms; ϕtrepresents
year dummies (which controls for common shocks such as the global financial
crises of 2007-2009), γiindicates regional dummies; and uitis the general error
term.
Furthermore, the following estimation approaches are adopted: (1) the sample is
split along five sub-regional delineations: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa,
South Africa and West Africa to allow for the comparison of findings across thecontinent. (2) To systematically draw the significance of ICT on economic growth,
the study adopts the use of static and dynamic models. These estimation methods
are used by similar studies [ 8,14] and given that the study uses a short panel of
54 countries (N) across 11 years (T) , hence, N>T. Similarly, the adoption of these
techniques serve as robustness for one another in order to observe the consistency ofthe impact of ICT variables on economic growth. The static models are the pooled
ordinary least squares (POLS ) which do not allow for heterogeneities across the
panels and the fixed effects ( FE) model
5which recognises panel heterogeneities
while the dynamic model is the systems generalised method of moments ( sys-GMM ).
The sys-GMM estimator is designed for short panel analysis and has the following
assumptions about the data-generating process which includes the fact that the pro-
cess may be dynamic, with current realisations of the dependent variable influenced
by past ones in addition to the fact that the regressors are not strictly exogenous
and may be correlated with past and possibly current realisations of the error term.Econometric analysis is carried out on the full sample as well as for the sub-sample
of regions. The POLS which is the baseline model is used to estimate the full and
sub-samples, while the FEandsys-GMM approaches are used only on the full sample
as they are not feasible for sub-sample regressions due to the small number of obser-
5The Hausman test supports the use of an FE model in 3 out of 4 panel regressions. Hence, random effects
(RE) estimator is used for one of the panel regressions.N.Adeleye,C.Eboagu
vations.6The sys-GMM specification includes the lagged GDP as a regressor. (3)
To avoid collinearity problems given the degree of substitutability between mobile
subscription and fixed telephone (correlation index is 0.6816), both are not included
together in the same model.
4 Resultsanddiscussions
4.1 PooledOLSresults
The results for the full sample using the POLS estimator are shown in Table 3.
Columns 1 and 2 are specific to the internet/mobile subscription and internet/fixed
telephone subscription regressions with trade openness as the control variable whilecolumns 3 and 4 are the respective robustness checks with inflation as the control
variable. Results in columns 1 and 2 which are consistent with findings from similar
studies [4, 7,9,10,13] show the positive and statistically significant relationship (at
the 1% level) between economic growth and ICT variables. The output elasticities of
INTERNET, MOBILE andTEL are 0.22%, 0.86% and 0.68%, respectively and those
obtained for the robustness checks are not significantly different with output elastic-
ities of 0.22%, 0.86% and 0.71%. Several key findings are gleaned from the results.
(1) The estimated elasticity for MOBILE is the largest indicating that an increase
in the number of mobile phone subscribers has a greater stimulating impact on the
continent’s economic growth relative to other ICT indicators. (2) The “leapfrogging”
hypothesis holds as findings show that among the three indicators, MOBILE is the
most likely to leapfrog Africa through developmental stages. (3) The positive coef-
ficients of the ICT indicators are consistent with ap r i o r iexpectations because the
existence of ICT provide the outline for the delivery of various services ranging from
telephony and its variants (such as, video phones, tele-conferencing) to high-speed
internet access and very diverse services (SMS, mobile banking, video stream-
ing, etc.) with eventual positive boost on economic growth. In addition, technologyimproves the capabilities of the labour force and communication between firms. The
use of ICT spreads to other industries and contributes to their profits thus affecting
their overall growth. Likewise, access to the internet provides a bigger boost to eco-nomic growth than access to mobile phones. Broadband internet, wireless and fixed,
is becoming a service of general economic interest by enhancing the knowledge,
skills, and networks of individuals; raising private sector productivity; and increasing

and West Africa meet the criteria for performing FE/RE and sys-GMM and because this will make a com-

to enhance national business environment and competitiveness. Overall, we find that
ICT stimulates economic growth.
On the factors of production, the coefficient of GFCF is positive and statistically
significant for the internet/mobile regressions at the 10% and 5% level, respectively,which aligns with what was expected a priori. This validates the role gross fixed capi-tal formation plays as an engine for economic growth. Capital input in this sense turns
out to be a major consideration in driving economic growth in Africa. Therefore,
productivity will increase in Africa as a result of an increase in capital investment.
Contrarily, across all model specifications, the results obtained on labour participa-
tion contradicts theory which posits that labour is a key ingredient for growth. Thecoefficient is negative and statistically significant (at the 1% and 5% level) which
implies that a proportionate decrease in economic growth occurs when LABOUR
changes by 1%, on average, ceteris paribus . For the control variables, TRADE has
no statistically significant impact on economic growth while INFLATION shows a
statistically significant asymmetric relationship at the 1% level.
On average, ceteris paribus , the coefficients of the regional dummies show that
the GDP of Central Africa is 302.25%
7higher than that of West Africa (the base
sub-region) for the internet/mobile regression and by 229.63% for the internet/fixed
telephone regression. Likewise, East Africa shows to have a higher GDP relative toWest Africa by 38.47% to 47.73% in both regressions. Similar findings are reported
from their robustness checks. On the other hand, North Africa shows a higher GDP
relative to West Africa only for the internet/mobile regression by 28.44% whileSouthern Africa indicates a higher GDP of 91.78% for the internet/mobile regression
and its respective robustness check. Lastly, having controlled for year dummies, the
goodness-of-fit of the four model specifications shows that the proportion of varia-tion in the dependent variable explained by the regressors ranges from 68% to 88%.
Across all model specifications, the F-statistics indicate that the regressors are jointly
significant in explaining economic growth.
The results for the full sub-sample for internet/mobile regression using the POLS
estimator are shown in Table 4while those for internet/fixed telephone regression are
shown in Table 5. Findings show that the output elasticity for MOBILE is the largest
for North Africa (1.12%) followed by that of West Africa (0.82%) with Central Africa
having the least (0.57%). Using the “leapfrogging” argument, it can be inferred thatmobile subscription can facilitate faster developmental progress in North Africa in
comparison to other sub-regions. These outcomes are very similar to those obtained
for the robustness checks (see Appendix Table 9). Contrary, the output elasticity for
INTERNET is negative for North Africa (-0.213) while it is statistically not signif-

icant for other sub-regions. For its corresponding robustness checks, the elasticities
are negative for East, North and Southern Africa. These findings provide further evi-
dence on the growth-stimulating impact of mobile subscriptions in comparison tointernet usage. Other results show the statistically significant asymmetric effects of
GFCF, LABOUR andTRADE.
Results in Table 5also reveal that TEL positively impacts growth across the five
sub-regions with West Africa having the largest elasticity of 0.792, followed bySouthern Africa (0.61) and Central Africa (0.464) as the least contributor. Hence,
theleapfrogging potential of fixed telephone in West Africa relative to other sub-
regions can be inferred. Parallel results are obtained from the robustness checks (see
Appendix Table 10). Similarly, the output elasticity for INTERNET is positive and
statistically significant for Central Africa (0.339), North Africa (0.168) and Southern
Africa (0.256) while the robustness checks reveal it is significant in Central Africa
(0.217) and North Africa (0.212) only.
In summary, findings from Tables 4and5further provide evidence on the growth-
stimulating impact and “leapfrogging” potentials of mobile and fixed telephonesubscriptions in comparison to internet usage that exhibits both positive and negativeN.Adeleye,C.Eboagu

4.3 SystemGMMresults
Controlling for possible endogeneity, heteroscedasticity and omitted variables,
results from the sys-GMM estimator are shown in Table 7.MOBILE is the only
ICT indicator that exhibits a positive and statistically significant relationship witheconomic growth in the short-run, on average, ceteris paribus .INTERNET shows
a negative relationship while that of TEL is both negative and statistically not sig-
nificant. An explanation for this result could be that the unobserved heterogeneityEvaluationofICTdevelopmentandeconomicgrowthinAfrica
in the data is now controlled. Again, findings highlight the “leapfrogging” poten-
tials of mobile subscription for African economies because it has the largest outputelasticities of 0.13% and 0.08%, respectively.
Regarding the model’s goodness-of-fit, there is no evidence of second-order serial
correlation given the p-values of the AR(2) statistics, while the null hypothesis of
instruments validity cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level given the p-
values of the Hansen statistics. Hence, the results obtained from these augmentedregressions can be used for inferences.
5 Conclusionandpolicyimplications
This study evaluates the relationship between ICT development and economic growthin Africa within the context of the “leapfrogging” hypothesis. Contribution is made
to the ICT-economic growth literature on Africa by using an exclusive panel data
of 54 African countries from 2005 to 2015, three ICT indicators (internet usage,mobile and fixed telephone subscribers) and static and dynamic modelling tech-
niques. We report some compelling and robust findings which substantiate that ICT
has a statistically significant influence on economic growth in Africa. This studyengages a new discourse and provides evidence that Africa can use ICT to “leapfrog”
developmental stages owing to the positive and statistically significant coefficients
of the ICT variables, particularly mobile subscribers which maintained a consistentpositive and statistically significant relation to economic growth across all model
specifications. In other words, the “leapfrogging” hypothesis and the “leapfrogging”
potentials of mobile subscription hold not only for the continent as a whole butalso for the sub-regions. Other findings are that gross fixed capital formation is an
essential ingredient for growth in the region while labour force participation, for the
most, has shown to have a negative impact on growth. The reason for this is due
to a large percentage of unskilled labour resulting in the unproductiveness of the
labour force thereby decreasing economic growth. Added to this are the incessantsocio-economic and political crises which reduce the incentive of labour to work.
In addition to initiating policies that will engender manpower training, capacity util-
isation which are ICT complementarities are required in order to boost economicgrowth.
The policy implication of our findings is not far-fetched. African governments
and stakeholders must take advantage of the developmental-enhancing potentials ofICT. Nonetheless, a greater percentage of African countries are promoting the use
of mobile subscriptions but at a rising cost to the teeming population. With ICT as
a “leapfrogging” opportunity, more investments need to be channeled to the sectorfor greater impacts on economic growth. That is, to be globally and economically
relevant, concerted efforts must be directed towards harnessing the inherent benefits
of ICT usage. These must include the drive to reduce the rising cost attributableto the usage of communication technology facilities such as the cost of buying aN.Adeleye,C.Eboagu
cellular phone, internet connectivity rates, subscription rates, etc. In conclusion, pol-
icy measures must be put in place to reduce ICT cost and develop the sector into amore economically and productive use. For further research, assessing ICT-growth
nexus as an inequality-reducing mechanism may be taken up.
