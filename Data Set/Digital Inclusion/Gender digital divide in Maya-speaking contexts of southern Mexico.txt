Abstract  
The digital divide phenomenon  arose in the early 90s due to internet  popularization and 
telecommunications and information use management development.  Numerous  studies and 
authors agree that the basic premise of the digital divide is the difference that exists between 
individuals and societies that have access to computing , telecommunications and internet 
technology resources and those that do not  (Schielfe 2008, Van Dijk & Hacker 2003, Servon 
2002, OECD 2001, Ginsburg, Sabatini & Wagner 2000) . The importance of information as 
a necessary element for society to function properly  is where this phenomenon  has its main 
emphasis, since those who do not have access to  information,  or have marginal contact with 
it, are excluded from a successful incorporation to social development.  
This work analyses  results of a study  focused on gender differences in the use of technologie s 
during a trai ning program called: Reduction of the Digital Divide in Vulnerable and Young 
People of Vulnerable Communities (REBREDIG -PJA) of a southern Mayan -speaking area 
of Yucatan. Th is study ´s results are discussed concurring to Mexico´s  National Development 
Plan (2013 -2018) and National Digital Strategy (2013) guidelines  and compared with  
parameters stated in Yucatan State Development Plan ( 2012 -2018 ).

Introduction  
In the dawn of the 1990’s, the digital divide phenomenon arose  because of  Internet´s 
popularization and telecommunications  development  on information use and administratio n 
(ICT) . Several  researchers  (Lichy, 2011 , Eynon, 2009, Schielfe, 2008, Livingstone & 
Helsper, 2007, Van Dijk & Hacker 2003, Cooper  & Weaver , 2003, Servon, 20 02, OECD, 
2001, Ginsburg, Sabatini & Wagner, 2000) agree that digital divide´s  basic premise is  the 
gap that computing, telecommunication and  internet build between individuals and societies 
that have access to these resources and those who do not.  Since i nformation , the highlight of 
this phenomenon  is an important and essential element to create connections  helping society 
to work properly and fairly , therefore, those who do not have access to information , or have 
it in a marginal way, are excluded from  a successful incorporation to social development.  
Globally , digital divide´s impact  has been the subject of numerous studies: Leaving no one 
Behind from digital divide to digital empowerment (UNESCO; 2017);  Bridging the digital 
divide in the EU  (Negreiro ; 2015);  Digital Dividends  (The World Bank, 2016) ; Capturing 
Digital Dividends and Closing Digital Divides  (OCDE, 2013) ; Bridging Gaps, Building 
Opportunity – Broadband as a Catalyst of Economic Growth and Social Progress in Latin 
America and the C aribbean  (IDB, 2012) . In Spain, for  example, the 2016 Statistical 
Yearbook, issued  by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) found that, according to the 
2016 Survey on Equipment and Use of Information and Communication Technologies in 
homes, 18.1% of households  in Spain do not have access to Internet ( INE, 2016), show ing 
that a significant percentage of Spanish houses  are excluded from the di gital universe. In 
terms of gender , there is a gap of 3.4% per person (pp), which means the percentage of male 
Internet users by 2014 were 77.9% and for women 74.5% , results that may seem acceptable, 
but compared  with Finland, Norway, New Zealand or Ireland, situation is far from expected 
internet access gender parity . 
Castaño , Martín and Martínez (2011) outlined  a composite indicators system to describe the 
gender digital divide through a study conducted in 31 European countries. This tool , called 
Gender and ICT Indicators System  (SIGTIC) , allows: a) to make inter -gender compa risons, 
determined by the degree of e -equality; b) perform intra -gender analysis, depending on the 
degree of e -inclusion of each sex; and c) contextualize the results obtained with those 
corresponding to 31 European countries. The outcomes show the presenc e of a gender digital 
divide , determined not only by  e-access, but also by the level of e -inclusion , showing a clear  
                        Vol. 11, Núm. 21 Julio - Diciembre 2020, e 104 
feminine disadvantage in the intensity of ICT use, addition ally presents evidence of the  use 
certain  segment s of internet according to gender: recreational  and economic (masculin e); of 
social welfare ( feminine ). 
In the article The digital divide between Male and Female users in Internet Public Access 
Sites , Dixon, Correa, Straubhaar, Covarrubias, Graber and Spencer (2 014),  examine the 
evidence of the gender digital  divide  in public internet access points (community technology 
centres , libraries  and others ) in Austin , Texas. Using extensive observations of the 
participants , authors found that male users are the most numerous  group in public access to 
internet use, even considering  age and ethnicity. Similarly, in -depth interviews revealed that 
both sexes saw public access  places , differen t form libraries, as  the least desira ble to use 
internet . In the case  of libraries , the study revealed women associated them with books and 
family nostalgia, while m en related  them . Finally, elder users described technophobia 
feelings .  
In this logic , USA´s  National Center for Women & Information Technology  (NCWIT, 2010) 
stated that 56% of the  2009  Advanced Placement exam  applicants were  women, but females 
only represented 18% of the people who took the exam in the Computer Science  area (CS 
AP). In fact, since 1999, the Advanced Place ment Program in Computer Science has 
systematically been the program with fewer women (NCWIT, 2010). NCWIT data is 
consistent with information found in countries such as Canada ( Dionne -Simard, Galarneau 
& Larochelle -Coté, 2016 ); Germany (Schinzel, 2017);  United Kingdom  (WISE,  2015); 
China ( Powell & Chang, 2016)  and Romania ( Ward, Dragne & Lucas, 2014), all 
documenting in recent years a significant decrease in women ´s enrollment  in study fields 
related to technology and engineering . 
United Kingdom ´s British Council (2016) carried out a study entitled: Gender equality and 
empowerment of women and girls in the UK , where th is parliamentary committee mentions 
that, despite the great global impact of digital technology and «Big data» in public an d 
consumer services , benefits are not shared equally,  and technology is playing an important 
role in  the emergence of new inequalities (gaps).  As a developed country,  the U K has almost 
achieved universal primary and secondary education. Girls enjoy greater  educational 
achievements, but there are still some areas where results are not fair. There is a clear gender 
segregation in areas selected by young woman in secondary and postsecondary education, 
mainly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathem atics)  related ones. Due to  
                        Vol. 11, Núm. 21 Julio - Diciembre 2020, e 104 
low participation in STEM in the UK, women represent only 15% of ICT professionals 
(European average is 18%) and less than 30% of the entire ICT workforce. These proportions  
are stagnant when analyzed and compared with the compo rtment  of other developed 
countries. Similarly, the study s hows  that worldwide, the number of female technology 
directors has remained immobile  for the last ten years.  
In Albury, Australia , Atkinson, Black & Curtis (2008) studied  the digital divide in th is region  
focusing  on its existence , identifying strategies to address it, and developing a methodology 
to explore it in any context. Results showed the existence of  digital divide, i s linked  to 
computer access  differences in access and related to income level, city  area of residency , age 
range  and education. In general, the model indicate s that individuals  with lower levels of 
education  and income and higher age range  report a greater incidence of the digital divide . 
However, the authors,  based on their research, mention  ways to deal with the digital divide 
that could be applied to contexts where this phenomenon exists : training and technical 
support provision to the a ffected, improvement of access, approach to ICT services 
knowledge, as well as the pro curement  of appropriate hardware and software for 
disadvantaged groups.  
The research: Digital Technologies and Gender  Justice in India , Gurumurthy & Chami  
(2014) mention s that the  2013  International Telecommunication  Union measurement  on 
information society places India in the «least Connected Countries » category, based on the 
composite media of ICT access , technology use skills  and ICT use. Cited  study  defines  less 
connected countries as those in which "... access and use of information and communication 
technologies are limited to basic voice and low -speed data services ”. This study also 
mentions , that in  the Indian context, there is gender gap  in ICT access , data concurs  with 
information other  studies  and authors , who have found that  11.6% of male Indians are 
connected online  while only 8.4% of Indian women  are (Anderson, 2015; World Economic 
Forum , 2013;  Vigneswara, 2013 ), therefore , Intel (2013), appraised a 27% weighted gender 
difference, mean ing females  in India are 27% less likely to have internet access than m en. 
Added to that , researches by  the GSMA Development Fund  and the Cherie Blair Foundation  
have found that only 28% of Indian women have a mobile p hone, compared to 40% of men 
(GSMA, 2010).

In Mexico, Yucatan´s Autonomous University (UADY)  and Yucatan´s state government 
education ministry (SEGEY), supported a study conducted by Dominguez, Canto, Ortega 
and McCalman (2016) study, with teachers from 1 9 high schools, 85% belonging to an urban 
environment (Merida) and 15% to rural settings located in towns such as Umán, Caucel and 
Acanceh. Main results showed teachers belonging to urban educational centers had better 
skills for ICT use, compared with tho se in rural environments. It was also observed that there 
is a digital divide between participants sex, since men registered better ICT use competencies 
in comparison with women.  
Outcomes form  previously reviewed intentional studies (Gurumurthy & Chami, 2014 ; 
Castaño, Martín & Martínez, 2011 ; Atkinson, Black & Curtis, 2008  and Cooper, 2006) and  
those carried out in Maya -speaking contexts of south -eastern  Mexico  (Domínguez, Canto, 
Ortega & McCalman , 2016), coincide this era is characterized by preci pitous changes in 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) which affect the way society  learn s, 
work s and relate s, despite the fact that in developing countries  a growing gap  is emerging , a 
new form of division or exclusion , in which women seem to have disadvantage s facing the 
benefits of technological  evolution  and information society , marginalizing them from 
employment, income and education opportunities of improve ment  in this digital age.  
 
Method  
Rese arch´s methodological development was mixed -type in an applied setting . Design was 
carried out under  an action research  focus , a scientific research method widely nowadays  in 
several countries  as Great Britain, Germany, USA, Spain, Canada, Australia , among others  
(Boggino & Rosekrans, 2007 and Elliot, 2005). This work was part of a larger study aiming  
to reduce the digital divide between  young people and adults ( YP&A) of vulnerable 
communities in southern Yucatan by strengthening their digital  ICT use skills . 
At the research -action  stage a training program me called REBREDIG -PJA was 
implement ed, lasting five  months and integrated by  thirteen  units of competen ce. The se units 
were gradually constructed and presented in complexity order from computer basic 
knowledge  (how to connect, turn on / off, keys knowledge) to possible ICT consequences on 
health (postures, addictions , etcetera ). It was meaningful  the assistance  received from  three 
community advisers belonging to Yucatan´s Adult s Education Institute  (IEAEY) and three  
experts from UADY ´s ICT area during the construction of the  programme.

Community characteristics  
According to Mexico ´s last population census raised  in 2010  by the National Institute of 
Statistics and Geography (INEGI) , Mayapan is one of the one hundred and six municipalities 
of Yucatan . By that time , INEGI  (2010) reported  3,269 inhabitants , representing  0.2% of the 
state´s population , and for every 105 men there were  100 women , population  median age was 
19 years. Finally, for every 100 people at productive age (15 to 64 years) there are 80 at 
dependency age (under 15  or over 64  years ). 
Average number of live births by age group is very vari able in this county;  it ranges from  0.3 
children born alive  in women between 15 and 19 years up to 6.1 for women between 45 and 
49 years.  
Indicators related to ICT in this community are relevant and significant to this study . INEGI 
results show ed that for every 100 homes only one had internet connection, which has serious 
social implications , widening the digital divide. On top of that , only  1.9% of the population 
has a computer, it is reasonable to think that  of every 100 homes scarcely two homes  have a 
computer. Furthermore , just 7.4% have telephone service and 29% mobile telephony.  
Examining population´s educational level, it is noticed that 588 inhabitants  have no 
education, 78.8%  of them  have basic education, 2.4% have higher secondary education and 
only 0.6% (19 people) have higher education . Incidentally , we must not forget  many authors  
(Dominguez, 2015 ; Atkinson, Black & Curtis, 2008 ), have  determ ined the absence of post-
secondary educ ation as one of the main  factors that contribute s to sharpen the digital divide 
phenomenon . 
 
Participants  
This research involved 119 YP&A  from Mayapan , participating in  the second year of the 
project Reduction of the digital divide in vulnerable communities of Yucatan ; 70 women 
(58.8%) and 49 men (41.2%). Partakers’  ages ranged from 13 to 53 years being the average 
age 16 years. 98.5% of  participants 98.5% are Maya -speakers. Table  1 presents  results of 
main variables that best characterize partici pating population :

As shown  above, 67.2% of the participants (80) have middle school  (7th to 9th grade ), 
followed  by 29.4% (35) with elementary level (1st to 6th grade) and only 4% have high school  
level  (10th to 12th grade) . Regard ing marital status, the majority  is single (82.4%), followed 
by married subjects ( 15%) and at last those  who live in consensual union ( 6%). Concerning 
the participants parents ´ education,  mother s (women ) without studies (37) are more than 
fathers ( men) that are only  23. However , analysing  parents academic training , both mothers 
(53%) and fathers  (54.6%)  prime st udy level is elementary . Overall , Table  I show s important 
parents  lack schooling , having women higher rates , in this type of Mayan -speaking 
communities.  
 
Instrument  
Instrument  was constructed by Domínguez, Vázquez, Suaste & Cab (2016),  considering 
demographic and personal data relevant to the study , adopting a Likert -type measurement 
scale with one step and six levels , where  YP&A were asked  to think about the ir competencies 
realization level (CCC), considering an ascending numerical scale from 0 to 5.

Simultaneously, participants were queried to assess if the competence would be important to 
get a job (CICT) and if they would be interested in learning this competence (EIA), as shown 
in Table  2. 
Thirteen  competences composed t he instrument and  gave a dia gnosis on those YP&A  had to 
strengthen. Table  3 presents domains that integrated the instrument, for better underst anding 
purposes, emphasizing  that each assessment was integrated by three sections  (CCC, CICT, 
EIA)  as mentioned previously .

Results  show that , at the training program beginning, men obtained highe r scores  than wom en 
in 11 of the 13 competences. In the Communication s competence women got higher scores 
(x = 2.26) than men (x = 2.24 ). This competence relates  to: sending and receiving SMS 
messages on the cell phone; exchang ing information by email; chat through tools like 
Whatsapp and participate in social networks like Facebook, Instagram , amongst others.  
Women also obtained higher scores  on internet use risks (x = 1.70)  than men (x = 1.66) .

First, population was divided in  five groups , participants belonging to groups one (13 to 21 
years) two  (22 to 30 years) obtained the best scores in their knowledge about the use of 
technology at the beginning of the program.  
At the same time , there is only one compet ence in which all age groups are below  average  
(Copyright knowledge) , related to: identifying copyright within any software , application or 
work, detecting when content is protected by copyright or licenses, knowing the 
consequences of downloading protected digital content from internet (music, movies . 
etcetera ); know ing copyright  and / or creative commons  symbols.  
Finally , results point toward the older the participant, fewer  compet ences  they have for  
technology usage , conduct observed at age group 5  (48 to 53 years), where no ne of the  
compet ences  exceeds the average.

To begin with,  married people and those living on consensual u nion have  lowe r level s of 
digital compet ence when  compared to singles. This situation  could reflect they spend les s 
time on ICT´s due to the re sponsibilit ies they face on daily basis in parallel with bachelors . 
In the same manner  of age, Copyright knowledge is the compet ence with the lowest scores  
in all groups, indicating a generalizable deficiency for the entire population.  
 
Pre-test competence level by study degree  
Figure 3 highlight s results for participant´s study levels . As might be expected , partakers with 
elementa ry and middle school levels are close to the minimum proficiency boundary  (dotted 
line), indicat ing these participators have weaker competences  towards t echnology  use. 
As might be expected , the higher the study level, technological usage and knowledge 
improves, as illustrated in Figure 3, where participants with a high school  diploma , obtained 
scores  above  the average line in the thirteen digital compet ences.

Elements inhibiting digital divide  reduction in Mayan -speaking 
communities  
As part of the methodology used in this work, training program participants were divided in 
two focus groups. Qualitative data analysis and interpretation was formulated using  
ATLAS .ti (version 8) , a tool setting  employed for qualitative analysis of large bodies of 
textual and graphic data from created  hermeneutic unit s (HU). Data analysis process involved 
four stages: data preparation (collection and storage),  initial analysis (open coding), main 
analysis  (indexed system refinement) and results (key concepts, relationships and models). 
During open coding procedure , in the initial analy sis stage, categories and subcategories 
came into sight , as presented in Figure 4  conceptual network.

Some of the most relevant elements inhibiting digital divide reduction integrat ing 
subcategories are the following : 
• Difficult access to internet providers  
• Poor i nfrastructure and facilities  
• Difficulty leaving their homes and participating in program activities  
• Unawareness o n how to work online (platform)  
• Non-Maya -speaking teachers  clarify doubts in Spanish, not Maya  
• Lack of time, due to house  chores and children attention  
• Few inhabited houses with internet access.  
• Security deficiency on ICT  management  
• Technological resources use di strust

Discussion  
Mexico´s official dispositions  on education (National Development Plan 2013 -2018, 
National Digital Strategy, 2013) and for Yucatan  State  (State Development Plan, 2012 -2018 ) 
propose  states and municipalities to outline  and incorporate strategies  to increase educational 
quality in urban and rural areas from elementary  to secondary  level.  
However, despite govern mental guidelines and international recommendations priorit izing a 
more equitable distribution of educational opportunities amongst vulnerable regions and 
social and ethnic groups, with a gender perspective  (OECD, 2017 ; CEPAL, 201 9), reality 
shows there st ill are access, habilitation, academic training  and technology usage and 
management differences between men and women , which increas e opportunities  gap for 
females by not joining knowledge society.  
Literature suggests that digital technology has the potential to create connections, encourage 
learning, raise inclusion levels and even provide lifesaving information. Nevertheless , 
evidence worldwide reports  differences amid  countries, translated to indic ators such as: 
educational level, economic stability, parents s chooling, growth and development; factors 
that collaterally increase cost, coverage, access and digital literacy level barriers of the most 
vulnerable groups imped ing the development of technol ogy use advanced skills.  
An important consideration of this study  is that , notwithstanding  men from  a Maya -speaking 
communit y in Yucatan exhibited better technology use competence levels  in variables such 
as maximum degree of studies, marital status and age. It seems that women , could reach 
better outcomes  by narrowing this gap if they are  promoted more, starting from within their 
famil ies, allow ing them  to access higher education and employ ment levels, breaking cultural 
barriers , as machismo and domination , improving their living conditions. In their own words : 
"We make an effort to be here, in addition to complying with the activities of the program, 
we have to fulfill  with the tasks of our home, which implies being aware of our spouses, taking 
care of our children, and take care of our family."

Conclusion  
Gender digital divide  phenomenon in Yucatan ´s vulnerable Maya -speaking communities  has 
been little studied in Mexico and documented evidence from scientific studies is incipient. 
However,  factors caus ing it, as well as its consequences, are tasks that require  immediate 
attention for southeastern Mexico inhabitant’s  well-being. Access to computer equipment  
and technology and interne t use enablement are some of the  differences that affect  women, 
broadening the inequality gap with men , sidestepping from  knowledge society , as well as  life 
and work increase and improve ment  conditions.  
This article analyze d differences in technology use between men and women of the Maya -
speaking communit y of Mayapan,  Yucat an through a diagnosis administer ed to 119 people 
prior to participating in a training program called: REBREDIG -PJA. Based on results  
examination , it can be concluded that Mayapan  presents a  gender digital divide , since men 
report  better  skills to use and access technology in comparison with women. A deeper 
analysis suggests that , even with the same level of education,  men have better skills for the 
technology use than women do . If participants are grouped by marital status , single men 
demonstrated better skills for technology  use compared to women in the same condition. 
Finally, age impact on digital competences development  is relevant, conclud ing that at a 
younger age, the existing technologies use competence level is higher, consider ing younger 
partakers  age ranges from 1 3 to 15 years old.  
This paper seeks to  initiate a dialogue about the importance of implementing actions t o allow 
digital  inclusion, regardless of gender, ethnicity, social class, physical condition or disabili ty 
type; therefore,  is essential to raise digital  and technological use  qualification in rural 
communities in  south ern Yucatan. As mentioned in State ´s Development Plan (2013 -2018) 
39 out of the 106 municipalities population  (in average)  has not finished elementary school  
(1st to 6st grade).  In literacy terms , Mérida (state capital), presents the lowest percentage , 
while in southern and eastern municipalities , such as Mayapan, Tahdziu and Chemax , have 
percentages higher than 27% of the population.  
This study findings reveal  a pending work agenda for region al post -secondary institutions  
(Yucatan´s Autonomous University, Campeche´s Autonomous University, Quintana Roo ´s 
University , Chiapas´ Autonomous University and Tabasco´s Juarez Autonomous University) 
as well for state government ministries  and agencies in charge of education  and program 
development  to attention vulnerable communities  [Education Secretary of Yucatan State

Government (SEGEY), Education Secretary of Campeche State Government (SEDUC), 
Education Secretary of Quintana Roo (SEQ), Education Secretary of  Chiapas State, 
Education Secretary of Tabasco ], validat ing this studies results by replicating it through the 
National Institute for Adult Education (INEA) and the Nationa l Commission for the 
Development of Indigenous Communities  (INPI) . Finally, this  study contribute s promot ing 
educational innovation projects , which  focus on  life quality improvement  for Yucatecan 
women , from  vulnerable communities , while  strengthen s the state ´s accountability process 
to increase educational excellence .
