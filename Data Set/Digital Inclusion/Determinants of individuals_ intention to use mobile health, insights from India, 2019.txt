Abstract
Purpose –This study aims to examine the determinants of mobile health technology and applications use
intention. The factors are delineated from prior literature and theories of individual traits and adoptioncharacteristics, technology acceptance and health belief.
Design/methodology/approach –Data from 409 respondents were collected from Indian participants
through a questionnaire survey. The construct “use intention ”was measured using individual traits to mobile
services, subjective norm, health consciousness, awarenes s and perceived usefulness, and the model was tested.
Findings –The study found that mobile health technology and the applications awareness and personal
innovativeness in ﬂuence intention to use.
Originality/value –Previous studies have often looked at technology adoption and acceptance models
separately and are less adequately discussed in the Indian context. The components that determine mobilehealth technology and the applications ’acceptance by literature and theories of individual traits and adoption
characteristics, technology acceptance and health beliefs were also inadequately discussed. The signi ﬁcant
contribution of this research also includes policy recommendations for improving mobile health acceptance inIndia.

1. Introduction
Mobile health (mHealth) is considered to be the backbone of electronic health, wherein mobile
devices are used for managing and communicating health and disease conditions ( Vital
Wave Consulting, 2009 ;Cipresso et al.,2 0 1 2 ). It can be de ﬁned as “the use of transportation
systems such as mobile medical units or vans and/or mobile phone/ICT for providing health
services to the people living in a particular locality or self-care ”(Pai and Alathur, 2019 ). The
reason behind the development of mHealth devices can be because of three main reasons:
(1) access to internet and Wi-Fi services, availability of smartphones and
improvements in the mobile supporting systems ( Choet al., 2014 );
(2) imbalance between the number of population and availability of healthcare
facilities ( Gibson et al., 2014 ); and
(3) increase in out-of-pocket expenditure of an individual ( Wagner, 2014 ).
For instance, India has a wireless telephone subscriber base of 668.44 and 499.00 million in
the rural and urban regions, respectively, and India is considered as the largest mobileTG

healthcare sector is also suffering owing to the lack of infrastructure, access and qualitywhich acts as a barrier for achieving universal health coverage and delivering qualityhealthcare services according to the national health policy 2017 ( Sharma, 2019 ). As a
consequence, healthcare solution providers and professionals are trying to bring mobiledevices into healthcare ( PwC, 2017 ) to reduce patients ’time and cost.
Many research studies have been carried out in this domain and across the regions of
India. Along the patients ’use-phases, the study included the development of speci ﬁc
mHealth applications or features for creating awareness (AWR) about health and diseases(
Parthaje et al.,2 0 1 6 ;DeSouza et al.,2 0 1 4 ), interventions ( Shet et al., 2010 ;Singh et al.,2 0 1 8 ;
Bali and Singh, 2007 ;Praveen et al. ,2 0 1 4 ) and reminders ( Venkat, 2016 ;NHRM, 2019 ),
diagnosis ( Salve et al.,2 0 1 2 ;Rangaswamy Thara, 2013 ;Bhargava et al.,2 0 1 8 ) and treatment
(Shet et al., 2014 ;Chandra et al., 2018 ). This would help healthcare professionals in providing
healthcare access and continuous monitoring services to the people living in the lowresource setting areas. Although there has been a notable increase in the availability ofmHealth applications in the application stores, its value can only be realized if an individualembraces it as the desired system for managing health and its services.
For years, various authors have worked on the determinants of information system
usage by incorporating either the technology acceptance model (TAM) ( Davis, 1989 ) or the
health belief model (HBM) ( Janz and Becker, 1984 ) in the system of banking ( Safeena et al.,
2018), hospitals ( Ebrahimi et al. ,2 0 1 8 ), learning ( Cidral et al. ,2 0 1 8 ), payments ( Liébana-
Cabanillas et al. ,2 0 1 8 ) and bookings ( Jeon et al. , 2018 ). However, the integration of these
models is found to be inadequate in the Indian context. Moreover, Shareef et al. (2016)
pointed out that the issues related to technological, behavioral and cognitive beliefs shouldbe considered for improving the mHealth service quality and ef ﬁciency.
In the domain of information systems, Luet al. (2005) indicated that the issues of pre-
adoption have primarily been explored and remained critical concerning its research. Thisalso becomes important for mHealth system adoption. Mobile health technologies andapplications in India are in the initial phase of implementation and require a properframework for its governance. Currently, the association between mobile phones andhealthcare is mostly “indirect ”. This means that individuals use basic mobile phone features
such as calling and messaging apps, internet browsers, mobile cameras, email apps, video-sharing apps, social networking apps and internet radio apps for health communication andservice delivery ( WHO, 2011 ). When it comes to “direct ”type, the health applications are
directly downloaded from play stores for managing wellness and health conditionmanagement ( Aitken and Lyle, 2015 ). Its utility is found to be less among Indian people
because of lack of con ﬁdence and support toward its use, which means that the desired
adoption is not achieved. On a global scale, the mHealth market of USA was valued at US$8,057.6 m in 2018, whereas its market in India is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 42.7 percent ( Global Market Insights, 2019 ). Thus, it becomes essential to study the pre-adoption
criteria of mHealth technology and applications ’adoption for market development.
The major objectives of this research is to theoretically understand the antecedents of
mHealth technology and applications ’early adoption and address the following research
questions.
RQ1. To what extent do individual traits and product/service adoption characteristics
impact mHealth technology and application awareness?Intention to

307RQ2. To what extent do individual cognitive factors, subjective norm (SN) and
perceived usefulness (PU) impact the intention to use (ITU) mHealth technologyand application?
RQ3. Whether there is a direct positive relationship between individual traits, product/
service adoption characteristics, individual cognitive factors, SN, PU, and ITUmHealth technology and application for health?
With this questions, the study investigates:
/C15the extent to which individual characteristics/traits promotes AWR about mHealth
technology and applications;
/C15the extent to which individual perception about mHealth technology and applicationis attributed owing to their willingness to try for the services;
/C15the extent to which individual perception about mHealth technology andapplication is attributed owing to the s upport from peers, family, and important
people (SN);
/C15whether internalization of SN and health consciousness (HC) has any effect on ITU;and
/C15whether AWR and PU has any power over the ITU mHealth applications and
technology, as established by prior literature.
This research paper is structured into seven sections: Section 2 discusses the theoretical
background and the development of the hypothesis. The methodology used is discussed inSection 3, followed by results and data analysis in Section 4. Section 5 presents a discussiononﬁnding, followed by the study implications in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes and
highlights study limitations and future research.
2. Theoretical background and hypothesis development
This study intends to examine the determinants of mHealth technology, and applications ’
use intention. In that direction the following theories are used.
The individual characteristics that focus on individuals ’intrinsic motivation and their
willingness to try for new technology services are considered to be essential for technologyadoption (
Chen et al. ,2 0 1 4 ;Raiet al., 2013 ). The variable “awareness ”is considered to be
vital in technology adoption ( Al-Somali et al.,2 0 0 9 ). It was identi ﬁed that lack of AWR about
internet banking has resulted in reluctance, leading to low adoption ( Sathye, 1999 ). The
HBM is a behavior change model for predicting health-related behaviors and mainly healthservices acceptance ( Janz and Becker, 1984 ;Rosenstock et al.,1 9 8 8 ). It was later integrated
with the TAM model to study health-related internet use ( Ahadzadeh et al.,2 0 1 5 ). TAM was
proposed by Davis (1989) to study acceptance of technology with PU as a major variable. It
was upgraded to TAM2 ( Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ) and TAM3 ( Venkatesh and Bala,
2008) by considering e-commerce sectors.
Although there exist numerous individual cognitive factors and behaviors which
inﬂuence the ITU, this study has considered factors ( Table I ) for measuring it. These factors
are considered based on perceived pressures and functionalities to use mHealth technologyand applications.
First, as people in the present generation are health-conscious and use various
information systems for seeking health information, the use of mHealth technology and
applications would assist them in providing self-care ( Choet al.,2 0 1 4 ). Thus, HC in ﬂuences
people to develop a positive attitude toward the ITU mHealth technology and applications.TG

308Second, when social forces act, individuals tend to take the opportunity of accepting or
rejecting a new system ( Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ). This implies that SN in ﬂuences PU and
ITU. Third, as digitalization has an in ﬂuence on peoples ’lifestyles, the use of mobile phones
and its applications plays an essential role in assisting them toward their daily work. It wassaid that people with high innovative capability often try to ﬁnd out information online to
cope with uncertainties, leading to positive intentions toward acceptance ( Rogers, 1983 ).
Therefore, personal innovativeness (PI) is inherently related to mHealth technology andapplications ’use intentions.
Fourth, owing to people-centric nature, the acceptance of mHealth technology and
applications is associated with intrinsic motivation and their cognitive assessments ( Chen
et al.,2 0 1 4 ). So, the study considered mobile service –enabled empowerment for measuring
ITU. Fifth, as aforementioned, people tend to use mHealth technology and applications ifthey believe it to be useful, implying that PU positively in ﬂuences ITU ( Wahyuni and
Nurbojatmiko, 2017 ). Finally, to start using mHealth technology and applications, it is vital
for people to be aware of the service bene ﬁts (Mols et al.,1 9 9 9 ) and should have access to
utilize it ( Sathye, 1999 ), signifying that AWR in ﬂuences ITU or acceptance. Based on this
reasoning, we have identi ﬁed factors related to individual cognition and behaviors to test
the hypothesis formulated for measuring ITU. Section 2.1 provides a description of thesefactors and their hypotheses.
2.1 Mobile service enabled empowerment
Mobile service –enabled empowerment (MSEE) refers to individuals ’intrinsic motivation
toward mobile services ( Spreitzer, 1995 ). It is said that intrinsic motivation of an individual
has an in ﬂuence on innovative behavior and provides autonomy to solve problems which
they are facing ( Redmond et al.,1 9 9 3 ;Çakar and Ertürk, 2010 ;Chen et al.,2 0 1 4 ). People who
are empowered may likely develop innovative actions to solve problems and achieve theirneeds ( Chen et al. ,2 0 1 4 ). Moreover, prior literature has identi ﬁed the existence of
relationship between MSEE and PI toward mobile services. Hence, the following hypothesishas been formulated.Table I.

309H1a. Mobile service –enabled empowerment has a direct positive impact on awareness
(AWR) of mHealth technology and application.
H1b. Mobile service –enabled empowerment has a direct positive impact on personal
innovativeness toward mobile services.
2.2 Personal innovativeness
PI refers to the willingness of an individual toward new mobile technology services
(Agarwal and Prasad, 1998 ). It acts as an important construct in studying individual
behavior toward innovation diffusion ( Rogers, 1983 ) and marketing research ( Flynn and
Goldsmith, 1993 ). People with high innovative capabilities are likely to be aware ( Lyons and
Henderson, 2005 ) and act as information seekers about new products and services
happening in their domain ( Luet al. ,2 0 0 5 ). They tend to manage themselves during
uncertainties and develop positive intentions toward acceptance ( Rogers, 1983 ). PI is
associated with AWR about the technology and its services for mHealth services ( Raiet al.,
2013;Chen et al.,2 0 1 4 ). It also in ﬂuences PU, which ultimately may lead to acceptance. For
example, the World Wide Web ( Agarwal and Karahanna, 2000 ), wireless internet services
over mobile technology ( Parveen and Sulaiman, 2008 ;Luet al., 2005 ), etc. In this study, we
expect there would be positive association between PI, AWR, PU and ITU mHealth
technology and applications. Thus, the hypotheses are proposed as:
H2a. Personal innovativeness has a direct positive impact on awareness of mHealth
technology and application.
H2b. Personal innovativeness has a direct positive impact on the perceived usefulness
of mHealth technology and application.
H2c. Personal innovativeness has a direct positive impact on the intention to use
mHealth technology and application.
2.3 Subjective norm
SN is the “perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior ”(Ajzen, 1988 ).
In other words, it can be said that, owing to external pressure from relatives, peers and
friends, people may opt for a particular behavior even if that behavior is not positive. Prior
literature suggests that SN positively in ﬂuences PU ( Ajzen, 1988 ;Teo, 2009 ;Weiz et al. ,
2016) and ITU ( Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975 ;Raza et al. ,2 0 1 7 ) technology and services
(Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ). Hence, the following hypotheses has been proposed:
H3a. Subjective norm has a direct positive impact on ITU mHealth technology and
application.
H3b. Subjective norm has a direct positive impact on the perceived usefulness of
mHealth technology and application.
2.4 Health consciousness
HC refers to individuals ’consiousness toward his/her own health ( Dutta-Bergman, 2004 ;
Basu and Dutta, 2008 ). It is believed that people who are highly health-conscious try to
exercise, practice yoga and follow a diet every day or on a regular basis to keep them ﬁt. At
the same time, they improve their knowledge related to health, disease and food habits fromTG
13,3/4
310various sources ( Dutta-Bergman, 2004 ;Ahadzadeh et al. ,2 0 1 5 ). Moreover, previous
literature also indicated that HC in ﬂuences PU ( Wahyuni and Nurbojatmiko, 2017 ;
Ahadzadeh et al.,2 0 1 5 ). Therefore, the hypothesis is formulated as:
H4. Health consciousness has a direct positive impact on the perceived usefulness of
mHealth technology and application.
2.5 Awareness
AWR about mHealth technology and applications is a new experience to many individuals.
An individual with a high level of AWR is bound to adopt these services for managing
health and diseases, i.e. more the level of AWR, more the impact on PI and PU ( Asif et al.,
2018). It was identi ﬁed that there exists a lack of AWR among the medical and engineering
students about mHealth applications and its practices for speci ﬁc health areas ( Parthaje
et al.,2 0 1 6 ). Prior literature has also found that people are aware and use mobile technology
for health but are unaware about its applications ( Ehteshami et al.,2 0 1 3 ;Zayapragassarazan
and Kumar, 2016 ;Pai and Alathur, 2019 ). Therefore, the lack of AWR about the bene ﬁts,
advantages and disadvantages acts as a barrier to the acceptance of mHealth technology
and applications. Thus, we propose our hypotheses as:
H5a. Awareness has a direct positive impact on the perceived usefulness of mHealth
technology and application.
H5b. Awareness has a direct positive impact on the intention to use mHealth technology
and application.
2.6 Perceived usefulness
PU refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would
enhance hihe/sher job performance ”(Davis, 1989 ).Wong et al. (2014) also state it “as the
belief about using the technology that would bring bene ﬁts to the user. ”More speci ﬁcally, if
people believe that using a certain technology will help them in improving job performance,then there is a high possibility of accepting it for their daily operations. As identi ﬁed in the
literature, this construct has a positive in ﬂuence on the acceptance of products and services.
We expect that to be true even for mHealth technology and applications. Therefore,accordingly, the study hypothesis is formulated as:
H6. Perceived usefulness has a direct positive impact on intention to use technology and
application.
2.7 Research model
The study model presented in Figure 1 consisted of components related to TAM (SN, PU
and ITU), HBM (HC) and individual traits (MSEE and PI) to mobile services.
The study model emphasizes on the determinants of mobile health technology, and
applications ’use intention.
3. Methodology
The methodology adopted in this research is empirical based on the primary data collected
through structured questionnaires for testing research hypothesis.Intention to
use mobile
health
3113.1 Pre-testing of questionnaire
Study variables were identi ﬁed from the literature review. The questionnaire was in English
language and pre-tested of ﬂine with a medical practitioners, two management professors
and three students. Their suggestions pertaining to the component and structure weretaken, and modi ﬁcations have been done accordingly.
3.2 Sample size
The sample size is calculated based on the number of mobile phone users or owners. In
India, the total number of mobile phones users are 650 million (
Iyengar, 2017 ). Thus, Slovin ’s
formula ( Altares et al.,2 0 0 3 ) is used to calculate the sample size, as the total population is
large, and there is no idea about its behavior. Hence the minimum samples for this studywas 399.99, which was rounded off to 400. But, this study considered a total sample size of409 responses taken from both online and of ﬂine channels.
3.3 Study population
The proposed research model was tested using a structured questionnaire from a random
sample of mobile phone and internet users. Hence, the mobile phone and the internet userslocated in India represent the study population that included students, academicians,working professionals and other general population. Because the dependent variable is theITU, the respondents can be non-users, one-time users or continual users (
Chatzoglou et al.,
2015) of mobile health technology and applications.
3.4 Data collection
For achieving the national representation, the questionnaire was distributed in the urban
locations of Bangalore, Vadodara, New Delhi and Kolkata through personal contacts. Therespondents were identi ﬁed according to the age distribution from the census data of 2011.
The data was also collected by posting the questionnaire link (prepared using Google docs)in the individuals ’message box of mHealth applications ’pages available on social media (i.e.
Twitter and Facebook). The participants were explicitly informed about the importance ofthe responses and the future use of the data for academic purpose. Overall, 409 responsesFigure 1.

TG
13,3/4
312out of 512 were valid and considered for this study. The survey was carried out between
December 2017 and May 2018, and the average time was calculated to be 15 min.
3.5 Participants ’demographics
The respondents ’demographic details are provided in Table II . It was identi ﬁed that gender-
wise the sample was balanced, with a higher number of male respondents than female, andage-wise it is skewed between the age groups of 18-25 and 26-35.
The study also revealed that over 268 (65.52 per cent) of the respondents had used basic
mobile phones features (indirect type) for seeking health information from online sources.For the multiple-choice question, respondents have largely indicated that, they have usedsocial networking apps (128 [31.29 per cent]), video-sharing apps (74 [18.09 per cent]) andinternet browsers (214 [52.32 per cent]) for cold and fever, obesity, stress, mental health andtoothache problems.
3.6 Survey instruments
The items in the questionnaire were largely constructed as ﬁve-point Likert-type scales
(
Table AI ). However, at some places, open answer –type questions were also used for seeking
respondents ’perceptions and opinions about mHealth applications.
The items for the construct mobile service enabled empowerment was measured using
ﬁve items of Spreitzer (1995) . These instruments have been accepted and used in mobile
banking and health service research of Donner and Tellez (2008) andChen et al. (2014) . Items
forPIwere measured with ﬁve items adapted from the literature of Agarwal and Prasad
(1998) andRaiet al. (2013) and modi ﬁed slightly to ﬁt the study context. The construct HC
was measured using ﬁve items of the Dutta-Bergman (2004) scale. Items for SNandPUhave
been taken from the literature of Huet al. (2003) andDavis (1989) and suggested changes
incorporated. The construct AWR was measured using four items of Sathye (1999) and that
of ITU consisted of two items taken from Bhattacherjee (2001) . These items are grouped as
indicated by Venkatesh and Davis (1996) such that it ensures a logical ﬂow of ideas between
the items.

3134. Data analysis and results
The analysis of the data was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Science v16 and
AMOS 22. The results have been presented in the following sections.
4.1 Pilot study
For conducting the pilot study, a revised questionnaire was sent to 123 respondents, both
online and of ﬂine. The unidimensionality of the construct was measured by performing
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using maximum likelihood extraction and Promax
rotation method. For an initial eigenvalue greater than 1, seven variables have beenextracted with Kaiser —Meyer –Olkin (KMO) value and was found to be 0.738, which is
above the acceptable value of 0.5 (
Malhotra and Dash, 2011 ). The internal consistency of the
proposed construct was measured using reliability analysis through Cronbach ’s alpha and
found that the values are within the acceptable range of 0.7, indicating acceptance
(Nunnally, 1978 ).
4.2 Main study
The main study includes the analysis performed using a two-step method ( Anderson and
Gerbing, 1988 ). As a ﬁrst step, con ﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the
measurement model to ensure that the items stated for each measure represent the same
construct. In the second step, the structural model was analyzed for examining hypothesized
causal paths. This helps us in inferring that the proposed conceptual model designates a
satisfactory ﬁt with the data.
A normality test was performed as suggested by Luet al. (2005) to ensure data suitability
for predetermining statistical analysis. From the data analysis, we observed fairly normal
distributions for the items in terms of skewness and tolerable value (i.e. from benign to 1.0)
in the case of kurtosis, as it is within the accepted value suggested by Kline (2011) . The EFA
was also carried out using maximum likelihood extraction and Promax rotation method.
The results of the analysis found that all the seven variables have been extracted, and the
KMO test value was 0.777, which is acceptable. The results indicate all the items present in aparticular component correlate and represent their corresponding component. The reliability
analysis was calculated and it was found to be more than 0.7, indicating the acceptance of
study items ( Nunnally, 1978 ).
4.3 Measurement model
The con ﬁrmatory measurement model was tested for model ﬁt, convergent and
discriminant validity ( Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ). The model ﬁt was assessed as suggested
byLuet al. (2005) . Because the sample size is more than 300 (considered big) and marks
oversensitivity, the resulting chi-square test value and its corresponding p-value can be
ignored ( Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993 ). The other values i.e. x2/df = 2.279, normed ﬁt index
(NFI) = 0.901, Tucker –Lewis index (TLI) = 0.923, comparative ﬁt index (CFI) = 0.941, root
mean square residual (RMSR) = 0.0457, root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) = 0.056 are found within the accepted value and suggest a good ﬁt(Hu and
Bentler, 1999 ;Hair et al., 2010 ).
4.4 Convergent validity
It is proved that, when the items of a construct that are theoretically related, they are
actually related ( Leeet al. ,2 0 0 6 ). The convergent validity is measured using the factor
loading and its corresponding p-values. From this study, it was identi ﬁed that all the items ’TG
13,3/4
314factor loading is above the cutoff value of 0.5, indicating the acceptability of construct
validity ( Kline, 1998 ). The composite reliability (CR) is calculated and it was found that the
value is greater than 0.7, indicating adequate reliability ( Table III ).
The average variance extracted (AVE) is the variance of the construct to that of the
variance due to measurement error. In this study, the AVE values for all the constructs aregreater than 0.5, except for PU, i.e. 0.482, indicating acceptance, as its composite reliability isgreater than 0.6 (
Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ). Hence, constructs ’convergent validity was
achieved.
Table III presents the values for reliability, validity and factor correlational matrix with
the square root of the AVE on the diagonal.
4.5 Discriminant validity
Discriminant validity is proved when the constructs ’correlation values are not excessively
high (greater than 0.85) or excessively low (lesser than 0.10) ( Luet al. , 2005 ). It is also
achieved as the diagonal values are greater than the off-diagonal values ( Hair et al.,2 0 1 0 ).
This indicates that the components are not related with each other ( Table III ).
The proposed model is also tested for multicollinearity issues to observe that the data are
highly intercorrelated with the independent variables. It was tested for the dependentvariable “ITU”against MSEE, PI, SN, HC, PU and AWR as an independent. The result
found that the values for each of the variables are less than 3.3, indicating that the model isfree from multicollinearity issues (
Kock and Lynn, 2012 ).
4.6 Structural model
In this case, the relations between the constructs were tested. Here, the model ﬁt indices were
also measured and found to have an acceptable ﬁt with x2/df = 2.287, NFI = 0.895, TLI =
0.922, CFI = 0.937, RMSR = 0.0523, RMSEA = 0.056 ( Hair et al.,2 0 1 0 ;Hu and Bentler, 1999 ).
Figure 2 depicts the results obtained from the path analysis. The values inserted on each
individual paths represent the estimate of standardized regression weight. To measure thetotal amount of variance in the “ITU”that is explained by the “AWR, PI, SN, HC and PU ”,
squared multiple correlation values is calculated (
Figure 2 ).
From Figure 2 , we can observe that MSEE and PI together contribute to 10.6 per cent of
the variance in AWR. PI, SN and HC collectively explained 29 per cent of the variance in PU.Finally, 13.6 per cent of the variance in the ITU mHealth technology and applications isexplained by AWR, PU, SN and PI.

3155. Discussions
The model proposed in this study was supported by data chosen from the total population.
The results of the path signi ﬁcance test ( Table IV ) indicate that MSEE had a signi ﬁcant
positive in ﬂuence on AWR. Moreover, for the sample chosen, the determinants PI, SN and
AWR had a signi ﬁcant positive in ﬂuence on PU. Finally,the determinants PI !AWR also
had a signi ﬁcant positive in ﬂuence on ITU. The remaining paths, PI !AWR, SN !ITU,
HC!PU and PU !ITU were found to be statistically insigni ﬁcant, and hence, the
corresponding hypotheses were rejected.
The path analysis results between MSEE and AWR ( H1a) and MSEE and PI ( H1b)i s
consistent with prior research ﬁndings ( Chen et al. ,2 0 1 4 ), and these indicate that MSEE
has a direct positive relationship on AWR and PI toward mobile services. This resultsigniﬁes that empowered people are likely to be aware and ﬁnd it meaningful to use mobile
phones for healthcare service delivery as it would help them in managing problems
independently by maintaining their anonymity and privacy. The direct effects of PI andFigure 2.

316AWR ( H2a) are found to be insigni ﬁcant, but PI and PU ( H2b) and PI and ITU ( H2c) are
signiﬁcant at p<0.001. This indicates that PI does not drive individuals toward AWR but
consider it to be useful and may use it in managing health often or in the near future. Thisunexpected result obtained through this study stipulates that, even though people take achance to explore various mobile applications, they often ﬁnd dif ﬁculty in identifying the
information about mobile health applications or the bene ﬁts of using it. They feel that
mobile technology and applications are important for banking and for other day-to-dayactivities but they are reluctant or hesitant to use it for health-seeking and communication.This can be because of the lack of electronic health literacy, trust and training from health
professionals.
The study also ﬁnds that SN and ITU ( H3a) are found to be insigni ﬁcant,
conﬁrming the research works of Venkatesh et al. (2003) ,Chismar and Wiley-Patton
(2003) and Suki and Suki (2017) , concluding that SN has minimal in ﬂuence on use
intentions and seems to work on perceptions rather than intentions when its use is not
mandatory ( Luet al. ,2 0 0 5 ). Simultaneously, the results of SN and PU ( H3b)a r ef o u n d
to be signi ﬁcant, indicating that people durin g unavoidable circumstances may
suggest their important ones to improv e the use perception, accomplishing and
enhancing the quality of health-related tas ks and goals. Similar studies have also been
found in support of this result ( Kim and Park, 2012 ;Karahanna and Straub, 1999 ;
Beldad and Hegner, 2018 ).
The relationship between HC and PU ( H4) is found to be insigni ﬁcant and is consistent
with the work of Beldad and Hegner (2018) . Even health-conscious people believe that its use
may help them in managing their health easily but owing to their food habits and prevalenceof various diseases, it make them anxious, thereby allowing them to visit healthcare
professionals personally rather than through mobile phones. This ﬁnding failed to con ﬁrm
the results of previous research by Kim and Park (2012) andChen and Lin (2018) .
The study ﬁnds that the relationships between the variables AWR and PU ( H5a) and
AWR and ITU ( H5b) are found to be signi ﬁcant at p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively. This
result is in line with the earlier works of Hanaﬁzadeh and Khedmatgozar (2012) andAl-
Somali et al. (2009) and indicates that AWR enhances an individual ’s mHealth technology
and applications ’use intention.
Interestingly, the study identi ﬁes that the direct effects of PU and ITU ( H6) are
insigni ﬁcant and are in line with the work of Bidmon et al. (2014) . This result signi ﬁes that
when it comes to use intention of mHealth technology and applications, the doctor ’s
recommendation plays an important role rather than PU. This is because of the fact that
digital solutions which are recommended by professionals are preferably developed
according to their requirement and the chances of getting unrealistic or error results will beless. Hence, it can be concluded that higher the recommendations, more the propensity of anindividual to use it for healthcare services.
6. Study implications
The results also have important implications for theory and practice.
6.1 Theoretical implications
The current study uses multiple theoretical models to identify the variables for measuringITU mHealth technology and applications. As indicated by the researchers, the use ofmultiple theoretical models forms a robust framework that integrates theoretical effortssupported from multiple subjects (
Edmondson and McManus, 2007 ;Alathur et al.,2 0 1 4 ). In
the conceptualization of this model, the variables, namely health consciousness ( Dutta-Intention to
use mobile
health
317Bergman, 2004 ;Choet al. ,2 0 1 4 ), subjective norm ( Ajzen, 1988 ), perceived usefulness ( Hu
et al. , 2003 ;Davis, 1989 ), awareness ( Sathye, 1999 ), intention to use ( Bhattacherjee, 2001 ;
Wahyuni and Nurbojatmiko, 2017 ), mobile service –enabled empowerment ( Spreitzer, 1995 ;
Chen et al., 2014 ) and personal innovativeness ( Agarwal and Prasad, 1998 ;Raiet al.,2 0 1 3 ),
are incorporated for making it complete according to the present situation. The descriptionof these variables is explained in the previous sections. Thus, by considering the relevantvariables, the conceptual model so formed is theorized as it appears in the present contextand among Indian citizens.
6.2 Implications for practiceThe study ﬁndings have some implications for government, healthcare organizations and
software developers.
6.2.1 Government. The adoption of mHealth technology and applications plays an
important role for the doctors and patients in streamlining healthcare processes to achieve
the desired goal of universal health coverage. By identifying various factors in ﬂuencing
mHealth application and technology adoption, healthcare professionals and otherstakeholders can easily understand the ground reality and its working so that speci ﬁc
targets and action plans can be devised accordingly. For instance, as aforementioned, lack ofAWR could be a possible reason for its low adoption. In such cases,
Dietsche ’s (2014)
concept of governance is recommended. This model considers various perceptions forachieving good governance through the dimensions of results, processes, rules or the abilityto steer ( Dietsche, 2014 ).
The Government of India has aligned its national development goals to that of
sustainable development goals with an agenda “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, ”i.e.
“collective effort, inclusive growth ”(United Nations, 2017 ). For this, they have
brought in various ambitious programs such as Aadhaar (biometric identity system),national health portal and mobile telephony as support for Digital India ( D’Monte,
2016 ). Information and communication tech nology at its forefront acts as a key
enabler for connecting people acros s federal systems of governance and
sustainability. With smartph ones and its applications, the lifestyle of an individual
has changed, and the information or se rvices which were earlier inaccessible or
requiring greater time and effort have b een made available w ithin a few phases.
Likewise, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, National Health Rural Mission,etc. are in an initial phase of implementing mo bile devices for controlling mortality,
preventing tuberculosis and other comm unicable and non-communicable diseases in
the near future. Thus, mHealth technology and applications ’adoption are seen to be in
the initial phase of impl ementation which require a proper framework for its
governance.
6.2.2 Healthcare organizations. This study highlights some of the important ﬁndings
which healthcare organization and other stakeholders have to consider while implementingmHealth technology and applications for healthcare. Although the study identi ﬁed potential
adopters, it can be applied to any smartphone user wherein people have used their mobile
devices for seeking and communicating information over the internet (indirect) or throughhealth applications (direct). It was revealed that people had used mobile phones through anindirect type of applications (such as social networking apps, video-sharing apps andinternet browsers) for cold and fever, obesity, stress and mental health and toothache ratherthan the direct type of health applications. Thus, mHealth technology and applications canbe effective with the help of doctors and other physicians ’recommendations promotions
during physical visits and through social media platforms. In addition, proper training andTG
13,3/4
318supporting mechanism across the patients ’use-phases would also help individuals
and practitioners monitor their health status oneself, thereby in ﬂuencing its usefulness and
actual system use.
6.2.3 Software developers. Speciﬁcally, for technology entrepreneurs and software
developers, the study ﬁndings indicate that individual characteristics toward mobile
services and SNs should be given greater importance to attract more people toward mHealth
technology and applications. The study also revealed that mHealth technology and
applications should also include gami ﬁcation, visual displays, easy demonstrations and
reward systems to enhance individual users to try it for managing health and servicedelivery. They should also work closely with healthcare professionals and the end-users intheir need identi ﬁcation and feedback mechanism for updating the features and components
regularly. At the same time, they should also promote mHealth applications and technologythrough social media, conferences and summits and practical demonstrations in educationalinstitutions, etc.
7. Conclusions
This study intends to examine the determ inants of mobile health technology and
applications ’use intention. From the data analysis, it was identi ﬁed that PI and AWR
are important variables that contribute to mobile health technology and applicationsuse intention. Further, it was also identi ﬁed that the opinion of people who they
consider to be important are less likely to be appreciated when it comes to health. This
means that people may consider it as optional and work more with perception thanintention.
This research has some important contributions. This study includes citizens ’
perspectives about mobile health technology and applications. It uses multiple theoreticalmodels, and the variables are delineated from individual traits, adoption characteristics ofnew product or service, individual cognitive factors and health-related use behavior from theview of technology. Thus, the model formed is theorized as it appears in the present contextand among Indian citizens. The study would be helpful for the decision-makers in gettingsome bene ﬁt by considering the study variables into practice.
7.1 Limitations and future research
This research has certain limitations. The study had collected responses from four locations
(speci ﬁcally urban), and as India is a land with varieties of culture, traditions and customs,
its in ﬂuence on the adoption of mHealth technology and applications has not been
considered for this study. This might have provided a narrow scope, and generalization maynot represent the intention of the entire population toward mHealth technology andapplications use. Hence, this research in the future can be extended by including samplesfrom other states of India to study the signi ﬁcance of these factors on adoption. The
majority of the respondents in this study have bachelor ’s (52.32 per cent) or master ’s degrees
(34.47 per cent). These constraints might also have dif ﬁculties in generalizing the ﬁndings
across the level of citizens in India.
In the research model, the r
2values for PI, SN, AWR and HC together explain only 29 per
cent of the variance in the PU, while those of AWR, SN, personal innovativeness and PU are13.6 per cent. So, an effort should be made to consider other variables such as perceived easeof use, health severity and susceptibility, electronic health literacy and trust for measuring
the signi ﬁcance and variance in the use intention.Intention to
