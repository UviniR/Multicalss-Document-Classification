media around the world   #mediadevbut what started as a way to improve the user experience came with \\na downside for website viewers: it entailed collecting and processing \\ntheir personal information, often without their knowledge or consent. \\nmoreover, the drive to collect data has resulted in many independent \\nmedia outlets in the global south unknowingly permitting third parties, \\nmany of which cannot be identified, to invasively monitor their visitors.\\nworldwide, citizens and policymakers are increasingly cognizant of \\nthe risks that the burgeoning data economy poses to personal privacy. \\nin recent years, a wave of next-generation data protection laws have \\nemerged that seek to restrict the collection, usage, and sharing of \\npersonal information. this is not necessarily a good news story for \\nthose news institutions that had successfully harnessed the value of \\nanalytics to grow advertising revenue or to better understand their \\naudiences. these data protection regulations have, by design, severely \\nhampered the environment within which many smaller digital media \\noutlets operate. while these laws do not entirely restrict the use of \\nanalytics, they do restrict the use of analytic applications that place \\npeople at risk of harm. indeed, there is growing evidence that some of \\nthe tracking mechanisms employed by digital news sites are potentially \\ndoing just that.\\nt o get a better understanding of how new privacy regimes will affect \\nmedia in the global south, this paper assembles a new set of findings \\non the websites of 50 small, independent news publishers from 10 \\ndeveloping countries. it shows that third-party trackers are collecting \\naudience data when people read articles, write comments, send in news \\ntips, and share pieces on social networking platforms. one independent \\npublisher in nigeria, for instance, had 523 third-party cookies on its \\nhomepage collecting audience information. in total, over 150 companies—\\nnot all of which could be identified—were found to be invisibly tracking the \\nvisitors to these 50 websites. they were collecting ip addresses, which \\ncan identify geographic locations, the titles and urls of news articles \\nread, search queries, and other data. once collected, this information introduction\\nfor years, the road to news media financial sustainability was said to be \\npaved with data—digital news outlets were counseled to collect as many \\ndetails about their readers as possible. tracking audiences was considered \\nessential for optimizing search engine results, creating content that people want \\nto read, and supporting targeted advertising to fund journalism. \\nworldwide, citizens and \\npolicymakers are increasingly \\ncognizant of the risks that \\nthe burgeoning data economy \\nposes to personal privacy. 2 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgcould be sold to advertisers or further exchanged with other third parties. \\nit could even reach the hands of governments. \\nfrom a media development perspective, the failure of media outlets \\nto protect their visitors against invasive tracking by third parties is \\ntroubling for two reasons. first and most importantly, it places the \\nprivacy and safety of a publication’s readers in jeopardy. readers need \\nto feel confident that visiting independent news sites, especially those \\ncovering sensitive issues, will not put them in danger. second, from a \\nbusiness perspective, when publishers give away information about \\ntheir audiences for free, they cede valuable leverage for negotiating with \\nadvertisers. in essence, the outsourcing of analytics to third parties \\npotentially puts readers at risk and weakens a site’s ability to truly take \\nadvantage of the interactions it has with its readers. taken together, the \\nfindings of this study suggest an important new frontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and the need to build stronger awareness \\nabout and strategies for managing the threats posed by tracking the \\nreaders of independent media. \\nthis report also provides an overview of the latest regulatory \\ndevelopments in the data protection field, such as the european \\nunion’s general data protection regulation (gdpr). while much of the \\npublic debate has been about policy changes in europe, the impact \\nhas been much broader in geographic scope. the changes underway \\ndirectly impact independent news outlets in many developing countries. \\nthis review of new laws is followed by a detailed description of the \\nvarious trackers currently used on news websites, and the ways that \\nthey potentially come into conflict with new data protection laws \\nand regulations. then, the report analyzes research on web tracking \\ntechnologies used by news media websites in 10 developing countries, \\nexposing pervasive tracking that ultimately may not benefit either \\nthe readers or the news organizations themselves. and finally, it \\nconcludes with suggestions about how news organizations and other \\nmedia development stakeholders might be able to take advantage of \\nthe global shift in data protection laws and regulations to strengthen \\nindependent media. the findings of this study \\nsuggest an important new \\nfrontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and \\nthe need to build stronger \\nawareness about and strategies \\nfor managing the threats posed \\nby tracking the readers of \\nindependent media. more sensitive less

#mediadevdefinitions\\nwhat is privacy?\\na generally accepted definition of privacy is “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine \\nfor themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. ”1\\nwhat are data protection laws?\\ndata protection laws are frameworks that seek to regulate the collection, storage, and processing of \\ninformation about individuals. \\nis all data protected by data protection laws?\\nno. data protection laws apply only to personal and sensitive information. data protection laws do not \\nprotect nonpersonal data,2 anonymized data, or public data.3 this is an important distinction because \\nmany common data analytic practices do not use personal information at all.\\nwhat is personal information?\\nthere is no universal definition of what is or is not personal information. however, a common definition \\nfound within many national laws and international agreements modelled after the european union’s \\ngdpr is that personal data “means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural \\nperson. ”4 some data elements very clearly count as personal or secret information, such as a name \\nor passport number. but the answer is not so straightforward for other elements. for example, a date \\nof birth in and of itself is not personal information. but if

laws of 134 countries; \\nhowever, it is also not necessary to do so. adopting the highest data \\nprotection standard available is the most straightforward approach to \\ncompliance. at this time, that standard is the european union’s general \\ndata protection regulation (gdpr). achieving compliance with the gdpr \\nand its principles of accountability and data minimization would place most \\nmedia organizations in good standing, even if they operate in a different \\nregulatory environment.\\nalthough european nations represent a minority of those jurisdictions with \\ndata protection

with regard \\nto automatic processing of personal data, the european union’s data \\nprotection directive, and the gdpr.\\nthe gdpr came into effect in 2018. it was a major revision to european \\nlaw that significantly built upon the principles contained within the us \\nprivacy act of 1974 and the values advanced within the eu data protection \\ndirective of 1995, aiming to prohibit the excessive collection, use, and \\ndisclosure of personal information without disproportionately impeding key historical developments in privacy law\\nprivacy rules and norms that govern action or inaction related to our personal \\ninformation have been interpreted in a similar way around the world for \\nsome time. in 1974 the united states adopted the privacy act,9 a federal law \\nthat sought to safeguard information about individuals held by federal agencies. \\nthe act codified into law the recommendations developed by an independent \\nadvisory committee in 1973 that had analyzed the consequences of using electronic \\nsystems to maintain records about people.10 their report shaped our contemporary \\nunderstanding of information privacy and it remains relevant some four decades \\nlater. in short, the committee recommended adopting five principles: \\ndata protection laws \\nare frameworks that \\nseek to regulate the \\ncollection, storage, and \\nprocessing of information \\nabout\\xa0individuals. 7 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevcommerce, free expression, or freedom of association. whether this \\nbalance was successfully achieved remains hotly debated, but what is \\nuncontested is that this legislation forced companies around the world to \\nreview their data processing activities. \\ngdpr in a nutshell\\nthe gdpr codifies into law a risk-based approach to protecting the privacy \\nof natural persons. it requires privacy by design and by default, mandates \\naccountability for data controllers, and grants individuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure and to control and transparency over how \\ntheir personal information will be used. the gdpr states that personal \\ninformation must be retained for the shortest period of time possible and \\nthat there must be limits on who can access it. it also imposes significant \\nrestrictions on how and when personal information may be shared with \\nthird parties. further, the gdpr grants new protections to sensitive \\ninformation like medical data, and article 7 states that if an individual \\nis asked to consent to a data processing practice, their consent must \\nbe a “freely given, specific, and unambiguous” indication of their intent. \\nmost strikingly, the penalties for noncompliance are set at €20 million \\n($22.4 million) or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher, even \\nwhere there is no ill intent on the part of the data controller.\\nextraterritoriality\\na major difference between the gdpr and other data protection laws is \\nthat it has extraterritorial effect, meaning that enforcement is theoretically \\npossible outside of the borders of the european union. this has made \\neurope, in the eyes of some, the “world’s data police. ”11 the consequence \\nof this is that under the gdpr, even organizations outside of the european \\nunion must comply with the gdpr when they process data belonging to \\nindividuals in the european union. because of the global nature of the \\ninternet, it is easy to imagine a european resident who is protected by the \\ngdpr visiting the website of a publisher, say, in belarus or mongolia. at \\nleast in theory according to european union regulations, that belarusian \\nor mongolian publisher must adhere to the gdpr if collecting analytic data \\nabout that european resident. if such extraterritorial enforcement actually \\nhappens, there would be profound implications here for the digital media \\necosystem worldwide.\\nat this point in time it is difficult to know what obligations will actually \\nbe enforced on entities located outside of the european union. one of \\nthe largest ambiguities that the internet presents, when it comes to the \\napplicability of legislation, is that it is a space where conventional nation-\\nstate borders do not exist and where traditional modes of interstate legal \\ncooperation have struggled to keep pace with the realities of a web 2.0 the gdpr codifies into law \\na risk-based approach to \\nprotecting the privacy of natural \\npersons. it\\xa0requires privacy \\nby design and by default, \\nmandates accountability for \\ndata controllers, and grants \\nindividuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure \\nand to control and\\xa0transparency \\nover how their personal \\ninformation will be\\xa0used. 8 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgworld. this is why earlier data protection laws have been difficult to enforce \\nand why the european union, in the gdpr, has sought to make its legislation \\napplicable in all environments. the fear, however, is that this jurisdictional \\noverreach could lead to a legal arms race that could have unpredictable \\nand unintended consequences. so far, the gdpr’s enforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to impose penalties on data controllers outside of the \\neuropean union. in one notable example, the united kingdom’s information \\ncommissioner’s office sent a letter to the washington post  advising that \\nits website did not comply with the gdpr, but it did not take any formal \\nenforcement action.12 this suggests that, at least for now, the european \\nunion will rely on indirect means of enforcing the gdpr outside of its \\nborders, incentivizing self-compliance through fear of reputational damage.\\ngdpr is the new global standard\\nt en countries outside of europe have now updated their earlier data \\nprotection bills to enact many (or all) of the principles contained within \\nthe gdpr. this trend appears to be continuing, with new or updated bills \\npending in algeria, indonesia, thailand, and t unisia that appear to have \\nbeen modelled after the gdpr. pakistan, which does not have any data \\nprotection legislation at present, currently has a bill under consideration \\nthat would adopt large chunks of the gdpr. \\n“i assume that lawmakers just copied and pasted the gdpr and left some \\nthings out actually, ” said salwa rana, legal officer at media matters for \\ndemocracy in pakistan.13 “and these things were that you need to inform \\nthe data subject of any leak that takes place, that the data subject has \\nthe right to be forgotten, and extraterritoriality. ” rana said the question \\nof extraterritorial application is one that remains unaddressed. “this was \\none of the main questions that was raised in one of our consultations: is \\nenforcement of the law going to be limited to pakistan? the problem is that \\nwe have the federal investigation authority which is going to be responsible \\nfor any violations under this law outside of pakistan, yet under the \\nproposed legislation, they haven’t given them any power. ” while the gdpr’s \\nexemptions for journalistic activities remain in the proposed bill, media \\norganizations in pakistan have not been actively involved in drafting this \\nlaw. “there hasn’t been much response from media companies, but i feel \\nlike the way this law is going, they are going to have to begin participating. ”\\nregardless of whether or not more countries adopt the gdpr’s provisions, \\ngiven the global nature of the internet and many businesses’ desire to trade \\nwith member states of the european union, a need to comply with the \\ngdpr has incentivized businesses such as microsoft to voluntarily adopt \\nhigher privacy and data protection standards for their entire operations \\nworldwide, even where they are under no legal obligation to do so.14so far, the gdpr’s \\nenforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to \\nimpose penalties on data \\ncontrollers outside of \\nthe\\xa0european union. 9 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevgdpr implications for the media industry\\narticle 4 (7) of the gdpr defines a data controller as “the natural or legal \\nperson, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly \\nwith others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of \\npersonal data. ” by this broad definition, it is difficult to imagine any media \\norganization with either a list of subscribers or a website with analytic \\nfunctions that would not  be considered a data controller. as a result, any \\njournalistic institution whose content is accessible to european residents \\nwill need to think carefully about how the gdpr may impact their \\nbusiness development activities or editorial functions. some potential \\nramifications include the following:\\nimpacts on newsgathering\\nthe gdpr states  that the \\n… processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the \\npurposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject \\nto derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation \\nif necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with \\nthe right to freedom of expression and information.15\\nwhile this language provides the media with significant leeway to be able \\nto publish journalistic work, it does not assist journalists in accessing \\ninformation for journalistic purposes.\\nioana avadani, executive director of the center for independent \\njournalism in bucharest, said the gdpr has been used in romania to \\nprotect those in positions of power.16 “what we witnessed immediately \\nafter the gdpr is that institutions started to invoke the gdpr as a \\nreason not to release information, ” she said. “they were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, so what they got is just another reason, and \\nthey are very happy that this is a legal reason to justify their less-than-\\ntransparent attitude. ” \\navadani pointed to an example of a protest that occurred in august 2018 \\nwhere riot police in bucharest behaved in a violent manner and physically \\nassaulted demonstrators. after a journalist asked who had authorized this \\naction, the police invoked the gdpr and refused to name the authorizing \\nofficer. “it was a clear case of public information, and they still refused \\nto say it because they wanted to protect the government, ” said avadani. \\ntheir next reaction was to use the gdpr to attempt to force the journalist \\nto reveal their source, claiming the police department had an obligation \\nunder the gdpr to investigate a data breach. “it was not a genuine \\nconcern for the protection of the police officer’s privacy, it was just a way \\nto protect the authorities. ” \\n© urban fenix / shutterstock.com\\n“what we witnessed \\nimmediately after the gdpr \\nis that institutions started to \\ninvoke the gdpr as a reason \\nnot to release information…\\nthey were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, \\nso what they got is just \\nanother reason, and they are \\nvery happy that

cima.ned.orgthis is not the only case of the gdpr being abused in romania. rise \\nproject, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, was threatened \\nwith a €20 million ($22.4 million) fine from romania’s data protection \\nauthority after publishing a post on facebook that accused a prominent \\nromanian politician of theft. rise project subsequently published a letter \\nit had received from the national supervisory authority for personal data \\nprocessing, which demanded that it disclose within 10 days “how and when \\nrise project obtained the information ultimately posted to facebook, who \\ntheir source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal \\ninformation rise project has on [the politician] and their friends, ”17 or \\nface a penalty of €20 million. while it is doubtful such a fine would stand \\nup in the highest courts of the european union, for smaller media outlets \\nthe fear of costly, ongoing litigation could ultimately have a chilling \\neffect on journalism.\\n“right to erasure” impact\\nthe “right to erasure, ” also known as the right to be forgotten, has garnered \\nsignificant attention but is often misunderstood. the right is not absolute, \\nwith article 17 (3) of the gdpr offering a public interest exemption \\nintended to safeguard against predicted abuses. the problem is that \\nthe gdpr’s recital 153 states  that “member states law should reconcile \\nthe rules governing freedom of expression and information, including \\njournalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to \\nthe protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation. ”18 this means \\nthat there could be a patchwork quilt of interpretations for how this article \\nshould be implemented. unfortunately, in romania, the data protection \\nauthority has settled upon a definition that seems to have prioritized the \\nright to privacy over freedom of expression in all circumstances.\\nziarul de iasi,  a local newspaper in romania with a circulation of 5,000 \\ncopies per week, received a right to erasure request to delete an article \\nfrom its online archive. after the newspaper refused to remove an article \\nfrom nine years earlier about a public figure who had engaged in improper \\nbehavior, the national supervisory authority for personal data processing \\nsent a letter imposing a fine of 3,000 leu ($725) per day until the article \\nwas deleted. “for a local newspaper this is huge, ” said avadani. “in this \\nparticular case, ziarul de iasi  is going to challenge the request in court. \\nhowever the editor-in-chief told me if he keeps receiving requests like this, \\nhe may not be able to afford to keep challenging them. ”while it is doubtful such \\na fine would stand up in \\nthe highest courts of the \\neuropean union, for smaller \\nmedia outlets the fear of \\ncostly, ongoing litigation \\ncould ultimately have a \\nchilling effect on\\xa0journalism.11 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevimpacts on internal operations and website functionality\\nunder the gdpr, data controllers are obligated to ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices and the data processing practices of third \\nparties comply with the regulation. this necessarily requires that media \\norganizations more closely scrutinize the activities of the third-party \\nvendors they work with. \\nala’a alzghoul, an information systems specialist with arab reporters \\nfor investigative journalism in jordan, explained how the gdpr \\nprompted his organization to develop internal procedures for assessing \\nhow third parties handle personal information.19 “for example, we use \\ngoogle analytics to collect some data for the user experience. before we \\nadded their plug-in, we first read the privacy policy of google analytics \\nand asked for every detail as to what data this tool is collecting, we \\ntracked what they actually do, and we mention those details in our \\nprivacy policy. ” alzghoul explained that the gdpr also prompted arab \\nreporters for investigative journalism to develop new procedures for \\nhandling personal information. “t o prevent any data leakages, we moved \\nfrom regular databases to encrypted databases, ” he said. “we have a \\nnew policy to protect the personal data that we collect, and to prevent \\nemployees [from] just copying the data onto their laptops. but this \\nhappened because of the gdpr, not because we were afraid of the laws \\nhere in jordan. ”under the gdpr, data \\ncontrollers are obligated \\nto ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices \\nand the data processing \\npractices of third parties \\ncomply with the\\xa0regulation.

for example, if you visit \\nhttps:/ /es .mercopress.com …13 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevwhen content is being downloaded, the browser sends an http request to \\neither retrieve information from a server or send data to a server.20 as part \\nof this interaction, the server obtains the visitor’s ip address to learn who \\nit is interacting with. y ou could think of an ip address as the return address \\non a letter you mail; it is a unique number that essentially identifies you by \\nthe device you’re using to connect to the internet, and can be linked to all \\nthe online activity you engage in on that device. \\nwhen first-party content is downloaded, a website visitor would reasonably \\nexpect that they are sharing their ip address to access that content. the \\nsituation becomes murkier with third-party content. because the website \\nviewer’s ip address is being collected by an external source with which \\nthey do not have a direct relationship—and since these third-party content \\nelements can either be invisible, blend into the webpage, or just load on the \\nwebpage without the individual’s explicit consent—their ip address would \\nbe collected by a third party without the individual’s knowledge or approval. \\nmoreover, it is rare that only an ip address will be captured. while an ip \\naddress does constitute personal information, it is extremely common \\nfor third parties to collect information on individuals through cookies, \\nweb beacons, and application program interfaces, among other technical \\nmeasures, as people browse digital properties. these allow for individuals \\nto be targeted in a much more granular manner and to be tracked across \\nthe entire internet.when first-party content is \\ndownloaded, a website visitor \\nwould reasonably expect \\nthat they are sharing their ip \\naddress to access that content. \\nthe situation becomes murkier \\nwith third-party content. \\nhow website visitors are tracked\\ncookie a cookie is a message that a server sends to a web browser to store on the website visitor’s \\ncomputer. this file is then sent back to the server each time the visitor’s web browser requests \\ncontent from that particular server.\\nweb beacon a web beacon is a small image, usually one pixel by one pixel in size, that is discretely placed on \\na website to monitor visitor behavior. when the image loads, the web beacon passes information \\nalong to the server where the image is stored, including the ip address of the computer that \\nretrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the \\nimage, and cookie values.\\napplication \\nprogram \\ninterfacean application program interface determines how different software applications and \\ncomponents should interact with others. they are building blocks that website developers can use \\nto pull and share data. for instance, amazon’s product advertising application program interface \\nallows another website to search amazon’s product inventory and to then add personalized \\nfunctions to its website advertising amazon’s products.14 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orghistorically it has even been possible for companies to track website \\nviewers without using cookies or web beacons or deploying application \\nprogram interfaces. there are various fingerprinting algorithms that \\nhave enabled data sets to be analyzed in a manner that, for all practical \\npurposes, could uniquely identify an individual with a high degree of \\naccuracy. when a visitor downloads a file from a third party, the third \\nparty necessarily obtains a user agent string (the website visitor’s \\noperating system, web browser type, and version number) and accepts \\nheaders (the type, version, and capabilities of the browser that is making \\nthe request so that the server returns compatible data). if javascript \\nis enabled, it can communicate the names of browser plug-ins that \\nare installed, and these plug-ins can be called upon to share system-\\nspecific attributes. many of these attributes are, in and of themselves, \\nharmless, but when aggregated, can effectively and easily lead to the \\nidentification of a user.21 \\nt o grasp how the tracking of readers involves a variety of distinct and \\nindependent entities, imagine a scenario in which an individual lands on \\na fictitious new site, newswebsite.com, to read an article on nutrition. \\nthe reader’s presence on the site is collected by analytics.com, a \\nthird-party audience measurement tool firm that newswebsite.com \\nhas enabled on its website. analytics.com collects data from millions \\nof websites using cookies, and this data could include the visitor’s past \\nshopping behavior, interests, time zone, ethnicity, browser language \\npreferences, and gender, among other information. based on these data \\ncompiled by analytics.com, another third-party, shopping.com, knows \\nthat the visitor is female, aged 40, and previously spent $60 on a book. \\nshopping.com could now infer that the visitor is likely to be interested \\nin hardcover recipe books, and so sends a request to advertising.com \\nto load an advertisement for a hardcover recipe book on the next page \\nthat the visitor loads on the newswebsites.com site. in this scenario, \\npersonal data about the reader would have been circulated with at \\nleast four different entities, some of which the reader herself might not \\neven know about.\\nover the past three years web browsers and mobile devices have \\nbegun masking header information by default. this reduces, but does \\nnot entirely eliminate, the potential for reidentification through this \\nmanner. these changes have arguably been implemented in reaction \\nto new privacy regulations like the gdpr, which oblige data controllers \\nto provide individuals with an effective means of exercising their data \\nrights. users with older mobile devices or web browsers that have \\nnot been updated may be particularly vulnerable to identification \\nthrough fingerprinting.there are various \\nfingerprinting algorithms \\nthat have enabled data sets \\nto be analyzed in a manner \\nthat, for all practical

the independent media websites and 98 percent of \\nthe mass media websites reviewed contained third-party trackers of some \\nkind. in the context of independent media websites, these trackers were \\nmost commonly deployed for audience measurement purposes, followed \\nby advertising and marketing purposes, and then by the inclusion of social \\nmedia share buttons. \\naccording to valentina pavel, who researches data ownership at privacy \\ninternational, “user tracking and exploitation of data is still the default for \\nnews websites, but this is changing. ”23 she said readers are

noted that large publishers like the new york times  have dropped \\nbehavioral advertisements from their websites altogether without suffering \\nany revenue impact and believes this has paved the way for smaller \\npublications to do the same. “people are looking for real guarantees that \\ntheir data is not going to be exploited, so by all means, don’t sell or share \\nuser data, and stop or

website owner may decide not to use an ad exchange, opting instead to \\nhandle advertising sales internally. this has been an approach that larger publishers \\nhave been taking post-gdpr, as it can also result in higher revenue from direct sales \\nnegotiations. if advertisements are not targeted to the individual website viewer and \\nare instead of a general nature, this is fairly simple to resolve. provided no personal \\ninformation about the website viewers is exchanged with the advertiser, no privacy \\nviolations can occur. much, if not all, of the information typically found in a media kit \\nabout audience demographics does not constitute personal information. \\nif personal information is to be exchanged with third parties, a careful assessment \\nwill need to be conducted before this happens. this assessment must consider both \\nthe fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, their reasonable \\nexpectations for how and why their personal information would be used, and the \\ngrounds for why and how the third party would reasonably use those data.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\naudience \\nmeasurementthere are audience measurement tools that can be self-hosted, such as cryptolog, \\nwhich allows both internal analytical logging and total control over how long data \\nare retained. however, these tools are not as easy to use as third-party

new data protection laws like \\nthe gdpr and other applicable regimes can be difficult, and that appears to be \\na leading reason that some website owners have not taken action. \\none simpler mechanism of coming into compliance with the gdpr is to migrate away from using third-\\nparty tools, services, and applications and to instead use self-hosted tools. this immediately limits \\nexposure to the data collection and processing practices of third parties, and grants readers a greater \\ndegree of privacy protection, as information that could lead to their identification will no longer be \\ncirculating outside of the websites they’re visiting. 21 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevmoving from third party to first party (in alphabetical order)\\ncontent hosting not all content needs to be hosted by third parties. for example, if a website uses a \\nthird-party font library, the site could be changed to use either default browser fonts \\nor self-hosted fonts to provide an immediate privacy gain for visitors.\\nit may not be feasible to self-host all content. video hosting, for example, can be very \\nresource intensive and expensive. however, website owners may wish to investigate \\nwhich third-party video hosts are out there, and how (if at all) they use visitor data. \\nyoutube, for example, offers “privacy enhancing mode, ” which “allows you to embed \\nyoutube videos without using cookies that track viewing behavior. ”24 however, it is \\ndisabled by default and so action is required by the website’s publisher to benefit \\nfrom this privacy gain.\\nease of migration:  easy \\ndesign \\noptimizationself-hosted design testing tools may not offer all of the functions of those of third \\nparties. it might be a better idea to review the privacy policy of any tools that are \\nused, and to make sure they respect the privacy of

retain audience data.\\nease of migration:  possibly not necessary \\nrecommendation \\nsystemsrecommendation engines are a major source of third-party cookies. while they \\nmay look harmless and may improve the appearance and functionality of a website, \\nthey can also be trojan horses, inserting hundreds of third-party trackers into \\nevery page of a website (including malware, in some instances). these tools can \\nalso be used to direct viewers to content that belongs to another publisher, or to \\ninject misinformation or misleading stories onto your webpage. website owners \\nwho cannot develop their own content recommendation engines may be better off \\neliminating the use of these third-party tools altogether.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\nsocial media \\nshare buttonssome of the most significant privacy violations we saw came from deploying social \\nmedia share buttons. embedding a facebook “like” button into a webpage enables \\nthat platform to be able to link a user’s reading and browsing history to their \\nfacebook account. however, it is not necessary to use facebook’s default “like” \\nbutton to encourage sharing news articles on facebook. there are self-hosted social \\nsharing plug-ins that transmit less personal information to third parties that may be \\nused instead. \\nease of migration:  easy \\nvisualizations many third-party visualization tools offer self-hosted deployments, though some \\ntechnical knowledge may be required to synchronize their visual interfaces with local \\ndeployment. others do not pose significant privacy risks because as paid tools they \\noffer contractual assurances around how they will or will not use data.\\nease of migration:  easy 22 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgindeed, the findings in this report reveal that the current level of \\npreparedness among smaller media companies in the global south \\nto protect their readers from being identified and to protect the \\ncommercial value of their analytics data is low. experts consulted for \\nthis report said that this is unfortunate as many of the most common \\ndata analytic practices that independent media outlets engage in and \\nbenefit from do not require the use of personal information at all. \\nwhile it will take additional effort by website operators, safeguarding \\nthe privacy rights of visitors may be good for business. this, in \\nturn, could help improve the commercial viability of independent \\nmedia. research from the world economic forum shows that in \\nthe $3 trillion global data economy, online news sites are unusually \\nwell-trusted relative to search engines, social networking platforms, \\nand even financial institutions.25 y et, so far, a handful of players \\nlike facebook and google have led the business of online data \\ncollection and marketing, which has allowed them to harness the \\nvalue of the data that they have collected from websites whose \\ncontent they do not control. this research reveals that independent \\nmedia websites commonly leak personal information to third parties \\nunder the following scenarios: when analytic tools are used to \\nmeasure audience demographics, when split tests are conducted \\nto experiment with new website design features, when social media \\n“share” buttons are embedded into webpages, or when content \\nrecommendation engines are deployed to personalize a website’s \\ncontent to make it relevant to the reader. \\nmaintaining and building upon the high degree of trust that exists \\nbetween a publisher and its readers may be the long-term solution conclusion and recommendations\\na year after a new wave of data protection regulations such as the european \\nunion’s gdpr have come into effect, the websites of media outlets continue \\ncollecting great volumes of personal information—but often unintentionally, \\nand typically for other parties. that so many media institutions have failed to \\nsafeguard this asset—to both protect the privacy and safety of their readers and \\nto be in a better negotiating position with advertisers—suggests that education, \\ncapacity building, and direct support of independent news outlets is needed to \\nimprove their analytics activities and ensure that they safeguard reader privacy. \\nwhile it will take \\nadditional effort by \\nwebsite operators, \\nsafeguarding the privacy \\nrights of visitors may be \\ngood for business. 23 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media

on your own user base rather than \\nthat of advertisers, ” said tanja maksic, a researcher with the balkan \\ninvestigative reporting network.26 this, in turn, could result in digital \\npublishers developing greater negotiating power and leverage with \\nthird-party advertising exchanges or, alternatively, being able to sell \\npremium subscriptions to readers. “look at your internal organization, \\nwhat you are collecting, what you are doing with it, how you are \\nprotecting it, ” said maksic, “and craft your economic sustainability \\naround your user base and meet their demands and their standards. ” \\nlouise marie hurel, an internet governance researcher at brazil’s \\nigarapé institute, agreed. “i think this is inevitable really. enforcement \\nof data protection laws may be ad hoc, but that same degree of \\nuncertainty should not mark your relationship with users who are \\naccessing your content. ”27\\nfrom a media development perspective, news organizations around \\nthe world need better support and training on how to safeguard their \\nvaluable audience data, both to protect the privacy rights of their \\nreaders and for commercial purposes. practical primers on complying \\nwith data protection laws and regulations, sharing best practices, \\nregularly auditing websites to understand what tracking devices \\nare present and what they are doing with data, and developing and \\nexchanging benchmarking information could all help smaller media \\noutlets find a competitive advantage over the advertising networks and

started as a way to improve the user experience came with \\na downside for website viewers: it entailed collecting and processing \\ntheir personal information, often without their knowledge or consent. \\nmoreover, the drive to collect data has resulted in many independent \\nmedia outlets in the global south unknowingly permitting third parties, \\nmany of which cannot be identified, to invasively monitor their visitors.\\nworldwide, citizens and policymakers are increasingly cognizant of \\nthe risks that the burgeoning data economy poses to personal privacy. \\nin recent years, a wave of next-generation data protection laws have \\nemerged that seek to restrict the collection, usage, and sharing of \\npersonal information. this is not necessarily a good news story for \\nthose news institutions that had successfully harnessed the value of \\nanalytics to grow advertising revenue or to better understand their \\naudiences. these data protection regulations have, by design, severely \\nhampered the environment within which many smaller digital media \\noutlets operate. while these laws do not entirely restrict the use of \\nanalytics, they do restrict the use of analytic applications that place \\npeople at risk of harm. indeed, there is growing evidence that some of \\nthe tracking mechanisms employed by digital news sites are potentially \\ndoing just that.\\nt o get a better understanding of how new privacy regimes will affect \\nmedia in the global south, this paper assembles a new set of findings \\non the websites of 50 small, independent news publishers from 10 \\ndeveloping countries. it shows that third-party trackers are collecting \\naudience data when people read articles, write comments, send in news \\ntips, and share pieces on social networking platforms. one independent \\npublisher in nigeria, for instance, had 523 third-party cookies on its \\nhomepage collecting audience information. in total, over 150 companies—\\nnot all of which could be identified—were found to be invisibly tracking the \\nvisitors to these 50 websites. they were collecting ip addresses, which \\ncan identify geographic locations, the titles and urls of news articles \\nread, search queries, and other data. once collected, this information introduction\\nfor years, the road to news media financial sustainability was said to be \\npaved with data—digital news outlets were counseled to collect as many \\ndetails about their readers as possible. tracking audiences was considered \\nessential for optimizing search engine results, creating content that people want \\nto read, and supporting targeted advertising to fund journalism. \\nworldwide, citizens and \\npolicymakers are increasingly \\ncognizant of the risks that \\nthe burgeoning data economy \\nposes to personal privacy. 2 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgcould be sold to advertisers or further exchanged with other third parties. \\nit could even reach the hands of governments. \\nfrom a media development perspective, the failure of media outlets \\nto protect their visitors against invasive tracking by third parties is \\ntroubling for two reasons. first and most importantly, it places the \\nprivacy and safety of a publication’s readers in jeopardy. readers need \\nto feel confident that visiting independent news sites, especially those \\ncovering sensitive issues, will not put them in danger. second, from a \\nbusiness perspective, when publishers give away information about \\ntheir audiences for free, they cede valuable leverage for negotiating with \\nadvertisers. in essence, the outsourcing of analytics to third parties \\npotentially puts readers at risk and weakens a site’s ability to truly take \\nadvantage of the interactions it has with its readers. taken together, the \\nfindings of this study suggest an important new frontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and the need to build stronger awareness \\nabout and strategies for managing the threats posed by tracking the \\nreaders of independent media. \\nthis report also provides an overview of the latest regulatory \\ndevelopments in the data protection field, such as the european \\nunion’s general data protection regulation (gdpr). while much of the \\npublic debate has been about policy changes in europe, the impact \\nhas been much broader in geographic scope. the changes underway \\ndirectly impact independent news outlets in many developing countries. \\nthis review of new laws is followed by a detailed description of the \\nvarious trackers currently used on news websites, and the ways that \\nthey potentially come into conflict with new data protection laws \\nand regulations. then, the report analyzes research on web tracking \\ntechnologies used by news media websites in 10 developing countries, \\nexposing pervasive tracking that ultimately may not benefit either \\nthe readers or the news organizations themselves. and finally, it \\nconcludes with suggestions about how news organizations and other \\nmedia development stakeholders might be able to take advantage of \\nthe global shift in data protection laws and regulations to strengthen \\nindependent media. the findings of this study \\nsuggest an important new \\nfrontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and \\nthe need to build

generally accepted definition of privacy is “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine \\nfor themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. ”1\\nwhat are data protection laws?\\ndata protection laws are frameworks that seek to regulate the collection, storage, and processing of \\ninformation about individuals. \\nis all data protected by data protection laws?\\nno. data protection laws apply only to personal and sensitive information. data protection laws do not \\nprotect nonpersonal data,2 anonymized data, or public data.3 this is an important distinction because \\nmany common data analytic practices do not use personal information at all.\\nwhat is personal information?\\nthere is no universal definition of what is or is not personal information. however, a common definition \\nfound within many national laws and international agreements modelled after the european union’s \\ngdpr is that personal data “means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural \\nperson. ”4 some data elements very clearly count as personal or secret information, such as a name \\nor passport number. but the answer is not so straightforward for other elements. for example, a date \\nof birth in and of itself is not personal information. but if that can be combined with a street address \\nand one’s gender, it could be used to identify someone, and in that instance should be treated as \\npersonal information.5note: while privacy is a disputed concept in law and philosophy, and attitudes toward how personal information is used \\nvary from individual to individual, it is generally accepted that some data elements are more sensitive than others. figure 1.   the range of consumer

for independent media around the world   #mediadevand journalistic institutions. these laws are particularly likely to apply \\nif a news organization’s website collects data about its audience, loads \\nelements onto a webpage from a third party, or uses cookies. it would not \\nbe feasible for most entities to adhere to the unique laws of 134 countries; \\nhowever, it is also not necessary to do so. adopting the highest data \\nprotection standard available is the most straightforward approach to \\ncompliance. at this time, that standard is the european union’s general \\ndata protection regulation (gdpr). achieving compliance with the gdpr \\nand its principles of accountability and data minimization would place most \\nmedia organizations in good standing, even if they operate in a different \\nregulatory environment.\\nalthough european nations represent a minority of those jurisdictions with \\ndata protection laws, europe continues to have an outsized influence on \\nthe development of data protection laws in africa, asia, and the americas. \\nthis is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future because the council of \\nthe european union has advised the european commission that it cannot \\nnegotiate away privacy rights in trade agreements.8 countries that wish to \\ntrade with the european union, and, in particular, have data flows with the \\ntrading bloc, will thus face pressure to implement data protection laws that \\nare influenced by the european standard. figure 3.  countries with data protection laws\\nnote: most data protection laws apply to

purpose without the consent of the individual concerned. \\n4 there must exist a right to correct inaccurate records. \\n5 organizations are responsible for ensuring that their \\nrecord-keeping systems are secure and reliable, and \\nmust take precautions to prevent the misuse of data. \\nfollowing the passage and implementation of the act, the united states \\nadvocated for these principles internationally. t oday, they can be found \\nin every major privacy protection instrument, including the african \\nunion convention on cyber security and personal data protection, \\nthe asia-pacific economic cooperation’s cross-border privacy rules, \\nthe organisation of eastern caribbean states’ data protection bill, the \\norganisation for economic co-operation and development’s guidelines \\non the protection of privacy and t ransborder flows of personal data, the \\ncouncil of europe’s convention for the protection of individuals with regard \\nto automatic processing of personal data, the european union’s data \\nprotection directive, and the gdpr.\\nthe gdpr came into effect in 2018. it was a major revision to european \\nlaw that significantly built upon the principles contained within the us \\nprivacy act of 1974 and the values advanced within the eu data protection \\ndirective of 1995, aiming to prohibit the excessive collection, use, and \\ndisclosure of personal information without disproportionately impeding key historical developments in privacy law\\nprivacy rules and norms that govern action or inaction related to our personal \\ninformation have been interpreted in a similar way around the world for \\nsome time. in 1974 the united states adopted the privacy act,9 a federal law \\nthat sought to safeguard information about individuals held by federal agencies. \\nthe act codified into law the recommendations developed by an independent \\nadvisory committee in 1973 that had analyzed the consequences of using electronic \\nsystems to maintain records about people.10 their report shaped our contemporary \\nunderstanding of information privacy and it remains relevant some four decades \\nlater. in short, the committee recommended adopting five principles: \\ndata protection laws \\nare frameworks that \\nseek to regulate the \\ncollection, storage, and \\nprocessing of information \\nabout\\xa0individuals. 7 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevcommerce, free expression, or freedom of association. whether this \\nbalance was successfully achieved remains hotly debated, but what is \\nuncontested is that this legislation forced companies around the world to \\nreview their data processing activities. \\ngdpr in a nutshell\\nthe gdpr codifies into law a risk-based approach to protecting the privacy \\nof natural persons. it requires privacy by design and by default, mandates \\naccountability for data controllers, and grants individuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure and to control and transparency over how \\ntheir personal information will be used. the gdpr states that personal \\ninformation must be retained for the shortest period of time possible and \\nthat there must be limits on who can access it. it also imposes significant \\nrestrictions on how and when personal information may be shared with \\nthird parties. further, the gdpr grants new protections to sensitive \\ninformation like medical data, and article 7 states that if an individual \\nis asked to consent to a data processing practice, their consent must \\nbe a “freely given, specific, and unambiguous” indication of their intent. \\nmost strikingly, the penalties for noncompliance are set at €20 million \\n($22.4 million) or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher, even \\nwhere there is no ill intent on the part of the data controller.\\nextraterritoriality\\na major difference between the gdpr and other data protection laws is \\nthat it has extraterritorial effect, meaning that enforcement is theoretically \\npossible outside of the borders of the european union. this has made \\neurope, in the eyes of some, the “world’s data police. ”11 the consequence \\nof this is that under the gdpr, even organizations outside of the european \\nunion must comply with the gdpr when they process data belonging to \\nindividuals in the european union. because of the global nature of the \\ninternet, it is easy to imagine a european resident who is protected by the \\ngdpr visiting the website of a publisher, say, in belarus or mongolia. at \\nleast in theory according to european union regulations, that belarusian \\nor mongolian publisher must adhere to the gdpr if collecting analytic data \\nabout that european resident. if such extraterritorial enforcement actually \\nhappens, there would be profound implications here for the digital media \\necosystem worldwide.\\nat this point in time it is difficult to know what obligations will actually \\nbe enforced on entities located outside of the european union. one of \\nthe largest ambiguities that the internet presents, when it comes to the \\napplicability of legislation, is that it is a space where conventional nation-\\nstate borders do not exist and where traditional modes of interstate legal \\ncooperation have struggled to keep pace with the realities of a web 2.0 the gdpr codifies into law \\na risk-based approach to \\nprotecting the privacy of natural \\npersons. it\\xa0requires privacy \\nby design and by default, \\nmandates accountability for \\ndata controllers, and grants \\nindividuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure \\nand to control and\\xa0transparency \\nover how their personal \\ninformation will be\\xa0used. 8 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgworld. this is why earlier data protection laws have been difficult to enforce \\nand why the european union, in the gdpr, has sought to make its legislation \\napplicable in all environments. the fear, however, is that this jurisdictional \\noverreach could lead to a legal arms race that could have unpredictable \\nand unintended consequences. so far, the gdpr’s enforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to impose penalties on data controllers outside of the \\neuropean union. in one notable example, the united kingdom’s information \\ncommissioner’s office sent a letter to the washington post  advising that \\nits website did not comply with the gdpr, but it did not take any formal \\nenforcement action.12 this suggests that, at least for now, the european \\nunion will rely on indirect means of enforcing the gdpr outside of its \\nborders, incentivizing self-compliance through fear of reputational damage.\\ngdpr is the new global standard\\nt en countries outside of europe have now updated their earlier data \\nprotection bills to enact many (or all) of the principles contained within \\nthe gdpr. this trend appears to be continuing, with new or updated bills \\npending in algeria, indonesia, thailand, and t unisia that appear to have \\nbeen modelled after the gdpr. pakistan, which does not have any data \\nprotection legislation at present, currently has a bill under consideration \\nthat would adopt large chunks of the gdpr. \\n“i assume that lawmakers just copied and pasted the gdpr and left some \\nthings out actually, ” said salwa rana, legal officer at media matters for \\ndemocracy in pakistan.13 “and these things were that you need to inform \\nthe data subject of any leak that takes place, that the data subject has \\nthe right to be forgotten, and extraterritoriality. ” rana said the question \\nof extraterritorial application is one that remains unaddressed. “this was \\none of the main questions that was raised in one of our consultations: is \\nenforcement of the law going to be limited to pakistan? the problem is that \\nwe have the federal investigation authority which is going to be responsible \\nfor any violations under this law outside of pakistan, yet under the \\nproposed legislation, they haven’t given them any power. ” while the gdpr’s \\nexemptions for journalistic activities remain in the proposed bill, media \\norganizations in pakistan have not been actively involved in drafting this \\nlaw. “there hasn’t been much response from media companies, but i feel \\nlike the way this law is going, they are going to have to begin participating. ”\\nregardless of whether or not more countries adopt the gdpr’s provisions, \\ngiven the global nature of the internet and many businesses’ desire to trade \\nwith member states of the european union, a need to comply with the \\ngdpr has incentivized businesses such as microsoft to voluntarily adopt \\nhigher privacy and data protection standards for their entire operations \\nworldwide, even where they are under no legal obligation to do so.14so far, the gdpr’s \\nenforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to \\nimpose penalties on data \\ncontrollers outside of \\nthe\\xa0european union. 9 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevgdpr implications for the media industry\\narticle 4 (7) of the gdpr defines a data controller as “the natural or legal \\nperson, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly \\nwith others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of \\npersonal data. ” by this broad definition, it is difficult to imagine any media \\norganization with either a list of subscribers or a website with analytic \\nfunctions that would not  be considered a data controller. as a result, any \\njournalistic institution whose content is accessible to european residents \\nwill need to think carefully about how the gdpr may impact their \\nbusiness development activities or editorial functions. some potential \\nramifications include the following:\\nimpacts on newsgathering\\nthe gdpr states  that the \\n… processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the \\npurposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject \\nto derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation \\nif necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with \\nthe right to freedom of expression and information.15\\nwhile this language provides the media with significant leeway to be able \\nto publish journalistic work, it does not assist journalists in accessing \\ninformation for journalistic purposes.\\nioana avadani, executive director of the center for independent \\njournalism in bucharest, said the gdpr has been used in romania to \\nprotect those in positions of power.16 “what we witnessed immediately \\nafter the gdpr is that institutions started to invoke the gdpr as a \\nreason not to release information, ” she said. “they were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, so what they got is just another reason, and \\nthey are very happy that this is a legal reason to justify their less-than-\\ntransparent attitude. ” \\navadani pointed to an example of a protest that occurred in august 2018 \\nwhere riot police in bucharest behaved in a violent manner and physically \\nassaulted demonstrators. after a journalist asked who had authorized this \\naction, the police invoked the gdpr and refused to name the authorizing \\nofficer. “it was a clear case of public information, and they still refused \\nto say it because they wanted to protect the government, ” said avadani. \\ntheir next reaction was to use the gdpr to attempt to force the journalist \\nto reveal their source, claiming the police department had an obligation \\nunder the gdpr to investigate a data breach. “it was not a genuine \\nconcern for the protection of the police officer’s privacy, it was just a way \\nto protect the authorities. ” \\n© urban fenix / shutterstock.com\\n“what we witnessed \\nimmediately after the gdpr \\nis that institutions started to \\ninvoke the gdpr as a reason \\nnot to release information…\\nthey were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, \\nso what they got is just \\nanother reason, and they are \\nvery happy that this is a legal \\nreason to justify their less-\\nthan-transparent attitude.”\\n— ioana avadani,\\ncenter for independent  \\njournalism in bucharest10 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgthis is not the only case of the gdpr being abused in romania. rise \\nproject, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, was threatened \\nwith a €20 million ($22.4 million) fine from romania’s data protection \\nauthority after publishing a post on facebook that accused a prominent \\nromanian politician of theft. rise project subsequently published a letter \\nit had received from the national supervisory authority for personal data \\nprocessing, which demanded that it disclose within 10 days “how and when \\nrise project obtained the information ultimately posted to facebook, who \\ntheir source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal \\ninformation rise project has on [the politician] and their friends, ”17 or \\nface a penalty of €20 million. while it is doubtful such a fine would stand \\nup in the highest courts of the european union, for smaller media outlets \\nthe fear of costly, ongoing litigation could ultimately have a chilling \\neffect on journalism.\\n“right to erasure” impact\\nthe “right to erasure, ” also known as the right to be forgotten, has garnered \\nsignificant attention but is often misunderstood. the right is not absolute, \\nwith article 17 (3) of the gdpr offering a public interest exemption \\nintended to safeguard against predicted abuses. the problem is that \\nthe gdpr’s recital 153 states  that “member states law should reconcile \\nthe rules governing freedom of expression and information, including \\njournalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to \\nthe protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation. ”18 this means \\nthat there could be a patchwork quilt of interpretations for how this article \\nshould be implemented. unfortunately, in romania, the data protection \\nauthority has settled upon a definition that seems to have prioritized the \\nright to privacy over freedom of expression in all circumstances.\\nziarul de iasi,  a local newspaper in romania with a circulation of 5,000 \\ncopies per week, received a right to erasure request to delete an article \\nfrom its online archive. after the newspaper refused to remove an article \\nfrom nine years earlier about a public figure who had engaged in improper \\nbehavior, the national supervisory authority for personal data processing \\nsent a letter imposing a fine of 3,000 leu ($725) per day until the article \\nwas deleted. “for a local newspaper this is huge, ” said avadani. “in this \\nparticular case, ziarul de iasi  is going to challenge the request in court. \\nhowever the editor-in-chief told me if he keeps receiving requests like this, \\nhe may not be able to afford to keep challenging them. ”while it is doubtful such \\na fine would stand up in \\nthe highest courts of the \\neuropean union, for smaller \\nmedia outlets the fear of \\ncostly, ongoing litigation \\ncould ultimately have a \\nchilling effect on\\xa0journalism.11 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevimpacts on internal operations and website functionality\\nunder the gdpr, data controllers are obligated to ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices and the data processing practices of third \\nparties comply with the regulation. this necessarily requires that media \\norganizations more closely

being downloaded, the browser sends an http request to \\neither retrieve information from a server or send data to a server.20 as part \\nof this interaction, the server obtains the visitor’s ip address to learn who \\nit is interacting with. y ou could think of an ip address as the return address \\non a letter you mail; it is a unique number that essentially identifies you by \\nthe device you’re using to connect to the internet, and can be linked to all \\nthe online activity you engage in on that device. \\nwhen first-party content is downloaded, a website visitor would reasonably \\nexpect that they are sharing their ip address to access that content. the \\nsituation becomes murkier with third-party content. because the website \\nviewer’s ip address is being collected by an external source with which \\nthey do not have a direct relationship—and since these third-party content \\nelements can either be invisible, blend into the webpage, or just load on the \\nwebpage without the individual’s explicit consent—their ip address would \\nbe collected by a third party without the individual’s knowledge or approval. \\nmoreover, it is rare that only an ip address will be captured. while an ip \\naddress does constitute personal information, it is extremely common \\nfor third parties to collect information on individuals through cookies, \\nweb beacons, and application program interfaces, among other technical \\nmeasures, as people browse digital properties. these allow for individuals \\nto be targeted in a much more granular manner and to be tracked across \\nthe entire internet.when first-party content is \\ndownloaded, a website visitor \\nwould reasonably expect \\nthat they are sharing their ip \\naddress to access that content. \\nthe

\\ncomputer. this file is then sent back to the server each time the visitor’s web browser requests \\ncontent from that particular server.\\nweb beacon a web beacon is a small image, usually one pixel by one pixel in size, that is discretely placed on \\na website to monitor visitor behavior. when the image loads, the web beacon passes information \\nalong to the server where the image is stored, including the ip address of the computer that \\nretrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the \\nimage, and cookie values.\\napplication \\nprogram \\ninterfacean application program interface determines how different software applications and \\ncomponents should interact with others. they are building blocks that website developers can use \\nto pull and share data. for instance, amazon’s product advertising application program interface \\nallows another website to search amazon’s product inventory and to then add personalized \\nfunctions to its website advertising amazon’s products.14 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orghistorically it has even been possible for companies to track website \\nviewers without using cookies or web beacons or deploying application \\nprogram interfaces. there are various fingerprinting algorithms that \\nhave enabled data sets to be analyzed in a manner that, for all practical \\npurposes, could uniquely identify an individual with a high degree of \\naccuracy. when a visitor downloads a file from a third party, the third \\nparty necessarily obtains a user agent string (the website visitor’s \\noperating system, web browser type, and version number) and accepts \\nheaders (the type, version, and capabilities of the browser that is making \\nthe request so that the server returns compatible data). if javascript \\nis enabled, it can communicate the names of browser plug-ins that \\nare installed, and these plug-ins can be called upon to share system-\\nspecific attributes. many of these attributes are, in and of themselves, \\nharmless, but when aggregated, can effectively and easily lead to the \\nidentification of a user.21 \\nt o grasp how the tracking of readers involves a variety of distinct and \\nindependent entities, imagine a scenario in which an individual lands on \\na fictitious new site, newswebsite.com, to read an article on nutrition. \\nthe reader’s presence on the site is collected by analytics.com, a \\nthird-party audience measurement tool firm that newswebsite.com \\nhas enabled on its website. analytics.com collects data from millions \\nof websites using cookies, and this data could include the visitor’s past \\nshopping behavior, interests, time zone, ethnicity, browser language \\npreferences, and gender, among other information. based on these data \\ncompiled by analytics.com, another third-party, shopping.com, knows \\nthat the visitor is female, aged 40, and previously spent $60 on a book. \\nshopping.com could now infer that the visitor is likely to be interested \\nin hardcover recipe books, and so sends a request to advertising.com \\nto load an advertisement for a hardcover recipe book on the next page \\nthat the visitor loads on the newswebsites.com site. in this scenario, \\npersonal data about the reader would have been circulated with at \\nleast four different entities, some of which the reader herself might not \\neven know about.\\nover the past three years web browsers and mobile devices have \\nbegun masking header information by default. this reduces, but does \\nnot entirely eliminate, the potential for reidentification through this \\nmanner. these changes have arguably been implemented in reaction \\nto new privacy regulations like the gdpr, which oblige data controllers \\nto provide individuals with an effective means of exercising their data \\nrights. users with older mobile devices or web browsers that have \\nnot been updated may be particularly vulnerable to identification \\nthrough fingerprinting.there are various \\nfingerprinting algorithms \\nthat have enabled data sets \\nto be analyzed in a manner \\nthat, for all practical

website owner may decide not to use an ad exchange, opting instead to \\nhandle advertising sales internally. this has been an approach that larger publishers \\nhave been taking post-gdpr, as it can also result in higher revenue from direct sales \\nnegotiations. if advertisements are not targeted to the individual website viewer and \\nare instead of a general nature, this is fairly simple to resolve. provided no personal \\ninformation about the website viewers is exchanged with the advertiser, no privacy \\nviolations can occur. much, if not all, of the information typically found in a

mechanism of coming into compliance with the gdpr is to migrate away from using third-\\nparty tools, services, and applications and to instead use self-hosted tools. this immediately limits \\nexposure to the data collection and processing practices of third parties, and grants readers a greater \\ndegree of privacy protection, as information that could lead to their identification will

failed to \\nsafeguard this asset—to both protect the privacy and safety of their readers and \\nto be in a better negotiating position with advertisers—suggests that education, \\ncapacity building, and direct support of independent news outlets is needed to \\nimprove their analytics activities and ensure that they safeguard reader privacy. \\nwhile it will take \\nadditional effort by

started as a way to improve the user experience came with \\na downside for website viewers: it entailed collecting and processing \\ntheir personal information, often without their knowledge or consent. \\nmoreover, the drive to collect data has resulted in many independent \\nmedia outlets in the global south unknowingly permitting third parties, \\nmany of which cannot be identified, to invasively monitor their visitors.\\nworldwide, citizens and policymakers are increasingly cognizant of \\nthe risks that the burgeoning data economy poses to personal privacy. \\nin recent years, a wave of next-generation data protection laws have \\nemerged that seek to restrict the collection, usage, and sharing of \\npersonal information. this is not necessarily a good news story for \\nthose news institutions that had successfully harnessed the value of \\nanalytics to grow advertising revenue or to better understand their \\naudiences. these data protection regulations have, by design, severely \\nhampered the environment within which many smaller digital media \\noutlets operate. while these laws do not entirely restrict the use of \\nanalytics, they do restrict the use of analytic applications that place \\npeople at risk of harm. indeed, there is growing evidence that some of \\nthe tracking mechanisms employed by digital news sites are potentially \\ndoing just that.\\nt o get a better understanding of how new privacy regimes will affect \\nmedia in the global south, this paper assembles a new set of findings \\non the websites of 50 small, independent news publishers from 10 \\ndeveloping countries. it shows that third-party trackers are collecting \\naudience data when people read articles, write comments, send in news \\ntips, and share pieces on social networking platforms. one independent \\npublisher in nigeria, for instance, had 523 third-party cookies on its \\nhomepage collecting audience information. in total, over 150 companies—\\nnot all of which could be identified—were found to be invisibly tracking the \\nvisitors to these 50 websites. they were collecting ip addresses, which \\ncan identify geographic locations, the titles and urls of news articles \\nread, search queries, and other data. once collected, this information introduction\\nfor years, the road to news media financial sustainability was said to be \\npaved with data—digital news outlets were counseled to collect as many \\ndetails about their readers as possible. tracking audiences was considered \\nessential for optimizing search engine results, creating content that people want \\nto read, and supporting targeted advertising to fund journalism. \\nworldwide, citizens and \\npolicymakers are increasingly \\ncognizant of the risks that \\nthe burgeoning data economy \\nposes to personal privacy. 2 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgcould be sold to advertisers or further exchanged with other third parties. \\nit could even reach the hands of governments. \\nfrom a media development perspective, the failure of media outlets \\nto protect their visitors against invasive tracking by third parties is \\ntroubling for two reasons. first and most importantly, it places the \\nprivacy and safety of a publication’s readers in jeopardy. readers need \\nto feel confident that visiting independent news sites, especially those \\ncovering sensitive issues, will not put them in danger. second, from a \\nbusiness perspective, when publishers give away information about \\ntheir audiences for free, they cede valuable leverage for negotiating with \\nadvertisers. in essence, the outsourcing of analytics to third parties \\npotentially puts readers at risk and weakens a site’s ability to truly take \\nadvantage of the interactions it has with its readers. taken together, the \\nfindings of this study suggest an important new frontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and the need to build stronger awareness \\nabout and strategies for managing the threats posed by tracking the \\nreaders of independent media. \\nthis report also provides an overview of the latest regulatory \\ndevelopments in the data protection field, such as the european \\nunion’s general data protection regulation (gdpr). while much of the \\npublic debate has been about policy changes in europe, the impact \\nhas been much broader in geographic scope. the changes underway \\ndirectly impact independent news outlets in many developing countries. \\nthis review of new laws is followed by a detailed description of the \\nvarious trackers currently used on news websites, and the ways that \\nthey potentially come into conflict with new data protection laws \\nand regulations. then, the report analyzes research on web tracking \\ntechnologies used by news media websites in 10 developing countries, \\nexposing pervasive tracking that ultimately may not benefit either \\nthe readers or the news organizations themselves. and finally, it \\nconcludes with suggestions about how news organizations and other \\nmedia development stakeholders might be able to take advantage of \\nthe global shift in data protection laws and regulations to strengthen \\nindependent media. the findings of this study \\nsuggest an important new \\nfrontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and \\nthe need to build

generally accepted definition of privacy is “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine \\nfor themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. ”1\\nwhat are data protection laws?\\ndata protection laws are frameworks that seek to regulate the collection, storage, and processing of \\ninformation about individuals. \\nis all data protected by data protection laws?\\nno. data protection laws apply only to personal and sensitive information. data protection laws do not \\nprotect nonpersonal data,2 anonymized data, or public data.3 this is an important distinction because \\nmany common data analytic practices do not use personal information at all.\\nwhat is personal information?\\nthere is no universal definition of what is or is not personal information. however, a common definition \\nfound within many national laws and international agreements modelled after the european union’s \\ngdpr is that personal data “means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural \\nperson. ”4 some data elements very clearly count as personal or secret information, such as a name \\nor passport number. but the answer is not so straightforward for other elements. for example, a date \\nof birth in and of itself is not personal information. but if that can be combined with a street address \\nand one’s gender, it could be used to identify someone, and in that instance should be treated as \\npersonal information.5note: while privacy is a disputed concept in law and philosophy, and attitudes toward how personal information is used \\nvary from individual to individual, it is generally accepted that some data elements are more sensitive than others. figure 1.   the range of consumer

similar data sets to understand \\nreader preferences, follow up on stories, and create content that responds \\nto audience demand. personal information has come to be seen by some \\ncompanies as an

information is \\nbeing used. increasingly, however, there are regulatory barriers that restrict \\nthese activities.\\nas of march 2019, 134 countries had enacted data protection laws,6 \\nwhile 26

grown in social and economic importance, more and \\nmore people have begun engaging with technologies that surreptitiously \\nundermine their privacy. businesses have emerged with business models

\\nelements onto a webpage from a third party, or uses cookies. it would not \\nbe feasible for most entities to adhere to the unique laws of 134 countries; \\nhowever, it is also not necessary to do so. adopting the highest data \\nprotection standard available is the most straightforward approach to \\ncompliance. at this time, that standard is the european union’s general \\ndata protection regulation (gdpr). achieving compliance with the gdpr \\nand its principles of accountability and data minimization would place most \\nmedia organizations in good standing, even if they operate in a different \\nregulatory environment.\\nalthough european nations represent a minority of those jurisdictions with \\ndata protection laws, europe continues to have an outsized influence on \\nthe development of data protection laws in africa, asia, and the americas. \\nthis is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future because the council of \\nthe european union has advised the european commission that it cannot \\nnegotiate away privacy rights in trade agreements.8 countries that wish to \\ntrade with the european union, and, in particular, have data flows with the \\ntrading bloc, will thus face pressure to implement data protection laws that \\nare influenced by the european standard. figure 3.  countries with data protection laws\\nnote: most data protection laws apply to

individuals held by federal agencies. \\nthe act codified into law the recommendations developed by an independent \\nadvisory committee in 1973 that had analyzed the consequences of using electronic \\nsystems to maintain records about people.10 their report shaped our contemporary \\nunderstanding of information privacy and it remains relevant some four decades \\nlater. in short, the committee recommended adopting five principles: \\ndata protection laws \\nare frameworks that \\nseek to regulate the \\ncollection, storage, and \\nprocessing of information \\nabout\\xa0individuals. 7 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevcommerce, free expression, or freedom of association. whether this \\nbalance was successfully achieved remains hotly debated, but what is \\nuncontested is that this legislation forced companies around the world to \\nreview their data processing activities. \\ngdpr in a nutshell\\nthe gdpr codifies into law a risk-based approach to protecting the privacy \\nof natural persons. it requires privacy by design and by default, mandates \\naccountability for data controllers, and grants individuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure and to control and transparency over how \\ntheir personal information will be used. the gdpr states that personal \\ninformation must be retained for the shortest period of time possible and \\nthat there must be limits on who can access it. it also imposes significant \\nrestrictions on how and when personal information may be shared with \\nthird parties. further, the gdpr grants new protections to sensitive \\ninformation like medical data, and article 7 states that if an individual \\nis asked to consent to a data processing practice, their consent must \\nbe a “freely given, specific, and unambiguous” indication of their intent. \\nmost strikingly, the penalties for noncompliance are set at €20 million \\n($22.4 million) or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher, even \\nwhere there is no ill intent on the part of the data controller.\\nextraterritoriality\\na major difference between the gdpr and other data protection laws is \\nthat it has extraterritorial effect, meaning that enforcement is theoretically \\npossible outside of the borders of the european union. this has made \\neurope, in the eyes of some, the “world’s data police. ”11 the consequence \\nof this is that under the gdpr, even organizations outside of the european \\nunion must comply with the gdpr when they process data belonging to \\nindividuals in the european union. because of the global nature of the \\ninternet, it is easy to imagine a european resident who is protected by the \\ngdpr visiting the website of a publisher, say, in belarus or mongolia. at \\nleast in theory according to european union regulations, that belarusian \\nor mongolian publisher must adhere to the gdpr if collecting analytic data \\nabout that european resident. if such extraterritorial enforcement actually \\nhappens, there would be profound implications here for the digital media \\necosystem worldwide.\\nat this point in time it is difficult to know what obligations will actually \\nbe enforced on entities located outside of the european union. one of \\nthe largest ambiguities that the internet presents, when it comes to the \\napplicability of legislation, is that it is a space where conventional nation-\\nstate borders do not exist and where traditional modes of interstate legal \\ncooperation have struggled to keep pace with the realities of a web 2.0 the gdpr codifies into law \\na risk-based approach to \\nprotecting the privacy of natural \\npersons. it\\xa0requires privacy \\nby design and by default, \\nmandates accountability for \\ndata controllers, and grants \\nindividuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure \\nand to control and\\xa0transparency \\nover how their personal \\ninformation will be\\xa0used. 8 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgworld. this is why earlier data protection laws have been difficult to enforce \\nand why the european union, in the gdpr, has sought to make its legislation \\napplicable in all environments. the fear, however, is that this jurisdictional \\noverreach could lead to a legal arms race that could have unpredictable \\nand unintended consequences. so far, the gdpr’s enforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to impose penalties on data controllers outside of the \\neuropean union. in one notable example, the united kingdom’s information \\ncommissioner’s office sent a letter to the washington post  advising that \\nits website did not comply with the gdpr, but it did not take any formal \\nenforcement action.12 this suggests that, at least for now, the european \\nunion will rely on indirect means of enforcing the gdpr outside of its \\nborders, incentivizing self-compliance through fear of reputational damage.\\ngdpr is the new global standard\\nt en countries outside of europe have now updated their earlier data \\nprotection bills to enact many (or all) of the principles contained within \\nthe gdpr. this trend appears to be continuing, with new or updated bills \\npending in algeria, indonesia, thailand, and t unisia that appear to have \\nbeen modelled after the gdpr. pakistan, which does not have any data \\nprotection legislation at present, currently has a bill under consideration \\nthat would adopt large chunks of the gdpr. \\n“i assume that lawmakers just copied and pasted the gdpr and left some \\nthings out actually, ” said salwa rana, legal officer at media matters for \\ndemocracy in pakistan.13 “and these things were that you need to inform \\nthe data subject of any leak that takes place, that the data subject has \\nthe right to be forgotten, and extraterritoriality. ” rana said the question \\nof extraterritorial application is one that remains unaddressed. “this was \\none of the main questions that was raised in one of our consultations: is \\nenforcement of the law going to be limited to pakistan? the problem is that \\nwe have the federal investigation authority which is going to be responsible \\nfor any violations under this law outside of pakistan, yet under the \\nproposed legislation, they haven’t given them any power. ” while the gdpr’s \\nexemptions for journalistic activities remain in the proposed bill, media \\norganizations in pakistan have not been actively involved in drafting this \\nlaw. “there hasn’t been much response from media companies, but i feel \\nlike the way this law is going, they are going to have to begin participating. ”\\nregardless of whether or not more countries adopt the gdpr’s provisions, \\ngiven the global nature of the internet and many businesses’ desire to trade \\nwith member states of the european union, a need to comply with the \\ngdpr has incentivized businesses such as microsoft to voluntarily adopt \\nhigher privacy and data protection standards for their entire operations \\nworldwide, even where they are under no legal obligation to do so.14so far, the gdpr’s \\nenforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to \\nimpose penalties on data \\ncontrollers outside of \\nthe\\xa0european union. 9 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevgdpr implications for the media industry\\narticle 4 (7) of the gdpr defines a data controller as “the natural or legal \\nperson, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly \\nwith others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of \\npersonal data. ” by this broad definition, it is difficult to imagine any media \\norganization with either a list of subscribers or a website with analytic \\nfunctions that would not  be considered a data controller. as a result, any \\njournalistic institution whose content is accessible to european residents \\nwill need to think carefully about how the gdpr may impact their \\nbusiness development activities or editorial functions. some potential \\nramifications include the following:\\nimpacts on newsgathering\\nthe gdpr states  that the \\n… processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the \\npurposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject \\nto derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation \\nif necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with \\nthe right to freedom of expression and information.15\\nwhile this language provides the media with significant leeway to be able \\nto publish journalistic work, it does not assist journalists in accessing \\ninformation for journalistic purposes.\\nioana avadani, executive director of the center for independent \\njournalism in bucharest, said the gdpr has been used in romania to \\nprotect those in positions of power.16 “what we witnessed immediately \\nafter the gdpr is that institutions started to invoke the gdpr as a \\nreason not to release information, ” she said. “they were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, so what they got is just another reason, and \\nthey are very happy that this is a legal reason to justify their less-than-\\ntransparent attitude. ” \\navadani pointed to an example of a protest that occurred in august 2018 \\nwhere riot police in bucharest behaved in a violent manner and physically \\nassaulted demonstrators. after a journalist asked who had authorized this \\naction, the police invoked the gdpr and refused to name the authorizing \\nofficer. “it was a clear case of public information, and they still refused \\nto say it because they wanted to protect the government, ” said avadani. \\ntheir next reaction was to use the gdpr to attempt to force the journalist \\nto reveal their source, claiming the police department had an obligation \\nunder the gdpr to investigate a data breach. “it was not a genuine \\nconcern for the protection of the police officer’s privacy, it was just a way \\nto protect the authorities. ” \\n© urban fenix / shutterstock.com\\n“what we witnessed \\nimmediately after the gdpr \\nis that institutions started to \\ninvoke the gdpr as a reason \\nnot to release information…\\nthey were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, \\nso what they got is just \\nanother reason, and they are \\nvery happy that this is a legal \\nreason to justify their less-\\nthan-transparent attitude.”\\n— ioana avadani,\\ncenter for independent  \\njournalism in bucharest10 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgthis is not the only case of the gdpr being abused in romania. rise \\nproject, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, was threatened \\nwith a €20 million ($22.4 million) fine from romania’s data protection \\nauthority after publishing a post on facebook that accused a prominent \\nromanian politician of theft. rise project subsequently published a letter \\nit had received from the national supervisory authority for personal data \\nprocessing, which demanded that it disclose within 10 days “how and when \\nrise project obtained the information ultimately posted to facebook, who \\ntheir source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal \\ninformation rise project has on [the politician] and their friends, ”17 or \\nface a penalty of €20 million. while it is doubtful such a fine would stand \\nup in the highest courts of the european union, for smaller media outlets \\nthe fear of costly, ongoing litigation could ultimately have a chilling \\neffect on journalism.\\n“right to erasure” impact\\nthe “right to erasure, ” also known as the right to be forgotten, has garnered \\nsignificant attention but is often misunderstood. the right is not absolute, \\nwith article 17 (3) of the gdpr offering a public interest exemption \\nintended to safeguard against predicted abuses. the problem is that \\nthe gdpr’s recital 153 states  that “member states law should reconcile \\nthe rules governing freedom of expression and information, including \\njournalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to \\nthe protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation. ”18 this means \\nthat there could be a patchwork quilt of interpretations for how this article \\nshould be implemented. unfortunately, in romania, the data protection \\nauthority has settled upon a definition that seems to have prioritized the \\nright to privacy over freedom of expression in all circumstances.\\nziarul de iasi,  a local newspaper in romania with a circulation of 5,000 \\ncopies per week, received a right to erasure request to delete an article \\nfrom its online archive. after the newspaper refused to remove an article \\nfrom nine years earlier about a public figure who had engaged in improper \\nbehavior, the national supervisory authority for personal data processing \\nsent a letter imposing a fine of 3,000 leu ($725) per day until the article \\nwas deleted. “for a local newspaper this is huge, ” said avadani. “in this \\nparticular case, ziarul de iasi  is going to challenge the request in court. \\nhowever the editor-in-chief told me if he keeps receiving requests like this, \\nhe may not be able to afford to keep challenging them. ”while it is doubtful such \\na fine would stand up in \\nthe highest courts of the \\neuropean union, for smaller \\nmedia outlets the fear of \\ncostly, ongoing litigation \\ncould ultimately have a \\nchilling effect on\\xa0journalism.11 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevimpacts on internal operations and website functionality\\nunder the gdpr, data controllers are obligated to ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices and the data processing practices of third \\nparties comply with the regulation. this necessarily requires that media \\norganizations more closely scrutinize the activities of the third-party \\nvendors they work with. \\nala’a alzghoul, an information systems specialist with arab reporters \\nfor investigative journalism in jordan, explained how the gdpr \\nprompted his organization to develop internal procedures for assessing \\nhow third parties handle personal information.19 “for example, we use \\ngoogle analytics to collect some data for the user experience. before we \\nadded their plug-in, we first read the privacy policy of google analytics \\nand asked for every detail as to what data this tool is collecting, we \\ntracked what they actually do, and we mention those details in our \\nprivacy policy. ” alzghoul explained that the gdpr also prompted arab \\nreporters for investigative journalism to develop new procedures for \\nhandling personal information. “t o prevent any data leakages, we moved \\nfrom regular databases to encrypted databases, ” he said. “we have a \\nnew policy to protect the personal data that we collect, and to prevent \\nemployees [from] just copying the data onto their laptops. but this \\nhappened because of the gdpr, not because we were afraid of the laws \\nhere in jordan. ”under the gdpr, data \\ncontrollers are obligated \\nto ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices \\nand the data processing \\npractices of third parties \\ncomply with the\\xa0regulation. \\n©

buys a printed newspaper, they \\nreceive a complete product. but when a visitor browses a webpage, \\ntheir web browser does not download one file. rather, the web browser \\nreads the code, downloads the required content from various sources, and \\nrenders the page. this all happens in milliseconds. the output may appear to \\nthe reader as one complete package, but more happens behind

for example, if you visit \\nhttps:/ /es .mercopress.com …13 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevwhen content is being downloaded, the browser sends an http request to \\neither retrieve information from a server or send data to a server.20 as part \\nof this interaction, the server obtains the visitor’s ip address to learn who \\nit is interacting with. y ou could think of an ip address as the return address \\non a letter you mail; it is a unique number that essentially identifies you by \\nthe device you’re using to connect to the internet, and can be linked to all \\nthe online activity you engage in on that device. \\nwhen first-party content is downloaded, a website visitor would reasonably \\nexpect that they are sharing their ip address to access that content. the \\nsituation becomes murkier with third-party content. because the website \\nviewer’s ip address is being collected by an external source with which \\nthey do not have a direct relationship—and since these third-party content \\nelements can either be invisible, blend into the webpage, or just load on the \\nwebpage without the individual’s explicit consent—their ip address would \\nbe collected by a third party without the individual’s knowledge or approval. \\nmoreover, it is rare that only an ip address will be captured. while an ip \\naddress does constitute personal information, it is extremely common \\nfor third parties to collect information on individuals through cookies, \\nweb beacons, and application program interfaces, among other technical \\nmeasures, as people browse digital properties. these allow for individuals \\nto be targeted in a much more granular manner and to be tracked across \\nthe entire internet.when first-party content is \\ndownloaded, a website visitor \\nwould reasonably expect \\nthat they are sharing their ip \\naddress to access that content. \\nthe situation becomes murkier \\nwith third-party content. \\nhow website visitors are tracked\\ncookie a cookie is a message that a server sends to a web browser to store on the website visitor’s \\ncomputer. this file is then sent back to the server each time the visitor’s web browser requests \\ncontent from that particular server.\\nweb beacon a web beacon is a small image, usually one pixel by one pixel in size, that is discretely placed on \\na website to monitor visitor behavior. when the image loads, the web beacon passes information \\nalong to the server where the image is stored, including the ip address of the computer that \\nretrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the \\nimage, and cookie values.\\napplication \\nprogram \\ninterfacean application program interface determines how different software applications and \\ncomponents should interact with others. they are building blocks that website developers can use \\nto pull and share data. for instance, amazon’s product advertising application program interface \\nallows another website to search amazon’s product inventory and to then add personalized \\nfunctions to its website advertising amazon’s products.14 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orghistorically it has even been possible for companies to track website \\nviewers without using cookies or web beacons or deploying application \\nprogram interfaces. there are various fingerprinting algorithms that \\nhave enabled data sets to be analyzed in a manner that, for all practical \\npurposes, could uniquely identify an individual with a high degree of \\naccuracy. when a visitor downloads a file from a third party, the third \\nparty necessarily obtains a user agent string (the website visitor’s \\noperating system, web browser type, and version number) and accepts \\nheaders (the type, version, and capabilities of the browser that is making \\nthe request so that the server returns compatible data). if javascript \\nis enabled, it can communicate the names of browser plug-ins that \\nare installed, and these plug-ins can be called upon to share system-\\nspecific attributes. many of these attributes are, in and of themselves, \\nharmless, but when aggregated, can effectively and easily lead to the \\nidentification of a user.21 \\nt o grasp how the tracking of readers involves a variety of distinct and \\nindependent entities, imagine a scenario in which an individual lands on \\na fictitious new site, newswebsite.com, to read an article on nutrition. \\nthe reader’s presence on the site is collected by analytics.com, a \\nthird-party audience measurement tool firm that newswebsite.com \\nhas enabled on its website. analytics.com collects data from millions \\nof websites using cookies, and this data could include the visitor’s past \\nshopping behavior, interests, time zone, ethnicity, browser language \\npreferences, and gender, among other information. based on these data \\ncompiled by analytics.com, another third-party, shopping.com, knows \\nthat the visitor is female, aged 40, and previously spent $60 on a book. \\nshopping.com could now infer that the visitor is likely to be interested \\nin hardcover recipe books, and so sends a request to advertising.com \\nto load an advertisement for a hardcover recipe book on the next page \\nthat the visitor loads on the newswebsites.com site. in this scenario, \\npersonal data about the reader would have been circulated with at \\nleast four different entities, some of which the reader herself might not \\neven know about.\\nover the past three years web browsers and mobile devices have \\nbegun masking header information by default. this reduces, but does \\nnot entirely eliminate, the potential for reidentification through this \\nmanner. these changes have arguably been implemented in reaction \\nto new privacy regulations like the gdpr, which oblige data controllers \\nto provide individuals with an effective means of exercising their data \\nrights. users with older mobile devices or web browsers that have \\nnot been updated may be particularly vulnerable to identification \\nthrough fingerprinting.there are various \\nfingerprinting algorithms \\nthat have enabled data sets \\nto be analyzed in a manner \\nthat, for all practical

also result in higher revenue from direct sales \\nnegotiations. if advertisements are not targeted to the individual website viewer and \\nare instead of a general nature, this is fairly simple to resolve. provided no personal \\ninformation about the website viewers is exchanged with the advertiser, no privacy \\nviolations can occur. much, if not all, of the information typically found in a media kit \\nabout audience demographics does not constitute personal information. \\nif personal information is to be exchanged with third parties, a careful assessment \\nwill need to be conducted before this happens. this assessment must consider both \\nthe fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, their reasonable \\nexpectations for how and why their personal information would be used, and the \\ngrounds for why and how the third party would reasonably use those data.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\naudience \\nmeasurementthere are audience measurement tools that can be self-hosted, such as cryptolog, \\nwhich allows both internal analytical logging and total control over how long data \\nare retained. however, these tools are not as easy to use as third-party ones and are \\nnot as rich in features. significant training may be required to learn how to use them \\neffectively.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\ncontinues next pageimmediate privacy gains are possible\\naround the world, data protection laws and regulations are changing the \\ndigital ecosystem; by extension, they are changing the online publishing \\nworld too. coming into compliance with new data protection laws like \\nthe gdpr and other applicable regimes can be difficult, and that appears to be \\na leading reason that some website owners have not taken action. \\none simpler mechanism of coming into compliance with the gdpr is to migrate away from using third-\\nparty tools, services, and applications and to instead use self-hosted tools. this immediately limits \\nexposure to the data collection and processing practices of third parties, and grants readers a greater \\ndegree of privacy protection, as information that could lead to their identification will no longer be \\ncirculating outside of the websites they’re visiting. 21 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevmoving from third party to first party (in alphabetical order)\\ncontent hosting not all content needs to be hosted by third parties. for example, if a website uses a \\nthird-party font library, the site could be changed to use either default browser fonts \\nor self-hosted fonts to provide an immediate privacy gain for visitors.\\nit may not be feasible to self-host all content. video hosting, for example, can be very \\nresource intensive and expensive. however, website owners may wish to investigate \\nwhich third-party video hosts are out there, and how (if at all) they use visitor data. \\nyoutube, for example, offers “privacy enhancing mode, ” which “allows you to embed \\nyoutube videos without using cookies that track viewing behavior. ”24 however, it is \\ndisabled by default and so action is required by the website’s publisher to benefit \\nfrom this privacy gain.\\nease of migration:  easy \\ndesign \\noptimizationself-hosted design testing tools may not offer all of the functions of those of third \\nparties. it might be a better idea to review the privacy policy of any tools that are \\nused, and to make sure they respect the privacy of visitors. as most of these services \\nare paid tools and involve some kind of contractual relationship, it is likely possible to \\nfind a design testing tool that does not share or unnecessarily retain audience data.\\nease of migration:  possibly not necessary \\nrecommendation \\nsystemsrecommendation engines are a major source of third-party cookies. while they \\nmay look harmless and may improve the appearance and functionality of a website, \\nthey can also be trojan horses, inserting hundreds of third-party trackers into \\nevery page of a website (including malware, in some instances). these tools can \\nalso be used to direct viewers to content that belongs to another publisher, or to \\ninject misinformation or misleading stories onto your webpage. website owners \\nwho cannot develop their own content recommendation engines may be better off \\neliminating the use of these third-party tools altogether.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\nsocial media \\nshare buttonssome of the most significant privacy violations we saw came from deploying social \\nmedia share buttons. embedding a facebook “like” button into a webpage enables \\nthat platform to be able to link a user’s reading and browsing history to their \\nfacebook account. however, it is not necessary to use facebook’s default “like” \\nbutton to encourage sharing news articles on facebook. there are self-hosted social \\nsharing plug-ins that transmit less personal information to third parties that may be \\nused instead. \\nease of migration:  easy \\nvisualizations many third-party visualization tools offer self-hosted deployments, though some \\ntechnical knowledge may be required to synchronize their visual interfaces with local \\ndeployment. others do not pose significant privacy risks because as paid tools they \\noffer contractual assurances around how they will or will not use data.\\nease of migration:  easy 22 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgindeed, the findings in this report reveal that the current level of \\npreparedness among smaller media companies in the global south \\nto protect their readers from being identified and to protect the \\ncommercial value of their analytics data is low. experts consulted for \\nthis report said that this is unfortunate as many of the most common \\ndata analytic practices that independent media outlets engage in and \\nbenefit from do not require the use of personal information at all. \\nwhile it will take additional effort by website operators, safeguarding \\nthe privacy rights of visitors may be good for business. this, in \\nturn, could help improve the commercial viability of independent \\nmedia. research from the world economic forum shows that in \\nthe $3 trillion global data economy, online news sites are unusually \\nwell-trusted relative to search engines, social networking platforms, \\nand even financial institutions.25 y et, so far, a handful of players \\nlike facebook and google have led the business of online data \\ncollection and marketing, which has allowed them to harness the \\nvalue of the data that they have collected from websites whose \\ncontent they do not control. this research reveals that independent \\nmedia websites commonly leak personal information to third parties \\nunder the following scenarios: when analytic tools are used to \\nmeasure audience demographics, when split tests are conducted \\nto experiment with new website design features, when social media \\n“share” buttons are embedded into webpages, or when content \\nrecommendation engines are deployed to personalize a website’s \\ncontent to make it relevant to the reader. \\nmaintaining and building upon the high degree of trust that exists \\nbetween a publisher and its readers may be the long-term solution conclusion and recommendations\\na year after a new wave of data protection regulations such as the european \\nunion’s gdpr have come into effect, the websites of media outlets continue \\ncollecting great volumes of personal information—but often unintentionally, \\nand typically for other parties. that so many media institutions have failed to \\nsafeguard this asset—to both protect the privacy and safety of their readers and \\nto be in a better negotiating position with advertisers—suggests that education, \\ncapacity building, and direct support of independent news outlets is needed to \\nimprove their analytics activities and ensure that they safeguard reader privacy. \\nwhile it will take \\nadditional effort by \\nwebsite operators, \\nsafeguarding the privacy \\nrights of visitors may be \\ngood for business. 23 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevto addressing data privacy concerns while simultaneously developing \\nan effective business model. “media sustainability in the long run \\nis actually going to be based on your own user base rather than \\nthat of advertisers, ” said tanja maksic, a researcher with the balkan \\ninvestigative reporting network.26 this, in turn, could result in digital \\npublishers developing greater negotiating power and leverage with \\nthird-party advertising exchanges or, alternatively, being able to sell \\npremium subscriptions to readers. “look at your internal organization, \\nwhat you are collecting, what you are doing with it, how you are \\nprotecting it, ” said maksic, “and craft your economic sustainability \\naround your user base and meet their demands and their standards. ” \\nlouise marie hurel, an internet governance researcher at brazil’s \\nigarapé institute, agreed. “i think this is inevitable really. enforcement \\nof data protection laws may be ad hoc, but that same degree of \\nuncertainty should not mark your relationship with users who are \\naccessing your content. ”27\\nfrom a media development perspective, news organizations around \\nthe world need better support and training on how to safeguard their \\nvaluable audience data, both to protect the privacy rights of their \\nreaders and for commercial purposes. practical primers on complying \\nwith data protection laws and regulations, sharing best practices, \\nregularly auditing websites to understand what tracking devices \\nare present and what they are doing with data, and developing and \\nexchanging benchmarking information could all help smaller media \\noutlets find a competitive advantage over the advertising networks and \\nplatforms that have absorbed the bulk of online advertising dollars to \\ndate. ultimately, a new business model for journalism will require both \\nsavvy use of data and an abiding respect for readers’ privacy.from a media development \\nperspective, news \\norganizations around the \\nworld need better support \\nand training on how to \\nsafeguard their valuable \\naudience data, both to

started as a way to improve the user experience came with \\na downside for website viewers: it entailed collecting and processing \\ntheir personal information, often without their knowledge or consent. \\nmoreover, the drive to collect data has resulted in many independent \\nmedia outlets in the global south unknowingly permitting third parties, \\nmany of which cannot be identified, to invasively monitor their visitors.\\nworldwide, citizens and policymakers are increasingly cognizant of \\nthe risks that the burgeoning data economy poses to personal privacy. \\nin recent years, a wave of next-generation data protection laws have \\nemerged that seek to restrict the collection, usage, and sharing of \\npersonal information. this is not necessarily a good news story for \\nthose news institutions that had successfully harnessed the value of \\nanalytics to grow advertising revenue or to better understand their \\naudiences. these data protection regulations have, by design, severely \\nhampered the environment within which many smaller digital media \\noutlets operate. while these laws do not entirely restrict the use of \\nanalytics, they do restrict the use of analytic applications that place \\npeople at risk of harm. indeed, there is growing evidence that some of \\nthe tracking mechanisms employed by digital news sites are potentially \\ndoing just that.\\nt o get a better understanding of how new privacy regimes will affect \\nmedia in the global south, this paper assembles a new set of findings \\non the websites of 50 small, independent news publishers from 10 \\ndeveloping countries. it shows that third-party trackers are collecting \\naudience data when people read articles, write comments, send in news \\ntips, and share pieces on social networking platforms. one independent \\npublisher in nigeria, for instance, had 523 third-party cookies on its \\nhomepage collecting audience information. in total, over 150 companies—\\nnot all of which could be identified—were found to be invisibly tracking the \\nvisitors to these 50 websites. they were collecting ip addresses, which \\ncan identify geographic locations, the titles and urls of news articles \\nread, search queries, and other data. once collected, this information introduction\\nfor years, the road to news media financial sustainability was said to be \\npaved with data—digital news outlets were counseled to collect as many \\ndetails about their readers as possible. tracking audiences was considered \\nessential for optimizing search engine results, creating content that people want \\nto read, and supporting targeted advertising to fund journalism. \\nworldwide, citizens and \\npolicymakers are increasingly \\ncognizant of the risks that \\nthe burgeoning data economy \\nposes to personal privacy. 2 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgcould be sold to advertisers or further exchanged with other third parties. \\nit could even reach the hands of governments. \\nfrom a media development perspective, the failure of media outlets \\nto protect their visitors against invasive tracking by third parties is \\ntroubling for two reasons. first and most importantly, it places the \\nprivacy and safety of a publication’s readers in jeopardy. readers need \\nto feel confident that visiting independent news sites, especially those \\ncovering sensitive issues, will not put them in danger. second, from a \\nbusiness perspective, when publishers give away information about \\ntheir audiences for free, they cede valuable leverage for negotiating with \\nadvertisers. in essence, the outsourcing of analytics to third parties \\npotentially puts readers at risk and weakens a site’s ability to truly take \\nadvantage of the interactions it has with its readers. taken together, the \\nfindings of this study suggest an important new frontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and the need to build stronger awareness \\nabout and strategies for managing the threats posed by tracking the \\nreaders of independent media. \\nthis report also provides an overview of the latest regulatory \\ndevelopments in the data protection field, such as the european \\nunion’s general data protection regulation (gdpr). while much of the \\npublic debate has been about policy changes in europe, the impact \\nhas been much broader in geographic scope. the changes underway \\ndirectly impact independent news outlets in many developing countries. \\nthis review of new laws is followed by a detailed description of the \\nvarious trackers currently used on news websites, and the ways that \\nthey potentially come into conflict with new data protection laws \\nand regulations. then, the report analyzes research on web tracking \\ntechnologies used by news media websites in 10 developing countries, \\nexposing pervasive tracking that ultimately may not benefit either \\nthe readers or the news organizations themselves. and finally, it \\nconcludes with suggestions about how news organizations and other \\nmedia development stakeholders might be able to take advantage of \\nthe global shift in data protection laws and regulations to strengthen \\nindependent media. the findings of this study \\nsuggest an important new \\nfrontier for the media \\ndevelopment community and \\nthe need to build

generally accepted definition of privacy is “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine \\nfor themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. ”1\\nwhat are data protection laws?\\ndata protection laws are frameworks that seek to regulate the collection, storage, and processing of \\ninformation about individuals. \\nis all data protected by data protection laws?\\nno. data protection laws apply only to personal and sensitive information. data protection laws do not \\nprotect nonpersonal data,2 anonymized data, or public data.3 this is an important distinction because \\nmany common data analytic practices do not use personal information at all.\\nwhat is personal information?\\nthere is no universal definition of what is or is not personal information. however, a common definition \\nfound within many national laws and international agreements modelled after the european union’s \\ngdpr is that personal data “means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural \\nperson. ”4 some data elements very clearly count as personal or secret information, such as a name \\nor passport number. but the answer is not so straightforward for other elements. for example, a date \\nof birth in and of itself is not personal information. but if that can be combined with a street address \\nand one’s gender, it could be used to identify someone, and in that instance should be treated as \\npersonal information.5note: while privacy is a disputed concept in law and philosophy, and attitudes toward how personal information is used \\nvary from individual to individual, it is generally accepted that some data elements are more sensitive than others. figure 1.   the range of consumer

for independent media around the world   #mediadevand journalistic institutions. these laws are particularly likely to apply \\nif a news organization’s website collects data about its audience, loads \\nelements onto a webpage from a third party, or uses cookies. it would not \\nbe feasible for most entities to adhere to the unique laws of 134 countries; \\nhowever, it is also not necessary to do so. adopting the highest data \\nprotection standard available is the most straightforward approach to \\ncompliance. at this time, that standard is the european union’s general \\ndata protection regulation (gdpr). achieving compliance with the gdpr \\nand its principles of accountability and data minimization would place most \\nmedia organizations in good standing, even if they operate in a different \\nregulatory environment.\\nalthough european nations represent a minority of those jurisdictions with \\ndata protection laws, europe continues to have an outsized influence on \\nthe development of data protection laws in africa, asia, and the americas. \\nthis is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future because the council of \\nthe european union has advised the european commission that it cannot \\nnegotiate away privacy rights in trade agreements.8 countries that wish to \\ntrade with the european union, and, in particular, have data flows with the \\ntrading bloc, will thus face pressure to implement data protection laws that \\nare influenced by the european standard. figure 3.  countries with data protection laws\\nnote: most data protection laws apply to

systems. \\n2 individuals must be able to find out what information \\nabout them is in a record and how it is used. \\n3 information cannot be obtained for one purpose and then used for \\nanother purpose without the consent of the individual concerned. \\n4 there must exist a right to correct inaccurate records. \\n5 organizations are responsible for ensuring that their \\nrecord-keeping systems are secure and reliable, and \\nmust take precautions to prevent the misuse of data. \\nfollowing the passage and implementation of the act, the united states \\nadvocated for these principles internationally. t oday, they can be found \\nin every major privacy protection instrument, including the african \\nunion convention on cyber security and personal data protection, \\nthe asia-pacific economic cooperation’s cross-border privacy rules, \\nthe organisation of eastern caribbean states’ data protection bill, the \\norganisation for economic co-operation and development’s guidelines \\non the protection of privacy and t ransborder flows of personal data, the \\ncouncil of europe’s convention for the protection of individuals with regard \\nto automatic processing of personal data, the european union’s data \\nprotection directive, and the gdpr.\\nthe gdpr came into effect in 2018. it was a major revision to european \\nlaw that significantly built upon the principles contained within the us \\nprivacy act of 1974 and the values advanced within the eu data protection \\ndirective of 1995, aiming to prohibit the excessive collection, use, and \\ndisclosure of personal information without disproportionately impeding key historical developments in privacy law\\nprivacy rules and norms that govern action or inaction related to our personal \\ninformation have been interpreted in a similar way around the world for \\nsome time. in 1974 the united states adopted the privacy act,9 a federal law \\nthat sought to safeguard information about individuals held by federal agencies. \\nthe act codified into law the recommendations developed by an independent \\nadvisory committee in 1973 that had analyzed the consequences of using electronic \\nsystems to maintain records about people.10 their report shaped our contemporary \\nunderstanding of information privacy and it remains relevant some four decades \\nlater. in short, the committee recommended adopting five principles: \\ndata protection laws \\nare frameworks that \\nseek to regulate the \\ncollection, storage, and \\nprocessing of information \\nabout\\xa0individuals. 7 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevcommerce, free expression, or freedom of association. whether this \\nbalance was successfully achieved remains hotly debated, but what is \\nuncontested is that this legislation forced companies around the world to \\nreview their data processing activities. \\ngdpr in a nutshell\\nthe gdpr codifies into law a risk-based approach to protecting the privacy \\nof natural persons. it requires privacy by design and by default, mandates \\naccountability for data controllers, and grants individuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure and to control and transparency over how \\ntheir personal information will be used. the gdpr states that personal \\ninformation must be retained for the shortest period of time possible and \\nthat there must be limits on who can access it. it also imposes significant \\nrestrictions on how and when personal information may be shared with \\nthird parties. further, the gdpr grants new protections to sensitive \\ninformation like medical data, and article 7 states that if an individual \\nis asked to consent to a data processing practice, their consent must \\nbe a “freely given, specific, and unambiguous” indication of their intent. \\nmost strikingly, the penalties for noncompliance are set at €20 million \\n($22.4 million) or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher, even \\nwhere there is no ill intent on the part of the data controller.\\nextraterritoriality\\na major difference between the gdpr and other data protection laws is \\nthat it has extraterritorial effect, meaning that enforcement is theoretically \\npossible outside of the borders of the european union. this has made \\neurope, in the eyes of some, the “world’s data police. ”11 the consequence \\nof this is that under the gdpr, even organizations outside of the european \\nunion must comply with the gdpr when they process data belonging to \\nindividuals in the european union. because of the global nature of the \\ninternet, it is easy to imagine a european resident who is protected by the \\ngdpr visiting the website of a publisher, say, in belarus or mongolia. at \\nleast in theory according to european union regulations, that belarusian \\nor mongolian publisher must adhere to the gdpr if collecting analytic data \\nabout that european resident. if such extraterritorial enforcement actually \\nhappens, there would be profound implications here for the digital media \\necosystem worldwide.\\nat this point in time it is difficult to know what obligations will actually \\nbe enforced on entities located outside of the european union. one of \\nthe largest ambiguities that the internet presents, when it comes to the \\napplicability of legislation, is that it is a space where conventional nation-\\nstate borders do not exist and where traditional modes of interstate legal \\ncooperation have struggled to keep pace with the realities of a web 2.0 the gdpr codifies into law \\na risk-based approach to \\nprotecting the privacy of natural \\npersons. it\\xa0requires privacy \\nby design and by default, \\nmandates accountability for \\ndata controllers, and grants \\nindividuals new rights, \\nincluding the rights to erasure \\nand to control and\\xa0transparency \\nover how their personal \\ninformation will be\\xa0used. 8 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgworld. this is why earlier data protection laws have been difficult to enforce \\nand why the european union, in the gdpr, has sought to make its legislation \\napplicable in all environments. the fear, however, is that this jurisdictional \\noverreach could lead to a legal arms race that could have unpredictable \\nand unintended consequences. so far, the gdpr’s enforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to impose penalties on data controllers outside of the \\neuropean union. in one notable example, the united kingdom’s information \\ncommissioner’s office sent a letter to the washington post  advising that \\nits website did not comply with the gdpr, but it did not take any formal \\nenforcement action.12 this suggests that, at least for now, the european \\nunion will rely on indirect means of enforcing the gdpr outside of its \\nborders, incentivizing self-compliance through fear of reputational damage.\\ngdpr is the new global standard\\nt en countries outside of europe have now updated their earlier data \\nprotection bills to enact many (or all) of the principles contained within \\nthe gdpr. this trend appears to be continuing, with new or updated bills \\npending in algeria, indonesia, thailand, and t unisia that appear to have \\nbeen modelled after the gdpr. pakistan, which does not have any data \\nprotection legislation at present, currently has a bill under consideration \\nthat would adopt large chunks of the gdpr. \\n“i assume that lawmakers just copied and pasted the gdpr and left some \\nthings out actually, ” said salwa rana, legal officer at media matters for \\ndemocracy in pakistan.13 “and these things were that you need to inform \\nthe data subject of any leak that takes place, that the data subject has \\nthe right to be forgotten, and extraterritoriality. ” rana said the question \\nof extraterritorial application is one that remains unaddressed. “this was \\none of the main questions that was raised in one of our consultations: is \\nenforcement of the law going to be limited to pakistan? the problem is that \\nwe have the federal investigation authority which is going to be responsible \\nfor any violations under this law outside of pakistan, yet under the \\nproposed legislation, they haven’t given them any power. ” while the gdpr’s \\nexemptions for journalistic activities remain in the proposed bill, media \\norganizations in pakistan have not been actively involved in drafting this \\nlaw. “there hasn’t been much response from media companies, but i feel \\nlike the way this law is going, they are going to have to begin participating. ”\\nregardless of whether or not more countries adopt the gdpr’s provisions, \\ngiven the global nature of the internet and many businesses’ desire to trade \\nwith member states of the european union, a need to comply with the \\ngdpr has incentivized businesses such as microsoft to voluntarily adopt \\nhigher privacy and data protection standards for their entire operations \\nworldwide, even where they are under no legal obligation to do so.14so far, the gdpr’s \\nenforcement bodies \\nhave been reluctant to \\nimpose penalties on data \\ncontrollers outside of \\nthe\\xa0european union. 9 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevgdpr implications for the media industry\\narticle 4 (7) of the gdpr defines a data controller as “the natural or legal \\nperson, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly \\nwith others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of \\npersonal data. ” by this broad definition, it is difficult to imagine any media \\norganization with either a list of subscribers or a website with analytic \\nfunctions that would not  be considered a data controller. as a result, any \\njournalistic institution whose content is accessible to european residents \\nwill need to think carefully about how the gdpr may impact their \\nbusiness development activities or editorial functions. some potential \\nramifications include the following:\\nimpacts on newsgathering\\nthe gdpr states  that the \\n… processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the \\npurposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject \\nto derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation \\nif necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with \\nthe right to freedom of expression and information.15\\nwhile this language provides the media with significant leeway to be able \\nto publish journalistic work, it does not assist journalists in accessing \\ninformation for journalistic purposes.\\nioana avadani, executive director of the center for independent \\njournalism in bucharest, said the gdpr has been used in romania to \\nprotect those in positions of power.16 “what we witnessed immediately \\nafter the gdpr is that institutions started to invoke the gdpr as a \\nreason not to release information, ” she said. “they were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, so what they got is just another reason, and \\nthey are very happy that this is a legal reason to justify their less-than-\\ntransparent attitude. ” \\navadani pointed to an example of a protest that occurred in august 2018 \\nwhere riot police in bucharest behaved in a violent manner and physically \\nassaulted demonstrators. after a journalist asked who had authorized this \\naction, the police invoked the gdpr and refused to name the authorizing \\nofficer. “it was a clear case of public information, and they still refused \\nto say it because they wanted to protect the government, ” said avadani. \\ntheir next reaction was to use the gdpr to attempt to force the journalist \\nto reveal their source, claiming the police department had an obligation \\nunder the gdpr to investigate a data breach. “it was not a genuine \\nconcern for the protection of the police officer’s privacy, it was just a way \\nto protect the authorities. ” \\n© urban fenix / shutterstock.com\\n“what we witnessed \\nimmediately after the gdpr \\nis that institutions started to \\ninvoke the gdpr as a reason \\nnot to release information…\\nthey were not keen on \\nreleasing information before, \\nso what they got is just \\nanother reason, and they are \\nvery happy that this is a legal \\nreason to justify their less-\\nthan-transparent attitude.”\\n— ioana avadani,\\ncenter for independent  \\njournalism in bucharest10 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgthis is not the only case of the gdpr being abused in romania. rise \\nproject, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, was threatened \\nwith a €20 million ($22.4 million) fine from romania’s data protection \\nauthority after publishing a post on facebook that accused a prominent \\nromanian politician of theft. rise project subsequently published a letter \\nit had received from the national supervisory authority for personal data \\nprocessing, which demanded that it disclose within 10 days “how and when \\nrise project obtained the information ultimately posted to facebook, who \\ntheir source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal \\ninformation rise project has on [the politician] and their friends, ”17 or \\nface a penalty of €20 million. while it is doubtful such a fine would stand \\nup in the highest courts of the european union, for smaller media outlets \\nthe fear of costly, ongoing litigation could ultimately have a chilling \\neffect on journalism.\\n“right to erasure” impact\\nthe “right to erasure, ” also known as the right to be forgotten, has garnered \\nsignificant attention but is often misunderstood. the right is not absolute, \\nwith article 17 (3) of the gdpr offering a public interest exemption \\nintended to safeguard against predicted abuses. the problem is that \\nthe gdpr’s recital 153 states  that “member states law should reconcile \\nthe rules governing freedom of expression and information, including \\njournalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to \\nthe protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation. ”18 this means \\nthat there could be a patchwork quilt of interpretations for how this article \\nshould be implemented. unfortunately, in romania, the data protection \\nauthority has settled upon a definition that seems to have prioritized the \\nright to privacy over freedom of expression in all circumstances.\\nziarul de iasi,  a local newspaper in romania with a circulation of 5,000 \\ncopies per week, received a right to erasure request to delete an article \\nfrom its online archive. after the newspaper refused to remove an article \\nfrom nine years earlier about a public figure who had engaged in improper \\nbehavior, the national supervisory authority for personal data processing \\nsent a letter imposing a fine of 3,000 leu ($725) per day until the article \\nwas deleted. “for a local newspaper this is huge, ” said avadani. “in this \\nparticular case, ziarul de iasi  is going to challenge the request in court. \\nhowever the editor-in-chief told me if he keeps receiving requests like this, \\nhe may not be able to afford to keep challenging them. ”while it is doubtful such \\na fine would stand up in \\nthe highest courts of the \\neuropean union, for smaller \\nmedia outlets the fear of \\ncostly, ongoing litigation \\ncould ultimately have a \\nchilling effect on\\xa0journalism.11 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevimpacts on internal operations and website functionality\\nunder the gdpr, data controllers are obligated to ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices and the data processing practices of third \\nparties comply with the regulation. this necessarily requires that media \\norganizations more closely scrutinize the activities of the third-party \\nvendors they work with. \\nala’a alzghoul, an information systems specialist with arab reporters \\nfor investigative journalism in jordan, explained how the gdpr \\nprompted his organization to develop internal procedures for assessing \\nhow third parties handle personal information.19 “for example, we use \\ngoogle analytics to collect some data for the user experience. before we \\nadded their plug-in, we first read the privacy policy of google analytics \\nand asked for every detail as to what data this tool is collecting, we \\ntracked what they actually do, and we mention those details in our \\nprivacy policy. ” alzghoul explained that the gdpr also prompted arab \\nreporters for investigative journalism to develop new procedures for \\nhandling personal information. “t o prevent any data leakages, we moved \\nfrom regular databases to encrypted databases, ” he said. “we have a \\nnew policy to protect the personal data that we collect, and to prevent \\nemployees [from] just copying the data onto their laptops. but this \\nhappened because of the gdpr, not because we were afraid of the laws \\nhere in jordan. ”under the gdpr, data \\ncontrollers are obligated \\nto ensure that both their \\ndata processing practices \\nand the data processing \\npractices of third parties \\ncomply with the\\xa0regulation. \\n©

buys a printed newspaper, they \\nreceive a complete product. but when a visitor browses a webpage, \\ntheir web browser does not download one file. rather, the web browser \\nreads the code, downloads the required content from various sources, and \\nrenders the page. this all happens in milliseconds. the output may appear to \\nthe reader as one complete package, but more happens behind

for example, if you visit \\nhttps:/ /es .mercopress.com …13 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevwhen content is being downloaded, the browser sends an http request to \\neither retrieve information from a server or send data to a server.20 as part \\nof this interaction, the server obtains the visitor’s ip address to learn who \\nit is interacting with. y ou could think of an ip address as the return address \\non a letter you mail; it is a unique number that essentially identifies you by \\nthe device you’re using to connect to the internet, and can be linked to all \\nthe online activity you engage in on that device. \\nwhen first-party content is downloaded, a website visitor would reasonably \\nexpect that they are sharing their ip address to access that content. the \\nsituation becomes murkier with third-party content. because the website \\nviewer’s ip address is being collected by an external source with which \\nthey do not have a direct relationship—and since these third-party content \\nelements can either be invisible, blend into the webpage, or just load on the \\nwebpage without the individual’s explicit consent—their ip address would \\nbe collected by a third party without the individual’s knowledge or approval. \\nmoreover, it is rare that only an ip address will be captured. while an ip \\naddress does constitute personal information, it is extremely common \\nfor third parties to collect information on individuals through cookies, \\nweb beacons, and application program interfaces, among other technical \\nmeasures, as people browse digital properties. these allow for individuals \\nto be targeted in a much more granular manner and to be tracked across \\nthe entire internet.when first-party content is \\ndownloaded, a website visitor \\nwould reasonably expect \\nthat they are sharing their ip \\naddress to access that content. \\nthe situation becomes murkier \\nwith third-party content. \\nhow website visitors are tracked\\ncookie a cookie is a message that a server sends to a web browser to store on the website visitor’s \\ncomputer. this file is then sent back to the server each time the visitor’s web browser requests \\ncontent from that particular server.\\nweb beacon a web beacon is a small image, usually one pixel by one pixel in size, that is discretely placed on \\na website to monitor visitor behavior. when the image loads, the web beacon passes information \\nalong to the server where the image is stored, including the ip address of the computer that \\nretrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the \\nimage, and cookie values.\\napplication \\nprogram \\ninterfacean application program interface determines how different software applications and \\ncomponents should interact with others. they are building blocks that website developers can use \\nto pull and share data. for instance, amazon’s product advertising application program interface \\nallows another website to search amazon’s product inventory and to then add personalized \\nfunctions to its website advertising amazon’s products.14 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orghistorically it has even been possible for companies to track website \\nviewers without using cookies or web beacons or deploying application \\nprogram interfaces. there are various fingerprinting algorithms that \\nhave enabled data sets to be analyzed in a manner that, for all practical \\npurposes, could uniquely identify an individual with a high degree of \\naccuracy. when a visitor downloads a file from a third party, the third \\nparty necessarily obtains a user agent string (the website visitor’s \\noperating system, web browser type, and version number) and accepts \\nheaders (the type, version, and capabilities of the browser that is making \\nthe request so that the server returns compatible data). if javascript \\nis enabled, it can communicate the names of browser plug-ins that \\nare installed, and these plug-ins can be called upon to share system-\\nspecific attributes. many of these attributes are, in and of themselves, \\nharmless, but when aggregated, can effectively and easily lead to the \\nidentification of a user.21 \\nt o grasp how the tracking of readers involves a variety of distinct and \\nindependent entities, imagine a scenario in which an individual lands on \\na fictitious new site, newswebsite.com, to read an article on nutrition. \\nthe reader’s presence on the site is collected by analytics.com, a \\nthird-party audience measurement tool firm that newswebsite.com \\nhas enabled on its website. analytics.com

some of which the reader herself might not \\neven know about.\\nover the past three years web browsers and mobile devices have \\nbegun masking header information by default. this reduces, but does \\nnot entirely eliminate, the potential for reidentification through this \\nmanner. these changes have arguably been implemented in reaction \\nto new privacy regulations like the gdpr, which oblige data controllers \\nto provide individuals with an effective means of exercising their data \\nrights. users with older mobile devices or web browsers that have \\nnot been updated may be particularly vulnerable to identification \\nthrough fingerprinting.there are various \\nfingerprinting algorithms \\nthat have enabled data sets \\nto be analyzed in a manner \\nthat, for all practical \\npurposes, could uniquely \\nidentify an individual with a \\nhigh degree of accuracy. 15 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevhowever, 15 percent of the tracking devices we found on independent \\nnews websites had no easily identifiable ownership. some of the most \\npervasive trackers on independent news websites in kenya, nigeria, and \\nukraine, for example, actively masked their identities. in such cases the \\naverage website visitor would not know who is collecting their personal \\ninformation or for what purpose. at least when the owner of a cookie can \\nbe identified, users can make contact with them to exercise their rights. \\noverall, the analysis included 100 news websites in argentina, brazil, egypt, \\nindia, indonesia, kenya, nigeria, syria, ukraine, and uruguay—five small \\npublishers and five large publishers in each country. the measurements \\nwere conducted using the open source openwpm platform, which was \\ndeveloped by scientists at princeton university. this tool has been used \\nin 22 academic studies, and it allows researchers to systematically and \\nreliably quantify, understand, and uncover the ways in which website users \\nare tracked across the measured websites.22 the openwpm tool was \\ndeployed using a local virtual private network (vpn) to imitate the website \\nexperience of a local website visitor (with the exception of syria, which \\ndoes not have a vpn, where sites were visited using a t urkish vpn).\\nthe small, independent publishers chosen for analysis were selected \\nbased on recommendations from respected journalists and media \\npolicy advisors in the field. the ownership structures and funding \\nsources of these websites were also taken into account to verify \\ntheir independence. t o be included, the sites also had to be posting \\noriginal content consistently for three or more years. for the large \\npublishers, we included the five most visited news websites in the given \\ncountry in january 2019, per alexa internet’s rankings. in uruguay, \\nthe top three most visited news

\\ncontent so that it loads more quickly. common providers include amazon web services and \\ncloudflare. some publishers use third-party content libraries, such as adobe fonts, to improve \\nthe appearance of their websites. others use tools like youtube to host videos because it is \\neither cheaper than self-hosting that content, or easier to extend the functionality of their \\nwebsites by turning to a third-party application. in all these instances, when content is being \\nloaded through an intermediary, it exposes a visitor’s ip address (or more) to the third party.\\npotential for

longer or improve website usability. \\nthese tools, like apptimize, optimizely, and splitforce, do not typically collect personal \\ninformation and data are usually accessible only by the publisher.\\npotential for privacy violation:  low \\nrecommendation \\nsystemssome news websites use content recommendation engines to encourage website viewers to \\nremain on the same website, or to visit a partner’s website to read an article that the publisher \\nbelieves the reader will find interesting. these tools are thought to be behind many of the \\nopaque tracking devices that we found, as their content changes dynamically and is updated by \\na code that the website owner is unable to closely scrutinize. \\npotential for privacy violation:  high \\nsocial media \\nshare buttonsmany news websites have embedded social media share buttons into their websites. these \\nare intended to facilitate sharing news articles via the most common social media platforms. \\nthe most common social media share buttons we saw were for facebook, which, if its button is \\nembedded into a webpage, results in audience information being shared with facebook. other \\nbuttons included the twitter icon and the sharethis widget.\\npotential for privacy violation:  high \\nvisualizations some news websites use third-party tools to attractively display their stories, for instance, by \\nembedding interactive maps, using scribd to embed annotated documents into a page, or using \\ntableau to create column graphs or pie charts.\\npotential for privacy violation:  medium

the independent media websites and 98 percent of \\nthe mass media websites reviewed contained third-party trackers of some \\nkind. in the context of independent media websites, these trackers were \\nmost commonly deployed for audience measurement purposes, followed \\nby advertising and marketing purposes, and then by the inclusion of social \\nmedia share buttons. \\naccording to valentina pavel, who researches data ownership at privacy \\ninternational, “user tracking and exploitation of data is still the default for \\nnews websites, but this is changing. ”23 she said readers are looking for \\nsomething else and that publishers can turn data protection principles to \\ntheir competitive advantage. “be fair and clear to your readers, show them \\nyou have been thoughtful about the way you are handling their data, and \\ncollect only the type of data that is necessary for the smooth running of \\nthe website and explain in plain language why you made those choices. ” \\nshe noted that large publishers like the new york times  have dropped \\nbehavioral advertisements from their websites altogether without suffering \\nany revenue impact and believes this has paved the way for smaller \\npublications to do the same. “people are looking for real guarantees that \\ntheir data is not going to be exploited, so by all means, don’t sell or share \\nuser data, and stop or limit using first- or third-party cookies, ” said pavel. \\n“if others do it, why can’t you?”\\nfigure 6.   third-party cookies on homepages of independent \\nmedia websites\\nnote: it is important to

order)\\nadvertising using a third-party ad exchange, like google adsense, to fund journalism sites makes \\nit impossible to eliminate the privacy risks that these tools present. \\nhowever, a website owner may decide not to use an ad exchange, opting instead to \\nhandle advertising sales internally. this has been an approach that larger publishers \\nhave been taking post-gdpr, as it can also result in higher revenue from direct sales \\nnegotiations. if advertisements are not targeted to the individual website viewer and \\nare instead of a general nature, this is fairly simple to resolve. provided no personal \\ninformation about the website viewers is exchanged with the advertiser, no privacy \\nviolations can occur. much, if not all, of the information typically found in a media kit \\nabout audience demographics does not constitute personal information. \\nif personal information is to be exchanged with third parties, a careful assessment \\nwill need to be conducted before this happens. this assessment must consider both \\nthe fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, their reasonable \\nexpectations for how and why their personal information would be used, and the \\ngrounds for why and how the third party would reasonably use those data.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\naudience \\nmeasurementthere are audience measurement tools that can be self-hosted, such as cryptolog, \\nwhich allows both internal analytical logging and total control over how long data \\nare retained. however, these tools are not as easy to use as third-party

new data protection laws like \\nthe gdpr and other applicable regimes can be difficult, and that appears to be \\na leading reason that some website owners have not taken action. \\none simpler mechanism of coming into compliance with the gdpr is to migrate away from using third-\\nparty tools, services, and applications and to instead use self-hosted tools. this immediately limits \\nexposure to the data collection and processing practices of third parties, and grants readers a greater \\ndegree of privacy protection, as information that could lead to their identification will no longer be \\ncirculating outside of the websites they’re visiting. 21 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media around the world   #mediadevmoving from third party to first party (in alphabetical order)\\ncontent hosting not all content needs to be hosted by third parties. for example, if a website uses a \\nthird-party font library, the site could be changed to use either default browser fonts \\nor self-hosted fonts to provide an immediate privacy gain for visitors.\\nit may not be feasible to self-host all content. video hosting, for example, can be very \\nresource intensive and expensive. however, website owners may wish to investigate \\nwhich third-party video hosts are out there, and how (if at all) they use visitor data. \\nyoutube, for example, offers “privacy enhancing mode, ” which “allows you to embed \\nyoutube videos without using cookies that track viewing behavior. ”24 however, it is \\ndisabled by default and so action is required by the website’s publisher to benefit \\nfrom this privacy gain.\\nease of migration:  easy \\ndesign \\noptimizationself-hosted design testing tools may not offer all of the functions of those of third \\nparties. it might be a better idea to review the privacy policy of any tools that are \\nused, and to make sure they respect the privacy of

retain audience data.\\nease of migration:  possibly not necessary \\nrecommendation \\nsystemsrecommendation engines are a major source of third-party cookies. while they \\nmay look harmless and may improve the appearance and functionality of a website, \\nthey can also be trojan horses, inserting hundreds of third-party trackers into \\nevery page of a website (including malware, in some instances). these tools can \\nalso be used to direct viewers to content that belongs to another publisher, or to \\ninject misinformation or misleading stories onto your webpage. website owners \\nwho cannot develop their own content recommendation engines may be better off \\neliminating the use of these third-party tools altogether.\\nease of migration:  difficult \\nsocial media \\nshare buttonssome of the most significant privacy violations we saw came from deploying social \\nmedia share buttons. embedding a facebook “like” button into a webpage enables \\nthat platform to be able to link a user’s reading and browsing history to their \\nfacebook account. however, it is not necessary to use facebook’s default “like” \\nbutton to encourage sharing news articles on facebook. there are self-hosted social \\nsharing plug-ins that transmit less personal information to third parties that may be \\nused instead. \\nease of migration:  easy \\nvisualizations many third-party visualization tools offer self-hosted deployments, though some \\ntechnical knowledge may be required to synchronize their visual interfaces with local \\ndeployment. others do not pose significant privacy risks because as paid tools they \\noffer contractual assurances around how they will or will not use data.\\nease of migration:  easy 22 center for international media assistance  cima.ned.orgindeed, the findings in this report reveal that the current level of \\npreparedness among smaller media companies in the global south \\nto protect their readers from being identified and to protect the \\ncommercial value of their analytics data is low. experts consulted for \\nthis report said that this is unfortunate as many of the most common \\ndata analytic practices that independent media outlets engage in and \\nbenefit from do not require the use of personal information at all. \\nwhile it will take additional effort by website operators, safeguarding \\nthe privacy rights of visitors may be good for business. this, in \\nturn, could help improve the commercial viability of independent \\nmedia. research from the world economic forum shows that in \\nthe $3 trillion global data economy, online news sites are unusually \\nwell-trusted relative to search engines, social networking platforms, \\nand even financial institutions.25 y et, so far, a handful of players \\nlike facebook and google have led the business of online data \\ncollection and marketing, which has allowed them to harness the \\nvalue of the data that they have collected from websites whose \\ncontent they do not control. this research reveals that independent \\nmedia websites commonly leak personal information to third parties \\nunder the following scenarios: when analytic tools are used to \\nmeasure audience demographics, when split tests are conducted \\nto experiment with new website design features, when social media \\n“share” buttons are embedded into webpages, or when content \\nrecommendation engines are deployed to personalize a website’s \\ncontent to make it relevant to the reader. \\nmaintaining and building upon the high degree of trust that exists \\nbetween a publisher and its readers may be the long-term solution conclusion and recommendations\\na year after a new wave of data protection regulations such as the european \\nunion’s gdpr have come into effect, the websites of media outlets continue \\ncollecting great volumes of personal information—but often unintentionally, \\nand typically for other parties. that so many media institutions have failed to \\nsafeguard this asset—to both protect the privacy and safety of their readers and \\nto be in a better negotiating position with advertisers—suggests that education, \\ncapacity building, and direct support of independent news outlets is needed to \\nimprove their analytics activities and ensure that they safeguard reader privacy. \\nwhile it will take \\nadditional effort by \\nwebsite operators, \\nsafeguarding the privacy \\nrights of visitors may be \\ngood for business. 23 big data, not big brother: new data protection laws and the implications for independent media

on your own user base rather than \\nthat of advertisers, ” said tanja maksic, a researcher with the balkan \\ninvestigative reporting network.26 this, in turn, could result in digital \\npublishers developing greater negotiating power and leverage with \\nthird-party advertising exchanges or, alternatively, being able to sell \\npremium subscriptions to readers. “look at your internal organization, \\nwhat you are collecting, what you are doing with it, how you are \\nprotecting it, ” said maksic, “and craft your economic sustainability \\naround your user base and meet their
