A subset of IoT is the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) that\\nconsists of smart healthcare devices having signiﬁcant importance in monitoring, processing, storing,\\nand transmitting sensitive information.

Introduction\\nThe IoT is an emerging technology that facilitates consumers by exchanging informa-\\ntion with devices connected to the Internet. The International Telecommunication Union\\n(ITU) [ 1] deﬁnes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment.\\nThe spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in\\ndifferent scenarios like security, remote monitoring, electrical appliances control, military\\nuse, and other electronic equipment. One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare\\nsector, i.e., the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), designed to monitor, store, or transmit\\nhealthcare information. In simple words, IoHT is a sub-class of IoT speciﬁcally dealing\\nwith healthcare that includes devices, services, and software [2].\\nThe IoHT describes uniquely identiﬁable devices connected to the Internet, communi-\\ncating with each other, used in the medical area. IoHT devices help to monitor individuals’\\nmedical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service\\nwith the help of wireless network infrastructure [ 3]. Like any other Internet-based device,\\nIoHT devices have a unique identiﬁer such as an IP address which enables them to connect\\nwith the network and to forward/receive data to/from intended devices [ 4]. The central\\nserver manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients’\\nAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927.   Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 2 of 22\\ndiseases. A high-level general working ﬂow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre-\\nsented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efﬁcient, and cost-effective healthcare\\nservices by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely monitoring their patients.\\nIoHT implementations also enable individuals to manage their health data easily and assist\\nthem in how to use wearable health monitors [5,6].\\nAppl.

The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to \\ndiagnose patients ’ diseases. A high -level general working flow diagram of  an IoHT im-\\nplementation is presented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efficient, and cost -\\neffective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely mon-\\nitoring their patients. IoHT implementations also enable indivi duals to manage their \\nhealth data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors [5 ,6]. \\n \\nFigure 1. High -Level Architecture of IoHT Implementation . \\nData privacy is considered to be a fundamental requirement for consumer ac-\\nceptance , which can be ensured through the data flow representation, authentication, and \\nauthorization of the performed activities such as data collection, retention, processing, \\nand transmission. Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection, usage, \\naccess, storage, and sharing activities. These activities might be the reason for personal \\ndata leakage and compromis ing the user’s privacy, especially concerning  healthcare data, \\nas it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive. In this regard, appropri-\\nate protection and security measures are required [7–10]. \\nMoreover, accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the In-\\nternet also cause privacy problems. In June 2015, a censorious privacy violation attack w as \\nlaunched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain \\naccess to hospital networks and leaked private data [11]. Despite this, the privacy frame-\\nwork for IoHT systems and services is expected  to be transparent to patients, making \\navailable updated information to ensure the protection of patients ’ data [6]. The healthcare \\nsystems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate \\ndevices to the management layer. During this process, several prot ocols and encoding \\nschemes are used to communicate data reliably. It is easier to find vulnerabilities in dif-\\nferent components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan, which \\nassist s attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devic es on the Internet [12]. Simi-\\nlarly, a worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be \\nexchanged in a fraction of a second, seamlessly, and without leaving any consistent trace \\n[10].  \\nSome IoT -related data privacy and protect ion policies are used to protect data and \\nuser s’ privacy. However, these legal frameworks have not produced the intended results \\nand the actual level of healthcare data privacy protection is insufficient for the issues men-\\ntioned earlier [9]. There are also  some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data \\nprivacy laws that do not provide a particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data.  \\nIn this paper, we discuss technological, legal, and structural problems of IoHT sys-\\ntems with some analysis, and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and pro-\\ntection framework in the developing countries. The paper uses a layered architecture to \\nhighlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT. It further identifies protec-\\ntion and privacy issu es at different layers from technical and legal perspectives. Further-\\nmore, the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of se-\\ncurity related to data protection discusses possible points of data leakage, missing aspects \\nof hea lthcare policies , and issues in the enforcement of healthcare systems and policies. \\nFigure 1.

Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT)\\nHealth management problems are increasing with the growing population, especially\\nwith the increasingly larger aging population. Sometimes no response from the hospital\\nfor emergencies creates social issues. Similarly, the medical staff in rural areas do not\\nhave sufﬁcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex\\ndiseases. Due to these reasons, people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper\\nmedical attention, increasing the load on hospitals. The late detection of diseases and\\nsevere health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process. Therefore,\\nthere is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system\\nthat includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical\\nproblems [20,21].\\n2.1. IoHT Classiﬁcation Based on Architecture\\nIn this subsection, we present a detailed classiﬁcation of IoHT based on the IoHT\\narchitecture in Figure 2. A generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices [ 22–30],\\ncommunication protocols [ 31–36], and networks [ 37–40]. The IoHT devices are further\\nclassiﬁed as wearable devices and implant devices. The data of IoHT devices are then\\ntransmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE 802.15.6, WBAN, IEEE\\n802.15.1 Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 WiFi, and LoRaWAN. The destination of this medical data\\nis a cloud service, or a remote server designed for intensive processing tasks. Finally, data\\ncan be transmitted to a physician or an Emergency Response Team (ERT) via a mobile\\ncommunication service such as 4G or 5G.\\nOnce the information is collected from different IoHT devices where the sensors\\nexist, it travels toward the near and far edge of the network to be stored, analyzed, and\\nadditionally processing [41].\\nUsing a fog node network can give a health care system more computing power\\nthat smaller and battery-oriented IoHT devices might not be able to achieve. In the IoHT\\narchitecture, data operations, such as classiﬁcation and compression, are completed on the\\nintermediate devices or often single remote servers that allow for the fast processing of data\\nthat mobile devices cannot do. In cloud-based networks, the majority of the computation isAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 4 of 22\\nperformed on the cloud servers because the cloud has a higher computing capacity than the\\nfog node networks. Cloud-based networks utilize multiple servers for parallel computing\\nand data analysis. Moreover, the cloud has data centers that allow for more data storage\\nthat is sometimes needed for patient records.\\nAppl.

IoHT Components  \\nAn IoHT implementation can simply consist of a single sensor device like a heartbeat \\nmonitor connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth.

Servers take the\\nappropriate actions by updating the database or contacting the relevant physicians or quick\\nresponse teams in case of an emergency. It is a simple architecture used in IoT application\\ndevelopment [ 41]. Each connected device has limitations like limited processing, memory,\\nand battery resources, etc., and the applications are developed for better utilization of these\\nlimited resources. The reference architecture model shown in Figure 3 highlights a layered\\napproach for describing IoHT functionalities and their problems. In addition, the layered\\narchitecture is used for identifying IoHT data security and privacy issues in technical and\\nlegal aspects. This ﬁve-layer architecture helps to identify IoHT data security and privacy\\nissues at different layers, what type of devices and entities (medical team, physician, and\\nemergency services) are involved at a speciﬁc layer, and what threat vectors are involved at\\neach layer.Appl.

Protocol Layer\\nThe protocol layer consists of communication protocols and wireless standards used to\\nenable communication for wireless devices. The ﬁrst dedicated standard for Wireless Body\\nArea Networks (WBANs) is the IEEE 802.15.6 released in 2012 [ 31]. IEEE 802.15.6 is de-\\nsigned to support both medical and non-medical applications and can be easily conﬁgured\\nbased on application requirements [ 50]. It ensures communication inside and around the\\nhuman body and is speciﬁcally designed keeping in mind sensor devices that consume less\\nenergy and have a low transmission range. Another upcoming standard in this context is\\nthe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) SmartBan [27,30] . In additionAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 7 of 22\\nto IEEE 802.15.6, there are other commonly used standards and technologies such as IEEE\\n802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee), IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) [ 35], Bluetooth Low Energy\\n(BLE), NFC, LoRaWAN, UWB [ 36], RuBee [ 51], and Z-Wave [ 52]. The choice of the stan-\\ndard used is based on many factors like data rate, transmission range, number of devices\\nsupported, interference due to the coexistence of different technologies, etc. The technical\\ndetails about these protocols, such as frequency, communication range, data transfer rate,\\nenergy consumption, and its security features, are summarized in Table 3.\\nTable 3.

Intermediate Layer\\nDevices in this layer have the responsibility to transmit data to potent computing\\nresources like cloud servers. These devices act like gateways that enable data ﬂow from\\nthe sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis. These\\ndevices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM, etc., [ 53]\\nand forward the collected data to the server. Some intermediate devices can store data as\\nwell for pre-processing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or\\nnot [45]. Some of the intermediate devices are discussed here brieﬂy.\\nSmart Hub is used to make communication easy with smart IoT devices but has many\\nvulnerabilities that draw the attention of attackers into snifﬁng the trafﬁc of the smart\\nhub. If they can access networks, they will be able to spot IoT healthcare devices in the\\nnetwork [54].\\nAccess Points facilitate a wireless connection between different healthcare devices and\\nconnect them with remote servers.\\nIoT Gateways primarily act as the bridge to connect sensor networks with conventional\\ncommunication networks, enabling protocol conversion and device management.\\nThe System on Chip (SoC) is a device that integrates all components of a computer\\nsystem, helps to normalize data collected from different sensors, and controls actuators\\nbased on applications. In this way, it reduces the load on a central server and minimizes\\nthe communication [55].\\nPersonal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are extensively used in the healthcare domain to\\nsupport healthcare providers [56]. Such systems receive data from different wearable and\\nimplanted devices and process them through a variety of software applications [57].\\n2.2.4. Management and Data Link Layer\\nManagement and database servers are the centralized part of the healthcare system\\nthat receives and updates the patient’s data collected by the sensors and can also help the\\nphysicians manage the quantity of medicine or prescribe a new one for the patient. In\\nemergencies, the servers send alerts to physicians and the emergency response teams for\\nappropriate actions.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 8 of 22\\n2.2.5. Feedback Layer\\nThe physicians and the emergency response teams (ERT) provide feedback in any\\nemergency and play a signiﬁcant role in the healthcare system. At this layer, doctors and\\nERT respond to the system when they receive an alert from it.\\nPhysicians are an integral part of the healthcare system and can observe their patients\\nanytime, anywhere, and change treatment when required. An IoT device for a physician\\ngives real-time information about the patient under observation. The IoT gateway device\\ngathers information from different healthcare devices and forwards it to PDA devices held\\nby physicians.\\nEmergency Response Team (ERT): In case of any medical emergency, the responsibility\\nof the ERT is to provide medical attention to patients on-premises or remotely. In the\\ncontext of IoHT, medical devices monitor patients’ conditions and generate alerts in case of\\na medical emergency. Emergency care is a critical part of medical services and is inﬂuenced\\nby the contextual information’s time, availability, and accuracy [58].\\n2.3.

This ﬁgure follows the conventions of a workﬂow diagram where the Start and\\nEnd processes are shown with an oval shape. Different systems processes are demonstrated\\nwith rectangle shapes, and conditional methods are shown with the diamond shapes. The\\nIoHT system consists of a Sensor, Intermediate System, Actuator, Server, and ERT module.\\nA physician is also a part of the system that receives information from the server about a\\npatient’s health condition.\\nFigure 5 presents a three-level generic IoHT implementation framework.

Workflow Diagram of IoHT Implementation.  \\n3. IoHT Security Landscape \\nIoHT security goes beyond device security, therefore, rather than only physical inter-\\nfaces and firmware on the device, its scope must include web, mobile/cloud interfaces, \\nnetwork services, local storage, and 3rd part y APIs as well. Furthermore, diverse needs \\nand varied intended usage of healthcare devices  by residential and industrial consumers \\nmakes it more complex [59]. A list of top ten vulnerabilities related to IoHT devices has \\nbeen published by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This includes \\nlack of authorization/insufficient authentication, insecure web interfaces, lack of transport \\nencryption, insecure network services, privacy concerns, insecure cloud interfaces, inade-\\nquate security configuration, insecure software or firmware, poor physical security, and insecure mobile interfaces [60].

IoHT Security Landscape\\nIoHT security goes beyond device security, therefore, rather than only physical inter-\\nfaces and ﬁrmware on the device, its scope must include web, mobile/cloud interfaces,\\nnetwork services, local storage, and 3rd party APIs as well. Furthermore, diverse needs\\nand varied intended usage of healthcare devices by residential and industrial consumers\\nmakes it more complex [ 59]. A list of top ten vulnerabilities related to IoHT devices has\\nbeen published by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This includes\\nlack of authorization/insufﬁcient authentication, insecure web interfaces, lack of transport\\nencryption, insecure network services, privacy concerns, insecure cloud interfaces, inade-\\nquate security conﬁguration, insecure software or ﬁrmware, poor physical security, andAppl.

This scenario facilitates attackers in using memory vulnerabilities and compromises\\nthe security of such devices [ 66]. With inadequate resources on lightweight IoT devices, it\\nbecomes challenging to implement strong encryption and authentication schemes.\\n3.1.2.

The urgency to roll out IoHT\\ncloud platforms and the limited user experience of new IoT applications may result in the\\ndevelopment of protocols by I.T. companies having many potential security loopholes. Due\\nto the diversity of IoT devices, it is not easy to develop a standard security protocol for\\nheterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address\\nthe security vulnerabilities among IoT devices.\\n3.1.3. Insecure Middleware\\nTo make IoT applications development more manageable, various IoT middleware\\nplatforms have been developed. These platforms offer distributed system services with\\nstandard programming interfaces and protocols and minimize problems associated with\\nheterogeneity, distribution, and scale in IoT applications development. These services are\\ncalled ‘middleware’ as they sit ‘in the middle’, in a layer above the operating system and\\nnetworking software and below domain-speciﬁc applications [67,68].\\n3.2. Possible Points for Data Leakage\\nIn the healthcare system, there are two states of data from where it can be stolen.\\nThese states are the persistent data (i.e., data at rest) and transient data (i.e., in motion).\\nThe overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure 5.\\nThe arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines\\nrepresent persistent data. The details of each state are as follows.\\n3.2.1. Persistent Data\\nPersistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components,\\nsuch as sensing and actuating devices, etc., and is prone to theft. Here, the features of the\\nhealthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed.\\nHealthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs (latest reading,\\nconﬁguration change, connection history, etc.) in the memory. As these devices usually\\nhave weak security conﬁgurations and store data in non-encrypted forms, an attacker can\\nsteal the data by exploiting these weaknesses.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 10 of 22\\nIoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to\\nsteal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their\\nbiodata.\\nPhysicians/Response Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or\\nresponse teams use to monitor and process healthcare data. These devices are susceptible\\nto memory leakage attacks. Personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, or any speciﬁc\\ndevices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category. Due to direct communication\\nwith IoHT data servers, these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks.\\nFigure 6 is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices operating at different\\nlayers. Effect of one compromised device can propagate at different layers because these\\ndevices are communicating with each other.\\nAppl. Sci.  2022 , 12, 1927  11 of 23 \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. Possible Sites for Data Leakage in an IoHT implementation . \\n3.2.2. Transient Data  \\nTransient data refers to the data on the move, as in the IoHT implementations, the \\ninformation is tran sferred from devices to servers using different protocols and network-\\ning devices. Here, we discuss such devices and protocols from where the data can be sto-\\nlen during transmission.  \\nCommunication protocols are used to transmit data from an IoT device to a d evice. \\nIoT devices are primarily lightweight, low computational, and battery -oriented. Low -\\nrange protocols with weak security features transfer data from IoT devices to a gateway \\ndevice.  \\nIntermediate devices collect data from end devices using a specific p rotocol  to aggre-\\ngate and transform this data into another format that can be underst ood by the next de-\\nvice.

These protocols have security issues; IoT gate-\\nways, smart hubs, mobile phones, and WiFi dev ices enable IoT devices to connect with \\nthe Internet.

No med-\\nical devices, either implantable or wearable, are allowed to be manufacture d if they do \\nnot meet data standards.  \\nFigure 6.

Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 11 of 22\\ncomply with any healthcare laws describing the security levels needed for IoT healthcare\\nintermediate devices.\\n3.3. Essential Security Features of IoHT\\nFollowing are some of the essential security features of IoHT.\\nUse of Standardized Devices: To ensure data privacy and security in healthcare sys-\\ntems, it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security features. These\\ndevices should meet healthcare standards and policies. Data storage, transmission, format\\ninterchanges, terminologies, and presentation standards should be well-deﬁned. No medi-\\ncal devices, either implantable or wearable, are allowed to be manufactured if they do not\\nmeet data standards.\\nLog Management and Compliance: Every management activity performed on these\\nhealthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers. For data\\nprivacy, there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system. The best\\npractices are gathering log ﬁles and saving them for future references as long as you need\\nthem. In distributed systems, these reports should be shared with other systems to prove\\ncompliance.\\nUpdating Technologies: Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad-\\nvancement in healthcare systems, and recent innovations have proven this. Technologies\\nhave changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads\\nto improved care and efﬁciency. The latest components are more efﬁcient and secure as\\ncompared to the previous ones. Therefore, the new devices with the latest technologies\\nshould be preferred over the old ones.\\nPatch Management: In addition to upgrading hardware, updating the software of IoT\\ndevice’s ﬁrmware is also essential; if it is not updated, it may be vulnerable. The software\\nvendors release patches from time to time to overcome the ﬂaws and loopholes. Every\\ndevice which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated, whether it is a personal\\ncomputer, smartphone, or any other device such as IoT [20].\\nUser’s Proﬁling: The users should be identiﬁed and authenticated; the system must\\nknow what resources a user can access. This process is called authorization. This process\\nensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the user’s permission.\\nUser proﬁling is more critical in healthcare applications. Healthcare organizations must\\ncomply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and\\nauthorization. The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints\\nwith professional liabilities.\\nGenerate Alerts: There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts\\nfor any kind of malicious event. Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this\\nregard with the help of some applications. Warnings should be raised for critical events and\\nemergencies. These devices can analyze received data; after the detection of any malicious\\nactivity, alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system. Availability\\nof IoHT should be the top priority; if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason,\\nintermediate devices communicate with them directly; therefore, generating alerts by these\\ndevices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly.\\nFines and Penalties: A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector\\nagainst attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health-\\ncare information. Healthcare data is conﬁdential, and if an attacker tries to breach the\\nhealthcare system for the purpose of data-stealing by any means they should be charged\\nwith penalties or imprisonment.\\n4. Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework\\nIn developed countries, there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to\\nsecurely process citizens’ personal data. In this section, we discuss some of them brieﬂy to\\nhighlight their aims and features. These laws and legislations are compared with each other\\nto see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 12 of 22\\narchitecture. Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal\\nmatters, human rights, and social norms. Generally, IoT data privacy regulations are re-\\nquired to support core privacy goals like fairness, purpose satisfaction, proportionality, and\\naccountability. Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these\\ngoals. American, European, and other leading countries’ law enforcement organizations are\\nworking to ﬁnd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also\\nmaking a more effective existing legal framework. An effective legal framework should\\nensure the user’s awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their\\nservices. Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more\\nadequate [6,69].\\n4.1. Major Healthcare Initiative\\nA brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection, for different\\nregions, is given below.\\n4.1.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\\nHIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy\\nof healthcare data for American citizens. It has separate rule sets for security and privacy.\\nThe privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure.\\nThe security rules provide security of the individuals’ health information by adopting\\nadvanced technologies to acquire more efﬁcient means of patient care. The HIPAA security\\nand privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and non-healthcare organizations that\\nstore, transmit, and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means.\\nThe privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities:\\n\\x0f Common Identiﬁer (e.g., name, address, birth date);\\n\\x0f Past, present, or future physical and mental health or condition;\\n\\x0f Past, present, or future payment provision for healthcare;\\n\\x0f Provision of healthcare to individuals.\\nThe mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and\\npublic interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information\\nexcept for treatment purposes, like payment and relevant health care operations.\\nThe Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created, re-\\nceived, transmitted, and managed electronically. These security rules have the following\\ncharacteristics:\\n\\x0f Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information;\\n\\x0f Detects and protects against known threats to conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability;\\n\\x0f Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information.\\nThe security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes\\npersonnel. Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel.\\nThis rule also includes audit control, access control, integrity control, and transmission\\nsecurity.\\n4.1.2. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nis an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in 2009.\\nHowever, it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry. It only provides\\nlegal liability for noncompliance. Besides applying the HIPAA rules, it is responsible for the\\nnotiﬁcation of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data. It enables individuals\\nwith a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to\\nreceive healthcare information [70].Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 13 of 22\\n4.1.3. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA)\\nThe federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection\\nand Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA) in 2001. Its main purpose is to provide individuals\\ncontrol, to some extent, over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza-\\ntions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens. These policies\\ninclude informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and\\nthis information is protected by using adequate security measures. The PIPEDA applies\\nto all personal data, healthcare data, and other data that holds the private information of\\nindividuals. If any organization collects data, then it is fully accountable for the protection\\nof the collected data. The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada. Every province\\nhas the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA [ 71].\\nPIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal\\ninformation for business purposes. The interconnected devices should use the security\\nstandards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA.\\n4.1.4. EUROHEALTH\\nIn late 1990, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro-\\ngram called EUROHEALTH. It provides medium-term needs for the Countries of Central\\nand Eastern Europe (CCEE) for material, managerial, and technical resources for long-term\\nhealth strategies. The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree-\\nments with CCEE, fundraising, and coordination with international organizations. The\\nprogram’s work has generated an information ﬂow for better cooperation and coordination\\nbetween all the organizations working in the health sector. This program is realistic, ﬂexible,\\nand accessible to the CCEE [72].\\n4.1.5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\nIn May 2018, a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced directive\\n95/46 [ 73], consolidating and innovating data protection rules. The introduced GDPR is\\nconsiderably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance\\nmechanisms that did not exist in the legislation. It applies to all sectors of the economy, all\\nbroadly deﬁned personal data, and every sector that controls or processes data. Moreover,\\nit applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data. GDPR is designed to\\nenable people to better control their data. Although the EU already established its data\\nprotection directive in 1995, it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of\\nthe EU. To remove all the reservations, the GDPR has been established and is applicable\\nthroughout the EU.\\nThe liability of the GDPR’s impact is likely to be for health organizations, hospitals, and\\nother healthcare organizations that process healthcare data. GDPR requires accountability\\nfor how healthcare data is processed. Data controllers are not only responsible for the\\ncompliance, but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and\\ndirection. Furthermore, health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in\\nproﬁling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ﬂow of\\ndata [74].\\n4.1.6. The Privacy Act (Australia)\\nIt entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor-\\nmation of Australian citizens. These principles refer to the usage, storage, and disclosure\\nof personal information. Moreover, individuals have the right to the access and correc-\\ntion of their personal information. This law also includes data security, data quality, and\\ncross-border data ﬂow policies [75].\\nHealthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies\\nand protection. All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information\\n(other than an employee record) are covered by the Privacy Act, whether or not they are\\nsmall businesses. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 14 of 22\\ninformation and personal information for health and medical research purposes, where it\\nis impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals’ consent.\\n4.1.7. Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies (SHIEP)\\nThe main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA\\n(Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) health information exchange like patient care, public health, and\\nquality. This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi\\nHealth Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers,\\nbusiness associates, health information services providers, and subcontractors [76].\\nPersonal Health Information (PHI) will be available for treatment, healthcare op-\\nerations, and public health, but it may be permitted for research and education. This\\npolicy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal\\ninvestigation or inquiry.\\nTable 4 presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ﬁve layers\\narchitecture for IoHT. It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are\\nproviding security at the intermediate and feedback layer. However, both these layers\\nare vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical\\ndevices.\\nTable 4.

Data Protection Issues/Aspects Not Covered in Healthcare Laws\\nThere are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already\\ndiscussed legislative initiatives.\\nBig Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues.\\nPatient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers. In America,\\nmost organizations have HIPAA certiﬁcation, but this does not guarantee a patient’s record\\nsafety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than\\nimplementation. Moreover, the transmission of large data sets from different locations\\nposes an extra burden on processing and storage. Conventional security solutions are\\ninadequate for large and inherently changing data sets. With the emergence of cloud\\nhealthcare solutions, security demands are becoming more complex and there are no\\nspeciﬁed policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws [77].\\nData Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial\\nstep in managing healthcare data. It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry\\ntowards a value-based business model. It demands common data representation that\\nencircles different security standards (e.g., ICD, CPT, and LOINC) [ 78]. Currently, data\\ngenerated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance\\nmodel. There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for\\nproper data governance.\\nPrivacy-preserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to\\nmonitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds. Therefore, it needs to process and analyze\\ndata in an ad-hoc decentralized manner. However, the execution of resource-exhausting\\noperations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge. As new healthcare dataAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 15 of 22\\nanalytics are becoming popular, healthcare data privacy laws need revision, and new laws\\nshould be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients’ private data.\\nIdentiﬁcation of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoT-based devices can be\\nviolated at many stages. Firstly, it is violated by collecting data by third parties. Secondly,\\nthe usage and distribution of private data, and thirdly, the data is combined with other\\ndata. The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoT-based medical\\ndevices to process and generate data. By combining newly generated information with\\nexisting data about a patient or health activity, it raises the high commercial value for many\\ndata-hungry organizations and commercial ﬁrms. Most of the data is often generated by\\nautomated medical devices, therefore, a higher trust level should be maintained for this\\ndata than on manually entered human data. This is important because medical insurance\\ncompanies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical\\ndevices to ascertain the speciﬁc risks associated with their customer’s health. These devices\\nare also tracking users’ geo-locations and such data must be protected through adequate\\ndevice safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage.\\nData and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a\\nsigniﬁcant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT. The quality of data highly\\ndepends on the environment in which it is collected. The quality of context may be\\nunknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context. It may also be\\nambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources.\\nContext quality generates new problems of conﬁdentiality that have not been addressed by\\ncurrent research. Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by\\nhardware components that likely provide the information. It is better to protect context\\nquality as it is sensitive information. Change in context quality is also sensitive information.\\nIoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system\\nor to easily disconnect from it.\\nTo enhance transparency of the healthcare systems, not only healthcare data that\\nis propagated from different devices need to be controlled, but also the data generated\\nautomatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed. Despite this important issue,\\nno law has been made in this regard. There is a need to develop a combined approach with\\ntechnical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency.\\nPrivacy violating interactions and presentation in IoT-based healthcare applications\\nlike heartbeat monitors, geo-tracking devices, automated insulin pumps, and other health-\\ncare devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient. In such devices, the\\ninformation will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings.\\nThis information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be-\\ncomes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different\\nsystems. In smart cities, for instance, an individual could make a query for the way to a\\nspeciﬁc health clinic. Such a query should not be answered, for instance, by showing the\\nway to a health clinic nearby, visible to any passerby, another example of such medical\\ndevices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server. Any adversary\\nintending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose. Due to\\nthe close interaction and presentation techniques, the threat of privacy-violating interaction\\nand presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws.\\nLife cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed\\nby IoT devices during the life cycle transition. These devices hold information like vital\\nsign readings, drug dosage, and actuator functions. Healthcare data is highly sensitive, but\\nalso the collection of simple usage data (e.g., location, duration, frequency) could disclose a\\nlot about the life cycle of people. Despite evident problems with healthcare devices, the\\nlife cycle transition problem has never been addressed. The life cycle of healthcare devices\\nis still modeled as buy-once-own-forever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total\\nmemory wipe (e.g., before selling a wearable) or physical destruction. There is a need to\\nidentify the requirements for ﬂexible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle\\nmanagement mechanisms.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 16 of 22\\nLinkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin-\\ning forms of revealed data sources. When data is gathered from different sources with\\ndifferent permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment. Threats\\nof linking different systems and data sources are not novel. Online social networks and\\nintegrated third-party applications are facing the same problems. However, IoT networks\\nand services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems. Managing\\nthe numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will\\nraise more challenges in linkage threats. The threat of linkage will cause problems in the\\nIoT evolution process. There are mainly two reasons for it. First, the horizontal linkage\\nof different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed\\nsystem-of-systems delivering new services that no single system can provide. Successful\\nlinkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties.\\nHowever, horizontal linkage also causes more local data ﬂows than vertical linkage that\\ncould improve privacy. These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare\\nlaws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices.\\n4.3. IoHT Governance Challenges\\nBased on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives, we identiﬁed the\\nfollowing IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT\\nsystems.\\n4.3.1. Conﬂicts in Laws\\nAfter the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the\\nenforcement of data security and privacy, standards have been widened. For the protection\\nof European citizens’ data outside of Europe, their data is allowed to be used under strict\\nconditions: If any data privacy legislation enacted by a non-EU country accepts Standard\\nContractual Clauses (SCC) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). These terms and conditions\\ncause challenges for developing countries because BCR’s and SCC are time-consuming and\\ncostly [79].\\nA country may or may not have a law for user data protection, but the healthcare\\nsystem should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs. The same thing\\napplies to the social and cultural norms, which should be applied according to the laws of\\nthe state to which the user belongs. In the case of data residing on cloud servers, again, the\\nprivacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients.\\n4.3.2. Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems\\nThe above discussion leads us to ﬁnd the four major issues in protecting healthcare\\ndata from the national policy level to an organizational level. These issues are (i) the\\nabsence of laws for healthcare data protection, (ii) the use of non-standard healthcare\\ndevices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility, (iii) compliance issues to\\nimplement healthcare policies locally, (iv) and the absence of a dedicated enforcement\\nagency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations [80].\\n4.3.3. Absence of Conﬂict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection\\nAs we have discussed, the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws\\nis the absence of law in many developing countries. There is no law for healthcare data\\nprotection, therefore, patients’ data can be used by the government and private agencies.\\nThey use patients’ medical records for research purposes without their consent. No mon-\\nitoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these\\norganizations.\\n4.3.4. Non-Standard Healthcare Devices and Protocols\\nThe development and production process of various smart devices over a short period\\nreduces the security considerations. Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 17 of 22\\nterms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the\\nhealthcare domain. Usage of non-standard healthcare devices and protocols is the major\\nconcern of healthcare data privacy and protection, which, in context, is the usage of locally\\nmanufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufﬁcient security features according\\nto healthcare standards. Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new\\nthreats and attacks. There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care\\nlaws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features\\nmust be included in them [81].\\n4.3.5. Other Considerations\\nApart from the above-mentioned challenges, there are several local issues worth\\nconsideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives.\\n\\x0f Awareness: There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about\\nthe importance of the security of healthcare data;\\n\\x0f System Management Staff: Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for-\\nwarded by system management staff in healthcare institutes. They work on inter-\\nmediate devices like data servers and gateway devices. The staff is not qualiﬁed\\nenough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects. They are\\nunaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network conﬁgurations\\nand the availability of data at the endpoints. Mostly, they do not update healthcare\\nsystems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised. They have little exposure\\nto awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy;\\n\\x0f Doctors and Healthcare staff: One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the\\nsecurity and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency\\nresponse teams in hospitals. Speciﬁcally, the doctor uses personal devices such as cell\\nphones or laptops to view the data, therefore, these personal devices also need to be\\nsecure. Moreover, they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data\\nleakage. There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to\\nfollow rules and policies to share and process patients’ healthcare data legally and\\nsecurely;\\n\\x0f Patients: These are the central entities in the healthcare system. However, they are\\nless attractive to attackers due to having less information i.e., about themselves only.\\nThey are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their\\nhealthcare privacy. However, they do not have any idea about how their data is shared\\nwith other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data. If\\ntheir data is shared without conferring with them, it begs the question of what the\\nlegal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing;\\n\\x0f Enforcement Difﬁculties: There is no enforcement authority or body established that\\nhelps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector. All the healthcare institutes\\nshould be obliged to follow instructions by some authority. The authority should\\nimplement healthcare laws;\\n\\x0f Low Budget: In developing countries, the medical budget is very limited. The trend\\nof using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities. Mostly, there is no central system\\nor facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries. A very low\\nor limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare\\nsector. Therefore, the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy\\npolicies if the usage of such devices is limited;\\n\\x0f Lack of Qualiﬁed Staff: The IT staff does not conﬁgure/enable security functions in\\nIoHT due to inadequate qualiﬁcations and expertise. The main reason behind it is\\nthe lack of security training programs for medical staff. They are only interested in\\nthe functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of non-functional\\nrequirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy;\\n\\x0f No Internal Auditing: There is no IoHT audit like IT audit, conducted in healthcare\\norganizations and hospitals. If any organization is processing healthcare data, then itAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 18 of 22\\nis unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data. The internal audit ensures\\nwhat data is being processed by which organization for what purposes. The auditing\\nactivities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage;\\n\\x0f No Special Enforcement Authority: One of the difﬁculties in the enforcement of data\\nprivacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the\\nhealthcare sector. Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be\\nthe primary responsibilities of the authority. It can also ensure the compliance of\\nstate-level or national-level policies with international policies.\\n5. Recommendations\\nAfter careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues\\nfor IoHT-based systems, some recommendations can assist in improving this system. These\\nrecommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance\\nissues between different legal frameworks.\\n\\x0f Fines and Penalties: IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are\\nseveral privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data. Speciﬁcally,\\nindividual identiﬁcation and behavior monitoring are major concerns. As the usage\\nof IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector, a huge amount of private data\\nis processed and stored. There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards. The\\nhealth information collected from devices like Fitbit/Jawbone [ 82] can be used to\\ndetect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring;\\n\\x0f Data Anonymization: IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi-\\nronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing. During\\nthis process, several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space\\non the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet\\nProtocol IPv6. This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it\\nsince this communication avoids safety risks;\\n\\x0f Healthcare System Design: The healthcare system should be designed in such a way\\nthat it provides the controls in a user-friendly manner. An end-user must have full\\ncontrol over his/her collected data at any moment i.e., to whom it can be or cannot be\\nshared. At any moment, the user should be given the possibility to know and control\\nwho has his data, what data have been collected, and for what purposes they will be\\nused for the legitimate initial purpose;\\n\\x0f Privacy by Design: Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component\\nintegrated into the whole IoHT core system. The privacy safeguard framework must\\nbe implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process. The health-\\ncare devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces. There are no privacy\\nprotection guidelines available while designing device interfaces. There are several\\nvulnerabilities in web-based interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information\\nleakage attacks. Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have\\ndefault passwords that are difﬁcult to enter due to their small size interfaces;\\n\\x0f Communication Security: There are several communication protocols used in IoT\\nhealthcare devices. There are no speciﬁc guidelines provided in data privacy laws\\nabout protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be\\nadopted for IoT devices, which operate on low memory and computation resources.\\nThese privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication\\nsecurity of these devices, especially for use in hospitals;\\n\\x0f Dispute Resolution: There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes\\nregarding data protection. There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws\\nenforced regionally and internationally. If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed\\nin a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced, then\\nwhat are the possible legal issues that should apply to that person’s processed data?\\nThese types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policies;Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 19 of 22\\n\\x0f Awareness Programs: Awareness programs are very signiﬁcant to highlight the im-\\nportance of data privacy, especially in the healthcare sector. IT staff, management\\nstaff, and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out\\nthe practices of secure processing of healthcare data. They must be aware of the\\nconsequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in\\nthe case of carelessness. Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for\\nthe secure usage of their devices (i.e., laptops and cellphones, etc.) linked to healthcare\\nsystems, and they should share their experiences and difﬁculties while using these\\ndevices securely with healthcare organizations.\\n6. Conclusions\\nIn this paper, we presented a detailed IoHT classiﬁcation along with the general\\narchitecture of IoHT systems. The architecture aids in highlighting data security and\\nprivacy challenges. Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities, we\\nalso discussed the healthcare regulations and afﬁliated issues. We also highlighted major\\nreasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT\\nsystems. The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and\\nhighlighted their limitations. Lastly, we proposed some recommendations regarding data\\nprivacy and security for IoHT implementations. We believe this research will help the\\nindustrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoT-enabled healthcare systems\\nwhile protecting the security and privacy of individuals.\\nAs future work, we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with\\nrespect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves\\nagainst pertinent risks. The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies\\nwill be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem. These risks\\ncould be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data, the ﬂow of information, and\\ncompliance with regional and global regulatory approaches.\\nAuthor Contributions: J.S. and R.A. were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea; A.K.K.\\nand T.A. helped with the methodology and deﬁning the contents of the paper; J.S., R.A., A.K.K. and\\nT.A. were involved in the writing—original draft preparation; J.S., R.A., A.K.K., T.A., S.S. and A.M.A.\\nwere involved in reviewing and editing.

A subset of IoT is the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) that\\nconsists of smart healthcare devices having signiﬁcant importance in monitoring, processing, storing,\\nand transmitting sensitive information. It is experiencing novel challenges regarding data privacy\\nprotection. This article discusses different components of IoHT and categorizes various healthcare\\ndevices based on their functionality and deployment. This article highlights the possible points and\\nreasons for data leakage, such as conﬂicts in laws, the use of sub-standard devices, lack of awareness,\\nand the non-availability of dedicated local law enforcement agencies. This article draws attention to\\nthe escalating demand for a suitable regulatory framework and analyzes compliance problems of\\nIoHT devices concerning healthcare data privacy and protection regulations. Furthermore, the article\\nprovides some recommendations to improve the security and privacy of IoHT implementation.\\nKeywords: IoHT; data privacy; healthcare systems; security and privacy; healthcare regulations\\n1. Introduction\\nThe IoT is an emerging technology that facilitates consumers by exchanging informa-\\ntion with devices connected to the Internet. The International Telecommunication Union\\n(ITU) [ 1] deﬁnes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment.\\nThe spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in\\ndifferent scenarios like security, remote monitoring, electrical appliances control, military\\nuse, and other electronic equipment. One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare\\nsector, i.e., the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), designed to monitor, store, or transmit\\nhealthcare information. In simple words, IoHT is a sub-class of IoT speciﬁcally dealing\\nwith healthcare that includes devices, services, and software [2].\\nThe IoHT describes uniquely identiﬁable devices connected to the Internet, communi-\\ncating with each other, used in the medical area. IoHT devices help to monitor individuals’\\nmedical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service\\nwith the help of wireless network infrastructure [ 3]. Like any other Internet-based device,\\nIoHT devices have a unique identiﬁer such as an IP address which enables them to connect\\nwith the network and to forward/receive data to/from intended devices [ 4]. The central\\nserver manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients’\\nAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927.   Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 2 of 22\\ndiseases. A high-level general working ﬂow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre-\\nsented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efﬁcient, and cost-effective healthcare\\nservices by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely monitoring their patients.\\nIoHT implementations also enable individuals to manage their health data easily and assist\\nthem in how to use wearable health monitors [5,6].\\nAppl.

The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to \\ndiagnose patients ’ diseases. A high -level general working flow diagram of  an IoHT im-\\nplementation is presented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efficient, and cost -\\neffective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely mon-\\nitoring their patients. IoHT implementations also enable indivi duals to manage their \\nhealth data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors [5 ,6]. \\n \\nFigure 1. High -Level Architecture of IoHT Implementation . \\nData privacy is considered to be a fundamental requirement for consumer ac-\\nceptance , which can be ensured through the data flow representation, authentication, and \\nauthorization of the performed activities such as data collection, retention, processing, \\nand transmission. Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection, usage, \\naccess, storage, and sharing activities. These activities might be the reason for personal \\ndata leakage and compromis ing the user’s privacy, especially concerning  healthcare data, \\nas it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive. In this regard, appropri-\\nate protection and security measures are required [7–10]. \\nMoreover, accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the In-\\nternet also cause privacy problems. In June 2015, a censorious privacy violation attack w as \\nlaunched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain \\naccess to hospital networks and leaked private data [11]. Despite this, the privacy frame-\\nwork for IoHT systems and services is expected  to be transparent to patients, making \\navailable updated information to ensure the protection of patients ’ data [6]. The healthcare \\nsystems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate \\ndevices to the management layer. During this process, several prot ocols and encoding \\nschemes are used to communicate data reliably. It is easier to find vulnerabilities in dif-\\nferent components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan, which \\nassist s attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devic es on the Internet [12]. Simi-\\nlarly, a worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be \\nexchanged in a fraction of a second, seamlessly, and without leaving any consistent trace \\n[10].  \\nSome IoT -related data privacy and protect ion policies are used to protect data and \\nuser s’ privacy. However, these legal frameworks have not produced the intended results \\nand the actual level of healthcare data privacy protection is insufficient for the issues men-\\ntioned earlier [9]. There are also  some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data \\nprivacy laws that do not provide a particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data.  \\nIn this paper, we discuss technological, legal, and structural problems of IoHT sys-\\ntems with some analysis, and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and pro-\\ntection framework in the developing countries. The paper uses a layered architecture to \\nhighlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT. It further identifies protec-\\ntion and privacy issu es at different layers from technical and legal perspectives. Further-\\nmore, the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of se-\\ncurity related to data protection discusses possible points of data leakage, missing aspects \\nof hea lthcare policies , and issues in the enforcement of healthcare systems and policies. \\nFigure 1.

Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT)\\nHealth management problems are increasing with the growing population, especially\\nwith the increasingly larger aging population. Sometimes no response from the hospital\\nfor emergencies creates social issues. Similarly, the medical staff in rural areas do not\\nhave sufﬁcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex\\ndiseases. Due to these reasons, people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper\\nmedical attention, increasing the load on hospitals. The late detection of diseases and\\nsevere health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process. Therefore,\\nthere is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system\\nthat includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical\\nproblems [20,21].\\n2.1. IoHT Classiﬁcation Based on Architecture\\nIn this subsection, we present a detailed classiﬁcation of IoHT based on the IoHT\\narchitecture in Figure 2. A generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices [ 22–30],\\ncommunication protocols [ 31–36], and networks [ 37–40]. The IoHT devices are further\\nclassiﬁed as wearable devices and implant devices. The data of IoHT devices are then\\ntransmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE 802.15.6, WBAN, IEEE\\n802.15.1 Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 WiFi, and LoRaWAN. The destination of this medical data\\nis a cloud service, or a remote server designed for intensive processing tasks. Finally, data\\ncan be transmitted to a physician or an Emergency Response Team (ERT) via a mobile\\ncommunication service such as 4G or 5G.\\nOnce the information is collected from different IoHT devices where the sensors\\nexist, it travels toward the near and far edge of the network to be stored, analyzed, and\\nadditionally processing [41].\\nUsing a fog node network can give a health care system more computing power\\nthat smaller and battery-oriented IoHT devices might not be able to achieve. In the IoHT\\narchitecture, data operations, such as classiﬁcation and compression, are completed on the\\nintermediate devices or often single remote servers that allow for the fast processing of data\\nthat mobile devices cannot do. In cloud-based networks, the majority of the computation isAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 4 of 22\\nperformed on the cloud servers because the cloud has a higher computing capacity than the\\nfog node networks. Cloud-based networks utilize multiple servers for parallel computing\\nand data analysis. Moreover, the cloud has data centers that allow for more data storage\\nthat is sometimes needed for patient records.\\nAppl.

IoHT Components  \\nAn IoHT implementation can simply consist of a single sensor device like a heartbeat \\nmonitor connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth.

Servers take the\\nappropriate actions by updating the database or contacting the relevant physicians or quick\\nresponse teams in case of an emergency. It is a simple architecture used in IoT application\\ndevelopment [ 41]. Each connected device has limitations like limited processing, memory,\\nand battery resources, etc., and the applications are developed for better utilization of these\\nlimited resources. The reference architecture model shown in Figure 3 highlights a layered\\napproach for describing IoHT functionalities and their problems. In addition, the layered\\narchitecture is used for identifying IoHT data security and privacy issues in technical and\\nlegal aspects. This ﬁve-layer architecture helps to identify IoHT data security and privacy\\nissues at different layers, what type of devices and entities (medical team, physician, and\\nemergency services) are involved at a speciﬁc layer, and what threat vectors are involved at\\neach layer.Appl.

Protocol Layer\\nThe protocol layer consists of communication protocols and wireless standards used to\\nenable communication for wireless devices. The ﬁrst dedicated standard for Wireless Body\\nArea Networks (WBANs) is the IEEE 802.15.6 released in 2012 [ 31]. IEEE 802.15.6 is de-\\nsigned to support both medical and non-medical applications and can be easily conﬁgured\\nbased on application requirements [ 50]. It ensures communication inside and around the\\nhuman body and is speciﬁcally designed keeping in mind sensor devices that consume less\\nenergy and have a low transmission range. Another upcoming standard in this context is\\nthe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) SmartBan [27,30] . In additionAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 7 of 22\\nto IEEE 802.15.6, there are other commonly used standards and technologies such as IEEE\\n802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee), IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) [ 35], Bluetooth Low Energy\\n(BLE), NFC, LoRaWAN, UWB [ 36], RuBee [ 51], and Z-Wave [ 52]. The choice of the stan-\\ndard used is based on many factors like data rate, transmission range, number of devices\\nsupported, interference due to the coexistence of different technologies, etc. The technical\\ndetails about these protocols, such as frequency, communication range, data transfer rate,\\nenergy consumption, and its security features, are summarized in Table 3.\\nTable 3.

Intermediate Layer\\nDevices in this layer have the responsibility to transmit data to potent computing\\nresources like cloud servers. These devices act like gateways that enable data ﬂow from\\nthe sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis. These\\ndevices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM, etc., [ 53]\\nand forward the collected data to the server. Some intermediate devices can store data as\\nwell for pre-processing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or\\nnot [45]. Some of the intermediate devices are discussed here brieﬂy.\\nSmart Hub is used to make communication easy with smart IoT devices but has many\\nvulnerabilities that draw the attention of attackers into snifﬁng the trafﬁc of the smart\\nhub. If they can access networks, they will be able to spot IoT healthcare devices in the\\nnetwork [54].\\nAccess Points facilitate a wireless connection between different healthcare devices and\\nconnect them with remote servers.\\nIoT Gateways primarily act as the bridge to connect sensor networks with conventional\\ncommunication networks, enabling protocol conversion and device management.\\nThe System on Chip (SoC) is a device that integrates all components of a computer\\nsystem, helps to normalize data collected from different sensors, and controls actuators\\nbased on applications. In this way, it reduces the load on a central server and minimizes\\nthe communication [55].\\nPersonal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are extensively used in the healthcare domain to\\nsupport healthcare providers [56]. Such systems receive data from different wearable and\\nimplanted devices and process them through a variety of software applications [57].\\n2.2.4. Management and Data Link Layer\\nManagement and database servers are the centralized part of the healthcare system\\nthat receives and updates the patient’s data collected by the sensors and can also help the\\nphysicians manage the quantity of medicine or prescribe a new one for the patient. In\\nemergencies, the servers send alerts to physicians and the emergency response teams for\\nappropriate actions.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 8 of 22\\n2.2.5. Feedback Layer\\nThe physicians and the emergency response teams (ERT) provide feedback in any\\nemergency and play a signiﬁcant role in the healthcare system. At this layer, doctors and\\nERT respond to the system when they receive an alert from it.\\nPhysicians are an integral part of the healthcare system and can observe their patients\\nanytime, anywhere, and change treatment when required. An IoT device for a physician\\ngives real-time information about the patient under observation. The IoT gateway device\\ngathers information from different healthcare devices and forwards it to PDA devices held\\nby physicians.\\nEmergency Response Team (ERT): In case of any medical emergency, the responsibility\\nof the ERT is to provide medical attention to patients on-premises or remotely. In the\\ncontext of IoHT, medical devices monitor patients’ conditions and generate alerts in case of\\na medical emergency. Emergency care is a critical part of medical services and is inﬂuenced\\nby the contextual information’s time, availability, and accuracy [58].\\n2.3.

This ﬁgure follows the conventions of a workﬂow diagram where the Start and\\nEnd processes are shown with an oval shape. Different systems processes are demonstrated\\nwith rectangle shapes, and conditional methods are shown with the diamond shapes. The\\nIoHT system consists of a Sensor, Intermediate System, Actuator, Server, and ERT module.\\nA physician is also a part of the system that receives information from the server about a\\npatient’s health condition.\\nFigure 5 presents a three-level generic IoHT implementation framework.

This scenario facilitates attackers in using memory vulnerabilities and compromises\\nthe security of such devices [ 66]. With inadequate resources on lightweight IoT devices, it\\nbecomes challenging to implement strong encryption and authentication schemes.\\n3.1.2. Communication Protocols\\nIoHT devices come with fewer safety checks, and it is the ﬁrmware of these devices\\nthat have security vulnerabilities like hardcoded keys. The urgency to roll out IoHT\\ncloud platforms and the limited user experience of new IoT applications may result in the\\ndevelopment of protocols by I.T. companies having many potential security loopholes. Due\\nto the diversity of IoT devices, it is not easy to develop a standard security protocol for\\nheterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address\\nthe security vulnerabilities among IoT devices.\\n3.1.3. Insecure Middleware\\nTo make IoT applications development more manageable, various IoT middleware\\nplatforms have been developed. These platforms offer distributed system services with\\nstandard programming interfaces and protocols and minimize problems associated with\\nheterogeneity, distribution, and scale in IoT applications development. These services are\\ncalled ‘middleware’ as they sit ‘in the middle’, in a layer above the operating system and\\nnetworking software and below domain-speciﬁc applications [67,68].\\n3.2. Possible Points for Data Leakage\\nIn the healthcare system, there are two states of data from where it can be stolen.\\nThese states are the persistent data (i.e., data at rest) and transient data (i.e., in motion).\\nThe overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure 5.\\nThe arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines\\nrepresent persistent data. The details of each state are as follows.\\n3.2.1. Persistent Data\\nPersistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components,\\nsuch as sensing and actuating devices, etc., and is prone to theft. Here, the features of the\\nhealthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed.\\nHealthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs (latest reading,\\nconﬁguration change, connection history, etc.) in the memory. As these devices usually\\nhave weak security conﬁgurations and store data in non-encrypted forms, an attacker can\\nsteal the data by exploiting these weaknesses.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 10 of 22\\nIoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to\\nsteal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their\\nbiodata.\\nPhysicians/Response Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or\\nresponse teams use to monitor and process healthcare data. These devices are susceptible\\nto memory leakage attacks. Personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, or any speciﬁc\\ndevices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category. Due to direct communication\\nwith IoHT data servers, these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks.\\nFigure 6 is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices operating at different\\nlayers. Effect of one compromised device can propagate at different layers because these\\ndevices are communicating with each other.\\nAppl. Sci.  2022 , 12, 1927  11 of 23 \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. Possible Sites for Data Leakage in an IoHT implementation . \\n3.2.2. Transient Data  \\nTransient data refers to the data on the move, as in the IoHT implementations, the \\ninformation is tran sferred from devices to servers using different protocols and network-\\ning devices. Here, we discuss such devices and protocols from where the data can be sto-\\nlen during transmission.  \\nCommunication protocols are used to transmit data from an IoT device to a d evice. \\nIoT devices are primarily lightweight, low computational, and battery -oriented. Low -\\nrange protocols with weak security features transfer data from IoT devices to a gateway \\ndevice.  \\nIntermediate devices collect data from end devices using a specific p rotocol  to aggre-\\ngate and transform this data into another format that can be underst ood by the next de-\\nvice. A mobile phone or a PDA connected to the wear er acts like an intermediate device. \\nThese intermediate devices use multiple protocols to communicate with IoT endpoint de-\\nvices, data servers, and monitoring devices. These protocols have security issues; IoT gate-\\nways, smart hubs, mobile phones, and WiFi dev ices enable IoT devices to connect with \\nthe Internet.

They are not storage devices; however, they forward re ceived data to the \\nintended destination. Due to the contact with different types of IoT devices, these devices \\noperate multiple protocols.

No med-\\nical devices, either implantable or wearable, are allowed to be manufacture d if they do \\nnot meet data standards.  \\nFigure 6.

Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 11 of 22\\ncomply with any healthcare laws describing the security levels needed for IoT healthcare\\nintermediate devices.\\n3.3. Essential Security Features of IoHT\\nFollowing are some of the essential security features of IoHT.\\nUse of Standardized Devices: To ensure data privacy and security in healthcare sys-\\ntems, it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security features. These\\ndevices should meet healthcare standards and policies. Data storage, transmission, format\\ninterchanges, terminologies, and presentation standards should be well-deﬁned. No medi-\\ncal devices, either implantable or wearable, are allowed to be manufactured if they do not\\nmeet data standards.\\nLog Management and Compliance: Every management activity performed on these\\nhealthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers. For data\\nprivacy, there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system. The best\\npractices are gathering log ﬁles and saving them for future references as long as you need\\nthem. In distributed systems, these reports should be shared with other systems to prove\\ncompliance.\\nUpdating Technologies: Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad-\\nvancement in healthcare systems, and recent innovations have proven this. Technologies\\nhave changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads\\nto improved care and efﬁciency. The latest components are more efﬁcient and secure as\\ncompared to the previous ones. Therefore, the new devices with the latest technologies\\nshould be preferred over the old ones.\\nPatch Management: In addition to upgrading hardware, updating the software of IoT\\ndevice’s ﬁrmware is also essential; if it is not updated, it may be vulnerable. The software\\nvendors release patches from time to time to overcome the ﬂaws and loopholes. Every\\ndevice which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated, whether it is a personal\\ncomputer, smartphone, or any other device such as IoT [20].\\nUser’s Proﬁling: The users should be identiﬁed and authenticated; the system must\\nknow what resources a user can access. This process is called authorization. This process\\nensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the user’s permission.\\nUser proﬁling is more critical in healthcare applications. Healthcare organizations must\\ncomply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and\\nauthorization. The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints\\nwith professional liabilities.\\nGenerate Alerts: There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts\\nfor any kind of malicious event. Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this\\nregard with the help of some applications. Warnings should be raised for critical events and\\nemergencies. These devices can analyze received data; after the detection of any malicious\\nactivity, alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system. Availability\\nof IoHT should be the top priority; if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason,\\nintermediate devices communicate with them directly; therefore, generating alerts by these\\ndevices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly.\\nFines and Penalties: A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector\\nagainst attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health-\\ncare information. Healthcare data is conﬁdential, and if an attacker tries to breach the\\nhealthcare system for the purpose of data-stealing by any means they should be charged\\nwith penalties or imprisonment.\\n4. Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework\\nIn developed countries, there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to\\nsecurely process citizens’ personal data. In this section, we discuss some of them brieﬂy to\\nhighlight their aims and features. These laws and legislations are compared with each other\\nto see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 12 of 22\\narchitecture. Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal\\nmatters, human rights, and social norms. Generally, IoT data privacy regulations are re-\\nquired to support core privacy goals like fairness, purpose satisfaction, proportionality, and\\naccountability. Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these\\ngoals. American, European, and other leading countries’ law enforcement organizations are\\nworking to ﬁnd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also\\nmaking a more effective existing legal framework. An effective legal framework should\\nensure the user’s awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their\\nservices. Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more\\nadequate [6,69].\\n4.1. Major Healthcare Initiative\\nA brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection, for different\\nregions, is given below.\\n4.1.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\\nHIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy\\nof healthcare data for American citizens. It has separate rule sets for security and privacy.\\nThe privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure.\\nThe security rules provide security of the individuals’ health information by adopting\\nadvanced technologies to acquire more efﬁcient means of patient care. The HIPAA security\\nand privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and non-healthcare organizations that\\nstore, transmit, and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means.\\nThe privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities:\\n Common Identiﬁer (e.g., name, address, birth date);\\n Past, present, or future physical and mental health or condition;\\n Past, present, or future payment provision for healthcare;\\n Provision of healthcare to individuals.\\nThe mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and\\npublic interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information\\nexcept for treatment purposes, like payment and relevant health care operations.\\nThe Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created, re-\\nceived, transmitted, and managed electronically. These security rules have the following\\ncharacteristics:\\n Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information;\\n Detects and protects against known threats to conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability;\\n Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information.\\nThe security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes\\npersonnel. Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel.\\nThis rule also includes audit control, access control, integrity control, and transmission\\nsecurity.\\n4.1.2. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nis an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in 2009.\\nHowever, it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry. It only provides\\nlegal liability for noncompliance. Besides applying the HIPAA rules, it is responsible for the\\nnotiﬁcation of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data. It enables individuals\\nwith a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to\\nreceive healthcare information [70].Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 13 of 22\\n4.1.3. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA)\\nThe federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection\\nand Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA) in 2001. Its main purpose is to provide individuals\\ncontrol, to some extent, over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza-\\ntions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens. These policies\\ninclude informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and\\nthis information is protected by using adequate security measures. The PIPEDA applies\\nto all personal data, healthcare data, and other data that holds the private information of\\nindividuals. If any organization collects data, then it is fully accountable for the protection\\nof the collected data. The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada. Every province\\nhas the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA [ 71].\\nPIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal\\ninformation for business purposes. The interconnected devices should use the security\\nstandards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA.\\n4.1.4. EUROHEALTH\\nIn late 1990, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro-\\ngram called EUROHEALTH. It provides medium-term needs for the Countries of Central\\nand Eastern Europe (CCEE) for material, managerial, and technical resources for long-term\\nhealth strategies. The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree-\\nments with CCEE, fundraising, and coordination with international organizations. The\\nprogram’s work has generated an information ﬂow for better cooperation and coordination\\nbetween all the organizations working in the health sector. This program is realistic, ﬂexible,\\nand accessible to the CCEE [72].\\n4.1.5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\nIn May 2018, a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced directive\\n95/46 [ 73], consolidating and innovating data protection rules. The introduced GDPR is\\nconsiderably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance\\nmechanisms that did not exist in the legislation. It applies to all sectors of the economy, all\\nbroadly deﬁned personal data, and every sector that controls or processes data. Moreover,\\nit applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data. GDPR is designed to\\nenable people to better control their data. Although the EU already established its data\\nprotection directive in 1995, it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of\\nthe EU. To remove all the reservations, the GDPR has been established and is applicable\\nthroughout the EU.\\nThe liability of the GDPR’s impact is likely to be for health organizations, hospitals, and\\nother healthcare organizations that process healthcare data. GDPR requires accountability\\nfor how healthcare data is processed. Data controllers are not only responsible for the\\ncompliance, but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and\\ndirection. Furthermore, health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in\\nproﬁling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ﬂow of\\ndata [74].\\n4.1.6. The Privacy Act (Australia)\\nIt entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor-\\nmation of Australian citizens. These principles refer to the usage, storage, and disclosure\\nof personal information. Moreover, individuals have the right to the access and correc-\\ntion of their personal information. This law also includes data security, data quality, and\\ncross-border data ﬂow policies [75].\\nHealthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies\\nand protection. All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information\\n(other than an employee record) are covered by the Privacy Act, whether or not they are\\nsmall businesses. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 14 of 22\\ninformation and personal information for health and medical research purposes, where it\\nis impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals’ consent.\\n4.1.7. Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies (SHIEP)\\nThe main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA\\n(Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) health information exchange like patient care, public health, and\\nquality. This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi\\nHealth Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers,\\nbusiness associates, health information services providers, and subcontractors [76].\\nPersonal Health Information (PHI) will be available for treatment, healthcare op-\\nerations, and public health, but it may be permitted for research and education. This\\npolicy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal\\ninvestigation or inquiry.\\nTable 4 presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ﬁve layers\\narchitecture for IoHT. It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are\\nproviding security at the intermediate and feedback layer. However, both these layers\\nare vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical\\ndevices.\\nTable 4.

Data Protection Issues/Aspects Not Covered in Healthcare Laws\\nThere are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already\\ndiscussed legislative initiatives.\\nBig Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues.\\nPatient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers. In America,\\nmost organizations have HIPAA certiﬁcation, but this does not guarantee a patient’s record\\nsafety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than\\nimplementation. Moreover, the transmission of large data sets from different locations\\nposes an extra burden on processing and storage. Conventional security solutions are\\ninadequate for large and inherently changing data sets. With the emergence of cloud\\nhealthcare solutions, security demands are becoming more complex and there are no\\nspeciﬁed policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws [77].\\nData Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial\\nstep in managing healthcare data. It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry\\ntowards a value-based business model. It demands common data representation that\\nencircles different security standards (e.g., ICD, CPT, and LOINC) [ 78]. Currently, data\\ngenerated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance\\nmodel. There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for\\nproper data governance.\\nPrivacy-preserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to\\nmonitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds. Therefore, it needs to process and analyze\\ndata in an ad-hoc decentralized manner. However, the execution of resource-exhausting\\noperations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge. As new healthcare dataAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 15 of 22\\nanalytics are becoming popular, healthcare data privacy laws need revision, and new laws\\nshould be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients’ private data.\\nIdentiﬁcation of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoT-based devices can be\\nviolated at many stages. Firstly, it is violated by collecting data by third parties. Secondly,\\nthe usage and distribution of private data, and thirdly, the data is combined with other\\ndata. The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoT-based medical\\ndevices to process and generate data. By combining newly generated information with\\nexisting data about a patient or health activity, it raises the high commercial value for many\\ndata-hungry organizations and commercial ﬁrms. Most of the data is often generated by\\nautomated medical devices, therefore, a higher trust level should be maintained for this\\ndata than on manually entered human data. This is important because medical insurance\\ncompanies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical\\ndevices to ascertain the speciﬁc risks associated with their customer’s health. These devices\\nare also tracking users’ geo-locations and such data must be protected through adequate\\ndevice safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage.\\nData and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a\\nsigniﬁcant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT. The quality of data highly\\ndepends on the environment in which it is collected. The quality of context may be\\nunknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context. It may also be\\nambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources.\\nContext quality generates new problems of conﬁdentiality that have not been addressed by\\ncurrent research. Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by\\nhardware components that likely provide the information. It is better to protect context\\nquality as it is sensitive information. Change in context quality is also sensitive information.\\nIoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system\\nor to easily disconnect from it.\\nTo enhance transparency of the healthcare systems, not only healthcare data that\\nis propagated from different devices need to be controlled, but also the data generated\\nautomatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed. Despite this important issue,\\nno law has been made in this regard. There is a need to develop a combined approach with\\ntechnical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency.\\nPrivacy violating interactions and presentation in IoT-based healthcare applications\\nlike heartbeat monitors, geo-tracking devices, automated insulin pumps, and other health-\\ncare devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient. In such devices, the\\ninformation will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings.\\nThis information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be-\\ncomes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different\\nsystems. In smart cities, for instance, an individual could make a query for the way to a\\nspeciﬁc health clinic. Such a query should not be answered, for instance, by showing the\\nway to a health clinic nearby, visible to any passerby, another example of such medical\\ndevices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server. Any adversary\\nintending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose. Due to\\nthe close interaction and presentation techniques, the threat of privacy-violating interaction\\nand presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws.\\nLife cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed\\nby IoT devices during the life cycle transition. These devices hold information like vital\\nsign readings, drug dosage, and actuator functions. Healthcare data is highly sensitive, but\\nalso the collection of simple usage data (e.g., location, duration, frequency) could disclose a\\nlot about the life cycle of people. Despite evident problems with healthcare devices, the\\nlife cycle transition problem has never been addressed. The life cycle of healthcare devices\\nis still modeled as buy-once-own-forever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total\\nmemory wipe (e.g., before selling a wearable) or physical destruction. There is a need to\\nidentify the requirements for ﬂexible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle\\nmanagement mechanisms.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 16 of 22\\nLinkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin-\\ning forms of revealed data sources. When data is gathered from different sources with\\ndifferent permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment. Threats\\nof linking different systems and data sources are not novel. Online social networks and\\nintegrated third-party applications are facing the same problems. However, IoT networks\\nand services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems. Managing\\nthe numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will\\nraise more challenges in linkage threats. The threat of linkage will cause problems in the\\nIoT evolution process. There are mainly two reasons for it. First, the horizontal linkage\\nof different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed\\nsystem-of-systems delivering new services that no single system can provide. Successful\\nlinkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties.\\nHowever, horizontal linkage also causes more local data ﬂows than vertical linkage that\\ncould improve privacy. These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare\\nlaws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices.\\n4.3. IoHT Governance Challenges\\nBased on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives, we identiﬁed the\\nfollowing IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT\\nsystems.\\n4.3.1. Conﬂicts in Laws\\nAfter the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the\\nenforcement of data security and privacy, standards have been widened. For the protection\\nof European citizens’ data outside of Europe, their data is allowed to be used under strict\\nconditions: If any data privacy legislation enacted by a non-EU country accepts Standard\\nContractual Clauses (SCC) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). These terms and conditions\\ncause challenges for developing countries because BCR’s and SCC are time-consuming and\\ncostly [79].\\nA country may or may not have a law for user data protection, but the healthcare\\nsystem should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs. The same thing\\napplies to the social and cultural norms, which should be applied according to the laws of\\nthe state to which the user belongs. In the case of data residing on cloud servers, again, the\\nprivacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients.\\n4.3.2. Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems\\nThe above discussion leads us to ﬁnd the four major issues in protecting healthcare\\ndata from the national policy level to an organizational level. These issues are (i) the\\nabsence of laws for healthcare data protection, (ii) the use of non-standard healthcare\\ndevices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility, (iii) compliance issues to\\nimplement healthcare policies locally, (iv) and the absence of a dedicated enforcement\\nagency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations [80].\\n4.3.3. Absence of Conﬂict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection\\nAs we have discussed, the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws\\nis the absence of law in many developing countries. There is no law for healthcare data\\nprotection, therefore, patients’ data can be used by the government and private agencies.\\nThey use patients’ medical records for research purposes without their consent. No mon-\\nitoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these\\norganizations.\\n4.3.4. Non-Standard Healthcare Devices and Protocols\\nThe development and production process of various smart devices over a short period\\nreduces the security considerations. Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl.

Usage of non-standard healthcare devices and protocols is the major\\nconcern of healthcare data privacy and protection, which, in context, is the usage of locally\\nmanufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufﬁcient security features according\\nto healthcare standards. Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new\\nthreats and attacks. There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care\\nlaws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features\\nmust be included in them [81].\\n4.3.5. Other Considerations\\nApart from the above-mentioned challenges, there are several local issues worth\\nconsideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives.\\n Awareness: There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about\\nthe importance of the security of healthcare data;\\n System Management Staff: Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for-\\nwarded by system management staff in healthcare institutes. They work on inter-\\nmediate devices like data servers and gateway devices. The staff is not qualiﬁed\\nenough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects. They are\\nunaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network conﬁgurations\\nand the availability of data at the endpoints. Mostly, they do not update healthcare\\nsystems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised. They have little exposure\\nto awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy;\\n Doctors and Healthcare staff: One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the\\nsecurity and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency\\nresponse teams in hospitals. Speciﬁcally, the doctor uses personal devices such as cell\\nphones or laptops to view the data, therefore, these personal devices also need to be\\nsecure. Moreover, they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data\\nleakage. There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to\\nfollow rules and policies to share and process patients’ healthcare data legally and\\nsecurely;\\n Patients: These are the central entities in the healthcare system. However, they are\\nless attractive to attackers due to having less information i.e., about themselves only.\\nThey are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their\\nhealthcare privacy. However, they do not have any idea about how their data is shared\\nwith other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data. If\\ntheir data is shared without conferring with them, it begs the question of what the\\nlegal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing;\\n Enforcement Difﬁculties: There is no enforcement authority or body established that\\nhelps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector. All the healthcare institutes\\nshould be obliged to follow instructions by some authority. The authority should\\nimplement healthcare laws;\\n Low Budget: In developing countries, the medical budget is very limited. The trend\\nof using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities. Mostly, there is no central system\\nor facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries. A very low\\nor limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare\\nsector. Therefore, the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy\\npolicies if the usage of such devices is limited;\\n Lack of Qualiﬁed Staff: The IT staff does not conﬁgure/enable security functions in\\nIoHT due to inadequate qualiﬁcations and expertise. The main reason behind it is\\nthe lack of security training programs for medical staff. They are only interested in\\nthe functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of non-functional\\nrequirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy;\\n No Internal Auditing: There is no IoHT audit like IT audit, conducted in healthcare\\norganizations and hospitals. If any organization is processing healthcare data, then itAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 18 of 22\\nis unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data. The internal audit ensures\\nwhat data is being processed by which organization for what purposes. The auditing\\nactivities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage;\\n No Special Enforcement Authority: One of the difﬁculties in the enforcement of data\\nprivacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the\\nhealthcare sector. Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be\\nthe primary responsibilities of the authority. It can also ensure the compliance of\\nstate-level or national-level policies with international policies.\\n5. Recommendations\\nAfter careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues\\nfor IoHT-based systems, some recommendations can assist in improving this system. These\\nrecommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance\\nissues between different legal frameworks.\\n Fines and Penalties: IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are\\nseveral privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data. Speciﬁcally,\\nindividual identiﬁcation and behavior monitoring are major concerns. As the usage\\nof IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector, a huge amount of private data\\nis processed and stored. There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards. The\\nhealth information collected from devices like Fitbit/Jawbone [ 82] can be used to\\ndetect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring;\\n Data Anonymization: IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi-\\nronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing. During\\nthis process, several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space\\non the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet\\nProtocol IPv6. This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it\\nsince this communication avoids safety risks;\\n Healthcare System Design: The healthcare system should be designed in such a way\\nthat it provides the controls in a user-friendly manner. An end-user must have full\\ncontrol over his/her collected data at any moment i.e., to whom it can be or cannot be\\nshared. At any moment, the user should be given the possibility to know and control\\nwho has his data, what data have been collected, and for what purposes they will be\\nused for the legitimate initial purpose;\\n Privacy by Design: Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component\\nintegrated into the whole IoHT core system. The privacy safeguard framework must\\nbe implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process. The health-\\ncare devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces. There are no privacy\\nprotection guidelines available while designing device interfaces. There are several\\nvulnerabilities in web-based interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information\\nleakage attacks. Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have\\ndefault passwords that are difﬁcult to enter due to their small size interfaces;\\n Communication Security: There are several communication protocols used in IoT\\nhealthcare devices. There are no speciﬁc guidelines provided in data privacy laws\\nabout protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be\\nadopted for IoT devices, which operate on low memory and computation resources.\\nThese privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication\\nsecurity of these devices, especially for use in hospitals;\\n Dispute Resolution: There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes\\nregarding data protection. There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws\\nenforced regionally and internationally. If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed\\nin a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced, then\\nwhat are the possible legal issues that should apply to that person’s processed data?\\nThese types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policies;Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 19 of 22\\n Awareness Programs: Awareness programs are very signiﬁcant to highlight the im-\\nportance of data privacy, especially in the healthcare sector. IT staff, management\\nstaff, and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out\\nthe practices of secure processing of healthcare data. They must be aware of the\\nconsequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in\\nthe case of carelessness. Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for\\nthe secure usage of their devices (i.e., laptops and cellphones, etc.) linked to healthcare\\nsystems, and they should share their experiences and difﬁculties while using these\\ndevices securely with healthcare organizations.\\n6. Conclusions\\nIn this paper, we presented a detailed IoHT classiﬁcation along with the general\\narchitecture of IoHT systems. The architecture aids in highlighting data security and\\nprivacy challenges. Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities, we\\nalso discussed the healthcare regulations and afﬁliated issues. We also highlighted major\\nreasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT\\nsystems. The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and\\nhighlighted their limitations. Lastly, we proposed some recommendations regarding data\\nprivacy and security for IoHT implementations. We believe this research will help the\\nindustrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoT-enabled healthcare systems\\nwhile protecting the security and privacy of individuals.\\nAs future work, we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with\\nrespect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves\\nagainst pertinent risks. The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies\\nwill be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem. These risks\\ncould be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data, the ﬂow of information, and\\ncompliance with regional and global regulatory approaches.\\nAuthor Contributions: J.S. and R.A. were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea; A.K.K.\\nand T.A. helped with the methodology and deﬁning the contents of the paper; J.S., R.A., A.K.K. and\\nT.A. were involved in the writing—original draft preparation; J.S., R.A., A.K.K., T.A., S.S. and A.M.A.\\nwere involved in reviewing and editing.

This article discusses different components of IoHT and categorizes various healthcare\\ndevices based on their functionality and deployment. This article highlights the possible points and\\nreasons for data leakage, such as conﬂicts in laws, the use of sub-standard devices, lack of awareness,\\nand the non-availability of dedicated local law enforcement agencies.

Introduction\\nThe IoT is an emerging technology that facilitates consumers by exchanging informa-\\ntion with devices connected to the Internet. The International Telecommunication Union\\n(ITU) [ 1] deﬁnes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment.\\nThe spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in\\ndifferent scenarios like security, remote monitoring, electrical appliances control, military\\nuse, and other electronic equipment. One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare\\nsector, i.e., the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), designed to monitor, store, or transmit\\nhealthcare information. In simple words, IoHT is a sub-class of IoT speciﬁcally dealing\\nwith healthcare that includes devices, services, and software [2].\\nThe IoHT describes uniquely identiﬁable devices connected to the Internet, communi-\\ncating with each other, used in the medical area. IoHT devices help to monitor individuals’\\nmedical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service\\nwith the help of wireless network infrastructure [ 3]. Like any other Internet-based device,\\nIoHT devices have a unique identiﬁer such as an IP address which enables them to connect\\nwith the network and to forward/receive data to/from intended devices [ 4]. The central\\nserver manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients’\\nAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927.   Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 2 of 22\\ndiseases. A high-level general working ﬂow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre-\\nsented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efﬁcient, and cost-effective healthcare\\nservices by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely monitoring their patients.\\nIoHT implementations also enable individuals to manage their health data easily and assist\\nthem in how to use wearable health monitors [5,6].\\nAppl.

The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to \\ndiagnose patients ’ diseases. A high -level general working flow diagram of  an IoHT im-\\nplementation is presented in Figure 1. The idea is to provide reliable, efficient, and cost -\\neffective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely mon-\\nitoring their patients. IoHT implementations also enable indivi duals to manage their \\nhealth data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors [5 ,6]. \\n \\nFigure 1. High -Level Architecture of IoHT Implementation . \\nData privacy is considered to be a fundamental requirement for consumer ac-\\nceptance , which can be ensured through the data flow representation, authentication, and \\nauthorization of the performed activities such as data collection, retention, processing, \\nand transmission. Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection, usage, \\naccess, storage, and sharing activities. These activities might be the reason for personal \\ndata leakage and compromis ing the user’s privacy, especially concerning  healthcare data, \\nas it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive. In this regard, appropri-\\nate protection and security measures are required [7–10]. \\nMoreover, accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the In-\\nternet also cause privacy problems. In June 2015, a censorious privacy violation attack w as \\nlaunched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain \\naccess to hospital networks and leaked private data [11]. Despite this, the privacy frame-\\nwork for IoHT systems and services is expected  to be transparent to patients, making \\navailable updated information to ensure the protection of patients ’ data [6]. The healthcare \\nsystems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate \\ndevices to the management layer. During this process, several prot ocols and encoding \\nschemes are used to communicate data reliably. It is easier to find vulnerabilities in dif-\\nferent components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan, which \\nassist s attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devic es on the Internet [12]. Simi-\\nlarly, a worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be \\nexchanged in a fraction of a second, seamlessly, and without leaving any consistent trace \\n[10].  \\nSome IoT -related data privacy and protect ion policies are used to protect data and \\nuser s’ privacy. However, these legal frameworks have not produced the intended results \\nand the actual level of healthcare data privacy protection is insufficient for the issues men-\\ntioned earlier [9]. There are also  some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data \\nprivacy laws that do not provide a particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data.  \\nIn this paper, we discuss technological, legal, and structural problems of IoHT sys-\\ntems with some analysis, and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and pro-\\ntection framework in the developing countries. The paper uses a layered architecture to \\nhighlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT. It further identifies protec-\\ntion and privacy issu es at different layers from technical and legal perspectives. Further-\\nmore, the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of se-\\ncurity related to data protection discusses possible points of data leakage, missing aspects \\nof hea lthcare policies , and issues in the enforcement of healthcare systems and policies. \\nFigure 1.

Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT)\\nHealth management problems are increasing with the growing population, especially\\nwith the increasingly larger aging population. Sometimes no response from the hospital\\nfor emergencies creates social issues. Similarly, the medical staff in rural areas do not\\nhave sufﬁcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex\\ndiseases. Due to these reasons, people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper\\nmedical attention, increasing the load on hospitals. The late detection of diseases and\\nsevere health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process. Therefore,\\nthere is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system\\nthat includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical\\nproblems [20,21].\\n2.1. IoHT Classiﬁcation Based on Architecture\\nIn this subsection, we present a detailed classiﬁcation of IoHT based on the IoHT\\narchitecture in Figure 2. A generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices [ 22–30],\\ncommunication protocols [ 31–36], and networks [ 37–40]. The IoHT devices are further\\nclassiﬁed as wearable devices and implant devices. The data of IoHT devices are then\\ntransmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE 802.15.6, WBAN, IEEE\\n802.15.1 Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 WiFi, and LoRaWAN. The destination of this medical data\\nis a cloud service, or a remote server designed for intensive processing tasks. Finally, data\\ncan be transmitted to a physician or an Emergency Response Team (ERT) via a mobile\\ncommunication service such as 4G or 5G.\\nOnce the information is collected from different IoHT devices where the sensors\\nexist, it travels toward the near and far edge of the network to be stored, analyzed, and\\nadditionally processing [41].\\nUsing a fog node network can give a health care system more computing power\\nthat smaller and battery-oriented IoHT devices might not be able to achieve. In the IoHT\\narchitecture, data operations, such as classiﬁcation and compression, are completed on the\\nintermediate devices or often single remote servers that allow for the fast processing of data\\nthat mobile devices cannot do. In cloud-based networks, the majority of the computation isAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 4 of 22\\nperformed on the cloud servers because the cloud has a higher computing capacity than the\\nfog node networks. Cloud-based networks utilize multiple servers for parallel computing\\nand data analysis. Moreover, the cloud has data centers that allow for more data storage\\nthat is sometimes needed for patient records.\\nAppl.

IoHT Components  \\nAn IoHT implementation can simply consist of a single sensor device like a heartbeat \\nmonitor connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth.

Servers take the\\nappropriate actions by updating the database or contacting the relevant physicians or quick\\nresponse teams in case of an emergency. It is a simple architecture used in IoT application\\ndevelopment [ 41]. Each connected device has limitations like limited processing, memory,\\nand battery resources, etc., and the applications are developed for better utilization of these\\nlimited resources. The reference architecture model shown in Figure 3 highlights a layered\\napproach for describing IoHT functionalities and their problems. In addition, the layered\\narchitecture is used for identifying IoHT data security and privacy issues in technical and\\nlegal aspects. This ﬁve-layer architecture helps to identify IoHT data security and privacy\\nissues at different layers, what type of devices and entities (medical team, physician, and\\nemergency services) are involved at a speciﬁc layer, and what threat vectors are involved at\\neach layer.Appl.

Protocol Layer\\nThe protocol layer consists of communication protocols and wireless standards used to\\nenable communication for wireless devices. The ﬁrst dedicated standard for Wireless Body\\nArea Networks (WBANs) is the IEEE 802.15.6 released in 2012 [ 31]. IEEE 802.15.6 is de-\\nsigned to support both medical and non-medical applications and can be easily conﬁgured\\nbased on application requirements [ 50]. It ensures communication inside and around the\\nhuman body and is speciﬁcally designed keeping in mind sensor devices that consume less\\nenergy and have a low transmission range. Another upcoming standard in this context is\\nthe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) SmartBan [27,30] . In additionAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 7 of 22\\nto IEEE 802.15.6, there are other commonly used standards and technologies such as IEEE\\n802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee), IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) [ 35], Bluetooth Low Energy\\n(BLE), NFC, LoRaWAN, UWB [ 36], RuBee [ 51], and Z-Wave [ 52]. The choice of the stan-\\ndard used is based on many factors like data rate, transmission range, number of devices\\nsupported, interference due to the coexistence of different technologies, etc. The technical\\ndetails about these protocols, such as frequency, communication range, data transfer rate,\\nenergy consumption, and its security features, are summarized in Table 3.\\nTable 3.

Intermediate Layer\\nDevices in this layer have the responsibility to transmit data to potent computing\\nresources like cloud servers. These devices act like gateways that enable data ﬂow from\\nthe sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis. These\\ndevices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM, etc., [ 53]\\nand forward the collected data to the server. Some intermediate devices can store data as\\nwell for pre-processing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or\\nnot [45]. Some of the intermediate devices are discussed here brieﬂy.\\nSmart Hub is used to make communication easy with smart IoT devices but has many\\nvulnerabilities that draw the attention of attackers into snifﬁng the trafﬁc of the smart\\nhub. If they can access networks, they will be able to spot IoT healthcare devices in the\\nnetwork [54].\\nAccess Points facilitate a wireless connection between different healthcare devices and\\nconnect them with remote servers.\\nIoT Gateways primarily act as the bridge to connect sensor networks with conventional\\ncommunication networks, enabling protocol conversion and device management.\\nThe System on Chip (SoC) is a device that integrates all components of a computer\\nsystem, helps to normalize data collected from different sensors, and controls actuators\\nbased on applications. In this way, it reduces the load on a central server and minimizes\\nthe communication [55].\\nPersonal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are extensively used in the healthcare domain to\\nsupport healthcare providers [56]. Such systems receive data from different wearable and\\nimplanted devices and process them through a variety of software applications [57].\\n2.2.4. Management and Data Link Layer\\nManagement and database servers are the centralized part of the healthcare system\\nthat receives and updates the patient’s data collected by the sensors and can also help the\\nphysicians manage the quantity of medicine or prescribe a new one for the patient. In\\nemergencies, the servers send alerts to physicians and the emergency response teams for\\nappropriate actions.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 8 of 22\\n2.2.5. Feedback Layer\\nThe physicians and the emergency response teams (ERT) provide feedback in any\\nemergency and play a signiﬁcant role in the healthcare system. At this layer, doctors and\\nERT respond to the system when they receive an alert from it.\\nPhysicians are an integral part of the healthcare system and can observe their patients\\nanytime, anywhere, and change treatment when required. An IoT device for a physician\\ngives real-time information about the patient under observation. The IoT gateway device\\ngathers information from different healthcare devices and forwards it to PDA devices held\\nby physicians.\\nEmergency Response Team (ERT): In case of any medical emergency, the responsibility\\nof the ERT is to provide medical attention to patients on-premises or remotely. In the\\ncontext of IoHT, medical devices monitor patients’ conditions and generate alerts in case of\\na medical emergency. Emergency care is a critical part of medical services and is inﬂuenced\\nby the contextual information’s time, availability, and accuracy [58].\\n2.3.

This ﬁgure follows the conventions of a workﬂow diagram where the Start and\\nEnd processes are shown with an oval shape. Different systems processes are demonstrated\\nwith rectangle shapes, and conditional methods are shown with the diamond shapes. The\\nIoHT system consists of a Sensor, Intermediate System, Actuator, Server, and ERT module.\\nA physician is also a part of the system that receives information from the server about a\\npatient’s health condition.\\nFigure 5 presents a three-level generic IoHT implementation framework.

IoHT Security Landscape \\nIoHT security goes beyond device security, therefore, rather than only physical inter-\\nfaces and firmware on the device, its scope must include web, mobile/cloud interfaces, \\nnetwork services, local storage, and 3rd part y APIs as well.

IoHT Security Landscape\\nIoHT security goes beyond device security, therefore, rather than only physical inter-\\nfaces and ﬁrmware on the device, its scope must include web, mobile/cloud interfaces,\\nnetwork services, local storage, and 3rd party APIs as well.

The urgency to roll out IoHT\\ncloud platforms and the limited user experience of new IoT applications may result in the\\ndevelopment of protocols by I.T. companies having many potential security loopholes. Due\\nto the diversity of IoT devices, it is not easy to develop a standard security protocol for\\nheterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address\\nthe security vulnerabilities among IoT devices.\\n3.1.3. Insecure Middleware\\nTo make IoT applications development more manageable, various IoT middleware\\nplatforms have been developed. These platforms offer distributed system services with\\nstandard programming interfaces and protocols and minimize problems associated with\\nheterogeneity, distribution, and scale in IoT applications development. These services are\\ncalled ‘middleware’ as they sit ‘in the middle’, in a layer above the operating system and\\nnetworking software and below domain-speciﬁc applications [67,68].\\n3.2. Possible Points for Data Leakage\\nIn the healthcare system, there are two states of data from where it can be stolen.\\nThese states are the persistent data (i.e., data at rest) and transient data (i.e., in motion).\\nThe overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure 5.\\nThe arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines\\nrepresent persistent data. The details of each state are as follows.\\n3.2.1. Persistent Data\\nPersistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components,\\nsuch as sensing and actuating devices, etc., and is prone to theft. Here, the features of the\\nhealthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed.\\nHealthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs (latest reading,\\nconﬁguration change, connection history, etc.) in the memory. As these devices usually\\nhave weak security conﬁgurations and store data in non-encrypted forms, an attacker can\\nsteal the data by exploiting these weaknesses.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 10 of 22\\nIoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to\\nsteal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their\\nbiodata.\\nPhysicians/Response Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or\\nresponse teams use to monitor and process healthcare data. These devices are susceptible\\nto memory leakage attacks. Personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, or any speciﬁc\\ndevices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category. Due to direct communication\\nwith IoHT data servers, these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks.\\nFigure 6 is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices operating at different\\nlayers. Effect of one compromised device can propagate at different layers because these\\ndevices are communicating with each other.\\nAppl. Sci.  2022 , 12, 1927  11 of 23 \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. Possible Sites for Data Leakage in an IoHT implementation . \\n3.2.2. Transient Data  \\nTransient data refers to the data on the move, as in the IoHT implementations, the \\ninformation is tran sferred from devices to servers using different protocols and network-\\ning devices. Here, we discuss such devices and protocols from where the data can be sto-\\nlen during transmission.  \\nCommunication protocols are used to transmit data from an IoT device to a d evice. \\nIoT devices are primarily lightweight, low computational, and battery -oriented. Low -\\nrange protocols with weak security features transfer data from IoT devices to a gateway \\ndevice.  \\nIntermediate devices collect data from end devices using a specific p rotocol  to aggre-\\ngate and transform this data into another format that can be underst ood by the next de-\\nvice. A mobile phone or a PDA connected to the wear er acts like an intermediate device. \\nThese intermediate devices use multiple protocols to communicate with IoT endpoint de-\\nvices, data servers, and monitoring devices. These protocols have security issues; IoT gate-\\nways, smart hubs, mobile phones, and WiFi dev ices enable IoT devices to connect with \\nthe Internet.

Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 11 of 22\\ncomply with any healthcare laws describing the security levels needed for IoT healthcare\\nintermediate devices.\\n3.3. Essential Security Features of IoHT\\nFollowing are some of the essential security features of IoHT.\\nUse of Standardized Devices: To ensure data privacy and security in healthcare sys-\\ntems, it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security features. These\\ndevices should meet healthcare standards and policies. Data storage, transmission, format\\ninterchanges, terminologies, and presentation standards should be well-deﬁned. No medi-\\ncal devices, either implantable or wearable, are allowed to be manufactured if they do not\\nmeet data standards.\\nLog Management and Compliance: Every management activity performed on these\\nhealthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers. For data\\nprivacy, there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system. The best\\npractices are gathering log ﬁles and saving them for future references as long as you need\\nthem. In distributed systems, these reports should be shared with other systems to prove\\ncompliance.\\nUpdating Technologies: Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad-\\nvancement in healthcare systems, and recent innovations have proven this. Technologies\\nhave changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads\\nto improved care and efﬁciency. The latest components are more efﬁcient and secure as\\ncompared to the previous ones. Therefore, the new devices with the latest technologies\\nshould be preferred over the old ones.\\nPatch Management: In addition to upgrading hardware, updating the software of IoT\\ndevice’s ﬁrmware is also essential; if it is not updated, it may be vulnerable. The software\\nvendors release patches from time to time to overcome the ﬂaws and loopholes. Every\\ndevice which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated, whether it is a personal\\ncomputer, smartphone, or any other device such as IoT [20].\\nUser’s Proﬁling: The users should be identiﬁed and authenticated; the system must\\nknow what resources a user can access. This process is called authorization. This process\\nensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the user’s permission.\\nUser proﬁling is more critical in healthcare applications. Healthcare organizations must\\ncomply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and\\nauthorization. The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints\\nwith professional liabilities.\\nGenerate Alerts: There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts\\nfor any kind of malicious event. Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this\\nregard with the help of some applications. Warnings should be raised for critical events and\\nemergencies. These devices can analyze received data; after the detection of any malicious\\nactivity, alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system. Availability\\nof IoHT should be the top priority; if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason,\\nintermediate devices communicate with them directly; therefore, generating alerts by these\\ndevices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly.\\nFines and Penalties: A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector\\nagainst attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health-\\ncare information. Healthcare data is conﬁdential, and if an attacker tries to breach the\\nhealthcare system for the purpose of data-stealing by any means they should be charged\\nwith penalties or imprisonment.\\n4. Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework\\nIn developed countries, there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to\\nsecurely process citizens’ personal data. In this section, we discuss some of them brieﬂy to\\nhighlight their aims and features. These laws and legislations are compared with each other\\nto see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 12 of 22\\narchitecture. Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal\\nmatters, human rights, and social norms. Generally, IoT data privacy regulations are re-\\nquired to support core privacy goals like fairness, purpose satisfaction, proportionality, and\\naccountability. Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these\\ngoals. American, European, and other leading countries’ law enforcement organizations are\\nworking to ﬁnd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also\\nmaking a more effective existing legal framework. An effective legal framework should\\nensure the user’s awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their\\nservices. Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more\\nadequate [6,69].\\n4.1. Major Healthcare Initiative\\nA brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection, for different\\nregions, is given below.\\n4.1.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\\nHIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy\\nof healthcare data for American citizens. It has separate rule sets for security and privacy.\\nThe privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure.\\nThe security rules provide security of the individuals’ health information by adopting\\nadvanced technologies to acquire more efﬁcient means of patient care. The HIPAA security\\nand privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and non-healthcare organizations that\\nstore, transmit, and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means.\\nThe privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities:\\n Common Identiﬁer (e.g., name, address, birth date);\\n Past, present, or future physical and mental health or condition;\\n Past, present, or future payment provision for healthcare;\\n Provision of healthcare to individuals.\\nThe mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and\\npublic interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information\\nexcept for treatment purposes, like payment and relevant health care operations.\\nThe Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created, re-\\nceived, transmitted, and managed electronically. These security rules have the following\\ncharacteristics:\\n Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information;\\n Detects and protects against known threats to conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability;\\n Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information.\\nThe security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes\\npersonnel. Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel.\\nThis rule also includes audit control, access control, integrity control, and transmission\\nsecurity.\\n4.1.2. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\\nis an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in 2009.\\nHowever, it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry. It only provides\\nlegal liability for noncompliance. Besides applying the HIPAA rules, it is responsible for the\\nnotiﬁcation of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data. It enables individuals\\nwith a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to\\nreceive healthcare information [70].Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 13 of 22\\n4.1.3. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA)\\nThe federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection\\nand Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA) in 2001. Its main purpose is to provide individuals\\ncontrol, to some extent, over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza-\\ntions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens. These policies\\ninclude informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and\\nthis information is protected by using adequate security measures. The PIPEDA applies\\nto all personal data, healthcare data, and other data that holds the private information of\\nindividuals. If any organization collects data, then it is fully accountable for the protection\\nof the collected data. The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada. Every province\\nhas the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA [ 71].\\nPIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal\\ninformation for business purposes. The interconnected devices should use the security\\nstandards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA.\\n4.1.4. EUROHEALTH\\nIn late 1990, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro-\\ngram called EUROHEALTH. It provides medium-term needs for the Countries of Central\\nand Eastern Europe (CCEE) for material, managerial, and technical resources for long-term\\nhealth strategies. The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree-\\nments with CCEE, fundraising, and coordination with international organizations. The\\nprogram’s work has generated an information ﬂow for better cooperation and coordination\\nbetween all the organizations working in the health sector. This program is realistic, ﬂexible,\\nand accessible to the CCEE [72].\\n4.1.5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\nIn May 2018, a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced directive\\n95/46 [ 73], consolidating and innovating data protection rules. The introduced GDPR is\\nconsiderably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance\\nmechanisms that did not exist in the legislation. It applies to all sectors of the economy, all\\nbroadly deﬁned personal data, and every sector that controls or processes data. Moreover,\\nit applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data. GDPR is designed to\\nenable people to better control their data. Although the EU already established its data\\nprotection directive in 1995, it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of\\nthe EU. To remove all the reservations, the GDPR has been established and is applicable\\nthroughout the EU.\\nThe liability of the GDPR’s impact is likely to be for health organizations, hospitals, and\\nother healthcare organizations that process healthcare data. GDPR requires accountability\\nfor how healthcare data is processed. Data controllers are not only responsible for the\\ncompliance, but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and\\ndirection. Furthermore, health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in\\nproﬁling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ﬂow of\\ndata [74].\\n4.1.6. The Privacy Act (Australia)\\nIt entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor-\\nmation of Australian citizens. These principles refer to the usage, storage, and disclosure\\nof personal information. Moreover, individuals have the right to the access and correc-\\ntion of their personal information. This law also includes data security, data quality, and\\ncross-border data ﬂow policies [75].\\nHealthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies\\nand protection. All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information\\n(other than an employee record) are covered by the Privacy Act, whether or not they are\\nsmall businesses. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 14 of 22\\ninformation and personal information for health and medical research purposes, where it\\nis impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals’ consent.\\n4.1.7. Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies (SHIEP)\\nThe main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA\\n(Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) health information exchange like patient care, public health, and\\nquality. This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi\\nHealth Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers,\\nbusiness associates, health information services providers, and subcontractors [76].\\nPersonal Health Information (PHI) will be available for treatment, healthcare op-\\nerations, and public health, but it may be permitted for research and education. This\\npolicy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal\\ninvestigation or inquiry.\\nTable 4 presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ﬁve layers\\narchitecture for IoHT. It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are\\nproviding security at the intermediate and feedback layer. However, both these layers\\nare vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical\\ndevices.\\nTable 4.

Data Protection Issues/Aspects Not Covered in Healthcare Laws\\nThere are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already\\ndiscussed legislative initiatives.\\nBig Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues.\\nPatient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers. In America,\\nmost organizations have HIPAA certiﬁcation, but this does not guarantee a patient’s record\\nsafety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than\\nimplementation. Moreover, the transmission of large data sets from different locations\\nposes an extra burden on processing and storage. Conventional security solutions are\\ninadequate for large and inherently changing data sets. With the emergence of cloud\\nhealthcare solutions, security demands are becoming more complex and there are no\\nspeciﬁed policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws [77].\\nData Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial\\nstep in managing healthcare data. It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry\\ntowards a value-based business model. It demands common data representation that\\nencircles different security standards (e.g., ICD, CPT, and LOINC) [ 78]. Currently, data\\ngenerated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance\\nmodel. There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for\\nproper data governance.\\nPrivacy-preserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to\\nmonitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds. Therefore, it needs to process and analyze\\ndata in an ad-hoc decentralized manner. However, the execution of resource-exhausting\\noperations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge. As new healthcare dataAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 15 of 22\\nanalytics are becoming popular, healthcare data privacy laws need revision, and new laws\\nshould be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients’ private data.\\nIdentiﬁcation of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoT-based devices can be\\nviolated at many stages. Firstly, it is violated by collecting data by third parties. Secondly,\\nthe usage and distribution of private data, and thirdly, the data is combined with other\\ndata. The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoT-based medical\\ndevices to process and generate data. By combining newly generated information with\\nexisting data about a patient or health activity, it raises the high commercial value for many\\ndata-hungry organizations and commercial ﬁrms. Most of the data is often generated by\\nautomated medical devices, therefore, a higher trust level should be maintained for this\\ndata than on manually entered human data. This is important because medical insurance\\ncompanies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical\\ndevices to ascertain the speciﬁc risks associated with their customer’s health. These devices\\nare also tracking users’ geo-locations and such data must be protected through adequate\\ndevice safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage.\\nData and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a\\nsigniﬁcant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT. The quality of data highly\\ndepends on the environment in which it is collected. The quality of context may be\\nunknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context. It may also be\\nambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources.\\nContext quality generates new problems of conﬁdentiality that have not been addressed by\\ncurrent research. Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by\\nhardware components that likely provide the information. It is better to protect context\\nquality as it is sensitive information. Change in context quality is also sensitive information.\\nIoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system\\nor to easily disconnect from it.\\nTo enhance transparency of the healthcare systems, not only healthcare data that\\nis propagated from different devices need to be controlled, but also the data generated\\nautomatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed. Despite this important issue,\\nno law has been made in this regard. There is a need to develop a combined approach with\\ntechnical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency.\\nPrivacy violating interactions and presentation in IoT-based healthcare applications\\nlike heartbeat monitors, geo-tracking devices, automated insulin pumps, and other health-\\ncare devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient. In such devices, the\\ninformation will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings.\\nThis information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be-\\ncomes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different\\nsystems. In smart cities, for instance, an individual could make a query for the way to a\\nspeciﬁc health clinic. Such a query should not be answered, for instance, by showing the\\nway to a health clinic nearby, visible to any passerby, another example of such medical\\ndevices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server. Any adversary\\nintending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose. Due to\\nthe close interaction and presentation techniques, the threat of privacy-violating interaction\\nand presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws.\\nLife cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed\\nby IoT devices during the life cycle transition. These devices hold information like vital\\nsign readings, drug dosage, and actuator functions. Healthcare data is highly sensitive, but\\nalso the collection of simple usage data (e.g., location, duration, frequency) could disclose a\\nlot about the life cycle of people. Despite evident problems with healthcare devices, the\\nlife cycle transition problem has never been addressed. The life cycle of healthcare devices\\nis still modeled as buy-once-own-forever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total\\nmemory wipe (e.g., before selling a wearable) or physical destruction. There is a need to\\nidentify the requirements for ﬂexible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle\\nmanagement mechanisms.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 16 of 22\\nLinkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin-\\ning forms of revealed data sources. When data is gathered from different sources with\\ndifferent permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment. Threats\\nof linking different systems and data sources are not novel. Online social networks and\\nintegrated third-party applications are facing the same problems. However, IoT networks\\nand services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems. Managing\\nthe numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will\\nraise more challenges in linkage threats. The threat of linkage will cause problems in the\\nIoT evolution process. There are mainly two reasons for it. First, the horizontal linkage\\nof different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed\\nsystem-of-systems delivering new services that no single system can provide. Successful\\nlinkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties.\\nHowever, horizontal linkage also causes more local data ﬂows than vertical linkage that\\ncould improve privacy. These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare\\nlaws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices.\\n4.3. IoHT Governance Challenges\\nBased on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives, we identiﬁed the\\nfollowing IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT\\nsystems.\\n4.3.1. Conﬂicts in Laws\\nAfter the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the\\nenforcement of data security and privacy, standards have been widened. For the protection\\nof European citizens’ data outside of Europe, their data is allowed to be used under strict\\nconditions: If any data privacy legislation enacted by a non-EU country accepts Standard\\nContractual Clauses (SCC) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). These terms and conditions\\ncause challenges for developing countries because BCR’s and SCC are time-consuming and\\ncostly [79].\\nA country may or may not have a law for user data protection, but the healthcare\\nsystem should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs. The same thing\\napplies to the social and cultural norms, which should be applied according to the laws of\\nthe state to which the user belongs. In the case of data residing on cloud servers, again, the\\nprivacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients.\\n4.3.2. Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems\\nThe above discussion leads us to ﬁnd the four major issues in protecting healthcare\\ndata from the national policy level to an organizational level. These issues are (i) the\\nabsence of laws for healthcare data protection, (ii) the use of non-standard healthcare\\ndevices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility, (iii) compliance issues to\\nimplement healthcare policies locally, (iv) and the absence of a dedicated enforcement\\nagency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations [80].\\n4.3.3. Absence of Conﬂict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection\\nAs we have discussed, the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws\\nis the absence of law in many developing countries. There is no law for healthcare data\\nprotection, therefore, patients’ data can be used by the government and private agencies.\\nThey use patients’ medical records for research purposes without their consent. No mon-\\nitoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these\\norganizations.\\n4.3.4. Non-Standard Healthcare Devices and Protocols\\nThe development and production process of various smart devices over a short period\\nreduces the security considerations. Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 17 of 22\\nterms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the\\nhealthcare domain. Usage of non-standard healthcare devices and protocols is the major\\nconcern of healthcare data privacy and protection, which, in context, is the usage of locally\\nmanufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufﬁcient security features according\\nto healthcare standards. Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new\\nthreats and attacks. There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care\\nlaws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features\\nmust be included in them [81].\\n4.3.5. Other Considerations\\nApart from the above-mentioned challenges, there are several local issues worth\\nconsideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives.\\n Awareness: There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about\\nthe importance of the security of healthcare data;\\n System Management Staff: Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for-\\nwarded by system management staff in healthcare institutes. They work on inter-\\nmediate devices like data servers and gateway devices. The staff is not qualiﬁed\\nenough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects. They are\\nunaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network conﬁgurations\\nand the availability of data at the endpoints. Mostly, they do not update healthcare\\nsystems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised. They have little exposure\\nto awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy;\\n Doctors and Healthcare staff: One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the\\nsecurity and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency\\nresponse teams in hospitals. Speciﬁcally, the doctor uses personal devices such as cell\\nphones or laptops to view the data, therefore, these personal devices also need to be\\nsecure. Moreover, they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data\\nleakage. There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to\\nfollow rules and policies to share and process patients’ healthcare data legally and\\nsecurely;\\n Patients: These are the central entities in the healthcare system. However, they are\\nless attractive to attackers due to having less information i.e., about themselves only.\\nThey are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their\\nhealthcare privacy. However, they do not have any idea about how their data is shared\\nwith other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data. If\\ntheir data is shared without conferring with them, it begs the question of what the\\nlegal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing;\\n Enforcement Difﬁculties: There is no enforcement authority or body established that\\nhelps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector. All the healthcare institutes\\nshould be obliged to follow instructions by some authority. The authority should\\nimplement healthcare laws;\\n Low Budget: In developing countries, the medical budget is very limited. The trend\\nof using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities. Mostly, there is no central system\\nor facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries. A very low\\nor limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare\\nsector. Therefore, the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy\\npolicies if the usage of such devices is limited;\\n Lack of Qualiﬁed Staff: The IT staff does not conﬁgure/enable security functions in\\nIoHT due to inadequate qualiﬁcations and expertise. The main reason behind it is\\nthe lack of security training programs for medical staff. They are only interested in\\nthe functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of non-functional\\nrequirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy;\\n No Internal Auditing: There is no IoHT audit like IT audit, conducted in healthcare\\norganizations and hospitals. If any organization is processing healthcare data, then itAppl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 18 of 22\\nis unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data. The internal audit ensures\\nwhat data is being processed by which organization for what purposes. The auditing\\nactivities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage;\\n No Special Enforcement Authority: One of the difﬁculties in the enforcement of data\\nprivacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the\\nhealthcare sector. Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be\\nthe primary responsibilities of the authority. It can also ensure the compliance of\\nstate-level or national-level policies with international policies.\\n5. Recommendations\\nAfter careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues\\nfor IoHT-based systems, some recommendations can assist in improving this system. These\\nrecommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance\\nissues between different legal frameworks.\\n Fines and Penalties: IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are\\nseveral privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data. Speciﬁcally,\\nindividual identiﬁcation and behavior monitoring are major concerns. As the usage\\nof IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector, a huge amount of private data\\nis processed and stored. There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards. The\\nhealth information collected from devices like Fitbit/Jawbone [ 82] can be used to\\ndetect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring;\\n Data Anonymization: IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi-\\nronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing. During\\nthis process, several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space\\non the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet\\nProtocol IPv6. This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it\\nsince this communication avoids safety risks;\\n Healthcare System Design: The healthcare system should be designed in such a way\\nthat it provides the controls in a user-friendly manner. An end-user must have full\\ncontrol over his/her collected data at any moment i.e., to whom it can be or cannot be\\nshared. At any moment, the user should be given the possibility to know and control\\nwho has his data, what data have been collected, and for what purposes they will be\\nused for the legitimate initial purpose;\\n Privacy by Design: Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component\\nintegrated into the whole IoHT core system. The privacy safeguard framework must\\nbe implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process. The health-\\ncare devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces. There are no privacy\\nprotection guidelines available while designing device interfaces. There are several\\nvulnerabilities in web-based interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information\\nleakage attacks. Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have\\ndefault passwords that are difﬁcult to enter due to their small size interfaces;\\n Communication Security: There are several communication protocols used in IoT\\nhealthcare devices. There are no speciﬁc guidelines provided in data privacy laws\\nabout protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be\\nadopted for IoT devices, which operate on low memory and computation resources.\\nThese privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication\\nsecurity of these devices, especially for use in hospitals;\\n Dispute Resolution: There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes\\nregarding data protection. There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws\\nenforced regionally and internationally. If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed\\nin a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced, then\\nwhat are the possible legal issues that should apply to that person’s processed data?\\nThese types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policies;Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 1927 19 of 22\\n Awareness Programs: Awareness programs are very signiﬁcant to highlight the im-\\nportance of data privacy, especially in the healthcare sector. IT staff, management\\nstaff, and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out\\nthe practices of secure processing of healthcare data. They must be aware of the\\nconsequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in\\nthe case of carelessness. Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for\\nthe secure usage of their devices (i.e., laptops and cellphones, etc.) linked to healthcare\\nsystems, and they should share their experiences and difﬁculties while using these\\ndevices securely with healthcare organizations.\\n6. Conclusions\\nIn this paper, we presented a detailed IoHT classiﬁcation along with the general\\narchitecture of IoHT systems. The architecture aids in highlighting data security and\\nprivacy challenges. Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities, we\\nalso discussed the healthcare regulations and afﬁliated issues. We also highlighted major\\nreasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT\\nsystems. The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and\\nhighlighted their limitations. Lastly, we proposed some recommendations regarding data\\nprivacy and security for IoHT implementations. We believe this research will help the\\nindustrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoT-enabled healthcare systems\\nwhile protecting the security and privacy of individuals.\\nAs future work, we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with\\nrespect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves\\nagainst pertinent risks. The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies\\nwill be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem. These risks\\ncould be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data, the ﬂow of information, and\\ncompliance with regional and global regulatory approaches.\\nAuthor Contributions: J.S. and R.A. were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea; A.K.K.\\nand T.A. helped with the methodology and deﬁning the contents of the paper; J.S., R.A., A.K.K. and\\nT.A. were involved in the writing—original draft preparation; J.S., R.A., A.K.K., T.A., S.S. and A.M.A.\\nwere involved in reviewing and editing.

scenarios like security remote monitoring electrical appliances control military\\nuse and other electronic equipment One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare\\nsector ie the Internet of

software 2\\nThe IoHT describes uniquely identiﬁable devices connected to the Internet communi\\ncating with each other used in the medical area IoHT devices help to monitor individuals’\\nmedical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service\\nwith the help of wireless network infrastructure  3 Like any other Internetbased device\\nIoHT devices have a

population Sometimes no response from the hospital\\nfor emergencies creates social issues Similarly the medical staff in rural areas do not\\nhave sufﬁcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex\\ndiseases Due to these reasons people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper\\nmedical attention increasing the load on hospitals The late detection of diseases and\\nsevere health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process Therefore\\nthere is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system\\nthat includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical\\nproblems 2021\\n21 IoHT Classiﬁcation Based on Architecture\\nIn this subsection we present a detailed

associated with\\nheterogeneity distribution and scale in IoT applications development These services are\\ncalled ‘middleware’ as they sit ‘in the middle’ in a layer above the operating system and\\nnetworking software and below domainspeciﬁc applications 6768\\n32 Possible Points for Data Leakage\\nIn the healthcare system there are two states of data from where it can be stolen\\nThese states are the persistent data ie data at rest and transient data ie in motion\\nThe overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure 5\\nThe arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines\\nrepresent persistent data The details of each state are as follows\\n321 Persistent Data\\nPersistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components\\nsuch as sensing and actuating devices etc and is prone to theft Here the features of the\\nhealthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed\\nHealthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs latest reading\\nconﬁguration change connection history etc in the memory As these devices usually\\nhave weak security conﬁgurations and store data in nonencrypted forms an attacker can\\nsteal the data by exploiting these weaknessesAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 10 of 22\\nIoHT servers are the most attractive

mostly mobile devices that physicians or\\nresponse teams use to monitor and process healthcare data These devices are susceptible\\nto memory leakage attacks Personal computers mobile phones tablets

data privacy and security in healthcare sys\\ntems it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security features These\\ndevices should meet healthcare standards and policies Data storage transmission format\\ninterchanges terminologies and presentation standards should be welldeﬁned No medi\\ncal devices either implantable or wearable are allowed to be manufactured if they do not\\nmeet data standards\\nLog Management and Compliance Every management activity performed on these\\nhealthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers For data\\nprivacy there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system The best\\npractices are gathering log ﬁles and saving them for future references as long as you need\\nthem In distributed systems these reports should be shared with other systems to prove\\ncompliance\\nUpdating Technologies Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad\\nvancement in healthcare systems and recent innovations have proven this Technologies\\nhave changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads\\nto improved care and efﬁciency The latest components are more efﬁcient and secure as\\ncompared to the previous ones Therefore the new devices with the latest technologies\\nshould be preferred over the old ones\\nPatch Management In addition to upgrading hardware updating the software of IoT\\ndevice’s ﬁrmware is also essential if it is not updated it may be vulnerable The software\\nvendors release patches from time to time to overcome the ﬂaws and loopholes Every\\ndevice which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated whether it is a personal\\ncomputer smartphone or any other device such as IoT 20\\nUser’s Proﬁling The users should be identiﬁed and authenticated the system must\\nknow what resources a user can access This process is called authorization This process\\nensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the user’s permission\\nUser proﬁling is more critical in healthcare applications Healthcare organizations must\\ncomply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and\\nauthorization The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints\\nwith professional liabilities\\nGenerate Alerts There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts\\nfor any kind of malicious event Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this\\nregard with the help of some applications Warnings should be raised for critical events and\\nemergencies These devices can analyze received data after the detection of any malicious\\nactivity alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system Availability\\nof IoHT should be the top priority if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason\\nintermediate devices communicate with them directly therefore generating alerts by these\\ndevices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly\\nFines and Penalties A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector\\nagainst attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health\\ncare information Healthcare data is conﬁdential and if an attacker tries to breach the\\nhealthcare system for the purpose of datastealing by any means they should be charged\\nwith penalties or imprisonment\\n4 Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework\\nIn developed countries there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to\\nsecurely process citizens’ personal data In this section we discuss some of them brieﬂy to\\nhighlight their aims and features These laws and legislations are compared with each other\\nto see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 12 of 22\\narchitecture Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal\\nmatters human rights and social norms Generally IoT data privacy regulations are re\\nquired to support core privacy goals like fairness purpose satisfaction proportionality and\\naccountability Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these\\ngoals American European and other leading countries’ law enforcement organizations are\\nworking to ﬁnd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also\\nmaking a more effective existing legal framework An effective legal framework should\\nensure the user’s awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their\\nservices Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more\\nadequate 669\\n41 Major Healthcare Initiative\\nA brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection for different\\nregions is given below\\n411 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA\\nHIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy\\nof healthcare data for American citizens It has separate rule sets for security and privacy\\nThe privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure\\nThe security rules provide security of the individuals’ health information by adopting\\nadvanced technologies to acquire more efﬁcient means of patient care The HIPAA security\\nand privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and nonhealthcare organizations that\\nstore transmit and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means\\nThe privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities\\n Common Identiﬁer eg name address birth date\\n Past present or future physical and mental health or condition\\n Past present or future payment provision for healthcare\\n Provision of healthcare to individuals\\nThe mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and\\npublic interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information\\nexcept for treatment purposes like payment and relevant health care operations\\nThe Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created re\\nceived transmitted and managed electronically These security rules have the following\\ncharacteristics\\n Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information\\n Detects and protects against known threats to conﬁdentiality integrity and availability\\n Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information\\nThe security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes\\npersonnel Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel\\nThis rule also includes audit control access control integrity control and transmission\\nsecurity\\n412 The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH\\nis an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in 2009\\nHowever it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry It only provides\\nlegal liability for noncompliance Besides applying the HIPAA rules it is responsible for the\\nnotiﬁcation of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data It enables individuals\\nwith a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to\\nreceive healthcare information 70Appl Sci 2022 12 1927 13 of 22\\n413 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA\\nThe federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection\\nand Electronic Document Act PIPEDA in 2001 Its main purpose is to provide individuals\\ncontrol to some extent over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza\\ntions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens These policies\\ninclude informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and\\nthis information is protected by using adequate security measures The PIPEDA applies\\nto all personal data healthcare data and other data that holds the private information of\\nindividuals If any organization collects data then it is fully accountable for the protection\\nof the collected data The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada Every province\\nhas the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA  71\\nPIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal\\ninformation for business purposes The interconnected devices should use the security\\nstandards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA\\n414 EUROHEALTH\\nIn late 1990 the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro\\ngram called EUROHEALTH It provides mediumterm needs for the Countries of Central\\nand Eastern Europe CCEE for material managerial and technical resources for longterm\\nhealth strategies The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree\\nments with CCEE fundraising and coordination with international organizations The\\nprogram’s work has generated an information ﬂow for better cooperation and coordination\\nbetween all the organizations working in the health sector This program is realistic ﬂexible\\nand accessible to the CCEE 72\\n415 General Data Protection Regulation GDPR\\nIn May 2018 a new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR replaced directive\\n9546  73 consolidating and innovating data protection rules The introduced GDPR is\\nconsiderably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance\\nmechanisms that did not exist in the legislation It applies to all sectors of the economy all\\nbroadly deﬁned personal data and every sector that controls or processes data Moreover\\nit applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data GDPR is designed to\\nenable people to better control their data Although the EU already established its data\\nprotection directive in 1995 it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of\\nthe EU To remove all the reservations the GDPR has been established and is applicable\\nthroughout the EU\\nThe liability of the GDPR’s impact is likely to be for health organizations hospitals and\\nother healthcare organizations that process healthcare data GDPR requires accountability\\nfor how healthcare data is processed Data controllers are not only responsible for the\\ncompliance but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and\\ndirection Furthermore health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in\\nproﬁling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ﬂow of\\ndata 74\\n416 The Privacy Act Australia\\nIt entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor\\nmation of Australian citizens These principles refer to the usage storage and disclosure\\nof personal information Moreover individuals have the right to the access and correc\\ntion of their personal information This law also includes data security data quality and\\ncrossborder data ﬂow policies 75\\nHealthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies\\nand protection All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information\\nother than an employee record are covered by the Privacy Act whether or not they are\\nsmall businesses In certain circumstances the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 14 of 22\\ninformation and personal information for health and medical research purposes where it\\nis impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals’ consent\\n417 Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies SHIEP\\nThe main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA\\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia health information exchange like patient care public health and\\nquality This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi\\nHealth Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers\\nbusiness associates health information services providers and subcontractors 76\\nPersonal Health Information PHI will be available for treatment healthcare op\\nerations and public health but it may be permitted for research and education This\\npolicy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal\\ninvestigation or inquiry\\nTable 4 presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ﬁve layers\\narchitecture for IoHT It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are\\nproviding security at the intermediate and feedback layer However both these layers\\nare vulnerable to data leakage threats due to

Laws\\nThere are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already\\ndiscussed legislative initiatives\\nBig Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues\\nPatient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers In America\\nmost organizations have HIPAA certiﬁcation but this does not guarantee a patient’s record\\nsafety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than\\nimplementation Moreover the transmission of large data sets from different locations\\nposes an extra burden on processing and storage Conventional security solutions are\\ninadequate for large and inherently changing data sets With the emergence of cloud\\nhealthcare solutions security demands are becoming more complex and there are no\\nspeciﬁed policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws 77\\nData Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial\\nstep in managing healthcare data It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry\\ntowards a valuebased business model It demands common data representation that\\nencircles different security standards eg ICD CPT and LOINC  78 Currently data\\ngenerated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance\\nmodel There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for\\nproper data governance\\nPrivacypreserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to\\nmonitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds Therefore it needs to process and analyze\\ndata in an adhoc decentralized manner However the execution of resourceexhausting\\noperations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge As new healthcare dataAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 15 of 22\\nanalytics are becoming popular healthcare data privacy laws need revision and new laws\\nshould be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients’ private data\\nIdentiﬁcation of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoTbased devices can be\\nviolated at many stages Firstly it is violated by collecting data by third parties Secondly\\nthe usage and distribution of private data and thirdly the data is combined with other\\ndata The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoTbased medical\\ndevices to process and generate data By combining newly generated information with\\nexisting data about a patient or health activity it raises the high commercial value for many\\ndatahungry organizations and commercial ﬁrms Most of the data is often generated by\\nautomated medical devices therefore a higher trust level should be maintained for this\\ndata than on manually entered human data This is important because medical insurance\\ncompanies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical\\ndevices to ascertain the speciﬁc risks associated with their customer’s health These devices\\nare also tracking users’ geolocations and such data must be protected through adequate\\ndevice safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage\\nData and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a\\nsigniﬁcant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT The quality of data highly\\ndepends on the environment in which it is collected The quality of context may be\\nunknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context It may also be\\nambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources\\nContext quality generates new problems of conﬁdentiality that have not been addressed by\\ncurrent research Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by\\nhardware components that likely provide the information It is better to protect context\\nquality as it is sensitive information Change in context quality is also sensitive information\\nIoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system\\nor to easily disconnect from it\\nTo enhance transparency of the healthcare systems not only healthcare data that\\nis propagated from different devices need to be controlled but also the data generated\\nautomatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed Despite this important issue\\nno law has been made in this regard There is a need to develop a combined approach with\\ntechnical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency\\nPrivacy violating interactions and presentation in IoTbased healthcare applications\\nlike heartbeat monitors geotracking devices automated insulin pumps and other health\\ncare devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient In such devices the\\ninformation will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings\\nThis information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be\\ncomes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different\\nsystems In smart cities for instance an individual could make a query for the way to a\\nspeciﬁc health clinic Such a query should not be answered for instance by showing the\\nway to a health clinic nearby visible to any passerby another example of such medical\\ndevices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server Any adversary\\nintending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose Due to\\nthe close interaction and presentation techniques the threat of privacyviolating interaction\\nand presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws\\nLife cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed\\nby IoT devices during the life cycle transition These devices hold information like vital\\nsign readings drug dosage and actuator functions Healthcare data is highly sensitive but\\nalso the collection of simple usage data eg location duration frequency could disclose a\\nlot about the life cycle of people Despite evident problems with healthcare devices the\\nlife cycle transition problem has never been addressed The life cycle of healthcare devices\\nis still modeled as buyonceownforever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total\\nmemory wipe eg before selling a wearable or physical destruction There is a need to\\nidentify the requirements for ﬂexible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle\\nmanagement mechanismsAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 16 of 22\\nLinkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin\\ning forms of revealed data sources When data is gathered from different sources with\\ndifferent permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment Threats\\nof linking different systems and data sources are not novel Online social networks and\\nintegrated thirdparty applications are facing the same problems However IoT networks\\nand services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems Managing\\nthe numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will\\nraise more challenges in linkage threats The threat of linkage will cause problems in the\\nIoT evolution process There are mainly two reasons for it First the horizontal linkage\\nof different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed\\nsystemofsystems delivering new services that no single system can provide Successful\\nlinkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties\\nHowever horizontal linkage also causes more local data ﬂows than vertical linkage that\\ncould improve privacy These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare\\nlaws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices\\n43 IoHT Governance Challenges\\nBased on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives we identiﬁed the\\nfollowing IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT\\nsystems\\n431 Conﬂicts in Laws\\nAfter the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR for the\\nenforcement of data security and privacy standards have been widened For the protection\\nof European citizens’ data outside of Europe their data is allowed to be used under strict\\nconditions If any data privacy legislation enacted by a nonEU country accepts Standard\\nContractual Clauses SCC and Binding Corporate Rules BCR These terms and conditions\\ncause challenges for developing countries because BCR’s and SCC are timeconsuming and\\ncostly 79\\nA country may or may not have a law for user data protection but the healthcare\\nsystem should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs The same thing\\napplies to the social and cultural norms which should be applied according to the laws of\\nthe state to which the user belongs In the case of data residing on cloud servers again the\\nprivacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients\\n432 Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems\\nThe above discussion leads us to ﬁnd the four major issues in protecting healthcare\\ndata from the national policy level to an organizational level These issues are i the\\nabsence of laws for healthcare data protection ii the use of nonstandard healthcare\\ndevices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility iii compliance issues to\\nimplement healthcare policies locally iv and the absence of a dedicated enforcement\\nagency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations 80\\n433 Absence of Conﬂict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection\\nAs we have discussed the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws\\nis the absence of law in many developing countries There is no law for healthcare data\\nprotection therefore patients’ data can be used by the government and private agencies\\nThey use patients’ medical records for research purposes without their consent No mon\\nitoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these\\norganizations\\n434 NonStandard Healthcare Devices and Protocols\\nThe development and production process of various smart devices over a short period\\nreduces the security considerations Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 17 of 22\\nterms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the\\nhealthcare domain Usage of nonstandard healthcare devices and protocols is the major\\nconcern of healthcare data privacy and protection which in context is the usage of locally\\nmanufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufﬁcient security features according\\nto healthcare standards Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new\\nthreats and attacks There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care\\nlaws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features\\nmust be included in them 81\\n435 Other Considerations\\nApart from the abovementioned challenges there are several local issues worth\\nconsideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives\\n Awareness There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about\\nthe importance of the security of healthcare data\\n System Management Staff Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for\\nwarded by system management staff in healthcare institutes They work on inter\\nmediate devices like data servers and gateway devices The staff is not qualiﬁed\\nenough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects They are\\nunaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network conﬁgurations\\nand the availability of data at the endpoints Mostly they do not update healthcare\\nsystems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised They have little exposure\\nto awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy\\n Doctors and Healthcare staff One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the\\nsecurity and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency\\nresponse teams in hospitals Speciﬁcally the doctor uses personal devices such as cell\\nphones or laptops to view the data therefore these personal devices also need to be\\nsecure Moreover they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data\\nleakage There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to\\nfollow rules and policies to share and process patients’ healthcare data legally and\\nsecurely\\n Patients These are the central entities in the healthcare system However they are\\nless attractive to attackers due to having less information ie about themselves only\\nThey are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their\\nhealthcare privacy However they do not have any idea about how their data is shared\\nwith other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data If\\ntheir data is shared without conferring with them it begs the question of what the\\nlegal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing\\n Enforcement Difﬁculties There is no enforcement authority or body established that\\nhelps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector All the healthcare institutes\\nshould be obliged to follow instructions by some authority The authority should\\nimplement healthcare laws\\n Low Budget In developing countries the medical budget is very limited The trend\\nof using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities Mostly there is no central system\\nor facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries A very low\\nor limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare\\nsector Therefore the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy\\npolicies if the usage of such devices is limited\\n Lack of Qualiﬁed Staff The IT staff does not conﬁgureenable security functions in\\nIoHT due to inadequate qualiﬁcations and expertise The main reason behind it is\\nthe lack of security training programs for medical staff They are only interested in\\nthe functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of nonfunctional\\nrequirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy\\n No Internal Auditing There is no IoHT audit like IT audit conducted in healthcare\\norganizations and hospitals If any organization is processing healthcare data then itAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 18 of 22\\nis unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data The internal audit ensures\\nwhat data is being processed by which organization for what purposes The auditing\\nactivities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage\\n No Special Enforcement Authority One of the difﬁculties in the enforcement of data\\nprivacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the\\nhealthcare sector Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be\\nthe primary responsibilities of the authority It can also ensure the compliance of\\nstatelevel or nationallevel policies with international policies\\n5 Recommendations\\nAfter careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues\\nfor IoHTbased systems some recommendations can assist in improving this system These\\nrecommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance\\nissues between different legal frameworks\\n Fines and Penalties IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are\\nseveral privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data Speciﬁcally\\nindividual identiﬁcation and behavior monitoring are major concerns As the usage\\nof IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector a huge amount of private data\\nis processed and stored There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards The\\nhealth information collected from devices like FitbitJawbone  82 can be used to\\ndetect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring\\n Data Anonymization IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi\\nronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing During\\nthis process several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space\\non the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet\\nProtocol IPv6 This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it\\nsince this communication avoids safety risks\\n Healthcare System Design The healthcare system should be designed in such a way\\nthat it provides the controls in a userfriendly manner An enduser must have full\\ncontrol over hisher collected data at any moment ie to whom it can be or cannot be\\nshared At any moment the user should be given the possibility to know and control\\nwho has his data what data have been collected and for what purposes they will be\\nused for the legitimate initial purpose\\n Privacy by Design Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component\\nintegrated into the whole IoHT core system The privacy safeguard framework must\\nbe implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process The health\\ncare devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces There are no privacy\\nprotection guidelines available while designing device interfaces There are several\\nvulnerabilities in webbased interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information\\nleakage attacks Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have\\ndefault passwords that are difﬁcult to enter due to their small size interfaces\\n Communication Security There are several communication protocols used in IoT\\nhealthcare devices There are no speciﬁc guidelines provided in data privacy laws\\nabout protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be\\nadopted for IoT devices which operate on low memory and computation resources\\nThese privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication\\nsecurity of these devices especially for use in hospitals\\n Dispute Resolution There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes\\nregarding data protection There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws\\nenforced regionally and internationally If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed\\nin a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced then\\nwhat are the possible legal issues that should apply to that person’s processed data\\nThese types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policiesAppl Sci 2022 12 1927 19 of 22\\n Awareness Programs Awareness programs are very signiﬁcant to highlight the im\\nportance of data privacy especially in the healthcare sector IT staff management\\nstaff and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out\\nthe practices of secure processing of healthcare data They must be aware of the\\nconsequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in\\nthe case of carelessness Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for\\nthe secure usage of their devices ie laptops and cellphones etc linked to healthcare\\nsystems and they should share their experiences and difﬁculties while using these\\ndevices securely with healthcare organizations\\n6 Conclusions\\nIn this paper we presented a detailed IoHT classiﬁcation along with the general\\narchitecture of IoHT systems The architecture aids in highlighting data security and\\nprivacy challenges Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities we\\nalso discussed the healthcare regulations and afﬁliated issues We also highlighted major\\nreasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT\\nsystems The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and\\nhighlighted their limitations Lastly we proposed some recommendations regarding data\\nprivacy and security for IoHT implementations We believe this research will help the\\nindustrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoTenabled healthcare systems\\nwhile protecting the security and privacy of individuals\\nAs future work we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with\\nrespect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves\\nagainst pertinent risks The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies\\nwill be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem These risks\\ncould be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data the ﬂow of information and\\ncompliance with regional and global regulatory approaches\\nAuthor Contributions JS and RA were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea AKK\\nand TA helped with the methodology and

Telecommunication Union\\nITU   deﬁnes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment\\nThe spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in\\ndifferent scenarios like security remote monitoring electrical appliances control military\\nuse and other electronic equipment One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare\\nsector ie the Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT designed to monitor store or transmit\\nhealthcare information In simple words IoHT is a subclass of IoT speciﬁcally dealing\\nwith healthcare that includes devices services and software \\nThe IoHT describes uniquely identiﬁable devices connected to the Internet communi\\ncating with each other used in the medical area IoHT devices help to monitor individuals’\\nmedical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service\\nwith the help of wireless network infrastructure   Like any other Internetbased device\\nIoHT devices have a unique identiﬁer such as an IP address which enables them to connect\\nwith the network and to forwardreceive data tofrom intended devices   The central\\nserver manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients’\\nAppl Sci      Sci     of \\ndiseases A highlevel general working ﬂow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre\\nsented in

problems are increasing with the growing population especially\\nwith the increasingly larger aging population Sometimes no response from the hospital\\nfor emergencies creates social issues Similarly the medical staff in rural areas do not\\nhave sufﬁcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex\\ndiseases Due to these reasons people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper\\nmedical attention increasing the load on hospitals The late detection of diseases and\\nsevere health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process Therefore\\nthere is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system\\nthat includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical\\nproblems \\n IoHT Classiﬁcation Based on Architecture\\nIn this subsection we present a detailed classiﬁcation of IoHT based on the IoHT\\narchitecture in Figure  A generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices  –\\ncommunication protocols  – and networks  – The IoHT devices are further\\nclassiﬁed as wearable devices and implant devices The data of IoHT devices are then\\ntransmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE  WBAN IEEE\\n Bluetooth IEEE  WiFi and LoRaWAN The destination of this medical data\\nis a cloud service or a remote server designed for intensive processing tasks Finally data\\ncan be transmitted to a physician or an Emergency Response Team ERT via a mobile\\ncommunication service such as G or G\\nOnce the information is

gateways that enable data ﬂow from\\nthe sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis These\\ndevices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi Bluetooth GSM etc  \\nand forward the collected data to the server Some intermediate devices can store data as\\nwell for preprocessing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or\\nnot

of protocols by IT companies having many potential security loopholes Due\\nto the diversity of IoT devices it is not easy to develop a standard security protocol for\\nheterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address\\nthe security vulnerabilities among IoT devices\\n Insecure Middleware\\nTo make IoT applications development more manageable various IoT

distribution and scale in IoT applications development These services are\\ncalled ‘middleware’ as they sit ‘in the middle’ in a layer above the operating system and\\nnetworking software and below domainspeciﬁc applications \\n Possible Points for Data Leakage\\nIn the healthcare system there are two states of data from where it can be stolen\\nThese states are the persistent data ie data at rest and transient data ie in motion\\nThe overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure \\nThe arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines\\nrepresent persistent data The details of each state are as follows\\n Persistent Data\\nPersistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components\\nsuch as sensing and actuating devices etc and is prone to theft Here the features of the\\nhealthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed\\nHealthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs latest reading\\nconﬁguration change connection history etc in the memory As these devices usually\\nhave weak security conﬁgurations and store data in nonencrypted forms an attacker can\\nsteal the data by exploiting these weaknessesAppl Sci     of \\nIoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to\\nsteal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their\\nbiodata\\nPhysiciansResponse Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or\\nresponse teams use to monitor and process healthcare data These devices are susceptible\\nto memory leakage attacks Personal computers mobile phones tablets or any speciﬁc\\ndevices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category Due to direct communication\\nwith IoHT data servers these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks\\nFigure  is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices

devices with reliable security features These\\ndevices should meet healthcare standards and policies Data storage transmission format\\ninterchanges terminologies and presentation standards should be welldeﬁned No medi\\ncal devices either implantable or wearable are allowed to be manufactured if they do not\\nmeet data standards\\nLog Management and Compliance Every management activity performed on these\\nhealthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers For data\\nprivacy there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system The best\\npractices are gathering log ﬁles and saving them for future references as long as you need\\nthem In distributed systems these reports should be shared with other systems to prove\\ncompliance\\nUpdating Technologies Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad\\nvancement in healthcare systems and recent innovations have proven this Technologies\\nhave changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads\\nto improved care and efﬁciency The latest components are more efﬁcient and secure as\\ncompared to the previous ones Therefore the new devices with the latest technologies\\nshould be preferred over the old ones\\nPatch Management In addition to upgrading hardware updating the software of IoT\\ndevice’s ﬁrmware is also essential if it is not updated it may be vulnerable The software\\nvendors release patches from time to time to overcome the ﬂaws and loopholes Every\\ndevice which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated whether it is a personal\\ncomputer smartphone or any other device such as IoT \\nUser’s Proﬁling The users should be identiﬁed and authenticated the system must\\nknow what resources a user can access This process is called authorization This process\\nensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the user’s permission\\nUser proﬁling is more critical in healthcare applications Healthcare organizations must\\ncomply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and\\nauthorization The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints\\nwith professional liabilities\\nGenerate Alerts There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts\\nfor any kind of malicious event Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this\\nregard with the help of some applications Warnings should be raised for critical events and\\nemergencies These devices can analyze received data after the detection of any malicious\\nactivity alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system Availability\\nof IoHT should be the top priority if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason\\nintermediate devices communicate with them directly therefore generating alerts by these\\ndevices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly\\nFines and Penalties A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector\\nagainst attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health\\ncare information Healthcare data is conﬁdential and if an attacker tries to breach the\\nhealthcare system for the purpose of datastealing by any means they should be charged\\nwith penalties or imprisonment\\n Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework\\nIn developed countries there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to\\nsecurely process citizens’ personal data In this section we discuss some of them brieﬂy to\\nhighlight their aims and features These laws and legislations are compared with each other\\nto see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl Sci     of \\narchitecture Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal\\nmatters human rights and social norms Generally IoT data privacy regulations are re\\nquired to support core privacy goals like fairness purpose satisfaction proportionality and\\naccountability Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these\\ngoals American European and other leading countries’ law enforcement organizations are\\nworking to ﬁnd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also\\nmaking a more effective existing legal framework An effective legal framework should\\nensure the user’s awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their\\nservices Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more\\nadequate \\n Major Healthcare Initiative\\nA brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection for different\\nregions is given below\\n Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA\\nHIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy\\nof healthcare data for American citizens It has separate rule sets for security and privacy\\nThe privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure\\nThe security rules provide security of the individuals’ health information by adopting\\nadvanced technologies to acquire more efﬁcient means of patient care The HIPAA security\\nand privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and nonhealthcare organizations that\\nstore transmit and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means\\nThe privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities\\n Common Identiﬁer eg name address birth date\\n Past present or future physical and mental health or condition\\n Past present or future payment provision for healthcare\\n Provision of healthcare to individuals\\nThe mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and\\npublic interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information\\nexcept for treatment purposes like payment and relevant health care operations\\nThe Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created re\\nceived transmitted and managed electronically These security rules have the following\\ncharacteristics\\n Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information\\n Detects and protects against known threats to conﬁdentiality integrity and availability\\n Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information\\nThe security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes\\npersonnel Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel\\nThis rule also includes audit control access control integrity control and transmission\\nsecurity\\n The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH\\nis an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in \\nHowever it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry It only provides\\nlegal liability for noncompliance Besides applying the HIPAA rules it is responsible for the\\nnotiﬁcation of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data It enables individuals\\nwith a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to\\nreceive healthcare information Appl Sci     of \\n Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA\\nThe federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection\\nand Electronic Document Act PIPEDA in  Its main purpose is to provide individuals\\ncontrol to some extent over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza\\ntions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens These policies\\ninclude informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and\\nthis information is protected by using adequate security measures The PIPEDA applies\\nto all personal data healthcare data and other data that holds the private information of\\nindividuals If any organization collects data then it is fully accountable for the protection\\nof the collected data The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada Every province\\nhas the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA  \\nPIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal\\ninformation for business purposes The interconnected devices should use the security\\nstandards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA\\n EUROHEALTH\\nIn late  the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro\\ngram called EUROHEALTH It provides mediumterm needs for the Countries of Central\\nand Eastern Europe CCEE for material managerial and technical resources for longterm\\nhealth strategies The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree\\nments with CCEE fundraising and coordination with international organizations The\\nprogram’s work has generated an information ﬂow for better cooperation and coordination\\nbetween all the organizations working in the health sector This program is realistic ﬂexible\\nand accessible to the CCEE \\n General Data Protection Regulation GDPR\\nIn May  a new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR replaced directive\\n   consolidating and innovating data protection rules The introduced GDPR is\\nconsiderably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance\\nmechanisms that did not exist in the legislation It applies to all sectors of the economy all\\nbroadly deﬁned personal data and every sector that controls or processes data Moreover\\nit applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data GDPR is designed to\\nenable people to better control their data Although the EU already established its data\\nprotection directive in  it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of\\nthe EU To remove all the reservations the GDPR has been established and is applicable\\nthroughout the EU\\nThe liability of the GDPR’s impact is likely to be for health organizations hospitals and\\nother healthcare organizations that process healthcare data GDPR requires accountability\\nfor how healthcare data is processed Data controllers are not only responsible for the\\ncompliance but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and\\ndirection Furthermore health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in\\nproﬁling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ﬂow of\\ndata \\n The Privacy Act Australia\\nIt entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor\\nmation of Australian citizens These principles refer to the usage storage and disclosure\\nof personal information Moreover individuals have the right to the access and correc\\ntion of their personal information This law also includes data security data quality and\\ncrossborder data ﬂow policies \\nHealthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies\\nand protection All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information\\nother than an employee record are covered by the Privacy Act whether or not they are\\nsmall businesses In certain circumstances the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl Sci     of \\ninformation and personal information for health and medical research purposes where it\\nis impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals’ consent\\n Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies SHIEP\\nThe main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA\\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia health information exchange like patient care public health and\\nquality This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi\\nHealth Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers\\nbusiness associates health information services providers and subcontractors \\nPersonal Health Information PHI will be available for treatment healthcare op\\nerations and public health but it may be permitted for research and education This\\npolicy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal\\ninvestigation or inquiry\\nTable  presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ﬁve layers\\narchitecture for IoHT It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are\\nproviding security at the intermediate and feedback layer However both these layers\\nare vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical\\ndevices\\nTable  Comparison of Healthcare

Laws\\nThere are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already\\ndiscussed legislative initiatives\\nBig Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues\\nPatient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers In America\\nmost organizations have HIPAA certiﬁcation but this does not guarantee a patient’s record\\nsafety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than\\nimplementation Moreover the transmission of large data sets from different locations\\nposes an extra burden on processing and storage Conventional security solutions are\\ninadequate for large and inherently changing data sets With the emergence of cloud\\nhealthcare solutions security demands are becoming more complex and there are no\\nspeciﬁed policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws \\nData Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial\\nstep in managing healthcare data It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry\\ntowards a valuebased business model It demands common data representation that\\nencircles different security standards eg ICD CPT and LOINC   Currently data\\ngenerated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance\\nmodel There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for\\nproper data governance\\nPrivacypreserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to\\nmonitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds Therefore it needs to process and analyze\\ndata in an adhoc decentralized manner However the execution of resourceexhausting\\noperations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge As new healthcare dataAppl Sci     of \\nanalytics are becoming popular healthcare data privacy laws need revision and new laws\\nshould be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients’ private data\\nIdentiﬁcation of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoTbased devices can be\\nviolated at many stages Firstly it is violated by collecting data by third parties Secondly\\nthe usage and distribution of private data and thirdly the data is combined with other\\ndata The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoTbased medical\\ndevices to process and generate data By combining newly generated information with\\nexisting data about a patient or health activity it raises the high commercial value for many\\ndatahungry organizations and commercial ﬁrms Most of the data is often generated by\\nautomated medical devices therefore a higher trust level should be maintained for this\\ndata than on manually entered human data This is important because medical insurance\\ncompanies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical\\ndevices to ascertain the speciﬁc risks associated with their customer’s health These devices\\nare also tracking users’ geolocations and such data must be protected through adequate\\ndevice safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage\\nData and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a\\nsigniﬁcant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT The quality of data highly\\ndepends on the environment in which it is collected The quality of context may be\\nunknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context It may also be\\nambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources\\nContext quality generates new problems of conﬁdentiality that have not been addressed by\\ncurrent research Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by\\nhardware components that likely provide the information It is better to protect context\\nquality as it is sensitive information Change in context quality is also sensitive information\\nIoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system\\nor to easily disconnect from it\\nTo enhance transparency of the healthcare systems not only healthcare data that\\nis propagated from different devices need to be controlled but also the data generated\\nautomatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed Despite this important issue\\nno law has been made in this regard There is a need to develop a combined approach with\\ntechnical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency\\nPrivacy violating interactions and presentation in IoTbased healthcare applications\\nlike heartbeat monitors geotracking devices automated insulin pumps and other health\\ncare devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient In such devices the\\ninformation will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings\\nThis information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be\\ncomes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different\\nsystems In smart cities for instance an individual could make a query for the way to a\\nspeciﬁc health clinic Such a query should not be answered for instance by showing the\\nway to a health clinic nearby visible to any passerby another example of such medical\\ndevices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server Any adversary\\nintending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose Due to\\nthe close interaction and presentation techniques the threat of privacyviolating interaction\\nand presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws\\nLife cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed\\nby IoT devices during the life cycle transition These devices hold information like vital\\nsign readings drug dosage and actuator functions Healthcare data is highly sensitive but\\nalso the collection of simple usage data eg location duration frequency could disclose a\\nlot about the life cycle of people Despite evident problems with healthcare devices the\\nlife cycle transition problem has never been addressed The life cycle of healthcare devices\\nis still modeled as buyonceownforever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total\\nmemory wipe eg before selling a wearable or physical destruction There is a need to\\nidentify the requirements for ﬂexible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle\\nmanagement mechanismsAppl Sci     of \\nLinkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin\\ning forms of revealed data sources When data is gathered from different sources with\\ndifferent permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment Threats\\nof linking different systems and data sources are not novel Online social networks and\\nintegrated thirdparty applications are facing the same problems However IoT networks\\nand services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems Managing\\nthe numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will\\nraise more challenges in linkage threats The threat of linkage will cause problems in the\\nIoT evolution process There are mainly two reasons for it First the horizontal linkage\\nof different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed\\nsystemofsystems delivering new services that no single system can provide Successful\\nlinkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties\\nHowever horizontal linkage also causes more local data ﬂows than vertical linkage that\\ncould improve privacy These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare\\nlaws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices\\n IoHT Governance Challenges\\nBased on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives we identiﬁed the\\nfollowing IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT\\nsystems\\n Conﬂicts in Laws\\nAfter the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR for the\\nenforcement of data security and privacy standards have been widened For the protection\\nof European citizens’ data outside of Europe their data is allowed to be used under strict\\nconditions If any data privacy legislation enacted by a nonEU country accepts Standard\\nContractual Clauses SCC and Binding Corporate Rules BCR These terms and conditions\\ncause challenges for developing countries because BCR’s and SCC are timeconsuming and\\ncostly \\nA country may or may not have a law for user data protection but the healthcare\\nsystem should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs The same thing\\napplies to the social and cultural norms which should be applied according to the laws of\\nthe state to which the user belongs In the case of data residing on cloud servers again the\\nprivacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients\\n Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems\\nThe above discussion leads us to ﬁnd the four major issues in protecting healthcare\\ndata from the national policy level to an organizational level These issues are i the\\nabsence of laws for healthcare data protection ii the use of nonstandard healthcare\\ndevices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility iii compliance issues to\\nimplement healthcare policies locally iv and the absence of a dedicated enforcement\\nagency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations \\n Absence of Conﬂict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection\\nAs we have discussed the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws\\nis the absence of law in many developing countries There is no law for healthcare data\\nprotection therefore patients’ data can be used by the government and private agencies\\nThey use patients’ medical records for research purposes without their consent No mon\\nitoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these\\norganizations\\n NonStandard Healthcare Devices and Protocols\\nThe development and production process of various smart devices over a short period\\nreduces the security considerations Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl Sci     of \\nterms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the\\nhealthcare domain Usage of nonstandard healthcare devices and protocols is the major\\nconcern of healthcare data privacy and protection which in context is the usage of locally\\nmanufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufﬁcient security features according\\nto healthcare standards Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new\\nthreats and attacks There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care\\nlaws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features\\nmust be included in them \\n Other Considerations\\nApart from the abovementioned challenges there are several local issues worth\\nconsideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives\\n Awareness There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about\\nthe importance of the security of healthcare data\\n System Management Staff Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for\\nwarded by system management staff in healthcare institutes They work on inter\\nmediate devices like data servers and gateway devices The staff is not qualiﬁed\\nenough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects They are\\nunaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network conﬁgurations\\nand the availability of data at the endpoints Mostly they do not update healthcare\\nsystems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised They have little exposure\\nto awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy\\n Doctors and Healthcare staff One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the\\nsecurity and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency\\nresponse teams in hospitals Speciﬁcally the doctor uses personal devices such as cell\\nphones or laptops to view the data therefore these personal devices also need to be\\nsecure Moreover they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data\\nleakage There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to\\nfollow rules and policies to share and process patients’ healthcare data legally and\\nsecurely\\n Patients These are the central entities in the healthcare system However they are\\nless attractive to attackers due to having less information ie about themselves only\\nThey are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their\\nhealthcare privacy However they do not have any idea about how their data is shared\\nwith other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data If\\ntheir data is shared without conferring with them it begs the question of what the\\nlegal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing\\n Enforcement Difﬁculties There is no enforcement authority or body established that\\nhelps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector All the healthcare institutes\\nshould be obliged to follow instructions by some authority The authority should\\nimplement healthcare laws\\n Low Budget In developing countries the medical budget is very limited The trend\\nof using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities Mostly there is no central system\\nor facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries A very low\\nor limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare\\nsector Therefore the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy\\npolicies if the usage of such devices is limited\\n Lack of Qualiﬁed Staff The IT staff does not conﬁgureenable security functions in\\nIoHT due to inadequate qualiﬁcations and expertise The main reason behind it is\\nthe lack of security training programs for medical staff They are only interested in\\nthe functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of nonfunctional\\nrequirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy\\n No Internal Auditing There is no IoHT audit like IT audit conducted in healthcare\\norganizations and hospitals If any organization is processing healthcare data then itAppl Sci     of \\nis unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data The internal audit ensures\\nwhat data is being processed by which organization for what purposes The auditing\\nactivities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage\\n No Special Enforcement Authority One of the difﬁculties in the enforcement of data\\nprivacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the\\nhealthcare sector Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be\\nthe primary responsibilities of the authority It can also ensure the compliance of\\nstatelevel or nationallevel policies with international policies\\n Recommendations\\nAfter careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues\\nfor IoHTbased systems some recommendations can assist in improving this system These\\nrecommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance\\nissues between different legal frameworks\\n Fines and Penalties IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are\\nseveral privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data Speciﬁcally\\nindividual identiﬁcation and behavior monitoring are major concerns As the usage\\nof IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector a huge amount of private data\\nis processed and stored There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards The\\nhealth information collected from devices like FitbitJawbone   can be used to\\ndetect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring\\n Data Anonymization IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi\\nronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing During\\nthis process several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space\\non the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet\\nProtocol IPv This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it\\nsince this communication avoids safety risks\\n Healthcare System Design The healthcare system should be designed in such a way\\nthat it provides the controls in a userfriendly manner An enduser must have full\\ncontrol over hisher collected data at any moment ie to whom it can be or cannot be\\nshared At any moment the user should be given the possibility to know and control\\nwho has his data what data have been collected and for what purposes they will be\\nused for the legitimate initial purpose\\n Privacy by Design Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component\\nintegrated into the whole IoHT core system The privacy safeguard framework must\\nbe implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process The health\\ncare devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces There are no privacy\\nprotection guidelines available while designing device interfaces There are several\\nvulnerabilities in webbased interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information\\nleakage attacks Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have\\ndefault passwords that are difﬁcult to enter due to their small size interfaces\\n Communication Security There are several communication protocols used in IoT\\nhealthcare devices There are no speciﬁc guidelines provided in data privacy laws\\nabout protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be\\nadopted for IoT devices which operate on low memory and computation resources\\nThese privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication\\nsecurity of these devices especially for use in hospitals\\n Dispute Resolution There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes\\nregarding data protection There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws\\nenforced regionally and internationally If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed\\nin a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced then\\nwhat are the possible legal issues that should apply to that person’s processed data\\nThese types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policiesAppl Sci     of \\n Awareness Programs Awareness programs are very signiﬁcant to highlight the im\\nportance of data privacy especially in the healthcare sector IT staff management\\nstaff and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out\\nthe practices of secure processing of healthcare data They must be aware of the\\nconsequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in\\nthe case of carelessness Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for\\nthe secure usage of their devices ie laptops and cellphones etc linked to healthcare\\nsystems and they should share their experiences and difﬁculties while using these\\ndevices securely with healthcare organizations\\n Conclusions\\nIn this paper we presented a detailed IoHT classiﬁcation along with the general\\narchitecture of IoHT systems The architecture aids in highlighting data security and\\nprivacy challenges Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities we\\nalso discussed the healthcare regulations and afﬁliated issues We also highlighted major\\nreasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT\\nsystems The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and\\nhighlighted their limitations Lastly we proposed some recommendations regarding data\\nprivacy and security for IoHT implementations We believe this research will help the\\nindustrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoTenabled healthcare systems\\nwhile protecting the security and privacy of individuals\\nAs future work we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with\\nrespect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves\\nagainst pertinent risks The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies\\nwill be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem These risks\\ncould be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data the ﬂow of information and\\ncompliance with regional and global regulatory approaches\\nAuthor Contributions JS and RA were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea AKK\\nand TA helped with

connected network architecture A subset of IoT is the Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT that consists of smart healthcare devices having signicant importance in monitoring processing storing and transmitting sensitive information It is experiencing novel challenges regarding data privacy protection This article discusses different components of IoHT and categorizes various healthcare devices based on their functionality and deployment This article highlights the possible points and reasons for data leakage such as conicts in laws the use of substandard devices lack of awareness and the nonavailability of dedicated local law enforcement agencies This article draws attention to the escalating demand for a suitable regulatory framework and analyzes compliance problems of IoHT devices concerning healthcare data privacy and protection regulations Furthermore the article provides some recommendations to improve the security and privacy of IoHT implementation Keywords IoHT data privacy healthcare systems security and privacy healthcare regulations Introduction The IoT is an emerging technology that facilitates consumers by exchanging informa tion with devices connected to the Internet The International Telecommunication Union ITU denes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment The spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in different scenarios like security remote monitoring electrical appliances control military use and other electronic equipment One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare sector ie the Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT designed to monitor store or transmit healthcare information In simple words IoHT is a subclass of IoT specically dealing with healthcare that includes devices services and software The IoHT describes uniquely identiable devices connected to the Internet communi cating with each other used in the medical area IoHT devices help to monitor individuals medical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to a remote server or service with the help of wireless network infrastructure Like any other Internetbased device IoHT devices have a unique identier such as an IP address which enables them to connect with the network and to forwardreceive data tofrom intended devices The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients Appl Sci Sci of diseases A highlevel general working ow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre sented in Figure The idea is to provide reliable efcient and costeffective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely monitoring their patients IoHT implementations also enable individuals to manage their health data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors Appl Sci of them to connect with the network and to forwardreceive data tofrom intended devices The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients diseases A high level general working flow diagram of an IoHT im plementation is presented in Figure The idea is to provide reliable efficient and cost effective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely mon itoring their patients IoHT implementations also enable indivi duals to manage their health data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors Figure High Level Architecture of IoHT Implementation Data privacy is considered to be a fundamental requirement for consumer ac ceptance which can be ensured through the data flow representation authentication and authorization of the performed activities such as data collection retention processing and transmission Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection usage access storage and sharing activities These activities might be the reason for personal data leakage and compromis ing the users privacy especially concerning healthcare data as it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive In this regard appropri ate protection and security measures are required Moreover accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the In ternet also cause privacy problems In June a censorious privacy violation attack w as launched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain access to hospital networks and leaked private data Despite this the privacy frame work for IoHT systems and services is expected to be transparent to patients making available updated information to ensure the protection of patients data The healthcare systems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate devices to the management layer During this process several prot ocols and encoding schemes are used to communicate data reliably It is easier to find vulnerabilities in dif ferent components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan which assist s attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devic es on the Internet Simi larly a worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be exchanged in a fraction of a second seamlessly and without leaving any consistent trace Some IoT related data privacy and protect

insufficient for the issues men tioned earlier There are also some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data privacy laws that do not provide a particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data In this paper we discuss technological legal and structural problems of IoHT sys tems with some analysis and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and pro tection framework in the developing countries The paper uses a layered architecture to highlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT It further identifies protec tion and privacy issu es at different layers from technical and legal perspectives Further more the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of se curity related to data protection discusses possible points of data leakage missing aspects of hea lthcare policies and issues in the enforcement of healthcare systems and policies Figure HighLevel Architecture of IoHT Implementation Data privacy is considered to be a fundamental requirement for consumer accep tance which can be ensured through the data ow representation authentication and authorization of the performed activities such as data collection retention processing and transmission Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection usage access storage and sharing activities These activities might be the reason for personal data leakage and compromising the users privacy especially concerning healthcare data as it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive In this regard appropriate protection and security measures are required Moreover accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the Internet also cause privacy problems In June a censorious privacy violation attack was launched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain access to hospital networks and leaked private data Despite this the privacy framework for IoHT systems and services is expected to be transparent to patients making available updated information to ensure the protection of patients data The healthcare systems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate devices to the management layer During this process several protocols and encoding schemes are used to communicate data reliably It is easier to nd vulnerabilities in different components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan which assists attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devices on the Internet Similarly a worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be exchanged in a fraction of a second seamlessly and without leaving any consistent trace Some IoTrelated data privacy and protection policies are used to protect data and users privacy However these legal frameworks have not produced the intended results and the actual level of healthcare data privacy protection is insufcient for the issues mentioned earlier There are also some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data privacy laws that do not provide a particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data In this paper we discuss technological legal and structural problems of IoHT systems with some analysis and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and protection framework in the developing countries The paper uses a layered architecture to highlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT It further identies protection and privacy issues at different layers from technical and legal perspectives Furthermore the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of security related to data protection discusses possible points of data

of IoHT Section recommends some measures for effective IoHT implementation while Section draws some conclusions Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT Health management problems are increasing with the growing population especially with the increasingly larger aging population Sometimes no response from the hospital for emergencies creates social issues Similarly the medical staff in rural areas do not have sufcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex diseases Due to these reasons people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper medical attention increasing the load on hospitals The late detection of diseases and severe health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process Therefore there is a need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system that includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical problems IoHT Classication Based on Architecture In this subsection we present a detailed classication of IoHT based on the IoHT architecture in Figure A generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices communication protocols and networks The IoHT devices are further classied as wearable devices and implant devices The data of IoHT devices are then transmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE WBAN IEEE Bluetooth IEEE WiFi and LoRaWAN The destination of this medical data is a cloud service or a remote server designed for intensive processing tasks Finally data can be transmitted to a physician or an Emergency Response Team ERT via a mobile communication service such as G or G Once the information is collected from different IoHT devices where the sensors exist it travels toward the near and far edge of the network to be stored analyzed and additionally processing Using a fog node network can give a health care system more computing power that smaller and batteryoriented IoHT devices might not be able to achieve In the IoHT architecture data operations such as classication and compression are completed on the intermediate devices or often single remote servers that allow for the fast processing of data that mobile devices cannot do In cloudbased networks the majority of the computation isAppl Sci of performed on the cloud servers because the cloud has a higher computing capacity than the fog node

will discuss each layer with its components Device Layer Actuators are devices that can perform some actions based on the data generated by sensors eg electronic motors drug pumps etc On the other hand according to their installation type these devices can be divided into three categories ie implantable wearable and fixed devices These categories are briefly discussed here Implantable Medical

physical parameters from their environment eg tem perature pressure etc ventilators and ECG machines installed in medical labs and diagnostics rooms These machines are not mobile because of their sizeable physical di mension These machines are computerized controlled and connected to the networks for remote monitoring The data sent from these devices are not secure and prone to datastealing

communication protocols and wireless standards used to enable communication for wireless devices The rst dedicated standard for Wireless Body Area Networks WBANs is the IEEE released in IEEE is de signed to support both medical and nonmedical applications and can be easily congured based on application requirements It ensures communication inside and around the human body and is specically

potent computing resources like cloud servers These devices act like gateways that enable data ow from the sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis These devices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi Bluetooth GSM etc and forward the collected data to the server Some intermediate devices can store data as well for preprocessing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or not Some of the intermediate devices are discussed here briey Smart Hub is used to make communication easy with smart IoT devices but has many vulnerabilities that draw the attention of attackers into snifng the trafc of the smart hub If they can access networks they will be able to spot IoT healthcare devices in the network Access Points facilitate a wireless connection between different healthcare devices and connect them with remote servers IoT Gateways primarily act as the bridge to connect sensor networks with conventional communication networks enabling protocol conversion and device management The System on Chip SoC is a device that integrates all components of a computer system helps to normalize data collected from different sensors and controls actuators based on applications In this way it reduces the load on a central server and minimizes the communication Personal Digital Assistants PDAs are extensively used in the healthcare domain to support healthcare providers Such systems receive data from different wearable and implanted devices and process them through a variety of software applications Management and Data Link Layer Management and database servers are the centralized part of the healthcare system that receives and updates the patients data collected by the sensors and can also help the physicians manage the quantity of medicine or prescribe a new one for the patient In emergencies the servers send alerts to physicians and the emergency response teams for appropriate actionsAppl Sci of Feedback Layer The physicians and the emergency response teams ERT provide feedback in any emergency and play a signicant role in the healthcare system At this layer doctors and ERT respond to the system when they receive an alert from it Physicians are an integral part of the healthcare system and can observe their patients anytime anywhere and change treatment when required An IoT device for a physician gives realtime information about the patient under observation The IoT gateway device gathers information from different healthcare devices and forwards it to PDA devices held by physicians Emergency Response Team ERT In case of any medical emergency the responsibility of the ERT is to provide medical attention to patients onpremises or remotely In the context of IoHT medical devices monitor patients conditions and generate alerts in case of a medical emergency Emergency care is a critical part of medical services and is inuenced by the contextual informations time

IoHT devices come with fewer safety checks and it is the rmware of these devices that have security vulnerabilities like hardcoded keys The urgency to roll out IoHT cloud platforms and the limited user experience of new IoT applications may result in the development of protocols by IT companies having many potential security loopholes Due to the diversity of IoT devices it is not easy to develop a standard security protocol for heterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address the security vulnerabilities among IoT devices Insecure Middleware To make IoT applications development more manageable various IoT middleware platforms have been developed These platforms offer distributed system services with standard programming interfaces and protocols and minimize problems associated with heterogeneity distribution and scale in IoT applications development These services are called middleware as they sit in the middle in a layer above the operating system and networking software and below domainspecic applications Possible Points for Data Leakage In the healthcare system there are two states of data from where it can be stolen These states are the persistent data ie data at rest and transient data ie in motion The overall description of data leakage points in a healthcare system is given in Figure The arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines represent persistent data The details of each state are as follows Persistent Data Persistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components such as sensing and actuating devices etc and is prone to theft Here the features of the healthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed Healthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs latest reading conguration change connection history etc in the memory As these devices usually have weak security congurations and store data in nonencrypted forms an attacker can steal the data by exploiting these weaknessesAppl Sci of IoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to steal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their biodata PhysiciansResponse Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or response teams use to monitor and process healthcare data These devices are susceptible to memory leakage attacks Personal computers mobile phones tablets or any specic devices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category Due to direct communication with IoHT data servers these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks Figure is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices operating at different layers Effect of one compromised device can propagate at different layers because these devices are communicating with each other Appl Sci of Figure Possible Sites for Data Leakage in an IoHT implementation Transient Data Transient data refers to the data on the move as in the IoHT implementations the information is tran sferred from devices to servers using different protocols and network ing devices Here we discuss such devices and protocols from where the data can be sto len during transmission Communication protocols are used to transmit data from an IoT device to a d evice IoT

IoT gate ways smart hubs mobile phones and WiFi dev ices enable IoT devices to connect with the Internet These devices are limited in storage and are not used to store data therefore they forward it as it is received by changing its format These devices communicate with IoT devices with different design s like LoRaWAN ZigBee Bluetooth etc but forward this collected data by using TCPIP or UDP to the Internet Access PointsSmart HubsIoT Gateways enable communication between IoT and data servers They are not storage devices however they forward re ceived data to the intended destination Due to

the essential security features of IoHT Use of Standa rdized Devices To ensure data privacy and security in healthcare sys tems it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security

manufactured if they do not meet data standards Log Management and Compliance Every management activity performed on these healthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers For data privacy there is a need to know who is accessing what data from which system The best practices are gathering log les and saving them for future references as long as you need them In distributed systems these reports should be shared with other systems to prove compliance Updating Technologies Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad vancement in healthcare systems and recent innovations have proven this Technologies have changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads to improved care and efciency The latest components are more efcient and secure as compared to the previous ones Therefore the new devices with the latest technologies should be preferred over the old ones Patch Management In addition to upgrading hardware updating the software of IoT devices rmware is also essential if it is not updated it may be vulnerable The software vendors release patches from time to time to overcome the aws and loopholes Every device which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated whether it is a personal computer smartphone or any other device such as IoT Users Proling The users should be identied and authenticated the system must know what resources a user can access This process is called authorization This process ensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the users permission User proling is more critical in healthcare applications Healthcare organizations must comply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and authorization The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints with professional liabilities Generate Alerts There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts for any kind of malicious event Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this regard with the help of some applications Warnings should be raised for critical events and emergencies These devices can analyze received data after the detection of any malicious activity alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system Availability of IoHT should be the top priority if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason intermediate devices communicate with them directly therefore generating alerts by these devices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly Fines and Penalties A mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector against attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health care information Healthcare data is condential and if an attacker tries to breach the healthcare system for the purpose of datastealing by any means they should be charged with penalties or imprisonment Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework In developed countries there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to securely process citizens personal data In this section we discuss some of them briey to highlight their aims and features These laws and legislations are compared with each other to see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl Sci of architecture Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal matters human rights and social norms Generally IoT data privacy regulations are re quired to support core privacy goals like fairness purpose satisfaction proportionality and accountability Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these goals American European and other leading countries law enforcement organizations are working to nd a common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also making a more effective existing legal framework An effective legal framework should ensure the users awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their services Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more adequate Major Healthcare Initiative A brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection for different regions is given below Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA HIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy of healthcare data for American citizens It has separate rule sets for security and privacy The privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure The security rules provide security of the individuals health information by adopting advanced technologies to acquire more efcient means of patient care The HIPAA security and privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and nonhealthcare organizations that store transmit and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means The privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities Common Identier eg name address birth date Past present or future physical and mental health or condition Past present or future payment provision for healthcare Provision of healthcare to individuals The mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and public interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information except for treatment purposes like payment and relevant health care operations The Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created re ceived transmitted and managed electronically These security rules have the following characteristics Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information Detects and protects against known threats to condentiality integrity and availability Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information The security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes personnel Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel This rule also includes audit control access control integrity control and transmission security The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH is an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in However it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry It only provides legal liability for noncompliance Besides applying the HIPAA rules it is responsible for the notication of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data It enables individuals with a right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to receive healthcare information Appl Sci of Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA The federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA in Its main purpose is to provide individuals control to some extent over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza tions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens These policies include informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and this information is protected by using adequate security measures The PIPEDA applies to all personal data healthcare data and other data that holds the private information of individuals If any organization collects data then it is fully accountable for the protection of the collected data The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada Every province has the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA PIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal information for business purposes The interconnected devices should use the security standards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA EUROHEALTH In late the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established a healthcare pro gram called EUROHEALTH It provides mediumterm needs for the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe CCEE for material managerial and technical resources for longterm health strategies The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree ments with CCEE fundraising and coordination with international organizations The programs work has generated an information ow for better cooperation and coordination between all the organizations working in the health sector This program is realistic exible and accessible to the CCEE General Data Protection Regulation GDPR In May a new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR replaced directive consolidating and innovating data protection rules The introduced GDPR is considerably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance mechanisms that did not exist in the legislation It applies to all sectors of the economy all broadly dened personal data and every sector that controls or processes data Moreover it applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data GDPR is designed to enable people to better control their data Although the EU already established its data protection directive in it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of the EU To remove all the reservations the GDPR has been established and is applicable throughout the EU The liability of the GDPRs impact is likely to be for health organizations hospitals and other healthcare organizations that process healthcare data GDPR requires accountability for how healthcare data is processed Data controllers are not only responsible for the compliance but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and direction Furthermore health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in proling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure a secure ow of data The Privacy Act Australia It entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor mation of Australian citizens These principles refer to the usage storage and disclosure of personal information Moreover individuals have the right to the access and correc tion of their personal information This law also includes data security data quality and crossborder data ow policies Healthcare data is a subset of personal information and needs extra security policies and protection All organizations that provide a health service and hold health information other than an employee record are covered by the Privacy Act whether or not they are small businesses In certain circumstances the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl Sci of information and personal information for health and medical research purposes where it is impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals consent Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies SHIEP The main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA Kingdom of Saudi Arabia health information exchange like patient care public health and quality This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi Health Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers business associates health information services providers and subcontractors Personal Health Information PHI will be available for treatment healthcare op erations and public health but it may be permitted for research and education This policy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal investigation or inquiry Table presents a comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ve layers architecture for IoHT It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are providing security at the intermediate and feedback layer However both these layers are vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical devices Table Comparison of Healthcare Regulations RegulationCountry

The Privacy Act Australia Yes Yes No No No SHIEP KSA Yes Yes No Yes No Data Protection IssuesAspects Not Covered in Healthcare Laws There are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already discussed legislative initiatives Big Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues Patient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers In America most organizations have HIPAA certication but this does not guarantee a patients record safety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than implementation Moreover the transmission of large data sets from different locations poses an extra burden on processing and storage Conventional security solutions are inadequate for large and inherently changing data sets With the emergence of cloud healthcare solutions security demands are becoming more complex and there are no specied policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws Data Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial step in managing healthcare data It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry towards a valuebased business model It demands common data representation that encircles different security standards eg ICD CPT and LOINC Currently data generated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand a proper governance model There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for proper data governance Privacypreserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to monitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds Therefore it needs to process and analyze data in an adhoc decentralized manner However the execution of resourceexhausting operations with privacy preservation is becoming a challenge As new healthcare dataAppl Sci of analytics are becoming popular healthcare data privacy laws need revision and new laws should be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients private data Identication of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoTbased devices can be violated at many stages Firstly it is violated by collecting data by third parties Secondly the usage and distribution of private data and thirdly the data is combined with other data The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoTbased medical devices to process and generate data By combining newly generated information with existing data about a patient or health activity it raises the high commercial value for many datahungry organizations and commercial rms Most of the data is often generated by automated medical devices therefore a higher trust level should be maintained for this data than on manually entered human data This is important because medical insurance companies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical devices to ascertain the specic risks associated with their customers health These devices are also tracking users geolocations and such data must be protected through adequate device safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage Data and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play a signicant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT The quality of data highly depends on the environment in which it is collected The quality of context may be unknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context It may also be ambivalent as there is a chance of contradictory information from different context sources Context quality generates new problems of condentiality that have not been addressed by current research Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by hardware components that likely provide the information It is better to protect context quality as it is sensitive information Change in context quality is also sensitive information IoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system or to easily disconnect from it To enhance transparency of the healthcare systems not only healthcare data that is propagated from different devices need to be controlled but also the data generated automatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed Despite this important issue no law has been made in this regard There is a need to develop a combined approach with technical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency Privacy violating interactions and presentation in IoTbased healthcare applications like heartbeat monitors geotracking devices automated insulin pumps and other health care devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient In such devices the information will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings This information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be comes a threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different systems In smart cities for instance an individual could make a query for the way to a specic health clinic Such a query should not be answered for instance by showing the way to a health clinic nearby visible to any passerby another example of such medical devices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server Any adversary intending to sniff that data could easily use this information for a malicious purpose Due to the close interaction and presentation techniques the threat of privacyviolating interaction and presentation is a major challenge in healthcare laws Life cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed by IoT devices during the life cycle transition These devices hold information like vital sign readings drug dosage and actuator functions Healthcare data is highly sensitive but also the collection of simple usage data eg location duration frequency could disclose a lot about the life cycle of people Despite evident problems with healthcare devices the life cycle transition problem has never been addressed The life cycle of healthcare devices is still modeled as buyonceownforever and solutions have not evolved beyond a total memory wipe eg before selling a wearable or physical destruction There is a need to identify the requirements for exible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle management mechanismsAppl Sci of Linkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin ing forms of revealed data sources When data is gathered from different sources with different permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment Threats of linking different systems and data sources are not novel Online social networks and integrated thirdparty applications are facing the same problems However IoT networks and services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems Managing the numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will raise more challenges in linkage threats The threat of linkage will cause problems in the IoT evolution process There are mainly two reasons for it First the horizontal linkage of different companies and manufacturers systems to create a heterogeneous distributed systemofsystems delivering new services that no single system can provide Successful linkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties However horizontal linkage also causes more local data ows than vertical linkage that could improve privacy These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare laws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices IoHT Governance Challenges Based on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives we identied the following IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT systems Conicts in Laws After the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR for the enforcement of data security and privacy standards have been widened For the protection of European citizens data outside of Europe their data is allowed to be used under strict conditions If any data privacy legislation enacted by a nonEU country accepts Standard Contractual Clauses SCC and Binding Corporate Rules BCR These terms and conditions cause challenges for developing countries because BCRs and SCC are timeconsuming and costly A country may or may not have a law for user data protection but the healthcare system should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs The same thing applies to the social and cultural norms which should be applied according to the laws of the state to which the user belongs In the case of data residing on cloud servers again the privacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems The above discussion leads us to nd the four major issues in protecting healthcare data from the national policy level to an organizational level These issues are i the absence of laws for healthcare data protection ii the use of nonstandard healthcare devices and communication protocols by a healthcare facility iii compliance issues to implement healthcare policies locally iv and the absence of a dedicated enforcement agency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations Absence of Conict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection As we have discussed the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws is the absence of law in many developing countries There is no law for healthcare data protection therefore patients data can be used by the government and private agencies They use patients medical records for research purposes without their consent No mon itoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these organizations NonStandard Healthcare Devices and Protocols The development and production process of various smart devices over a short period reduces the security considerations Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl Sci of terms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the healthcare domain Usage of nonstandard healthcare devices and protocols is the major concern of healthcare data privacy and protection which in context is the usage of locally manufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufcient security features according to healthcare standards Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new threats and attacks There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care laws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features must be included in them Other Considerations Apart from the abovementioned challenges there are several local issues worth consideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives Awareness There is a lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about the importance of the security of healthcare data System Management Staff Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for warded by system management staff in healthcare institutes They work on inter mediate devices like data servers and gateway devices The staff is not qualied enough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects They are unaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network congurations and the availability of data at the endpoints Mostly they do not update healthcare systems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised They have little exposure to awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy Doctors and Healthcare staff One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the security and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency response teams in hospitals Specically the doctor uses personal devices such as cell phones or laptops to view the data therefore these personal devices also need to be secure Moreover they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data leakage There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to follow rules and policies to share and process patients healthcare data legally and securely Patients These are the central entities in the healthcare system However they are less attractive to attackers due to having less information ie about themselves only They are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their healthcare privacy However they do not have any idea about how their data is shared with other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data If their data is shared without conferring with them it begs the question of what the legal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing Enforcement Difculties There is no enforcement authority or body established that helps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector All the healthcare institutes should be obliged to follow instructions by some authority The authority should implement healthcare laws Low Budget In developing countries the medical budget is very limited The trend of using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities Mostly there is no central system or facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries A very low or limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare sector Therefore the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy policies if the usage of such devices is limited Lack of Qualied Staff The IT staff does not congureenable security functions in IoHT due to inadequate qualications and expertise The main reason behind it is the lack of security training programs for medical staff They are only interested in the functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of nonfunctional requirements of a medical device like communication security and data privacy No Internal Auditing There is no IoHT audit like IT audit conducted in healthcare organizations and hospitals If any organization is processing healthcare data then itAppl Sci of is unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data The internal audit ensures what data is being processed by which organization for what purposes The auditing activities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage No Special Enforcement Authority One of the difculties in the enforcement of data privacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the healthcare sector Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be the primary responsibilities of the authority It can also ensure the compliance of statelevel or nationallevel policies with international policies Recommendations After careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues for IoHTbased systems some recommendations can assist in improving this system These recommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance issues between different legal frameworks Fines and Penalties IoT devices gather a huge amount of information and there are several privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data Specically individual identication and behavior monitoring are major concerns As the usage of IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector a huge amount of private data is processed and stored There is a need to introduce new privacy safeguards The health information collected from devices like FitbitJawbone can be used to detect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring Data Anonymization IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi ronment and forward it via a router or intermediate device for processing During this process several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space on the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet Protocol IPv This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it since this communication avoids safety risks Healthcare System Design The healthcare system should be designed in such a way that it provides the controls in a userfriendly manner An enduser must have full control over hisher collected data at any moment ie to whom it can be or cannot be shared At any moment the user should be given the possibility to know and control who has his data what data have been collected and for what purposes they will be used for the legitimate initial purpose Privacy by Design Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component integrated into the whole IoHT core system The privacy safeguard framework must be implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process The health care devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces There are no privacy protection guidelines available while designing device interfaces There are several vulnerabilities in webbased interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information leakage attacks Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have default passwords that are difcult to enter due to their small size interfaces Communication Security There are several communication protocols used in IoT healthcare devices There are no specic guidelines provided in data privacy laws about protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be adopted for IoT devices which operate on low memory and computation resources These privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication security of these devices especially for use in hospitals Dispute Resolution There is a need to resolve regional and international disputes regarding data protection There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws enforced regionally and internationally If the healthcare data of a citizen is processed in a different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced then what are the possible legal issues that should apply to that persons processed data These types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policiesAppl Sci of Awareness Programs Awareness programs are very signicant to highlight the im portance of data privacy especially in the healthcare sector IT staff management staff and other related staff of a healthcare facility should be aware and carry out the practices of secure processing of healthcare data They must be aware of the consequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in the case of carelessness Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for the secure usage of their devices ie laptops and cellphones etc linked to healthcare systems and they should share their experiences and difculties while using these devices securely with healthcare organizations Conclusions In this paper we presented a detailed IoHT classication along with the general architecture of IoHT systems The architecture aids in highlighting data security and privacy challenges Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities we also discussed the healthcare regulations and afliated issues We also highlighted major reasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT systems The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and highlighted their limitations Lastly we proposed some recommendations regarding data privacy and security for IoHT implementations We believe this research will help the industrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoTenabled healthcare systems while protecting the security and privacy of individuals As future work we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with respect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves against pertinent risks The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies will be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem These risks could be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data the ow of information and compliance with regional and global regulatory approaches Author Contributions JS and RA were involved in the

privacy healthcare systems security and privacy healthcare regulations Introduction The IoT is an emerging technology that facilitates consumers by exchanging informa tion with devices connected to the Internet The International Telecommunication Union ITU denes IoT as the network of sensor devices interacting with the environment The spectrum of IoT has been broadened and encloses many applications that are used in different scenarios like security remote monitoring electrical appliances control military use and other electronic equipment One primary use case of IoT is in the healthcare sector ie the Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT designed to monitor store or transmit healthcare information In simple words IoHT is subclass of IoT specically dealing with healthcare that includes devices services and software The IoHT describes uniquely identiable devices connected to the Internet communi cating with each other used in the medical area IoHT devices help to monitor individuals medical conditions by generating clinical data by forwarding it to remote server or service with the help of wireless network infrastructure Like any other Internetbased device IoHT devices have unique identier such as an IP address which enables them to connect with the network and to forwardreceive data tofrom intended devices The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients Appl Sci Sci of diseases highlevel general working ow diagram of an IoHT implementation is pre sented in Figure The idea is to provide reliable efcient and costeffective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely monitoring their patients IoHT implementations also enable individuals to manage their health data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors Appl Sci of them to connect with the network and to forwardreceive data tofrom intended devices The central server manages this collected information and responds accordingly to diagnose patients diseases high level general working flow diagram of an IoHT im plementation is presented in Figure The idea is to provide reliable efficient and cost effective healthcare services by facilitating physicians and medical staff by remotely mon itoring their patients IoHT implementations also enable indivi duals to manage their health data easily and assist them in how to use wearable health monitors Figure High Level Architecture of IoHT Implementation Data privacy is considered to be fundamental requirement for consumer ac ceptance which can be ensured through the data flow representation authentication and authorization of the performed activities such as data collection retention processing and transmission Data privacy risks are directly related to unauthorized collection usage access storage and sharing activities These activities might be the reason for personal data leakage and compromis ing the users privacy especially concerning healthcare data as it has different priorities and is highly valuable and sensitive In this regard appropri ate protection and security measures are required Moreover accessibility and availability of personal healthcare information on the In ternet also cause privacy problems In June censorious privacy violation attack as launched when malware exploited vulnerabilities in blood gas analyzer devices to gain access to hospital networks and leaked private data Despite this the privacy frame work for IoHT systems and services is expected to be transparent to patients making available updated information to ensure the protection of patients data The healthcare systems collect most of the data from the sensing devices and forward it via intermediate devices to the management layer During this process several prot ocols and encoding schemes are used to communicate data reliably It is easier to find vulnerabilities in dif ferent components of the healthcare system by using search engines like Shodan which assist attackers in searching the connected vulnerable devic es on the Internet Simi larly worksheet containing millions of records with user healthcare information can be exchanged in fraction of second seamlessly and without leaving any consistent trace Some IoT related data privacy and protect ion policies are used to protect data and user privacy However these legal frameworks have not produced the intended results and the actual level of healthcare data privacy protection is insufficient for the issues men tioned earlier There are also some limitations and missing aspects of healthcare data privacy laws that do not provide particular set of instructions to protect IoHT data In this paper we discuss technological legal and structural problems of IoHT sys tems with some analysis and compliance issues of the healthcare data privacy and pro tection framework in the developing countries The paper uses layered architecture to highlight the data protection and privacy issues in the IoHT It further identifies protec tion and privacy issu es at different layers from technical and legal perspectives Further more the study of different components of the existing healthcare system in terms of se curity related to data protection discusses possible points of data leakage missing aspects of hea lthcare policies and issues in the enforcement of healthcare systems and policies Figure HighLevel Architecture of IoHT Implementation Data privacy is considered to be fundamental requirement

while Section draws some conclusions Internet of Healthcare Things IoHT Health management problems are increasing with the growing population especially with the increasingly larger aging population Sometimes no response from the hospital for emergencies creates social issues Similarly the medical staff in rural areas do not have sufcient resources for treatment and do not have the expertise to diagnose complex diseases Due to these reasons people in rural areas focus on big hospitals for proper medical attention increasing the load on hospitals The late detection of diseases and severe health problems of older people also complicate the diagnosis process Therefore there is need to provide better medical facilities using an optimized healthcare system that includes body sensors and medical devices to remotely monitor and diagnose medical problems IoHT Classication Based on Architecture In this subsection we present detailed classication of IoHT based on the IoHT architecture in Figure generic IoHT architecture consists of IoHT devices communication protocols and networks The IoHT devices are further classied as wearable devices and implant devices The data of IoHT devices are then transmitted by using different communication protocols like IEEE WBAN IEEE Bluetooth IEEE WiFi and LoRaWAN The destination of this medical data is cloud service or remote server designed for intensive processing tasks Finally data can be transmitted to physician or an Emergency Response Team ERT via mobile communication service such as or Once the information is collected from different IoHT devices where the sensors exist it travels toward the near and far edge of the network to be stored analyzed and additionally processing Using fog node network can give health care system more computing power that smaller and batteryoriented IoHT devices might not be able to achieve In the IoHT architecture data operations such as classication and compression are completed on the intermediate devices or often single remote servers that allow for the fast processing of data that mobile devices cannot do In cloudbased networks the majority of the computation isAppl Sci of

electronic motors drug pumps etc On the other hand according to their installation type these devices can be divided into three categories ie implantable wearable and fixed devices These categories are briefly discussed here Implantable Medical Devices are implanted into the human body as shown in Figure The most common devices belonging to th is category are the Pacemaker Neuro stimulators

layer can be classied according to their functionalities or installation type According to their functionalities these devices can be divided into two types ie sensors and actuators briey discussed here Sensors generate data by sensing physical parameters from their environment eg tem perature pressure etc ventilators and ECG machines installed in medical labs and diagnostics rooms These machines are not mobile because of their sizeable physical di mension These machines are computerized controlled and connected to the networks for remote monitoring The data sent from these devices

communication protocols and wireless standards used to enable communication for wireless devices The rst dedicated standard for Wireless Body Area Networks WBANs is the IEEE released in IEEE is de signed to support both medical and nonmedical applications and can be easily congured based on application requirements It ensures communication inside and around the human body and is specically designed keeping in mind sensor devices that consume less energy and have low transmission range Another upcoming standard in this context is the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI

resources like cloud servers These devices act like gateways that enable data ow from the sensor devices to the cloud or central servers for storage and further analysis These devices can run multiple communication protocols such as WiFi Bluetooth GSM etc and forward the collected data to the server Some intermediate devices can store data as well for preprocessing algorithms to evaluate whether the data is clinically relevant or not Some of the intermediate devices are discussed here briey Smart Hub is used to make communication easy with smart IoT devices but has many vulnerabilities that draw the attention of attackers into snifng the trafc of the smart hub If they can access networks they will be able to spot IoT healthcare devices in the network Access Points facilitate wireless connection between different healthcare devices and connect them with remote servers IoT Gateways primarily act as the bridge to connect sensor networks with conventional communication networks enabling protocol conversion and device management The System on Chip SoC is device that integrates all components of computer system helps to normalize data collected from different sensors and controls actuators based on applications In this way it reduces the load on central server and minimizes the communication Personal Digital Assistants PDAs are extensively used in the healthcare domain to support healthcare providers Such systems receive data from different wearable and implanted devices and process them through variety of software applications Management and Data Link Layer Management and database servers are the centralized part of the healthcare system that receives and updates the patients data collected by the sensors and can also help the physicians manage the quantity of medicine or prescribe new one for the patient In emergencies the servers send alerts to physicians and the emergency response teams for appropriate actionsAppl Sci of Feedback Layer The physicians and the emergency response teams ERT provide feedback in any emergency and play signicant role in the healthcare system At this layer doctors and ERT respond to the system when they receive an alert from it Physicians are an integral part of the healthcare system and can observe their patients anytime anywhere and change treatment when required An IoT device for physician gives realtime information about the patient under observation The IoT gateway device gathers information from different healthcare devices and forwards it to PDA devices held by physicians Emergency Response Team ERT In case of any medical emergency the responsibility of the ERT is to provide medical attention to patients onpremises or remotely In the context of IoHT medical devices monitor patients conditions and generate alerts in case of medical emergency Emergency care is critical part of medical services and is inuenced by the contextual informations time availability and accuracy IoHT Working Figure

of protocols by IT companies having many potential security loopholes Due to the diversity of IoT devices it is not easy to develop standard security protocol for heterogeneous devices and it leads to problems of how to discover and urgently address the security vulnerabilities among IoT devices Insecure Middleware To make IoT applications development more manageable various IoT middleware platforms have been developed These platforms offer distributed system services with standard programming interfaces and protocols and minimize problems associated with heterogeneity distribution and scale in IoT applications development These services are called middleware as they sit in the middle in layer above the operating system and networking software and below domainspecic applications Possible Points for Data Leakage In the healthcare system there are two states of data from where it can be stolen These states are the persistent data ie data at rest and transient data ie in motion The overall description of data leakage points in healthcare system is given in Figure The arrows with dotted lines represent transient data whereas the arrows with solid lines represent persistent data The details of each state are as follows Persistent Data Persistent data refers to the data stored on different healthcare system components such as sensing and actuating devices etc and is prone to theft Here the features of the healthcare system where the data can be stolen are discussed Healthcare devices such as sensors and actuators store the events logs latest reading conguration change connection history etc in the memory As these devices usually have weak security congurations and store data in nonencrypted forms an attacker can steal the data by exploiting these weaknessesAppl Sci of IoHT servers are the most attractive components of healthcare systems for attackers to steal health care data from as they contain the complete history of all the patients with their biodata PhysiciansResponse Team devices are mostly mobile devices that physicians or response teams use to monitor and process healthcare data These devices are susceptible to memory leakage attacks Personal computers mobile phones tablets or any specic devices to monitor healthcare data fall into this category Due to direct communication with IoHT data servers these devices are highly vulnerable to different security attacks Figure is presenting attacks an attacker can execute on devices operating at different layers Effect of one compromised device can propagate at different layers because these devices are communicating with each other Appl Sci of Figure Possible Sites for Data Leakage in an IoHT implementation Transient Data Transient data refers to the data on the move as in the IoHT implementations the information is tran sferred from devices to servers using different protocols and network ing devices Here we discuss such devices and protocols from where the data can be sto len during transmission Communication protocols are used to transmit data from an IoT device to evice IoT devices are primarily lightweight low computational and battery oriented Low range protocols with

IoT endpoint de vices data servers and monitoring devices These protocols have security issues IoT gate ways smart hubs mobile phones and WiFi dev ices enable IoT devices to connect with the Internet

healthcare sys tems it is essential to use standardized devices with reliable security features These de vices should meet healthcare standards and policies Data storage transmission format intercha

should be welldened No medi cal devices either implantable or wearable are allowed to be manufactured if they do not meet data standards Log Management and Compliance Every management activity performed on these healthcare devices should be appropriately logged on the healthcare servers For data privacy there is need to know who is accessing what data from which system The best practices are gathering log les and saving them for future references as long as you need them In distributed systems these reports should be shared with other systems to prove compliance Updating Technologies Technologies are considered the workforce behind the ad vancement in healthcare systems and recent innovations have proven this Technologies have changed the healthcare system to increase the accessibility of treatment that leads to improved care and efciency The latest components are more efcient and secure as compared to the previous ones Therefore the new devices with the latest technologies should be preferred over the old ones Patch Management In addition to upgrading hardware updating the software of IoT devices rmware is also essential if it is not updated it may be vulnerable The software vendors release patches from time to time to overcome the aws and loopholes Every device which is connected to the Internet needs to be updated whether it is personal computer smartphone or any other device such as IoT Users Proling The users should be identied and authenticated the system must know what resources user can access This process is called authorization This process ensures that the behavior of the users is constrained according to the users permission User proling is more critical in healthcare applications Healthcare organizations must comply with international standards and procedures regarding user authentication and authorization The exchange of patient data must permanently preserve privacy constraints with professional liabilities Generate Alerts There should be some proper mechanism for IoHT to generate alerts for any kind of malicious event Intermediate devices can play an essential role in this regard with the help of some applications Warnings should be raised for critical events and emergencies These devices can analyze received data after the detection of any malicious activity alerts can be directly transmitted to the monitoring server or system Availability of IoHT should be the top priority if any critical IoHT device goes off for any reason intermediate devices communicate with them directly therefore generating alerts by these devices could help the emergency response team to respond more quickly Fines and Penalties mechanism should be implemented in the healthcare sector against attackers that attack healthcare systems and devices and try to leak or steal health care information Healthcare data is condential and if an attacker tries to breach the healthcare system for the purpose of datastealing by any means they should be charged with penalties or imprisonment Healthcare Data Protection Legislation and Framework In developed countries there are data privacy and protection laws implemented to securely process citizens personal data In this section we discuss some of them briey to highlight their aims and features These laws and legislations are compared with each other to see how they provide security features at different layers of the proposed healthcareAppl Sci of architecture Implementation of IoT data privacy regulations is very important for legal matters human rights and social norms Generally IoT data privacy regulations are re quired to support core privacy goals like fairness purpose satisfaction proportionality and accountability Government and private organizations can work together to achieve these goals American European and other leading countries law enforcement organizations are working to nd common ground for solving healthcare data privacy problems while also making more effective existing legal framework An effective legal framework should ensure the users awareness and their control over the IoT healthcare products with their services Compliance with other international data privacy frameworks makes it more adequate Major Healthcare Initiative brief overview of healthcare initiatives related to data protection for different regions is given below Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA HIPAA was enacted by the US government to implement the security and privacy of healthcare data for American citizens It has separate rule sets for security and privacy The privacy rules enable the privacy of the health data to protect the data from disclosure The security rules provide security of the individuals health information by adopting advanced technologies to acquire more efcient means of patient care The HIPAA security and privacy rules are implemented to healthcare and nonhealthcare organizations that store transmit and process healthcare data of US citizens by any means The privacy rule protects the following health information processed by concerned entities Common Identier eg name address birth date Past present or future physical and mental health or condition Past present or future payment provision for healthcare Provision of healthcare to individuals The mentioned entities are allowed to be processed or disclosed for research and public interest and should have the authorization to process or disclose health information except for treatment purposes like payment and relevant health care operations The Security Rule protects personal health information that has been created re ceived transmitted and managed electronically These security rules have the following characteristics Making sure of the integrity and availability of personal healthcare information Detects and protects against known threats to condentiality integrity and availability Protect against processes not permitted and the disclosure of information The security rule requires the administrative protection of management processes personnel Proper administrative controls should be maintained for devices and personnel This rule also includes audit control access control integrity control and transmission security The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH is an extension of security and privacy guidelines described in HIPAA signed in However it has not been completely enforced in the healthcare industry It only provides legal liability for noncompliance Besides applying the HIPAA rules it is responsible for the notication of breaches and unauthorized access to healthcare data It enables individuals with right to get their electronic healthcare data and they can grant privileges to others to receive healthcare information Appl Sci of Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA The federal government of Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act PIPEDA in Its main purpose is to provide individuals control to some extent over their personal information by enforcing policies on organiza tions that process and disclose the personal information of Canadian citizens These policies include informing citizens concerning personal information processed or disclosed and this information is protected by using adequate security measures The PIPEDA applies to all personal data healthcare data and other data that holds the private information of individuals If any organization collects data then it is fully accountable for the protection of the collected data The PIPEDA is not applicable in all states of Canada Every province has the right to enforce rules and policies as long as they are similar to PIPEDA PIPEDA provides basic guidelines to organizations for collecting and processing personal information for business purposes The interconnected devices should use the security standards of data privacy principles according to PIPEDA EUROHEALTH In late the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established healthcare pro gram called EUROHEALTH It provides mediumterm needs for the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe CCEE for material managerial and technical resources for longterm health strategies The primary objectives of this program are to make collaborative agree ments with CCEE fundraising and coordination with international organizations The programs work has generated an information ow for better cooperation and coordination between all the organizations working in the health sector This program is realistic exible and accessible to the CCEE General Data Protection Regulation GDPR In May new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR replaced directive consolidating and innovating data protection rules The introduced GDPR is considerably more comprehensive and establishes requirements for internal compliance mechanisms that did not exist in the legislation It applies to all sectors of the economy all broadly dened personal data and every sector that controls or processes data Moreover it applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of the data GDPR is designed to enable people to better control their data Although the EU already established its data protection directive in it was not completely reasonable for all the member states of the EU To remove all the reservations the GDPR has been established and is applicable throughout the EU The liability of the GDPRs impact is likely to be for health organizations hospitals and other healthcare organizations that process healthcare data GDPR requires accountability for how healthcare data is processed Data controllers are not only responsible for the compliance but processors are also accountable for any data breach of their work and direction Furthermore health organizations will need to be clearer and attentive in proling data processing activities and will require their staff to ensure secure ow of data The Privacy Act Australia It entails the set of principles of Australian legislation to protect the personal infor mation of Australian citizens These principles refer to the usage storage and disclosure of personal information Moreover individuals have the right to the access and correc tion of their personal information This law also includes data security data quality and crossborder data ow policies Healthcare data is subset of personal information and needs extra security policies and protection All organizations that provide health service and hold health information other than an employee record are covered by the Privacy Act whether or not they are small businesses In certain circumstances the Privacy Act permits the handling of healthAppl Sci of information and personal information for health and medical research purposes where it is impracticable for researchers to obtain individuals consent Saudi Health Information Exchange Policies SHIEP The main objective of this policy is to present the permissible usage of the KSA Kingdom of Saudi Arabia health information exchange like patient care public health and quality This policy applies to all individuals and organizations who have access to the Saudi Health Information Exchange managed records such as participating healthcare subscribers business associates health information services providers and subcontractors Personal Health Information PHI will be available for treatment healthcare op erations and public health but it may be permitted for research and education This policy shall not permit the usage of healthcare information for market studies and legal investigation or inquiry Table presents comparison of regulations in light of the proposed ve layers architecture for IoHT It is interesting to observe that none of the above regulations are providing security at the intermediate and feedback layer However both these layers are vulnerable to data leakage threats due to human intervention accessibility to physical devices Table Comparison

Yes No No No No GDPR EU Yes Yes No No No The Privacy Act Australia Yes Yes No No No SHIEP KSA Yes Yes No Yes No Data Protection IssuesAspects Not Covered in Healthcare Laws There are various issues and aspects of IoHT that are not covered in the already discussed legislative initiatives Big Data Issues Integrating healthcare data notably raises security and privacy issues Patient information is processed at different levels of security in data centers In America most organizations have HIPAA certication but this does not guarantee patients record safety because HIPAA is more inclined towards ensuring security policies rather than implementation Moreover the transmission of large data sets from different locations poses an extra burden on processing and storage Conventional security solutions are inadequate for large and inherently changing data sets With the emergence of cloud healthcare solutions security demands are becoming more complex and there are no specied policies written in existing healthcare data protection laws Data Governance related to the governance of healthcare data should be the initial step in managing healthcare data It is due to the need of moving the healthcare industry towards valuebased business model It demands common data representation that encircles different security standards eg ICD CPT and LOINC Currently data generated in the healthcare industry is diverse and would demand proper governance model There are no policies for healthcare data standardization and normalization for proper data governance Privacypreserving analytics in the healthcare industry is grasping IoT devices to monitor and transmit vitals to healthcare clouds Therefore it needs to process and analyze data in an adhoc decentralized manner However the execution of resourceexhausting operations with privacy preservation is becoming challenge As new healthcare dataAppl Sci of analytics are becoming popular healthcare data privacy laws need revision and new laws should be drafted to illustrate all processes involved in the usage of patients private data Identication of the Relevant Privacy Violation privacy in IoTbased devices can be violated at many stages Firstly it is violated by collecting data by third parties Secondly the usage and distribution of private data and thirdly the data is combined with other data The third possibility is not known by the users who are using IoTbased medical devices to process and generate data By combining newly generated information with existing data about patient or health activity it raises the high commercial value for many datahungry organizations and commercial rms Most of the data is often generated by automated medical devices therefore higher trust level should be maintained for this data than on manually entered human data This is important because medical insurance companies are monitoring the health conditions of their customers with the help of medical devices to ascertain the specic risks associated with their customers health These devices are also tracking users geolocations and such data must be protected through adequate device safety measures as well as legislative limitations on data usage Data and context quality are mostly overlooked issues even if these facts play signicant role in the privacy debates in the context of IoT The quality of data highly depends on the environment in which it is collected The quality of context may be unknown where there is no or incomplete information about the context It may also be ambivalent as there is chance of contradictory information from different context sources Context quality generates new problems of condentiality that have not been addressed by current research Context quality is related to the information that is not to be processed by hardware components that likely provide the information It is better to protect context quality as it is sensitive information Change in context quality is also sensitive information IoT devices generate data based on context and do not allow users to shut down the system or to easily disconnect from it To enhance transparency of the healthcare systems not only healthcare data that is propagated from different devices need to be controlled but also the data generated automatically by the healthcare devices need to be managed Despite this important issue no law has been made in this regard There is need to develop combined approach with technical standards and existing regulatory frameworks to ensure data transparency Privacy violating interactions and presentation in IoTbased healthcare applications like heartbeat monitors geotracking devices automated insulin pumps and other health care devices envisage and require strong interaction with the patient In such devices the information will be provided through sensors or other recorded medical device readings This information goes through different devices to reach its ultimate destination and be comes threat to privacy when this sensitive information is exchanged through different systems In smart cities for instance an individual could make query for the way to specic health clinic Such query should not be answered for instance by showing the way to health clinic nearby visible to any passerby another example of such medical devices that do not encrypt data while transmitting to the remote server Any adversary intending to sniff that data could easily use this information for malicious purpose Due to the close interaction and presentation techniques the threat of privacyviolating interaction and presentation is major challenge in healthcare laws Life cycle transition privacy is compromised when private information is disclosed by IoT devices during the life cycle transition These devices hold information like vital sign readings drug dosage and actuator functions Healthcare data is highly sensitive but also the collection of simple usage data eg location duration frequency could disclose lot about the life cycle of people Despite evident problems with healthcare devices the life cycle transition problem has never been addressed The life cycle of healthcare devices is still modeled as buyonceownforever and solutions have not evolved beyond total memory wipe eg before selling wearable or physical destruction There is need to identify the requirements for exible solutions to implement convenient privacy life cycle management mechanismsAppl Sci of Linkage refers to the linkage of different previously separated systems like combin ing forms of revealed data sources When data is gathered from different sources with different permissions and contexts it causes loss of context and poor judgment Threats of linking different systems and data sources are not novel Online social networks and integrated thirdparty applications are facing the same problems However IoT networks and services rely on the interaction and collaboration of many coequal systems Managing the numerous devices in IoHT systems and their connectivity with other systems will raise more challenges in linkage threats The threat of linkage will cause problems in the IoT evolution process There are mainly two reasons for it First the horizontal linkage of different companies and manufacturers systems to create heterogeneous distributed systemofsystems delivering new services that no single system can provide Successful linkage will make data exchange more agile and controllable between different parties However horizontal linkage also causes more local data ows than vertical linkage that could improve privacy These problems should be properly addressed in IoT healthcare laws to prevent passive monitoring and intrusive data collection by IoT devices IoHT Governance Challenges Based on the analysis of the major global healthcare initiatives we identied the following IoHT governance challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of IoHT systems Conicts in Laws After the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR for the enforcement of data security and privacy standards have been widened For the protection of European citizens data outside of Europe their data is allowed to be used under strict conditions If any data privacy legislation enacted by nonEU country accepts Standard Contractual Clauses SCC and Binding Corporate Rules BCR These terms and conditions cause challenges for developing countries because BCRs and SCC are timeconsuming and costly country may or may not have law for user data protection but the healthcare system should follow the laws of the country from which the user belongs The same thing applies to the social and cultural norms which should be applied according to the laws of the state to which the user belongs In the case of data residing on cloud servers again the privacy laws will be applied according to the region of the patients Data Protection Issues in Healthcare Systems The above discussion leads us to nd the four major issues in protecting healthcare data from the national policy level to an organizational level These issues are the absence of laws for healthcare data protection ii the use of nonstandard healthcare devices and communication protocols by healthcare facility iii compliance issues to implement healthcare policies locally iv and the absence of dedicated enforcement agency for inspection and to deal with complaints and violations Absence of Conict of Laws for Healthcare Data Protection As we have discussed the most common reason for violations in healthcare laws is the absence of law in many developing countries There is no law for healthcare data protection therefore patients data can be used by the government and private agencies They use patients medical records for research purposes without their consent No mon itoring facility can ensure the integrity of the medical records after being used by these organizations NonStandard Healthcare Devices and Protocols The development and production process of various smart devices over short period reduces the security considerations Small businesses have less expertise and resources inAppl Sci of terms of security implementations and testing the devices as well as applications for the healthcare domain Usage of nonstandard healthcare devices and protocols is the major concern of healthcare data privacy and protection which in context is the usage of locally manufactured healthcare devices that do not have sufcient security features according to healthcare standards Most of these devices are unable to update or patch against new threats and attacks There must be some laws and policies included in these healthcare care laws that declare guidelines for manufacturing healthcare devices and security features must be included in them Other Considerations Apart from the abovementioned challenges there are several local issues worth consideration for the adoption of IoHT governance initiatives Awareness There is lack of awareness among the users of healthcare systems about the importance of the security of healthcare data System Management Staff Most of the time healthcare data is processed and for warded by system management staff in healthcare institutes They work on inter mediate devices like data servers and gateway devices The staff is not qualied enough to understand the complexities of data privacy and legal aspects They are unaware of the latest threats because their primary tasks are network congurations and the availability of data at the endpoints Mostly they do not update healthcare systems and leave them unpatched until an issue is raised They have little exposure to awareness programs and practices for data security and privacy Doctors and Healthcare staff One of the critical facts is not knowing much about the security and privacy laws of healthcare data by the healthcare staff and emergency response teams in hospitals Specically the doctor uses personal devices such as cell phones or laptops to view the data therefore these personal devices also need to be secure Moreover they are not even familiar with the consequences of healthcare data leakage There is no proper framework implemented that enforces healthcare staff to follow rules and policies to share and process patients healthcare data legally and securely Patients These are the central entities in the healthcare system However they are less attractive to attackers due to having less information ie about themselves only They are conscious about their privacy and all these legalities are there to protect their healthcare privacy However they do not have any idea about how their data is shared with other organizations and what their rights are regarding their healthcare data If their data is shared without conferring with them it begs the question of what the legal liberties are that can be taken by concerned organizations about data sharing Enforcement Difculties There is no enforcement authority or body established that helps to enforce data privacy laws in the healthcare sector All the healthcare institutes should be obliged to follow instructions by some authority The authority should implement healthcare laws Low Budget In developing countries the medical budget is very limited The trend of using IoHT devices is emerging in big cities Mostly there is no central system or facility provided to facilitate data privacy in developing countries very low or limited budget is allocated for new and innovative technologies in the healthcare sector Therefore the authorities consider that there is no need to enforce data privacy policies if the usage of such devices is limited Lack of Qualied Staff The IT staff does not congureenable security functions in IoHT due to inadequate qualications and expertise The main reason behind it is the lack of security training programs for medical staff They are only interested in the functional requirements of medical devices but do not take care of nonfunctional requirements of medical device like communication security and data privacy No Internal Auditing There is no IoHT audit like IT audit conducted in healthcare organizations and hospitals If any organization is processing healthcare data then itAppl Sci of is unlikely to make checks and balance the healthcare data The internal audit ensures what data is being processed by which organization for what purposes The auditing activities reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized usage No Special Enforcement Authority One of the difculties in the enforcement of data privacy laws and regulations is the absence of special enforcement authorities in the healthcare sector Formation and implementation of data privacy laws should be the primary responsibilities of the authority It can also ensure the compliance of statelevel or nationallevel policies with international policies Recommendations After careful analysis of data privacy and protection policies and compliance issues for IoHTbased systems some recommendations can assist in improving this system These recommendations assist in resolving healthcare data security problems due to compliance issues between different legal frameworks Fines and Penalties IoT devices gather huge amount of information and there are several privacy risks associated with the usage and access of the data Specically individual identication and behavior monitoring are major concerns As the usage of IoT devices is increasing in the healthcare sector huge amount of private data is processed and stored There is need to introduce new privacy safeguards The health information collected from devices like FitbitJawbone can be used to detect disease correlations with new treatment options with remote monitoring Data Anonymization IoT devices gather most of the data aggregated from the envi ronment and forward it via router or intermediate device for processing During this process several protocols and compression schemes are used as the storage space on the devices is limited and cannot handle big headers like that used for Internet Protocol IPv This data is sanitized as closely as possible to the device that created it since this communication avoids safety risks Healthcare System Design The healthcare system should be designed in such way that it provides the controls in userfriendly manner An enduser must have full control over hisher collected data at any moment ie to whom it can be or cannot be shared At any moment the user should be given the possibility to know and control who has his data what data have been collected and for what purposes they will be used for the legitimate initial purpose Privacy by Design Privacy embedded into the design is an essential component integrated into the whole IoHT core system The privacy safeguard framework must be implemented from the beginning of the system engineering process The health care devices operate with user interactions or web interfaces There are no privacy protection guidelines available while designing device interfaces There are several vulnerabilities in webbased interfaces that are prone to data leakage and information leakage attacks Most of the devices do not have authentication features or have default passwords that are difcult to enter due to their small size interfaces Communication Security There are several communication protocols used in IoT healthcare devices There are no specic guidelines provided in data privacy laws about protocol security or what type of encryption or anonymity standards should be adopted for IoT devices which operate on low memory and computation resources These privacy laws should provide transparent policies about the communication security of these devices especially for use in hospitals Dispute Resolution There is need to resolve regional and international disputes regarding data protection There are different versions of healthcare data privacy laws enforced regionally and internationally If the healthcare data of citizen is processed in different country or state where different data privacy laws are enforced then what are the possible legal issues that should apply to that persons processed data These types of disputes should be resolved in the national healthcare policiesAppl Sci of Awareness Programs Awareness programs are very signicant to highlight the im portance of data privacy especially in the healthcare sector IT staff management staff and other related staff of healthcare facility should be aware and carry out the practices of secure processing of healthcare data They must be aware of the consequences in the case of data leakage and what penalties they would be charged in the case of carelessness Doctor and emergency response teams should be trained for the secure usage of their devices ie laptops and cellphones etc linked to healthcare systems and they should share their experiences and difculties while using these devices securely with healthcare organizations Conclusions In this paper we presented detailed IoHT classication along with the general architecture of IoHT systems The architecture aids in highlighting data security and privacy challenges Along with discussion about the known security vulnerabilities we also discussed the healthcare regulations and afliated issues We also highlighted major reasons causing the failure of data protection and possible points of data leakage in IoHT systems The study also discussed and compared various data protection regulations and highlighted their limitations Lastly we proposed some recommendations regarding data privacy and security for IoHT implementations We believe this research will help the industrial and governing bodies to design and implement IoTenabled healthcare systems while protecting the security and privacy of individuals As future work we plan to explore cybersecurity risk assessment approaches with respect to IoHT to aid organizations and governments in better protecting themselves against pertinent risks The risk with simply extending existing assessment methodologies will be possibly being blind to new risks arising in the healthcare ecosystem These risks could be related to the high sensitivity of healthcare data the ow of information and compliance with regional and global regulatory approaches Author Contributions JS and RA were involved in the conceptualization of the key idea
