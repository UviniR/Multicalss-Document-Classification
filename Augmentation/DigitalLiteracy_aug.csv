high school in Tangerang Indonesia tota of students are taken as the sample in the current study The randomized pretest posttest control group design was used in the study Using quasi experimental research nonequivalent control group design the students in the experimental groups comp leted the process through digital storytelling The students test and questionnaires were used to collect the data In order to test whether there was an improvement within groups and to see if there were differences between groups the hypotheses were te sted using the test and obtaining gain scores The result showed that the visual memory and writing skill of students undergoing digital storytelling technique and of those undergoing conventional teaching but no significant differences were found betwee the two conditions They had same proficiency focused and same concentration during the learning process and the students had many opinions in experimental class Based on the percentages students post test showed that students visual memory was mor dominant than students writing skill after applying digital storytelling Moreover this research also found that students learning motivation was very good and created good of class atmosphere in experimental class during the learning process by usi ng digital storytelling Keywords digital storytelling visual memory writing skill INTRODUCTION In the acquisition and fluency of language skills may be directly involved visual memory Magnussen said that memory is retain stimulus information in memory which is assessed in term precision Visual memory is one of the power to remember or recall such as images scenes words and other information which presented visually Visual memory is important to develop because according to Phillips Christie visual memory has role in wide variety of everyday tasks It has also been considered fundamental on every type of academic learning The students should be able to visualiz the stimulus in their mind Visual memory is complex process for students Current theory of visual working memory inv olving capacity and resolution as the two important aspects of visual working memory storage Yao Chen and Qian The memory storage system of working memory includes subsystems They maintain verbal spatial and visual information The feel is so hard to remember with what they have seen so the students should learn and understand the ability to store and recall mental images in the memory efficiently to help their learning foreign language Michel et al This memory will store in short term memory as many as students should remember with the duration is briefly to Imam Sudarmaji Agus Mulyana Karsiyah Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students visual memory and writing skill see Acco rding to Baddeley et al that short term memory is able to store limited quantities of information for limited periods of time So if the students did not pay attention they will feel difficult in pl acing visual which means that they need stimuli for be able to visualize The students may have difficulty during several operations such as remembering general view of words in reading and writing also sequencing the letters if such skills have not impro ved While writing is one of the four skills in English The students felt that writing is as more complicated than the other skills and became challenging area of language learning Jabali Javed et al said that even native speakers of English can feel difficulty in demonstrating good of writing The students often feel confused when they are using the rules of writing such as grammatical and they also lac of vocabulary According to Maazi Janfesha and Nik et al said that writing has an important role which is assumed as the most complex process Sylvester Greenidge stated that writing has difficulty to start and it is very complex process to write although after the teacher assists the students for prewriting activities such as brainstorming to generate the ideas or supports an upcoming writing assignment Learning to write is difficult and complex process because it concerned with the knowledge bout the structure of language Rusinovci Students also need to know how to express their idea feeling opinion critical thinking in written text Fadhly The stud ents still do not understand how to write in English and they dont know their mistakes on their writing The technique or strategies to teach writing may not be interesting for the students Klimova claimed that if the teacher uses appropriate techniquestrategies to teach the students it can be more inter esting and considers students personality Writing instruction in language teaching and learning can improve students writing skill Coker et al Teacher should

also measured the level of the class atmosphere The score of class atmosphere was obtained from questionnaire that has been given to the students in experimental class during the learning process by using digital storytelling tech nique Students score of visual memory The students score in experimental class and control class are increased As the Minimum Mastery Criterion KKM at the tenth grade is Based on the result that there was no students not pass on visual memo ry in experimental class that taught by using digital storytelling technique students can pass KKM values means the students got the score than as KKM values While based on the visual memory test that was given in control class the researcher ot the total score was students could not pass KKM values and students could pass KKM values It means almost all of students in control class have score more than Even though there are several students got the score gain with KKM values Students score of writing skill The students score in experimental class and control class are increased but many students have score below the minimum criteria KKM In experimental class students could not achieve KKM values and students co uld achieve KKM values While in control class students could not achieve KKM values and students could achieve KKM values It can be seen from graphic below Figure Students post test in experiment and control cl ass Students learning motivation in experimental class In this research the students learning motivation which measured by criteria that is consists of bad not good sufficient good very go od This research analyzed by obtaining the total score of learning motivation and got the total was So based on the criteria of percentages that can be categorized that the students learning motivation was very good during the learning process by using digital storytelling with percentages Class tmosphere in experimental class The questionnaire of class atmosphere has six statements which is given by the researcher to know the students perception and participation about class atmospher during the learning process The result of every statements can be explained as follows Class atmosphere The criteria of class atmosphere can be categorized by successive interval became points with the higher score was means the students answ ered good means the students answered sufficient

storytelling that applied by the researcher has no difference to improve the students writing skill at the tenth of high school in Tangerang From the students analysis of visual memory and writing skill taught by using digital storytelling in experimental class and by using gallery walk in cont rol class the researcher has found the result of students visual memory and writing skill The researcher have just given the pretest treatment and post test in order to know the students visual memory and writing skill The result of teaching visu al memory and writing skill taught by the researcher using digital storytelling technique was good because the students scores are increased between pre test and post test score So their visual memory and writing skill had improved The score of post test was higher than pre test In visual memory students can pass KKM values and in writing skill students can pass KKM values Based on the percentages students post test of visual memory is more dominant than writing skill after applying digita storytelling technique The testing of research hypotheses indicated that Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected it means there is no significant difference of using digital storytelling on the students visual memory and writing skill This research is re lated with the previous research such as from Sarica Usluel about visual memory that is no statistical difference was found that the students less interaction with visuals in experimental class than control class But this research did not correspond to Sarica Usluel for writing skill that can be said the significant result to improve writing skill of students in experimental and control class Also from Yama Ulusoy stated that through digital storytelling could successfully result in improvement students writing skill Tarigan Liana said that the students writing skill after using digital storytelling technique was significantly higher than before their used Although fundamentally that vi sual memory need to take long time to develop because the growth of memory capacity begins in infancy and continues through early adulthood Terry While also for writing is assumed the most difficult to be learnt by the student As Brown stated that there are many aspects that can be assessed when the teacher measure the students writing skill such as content organization grammar vocabulary mechanic and the score of writing test was taken based on proficiency categories In this research there is no different between experimental and control class Although there is no activities related to the digital storytelling were conducted in control class because the condition of the students were same and had same proficiency They focused and had concentration when researcherteacher taught the students either by digital storytelling or gallery walk but the students have many opinions in experimental class So that the learning outc omes obtained almost same or have no different Based on this matter the researcher conducted by giving questionnaire to get the students learning motivation and atmosphere class during the learning process in experimental class by using digital storyt elling technique The result showed that the application of this technique had proven to have very good effect in increasing learning motivation In addition this technique also could create good and conducive classroom atmosphere students active to ask and students able to solve problem Witte Rogge stated that if the students are active during the learning process so the technique has positive effect and it can believe the students learning motivation and class atmosphere were better CONCLUSION The students score of visual memory in experimental class are increased after applying digital storytelling The students score of post test was higher that pre test it was students can pass KKM Minimum Mastery Criterion values While the students score of writing skill in experimental class als increased after applying digital storytelling The score of post test was higher than pre test it was students can pass KKM values So the level of achievement of the KKM values from these had improved Based on the percentages of students post test score that visual memory was more dominant than writing skill after applying digital storytelling at the tenth grade students of higher school in Tangerang in academic year The result of statistic which obtained by analyzing data through test of statistic calculation it indicated that Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected which means that there is no significant difference of using digital storytelling on the students visual memory and writing skill at the tenth grade of higher school in Tan gerang Imam Sudarmaji Agus

Muslem Yusuf and Juliana conducted study on attitude and barriers to ICT use amo ng English teachers in Indonesia The study used questionnaire and interview for teachers selected by purposive sampling technique The finding of the study show ed that participant teachers had positive perceptions of the implementation of ICT in classroom teaching and learning Teachers believe that ICT support them in their lessons as well as helps them to find information that enriches their lessons easily and qu ickly They also think that ICT makes teaching in the class more interesting Hong carried out study on teachers views of ICT integration using open ended semi structured interview for teachers from different parts of Colorado USA The study revealed that teacher involved in the study had positive attitude towards ICT as an instructional tool They liked ICT as pedagogical tool and as resource bank for their teaching Teachers wanted to learn new ways of using ICT to deliver instructional materials to stude nts effectively and showed their willingness to incorporate ICT in their lessons frequently This is because they believed that ICT is current trend and it has many benefits for students Further the study found that low availability of ICT resources especially the availability of computers and unreliable internet connection were major barriers that limited the implementation of ICT in the classroom Daher Bayaa and Anabousy conducted experimental study on in service athematics teachers integration of ICT as innovative practice in lower secondary and found out that the teachers ad positive attitudes and beliefs Despite their positive feeling teachers were reluctant to integrate technology in their lessons due to their little experience and different obstacles they encountered in the integration of ICT in education According to the study carried out by Semerci and Aydn on examining high school teachers attitudes towards ICT use in education applying descriptive res earch design and questionnaire for teachers working in different schools of Ankara turkey Teachers displayed high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low level of anxiety towards ICT use in education Adegbenro Gumbo and Olakanmi investigated in service secondary school teachers technology integration needs an ICT enhanced classroom in Pretoria South Africa using

competence as well as positive attitudes towards ICT Similarly study conducted on preservice Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology teaching revealed that preservice Biology teachers had positive attitude with no difference in gender or class Yapici and Heved anli The resence of positive attitude in teachers enhances the use of ICT in instruction However least was known about Biology teachers attitude toward the integration of ICT in teaching and learn ing in the outhern Regions secondary schools in Eritrea Statement of the Problem The use of technology has influenced all human aspects of life and it has an impact on how education is delivered The Government of Eritrea through the Ministry of duca tion has placed effort in introducing new curriculum that focuses on learner centered outcome based interactive pedagogy The new curriculum allows learners to actively participate in their learning In addition to this ICT policy in education has bee launched for integrating ICT in education While studying iology is important for it generally helps us to get better understanding about ourselves the world and its natural processes the performance of this subject in secondary schools in Eritrea was not satisfactory in the last five years The performance of Biology as indicated in table was poor in the last five years This can have serious implication for the quality of education and discourage students from studying Biology This problem of low performance could be solved by integrating CT in teaching and learning of Biology Various researches conducted on ICT integration in education have proved that integrating ICT in teaching and learning improve the quality of learning and perform ance of learners Moreover ICT integration simplifies abstract and complex concepts create cooperative learning and create interest in learning among students In essence integration of ICT creates learner centered learning environment Although the integration of ICT has many benefits that can be considered as opportunities it also has numerous challenges It demands educational transformation such as changing curriculum assessment and importantly changing role of teachers from being ustodians of knowledge to being facilitator in pedagogy The effective integration of ICT in teaching and learning requires the availability of ICT resources Teachers preparedness on ICT integration and attitude of teachers towards ICT integration in teaching learning However it is not clear whether Biology teachers integrate ICT in the classroom instruction with the purpose of improving teaching and learning of biology This study therefore intended to examine the integration of ICT in teaching and learning of Biology in the Southern egion of

Few school directors were not able to decide about teachers attitude Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp One school director was quoted in saying that Without providing ICT resources necessary for teaching and learning their subject giving them adequate trai ning on how to integrate ICT in biology teaching and without observing them using ICT in their classrooms it is not easy to judge about teachers attitude towards ICT integration in teaching and learning School Director No Based on the quot ation of the school director it was difficult to measure teachers attitude towards the integration of ICT in Biology lessons before providing the requirements The school directors were also asked to give their view on how they see the integration ICT in teaching and learning Majority of them believe ICT would improve the quality of teaching and learning However few responded that computer and internet could take the attention of students away from their Biology learning When school directors have positive attitude towards ICT integration in schools they can give the necessary support for teachers in using ICT in their lessons Teachers students and school directors involved in the study showed positive attitude towards the integration ICT in teaching and learning process The findings of this study were in ag reement with several research studies study conducted by Semerci and Aydn on examining high school teachers attitudes towards ICT use in education applying descriptive research design and questionnaire for teachers working in different schools of Ankara turkey Teachers displayed high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low level of anxiety towards ICT us in education Hong carried out study on teachers views of ICT integration using open ended semi structured interview for teachers from different parts of Colorado USA The study revealed that teachers involved in the study had positive attitude towards ICT as an instructional tool study conducted on preservice Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology teaching the result revealed that pre service Biology teachers had positive attitude with no difference in gender or class Yapici and Hevedanli Although positive attitude towards ICT is one of the factors for the integration of ICT in education having positive attit ude alone is not enough for ICT integration in teaching and learning Adegbenro Gumbo and lakanmi ascertained that teachers had positive attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms Teachers were willing to learn more about how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes However teachers faced difficulti es in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their inadequate knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Summary In the study it was revealed that majority of iology teachers who participated in the study had positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning They liked to use ICT in their Biology lessons they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting understandable and improves learner performance In addition the study revealed that the attitude of the majority of school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in educationEven though positive attitude existed in the schools community ICT was not applied for teaching and Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp learning of Biology This could be due to other barriers that influenced ICT integration in instruction Conclusion The study concluded that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had positive attitudes towards th use of ICT in teaching and learning The attitude of school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education Though the attitude of teachers and school directors was positive ICT was not integrated into instruction From thi it is logical to conclude that having positive attitude alone could not make ICT integration practical in the classrooms Recommendations The study recommended that Ministry of Education should provide adequate in service training on ICT integration skills for teachers REFERENCES Abdullahi The role of ICT in teaching science education in schools International Letters of

Revolution has set forth demands for new generation of the labor force with comprehensive set of skills to meet the standards of the global market Despite widespread concerns about educational reforms and renovations to enhance the workforce capacity in terms of information and communication technology ICT skills research into the digital prociencies of students has been limited in Vietnam This dataset contains observations on the digital competency level of thgrade students in surveyed schools from ve provinces in Vietnam The investigation joining frequentist and Bayesian analyses aims to provide valuable insights into the current state of childrens attitudes behaviors competency levels and use of ICT within the Vietnamese educational context The values of the dataset lie in its proposed scientic framework for replication in multiple regions and contexts equally well as the feasibility of categorical regression techniques together with Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression analysis Dataset The dataset is submitted and will be published as supplement to this paper Dataset License CCBY Keywords information technology ICT skills digital citizenship Bayesian statistics Vietnam Summary This manuscript introduces dataset Supplementary Materials of observations of students from senior high schools across ve provinces and cities in Vietnam The dataset was collected Data doi data journal dataData of as component of the Digital Kids Asia Pacic DKAP project that aimed to investigate school students information and communication technology ICT competency levels in AsiaPacic through four pilot countries Vietnam Bangladesh Fiji and the Republic of Korea The DKAP investigation implemented by the United Nations Educational Scientic and Cultural Organization UNESCO in Bangkok within the scope of the Fostering Digital Citizenship through Safe and Responsible Use of ICT Project seeks to establish concrete understanding of ICT use and competency levels of regional children by creating and verifying framework to gather quantitative data reecting their attitudes perceptions prociency and behavioral use of ICT in an educational setting The compiled data include information regarding respondents demographic and personal features such as gender ICT awareness and access socioeconomic status school and neighborhood living standards and their digital citizenship competencies The goal of this dataset is not only to describe students ICT cognitive and noncognitive skills but also to encompass thorough examination of the relationship between demographic cognitive behavioral sociocultural and contextual factors and the digital competencies of school students Utilizing both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches analyses of these data would shed light on possible predictive factors and the determinants of ICT prociency as an essential ability of future global citizens This research is particularly crucial to developing economies that rely heavily on technology transfer to boost technological progress and sustain longterm economic growth Research has conrmed the underlying signicance of human capital stock in secondary and tertiary levels of education as absorption capacity in facilitating technology transfer The ICT skills readiness of school students is even more critical for low and middleincome economies in the era of Industry which presents substantial challenges and opportunities In Vietnam as particular case study researchers have pointed out the increased risks for the middleincome trap where investment will recede due to the rising labor cost and poor laborsaving technology As Vietnam transits from traditional entrepreneurship to new computational entrepreneurship skill shortages are another problem facing the Southeast Asian country with the high pitched percentage of wage workers at risk due to automation in the region As of low skilled workers still took up to over onethird of the total labor force in the country despite growing demand for information technology IT workers by per year Alongside the possible disruption in growth rates and concerns over the weak human capital Vietnams cybersecurity is still vulnerable with fourfold increase of the number of cyberattacks and incidents within one year from to Vietnam only ranked out of countries in global cybersecurity index in Recognizing this peril of falling far behind in the age of digitalization the Vietnamese government has made an ort to improve skills education for youth especially technical education In addition to enhancing the competitiveness of the labor force digital competencies are also relevant to widespread concerns facing the global community such as cyberbullying youth suicide depression or behavioral disorders Therefore ndings from this dataset are expected to have signicant implications for the development and rating of management and capacitybuilding policies in the emerging country Within the scope of this text description of the dataset including the survey questionnaire potential research questions the research framework and our data collection procedure will be presented Examples of possible statistical model methods and analyses will also be provided Limitations and potential implications of the dataset will be discussed in the nal section of the paper Data Description DKAP was proposed as part of UNESCOs Enhancing National Capacity to Foster Digital Citizenship Education in Asia Pacic project to understand students digital competency in the Asia Pacic region The project was nancially supported by the Government of the Republic of Korea FundsInTrust and Google in close cooperation with The International Telecommunication Union ITU and The United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEFData of The DKAP survey tool has been assessed as reliable and validated to measure digital citizenship competencies under the DKAP Framework total of responses from children aged from four countriesBangladesh Fiji South Korea and Vietnamhave been obtained using the instrument within the scope of comparative investigation study of digital citizenship across the pilot countries The Vietnam Institute of Educational Sciences VNIES became the focal point of the Ministry of Education and Training to carry out the project component in Vietnam VNIES signed the contract with UNESCO Hanoi to conduct the survey in September in ve provinces within the country The survey questionnaire of the project in Vietnam was translated into Vietnamese from the English version of the DKAP framework The dataset contains responses by yearold school students regarding their digital competencies The questionnaire consists of multiplechoice questions most of which require the respondents to choose one single answer out of the provided options while some of the questions ask for more than one answer Questions and answers were treated as discrete and continuous variables and encoded according to the coding instructions provided by UNESCO see the dataset The questions were divided into two groups group contextual questions and group digital competence questions Group contains items asking for students ICT experiences along with their demographic information Group contains items concerning students ICT competencies across ve di erent domains Group Personal Background Questions The question items in group cover three domains student personal background eight items access and usage of digital devices items and socioeconomic status SES seven items

['Medic Mobile Case study by UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Name Location Year launchedReachImplementing organizationMedic Mobile Medic MobileNepal and twentytwo other countries Focus of intervention Provide an integrated mobile system for improving maternal and neonatal healthIn Nepal community health workers serving nearly people of the Himalayas Medic MobileLewis Feuer UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Summary Nepal has sustained continued reduction in maternal and under mortality rates but there are still severe disparities between those of different socioeconomic status Nepal In under mortality rates per live births were times greater for rural than for urban areas times greater for mothers with low levels of education than for mothers with higher education and times greater for the poorest than for the wealthiest Nepali households Nepal Following this trend in disparity in the chance of receiving full cycle of antenatal care ANC was twice as high among the wealthiest households and highest educated mothers than for the poorest and least educated mothers Nepal Also the ratio of institutional delivery or delivery by skilled attendant for highly educated mothers was over twice that for mothers with no formal education and for the wealthiest households it was over three times greater than for the poorest Nepal Fewer than per cent of all new mothers successfully complete the full cycle of three postnatal checkups after giving birth Nepal To address this shortfall Medic Mobile was launched in Nepal in as mobile phonebased health monitoring solution using simple data capture interface appropriate for community health workers CHWs with low levels of literacy and technical skills CHWs conduct home visits and register maternal health information directly to their mobile devices to provide increased coverage of ANC among rural women from poor households and with little formal education webbased digital dashboard allows CHW supervisors to monitor CHW activity and schedule followup services for those with highrisk pregnancies Since its launch the programme has been scaled up in Nepal to over CHWs and has been launched in twentytwo other countries supporting almost CHWs worldwide The focus of this case study is the Medic Mobile implementation in Nepal Through the UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World this case study is part of series highlighting how inclusive digital solutions can help people with low skills or low literacy levels use technology in ways that support skills development and ultimately improve livelihoods in contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on education For more information go to enunescoorgthemesliteracyallpearsoninitiativeABOUT THIS CASE STUDYCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile By traditional literacy is meant the ability to read and write Why selected To ensure that the digital solution is as appropriate as possible Medic Mobile has continually focused on usercentred design approach undertaking range of activities such as user interviews and field visits focus group discussions and roleplaying with supervisors and CHWs stakeholder and process mapping of current activities paperprototyping usability tests and pre and posttests for education and digital skills The process followed offers an instructive example of good practice when designing with users Key takeaways Medic Mobile offers an accessible mobile health mHealth approach to support more connected and coordinated healthcare systems Medic Mobile recognizes that the process of usercentered design requires extensive collaboration with all types of users and key stakeholders The Medic Mobile digital solution provides evidence of effective mHealth implementation among communities with low traditional and technical literacyUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Context and project origins In the government of Nepal instituted the national Safe Motherhood Programme with primary goal of reducing maternal and neonatal mortality of newborns up to one month while improving overall health through preventive practices for antenatal care delivery and the postnatal period Nepal While overall maternal and child mortality rates have steadily declined over the past fifteen years limitations in knowledge about services among expectant mothers institutional coverage and service delivery have created disparities between mothers experiences along the lines of education wealth and rural or urban location In addition to the Prophylactic Motherhood Programme the government added policy in underscoring the importance of skilled birth attendance SBA at all deliveries through the national deployment of trained professionals As part of its ongoing commitment to maternal and neonatal health MNH Nepal has goal of per cent of deliveries by institution or SBA by Nepal Some constraints that make achieving this goal difficult include inadequate referral mechanisms for receiving care low coverage of ANC consultations and lack of access to hospitals and health centres Nepal Medic Mobile was developed with these specific constraints in mind In Medic Mobile partnered with the Ministry of Health in Nepal and Ace Heart World Wide to equip CHWs who conduct routine house visits for expectant mothers with basic mobile phones The health workers receive reminders to follow up with mothers for ANC consultations delivery procedures and postnatal care PNC visits The primary objective of the programme was to increase rates of full ANC visits and institutional deliveries among expectant mothers Medic Mobiles target audience is the network of almost CHWs in Nepal One Heart World Wide is an international nongovernmental organization NGO working to strengthen public health services for mothers and children Medic MobileLewis FeuerCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Figure Distribution of CHW pilot sample by educational attainment Designing with the user Medic MobileLewis FeuerCentral to Medic Mobiles philosophy and practice is following usercentred design approach or what it calls humancentred design in partnership with CHWs Prior to pilot implementation the Medic Mobile team ran two rounds of field tests creating opportunities for local stakeholders to influence system design features Over percent of registered CHWs have no formal schooling JSI Therefore the Medic Mobile team consciously included key stakeholder feedback from communities with low traditional and digital literacy as an added measure for ensuring an appropriate mobile health design solution Initial design activities included mapping current healthcare system activities with CHWs and their supervisors to identify constraints and opportunities and validating sketches of the proposed platform interface before developing prototype for fieldtesting This process also involved individual interviews with staff at the government agency responsible for all public health programmes in the district Preliminary design activities led to pilot implementation among seventyseven CHWs and twentyone supervisors in the Baglung District of Nepal The purpose of the pilot was to test the feasibility of the platform among the sample of CHWs and to solicit feedback for improving its overall usability design The pilot CHWs ranged in age from to with an average age of about The sample for the pilot reflected the educational and ethnic distribution in the district Figure Almost third of the sample had no formal education and limited reading and writing proficiency while per cent of the sample had higher secondary education or above The CHWs had between none and twentyone years experience of community health work with an average of years The pilot implementation stage resulted in critical shifts in the programme objectives and strategies concerning the systems core technologies UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Prior to fieldtesting stakeholder groups were divided about the type of content to include in the CHW reporting system Given that the tool was developed to improve ANC coverage the fieldtesting revealed some clear areas that could be cut Protocol items specific to health facility services that could not accurately be substantiated by selfreports at home such as iron tablets given and tetanus and diphtheria TD vaccination administered were removed from the updated version The resulting protocol was not only easier for CHWs to administer but more focused on the intended purpose of the design solutionLESSON Focus on the content the digital tool was designed to addressHealth worker motivation major insight from the focus group sessions was that there was low motivation among CHWs because of perceived sense of isolation from supervisors and lack of support for their work Sharma and Holeman The group solicited for feedback indicated that the idea of linking their efforts to larger system and receiving confirmation was appealing Medic Mobile used this feedback to incorporate personalized and automated SMS confirmation each time report was submitted as means of increasing the visibility of and acknowledging the CHWs in the health system The pilot validated the fact that the automated response including warm greeting and salutation using the CHWs name was better received than generic confirmation Therefore Medic Mobile carried this feature over into subsequent iterations of the platform Continuous adaptation An early design of the Medic Mobile system included reporting feature for flagging highrisk pregnancies in birthing centres The pilot revealed that CHWs preferred making phone calls to ask for assistance with emergency issues while they preferred the SMS system for nonemergencies and as useful backup in lownetworkcoverage areas Sharma and Holeman Medic Mobile used this insight to redesign the workflow to allow CHWs to submit the reports after making an initial phone call This underscores the importance of continuous feedback for sustained userdesign processValidation and shifts in programme objectives Figure CHW submitting data to the Medic Mobile reporting system using SMSWe receive Thank You as soon as we submit anything using Medic Mobile We are the happiest when we are thanked CHW in Baglung Medic MobileRanju SharmaCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Rightsizing the reporting system During the initial fieldtesting process stakeholder groups debated how much information the CHWs should submit through the reporting system with some groups pushing for more comprehensive reporting protocol The pilot revealed important insights into what it was feasible for CHWs to achieve on the ground Informed by the pilot outcomes stakeholder groups were able to agree on more limited set of essential data and prioritize the primary objectives of the reporting system Sharma and Holeman Expanding the role of the target group The pilot implementation revealed need to expand the target group of end users The original design included web based dashboard system for displaying reports and CHW activity but many CHW supervisors did not have computers and relied on SMS alerts from CHWs The pilot showed the importance of their role for scaling up and made it clear that the community supervisors needed more information to support CHWs This insight has led to modifications in the roles of the CHW supervisors and their information needs Medic MobileRanju SharmaUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Feature phones and SIM card apps The initial design of the Medic Mobile approach incorporated lowcost feature phones and SIM card apps Compared with smartphone devices feature phones were both more costeffective to the programme and more familiar to CHWs Also CHWs often used SMS for communication in their daily lives and feature phones were more reliable in environments with low internet connectivity Prepilot stakeholder interviews called for comprehensive digitization of the entire MNH protocol Therefore the team developed SIMbased app for data collection and storage of report protocol The app resided on the SIM card and ran on the phone As comprehensive reporting system SIM app technology was attractive for its ability to support menudriven forms to help mediate responses and ensure accurate data entry The pilot experience led to three important findings regarding the initial design solution There was need to validate CHWs ability to use the feature phone comfortably and adopt the SMS design approach However the menudriven platform of the prototype presented challenge because of its more technically complicated multistep interface It was necessary to expand the training module to include comprehensive digital literacy component covering the basic alphabets on the keypad and general operation of the feature phones This needed to be offered prior to orienting the CHWs to the more advanced features of the Medic Mobile platform There was also need to arrive at consensus for streamlining the data capture process as described above Through this pilot experience Medic Mobile began to explore other SMSbased tools that did not involve menudriven platform and simplified the data collection protocol Improving the efficiency of the technology Figure SIM card for running Medic Mobile natively on any feature phone Text forms collect small amounts of structured data using ordinary SMS To submit text form CHW sends an ordinary SMS message with values delineated by spaces CHW might send text message with content such as Pabitra where indicates registering new pregnancy the number of weeks pregnant followed by the patients name In Nepal text forms came to be seen as viable option after insight was gained from SIMbased pilot trialINSIGHT Codesigning for improved usabilityData entry with text forms Medic Mobile decided to test the use of webbased text forms that allowed CHWs to enter spacedelineated lines of text to register data instead of the multistep menu approach of the SIM app used during the pilot This switch reduced the number of key strokes needed to send an updated report While SMSbased text forms essentially structured SMS messages have proved effective in similar studies for maternal health in Rwanda Ngabo et al and family planning in Malawi Vollmer Lemay et al stakeholders at prepilot design workshops were sceptical of this approach based on concerns related to data entry Medic MobileCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile and poor adoption among CHWs used to the traditional paperbased system Prioritizing the reporting items captured and streamlining the protocol allowed the team to revisit the topic of alternative to SIM card apps Further research revealed that text forms have two key usability advantages over SIM card apps They reduce hardware procurement costs and improve routine software updates as an alternative to convening CHWs and updating cards one at time CHWs also reported that communicating through SMS offered more comfortable reporting technique and reduced overall reporting time as opposed to navigating through the menudriven interface of SIM app Enhanced information for CHW supervisors Medic Mobile discovered that if it was to promote the use of the system by CHW supervisors for monitoring and supporting CHW engagement the supervisors needed access to more information right on their phones Focus group sessions with supervisors revealed that their priority data need was to verify that all expectant mothers were being registered Therefore Medic Mobile updated the automated SMS schedules to alert CHW supervisors each time new pregnancy was registered The alert was accompanied by comprehensive report of delivery information related to the expectant mother including anticipated delivery date the assigned CHW and upcoming ANC consultations The supervisor could then integrate the Medic Mobile Unique ID with the mothers official MNH register at the local clinic and easily account for any discrepancies between the two systems Design challenge Typing text even in the native language Nepali is difficult CHWs were much more comfortable with structured alphanumeric digits Responses All Medic Mobile text forms are structured and require as little text as possible Some examples of forms are Rita The date field was also replaced with number of days since last menstrual period LMP This change allowed CHWs to type one or twodigit entries instead of the full date format Example Weeks since LMP instead of Date of LMP Design challenge Remembering simple form syntax can be challenge Responses All text forms are very short and simple with maximum number of four fields required pregnancy status number of weeks pregnant mothers first name additional data point Medic Mobile form codes are relatable to the action being performed so that they are easy to remember All error responses and reminders contain the exact syntax of the text form that needs to be sent so that CHWs only need to refer to these messages to know what to send and when INSIGHT Design challenges created by lowskilled CHWs and Medic Mobile responses Figure Medic Mobile Unique ID linked to official MNH register Medic MobileLester Ng UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World The digital solution Remote registration Once an expectant mother is identified the CHW registers her information via SMS text form Medic Mobiles web application then registers the pregnancy creates unique patient ID calculates the expected date of delivery and schedules series of automated reminder messages to the CHW related to ANC and anticipated delivery date Antenatal care reminders and advice The reminders system is scheduled based on the Nepali Ministry of Healths protocol for recommended ANC visits SMS alerts are automatically sent to CHWs for followup with the expectant mother throughout her pregnancy During the consultation the CHW provides counselling and antenatal education following the adapted government protocols and reminds the pregnant woman to attend the nearest health facility for an ANC visit CHWs follow up few days later to confirm whether the pregnant woman completed her ANC visit at the health facility If the woman has completed her visit the CHW sends confirmation SMS text form to the Medic Mobile application If the CHW does not send confirmation SMS within two weeks of the first ANC reminder her supervisor is alerted for followup Emergency forms and birth reports The platform also incorporates system for supervisors to flag pregnancies with danger signs so that these women are more closely supported by the CHWs Alternatively if CHW identifies danger sign during pregnancy birth or postnatal period she notifies professional healthcare provider by directly calling them or sending an emergency SMS to the Medic Mobile platform which then immediately sends out SMS alerts to multiple clinic personnel After the woman gives birth the CHW confirms her delivery and whether the delivery was performed at home without trained health worker at home with trained health worker or at health facility certified to provide basic obstetric care services Web application and analytics dashboard The text forms are integrated with the Medic Mobile web application and analytics dashboard which can be translated into local Nepali languages All the information sent and received by CHWs in the form of SMS messages is listed via webbased application The analytics dashboard displays preconfigured data reports addressing the CHW supervisors needs The webbased application and the analytics dashboard are monitored by public health administrators at the district level The Medic Mobile digital solution consists of structured SMS messages submitted by CHWs to web based application for registering expectant mothers An automated reminder system and reporting dashboard supports the accountability between expectant mothers CHWs and their supervisors The system integrates digitized information from the official MNH register to improve institutional and SBA deliveries as well as ANC coverage for expectant mothersCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile DigComp The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens Carretero et al developed by the European Commission provides common reference on how to describe key areas of digital competence and proficiency levels among individuals UNESCO has applied this framework to understand the minimum skills needed to use Medic Mobile as well as thirtyone other digital solutions Benchmarking digital competences is recommended because it provides knowledge base from which to design appropriate solutions as well as to track progress of skills development Please refer to the forthcoming UNESCO landscape review Digital Inclusion for Lowskilled and Lowliterate People for the DigComp mapping and more informationRECOMMENDATION Benchmark the digital competences of users During all Medic Mobile trainings more time is spent on casebased exercises than on lectures or presentations Trainees are paired in groups based on their technical competency levels and proximity of catchment area so they can continue to support each other if they have any difficulties after returning to their communities Each training has maximum of twenty participants and there are at least two trainers per session The initial training spans three days and begins with baseline questionnaire and pretest of digital competencies At the end of the training participants complete competency posttest to ensure they have the minimum skills needed to operate the Medic Mobile platform independently in their communities After the training CHWs receive an comprehensive illustrated user manual demonstrating basic concepts of mobile phone use such as sending and receiving messages and other relevant functions Figure In addition to the initial training CHW supervisors convene monthly meetings to gather CHW feedback and provide continuing training and support Every three to six months more comprehensive refresher training is scheduled with all CHWsFigure Example of Medic Mobile new user registration process Medic MobileLester NgUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Medic

between CHWs and clinics will lead to stronger adherence to full cycle of ANC visits and facilitybased deliveries reducing maternal and neonatal mortality The platforms analytics dashboard is designed to provide realtime data to help users spot trends and improve support across the rural healthcare system The Medic Mobile dashboard reports on CHW user activity and engagement metrics alongside programme outcome metrics Supervisors use the data to follow up with CHWs through phone calls or scheduled monitoring visits Complementing dashboard data with user feedback and fieldbased observations is an important part of support visits User feedback informs not only programmatic revisions but also improvements to the efficiency of the technology As part of its monitoring strategy Medic Mobile runs structured baseline and endline questionnaire for each training session to ensure participants have learned the skills that they require to make effective use of the digital platform As noted earlier many CHWs are not fully confident in their digital skills so the Medic Mobile implementation modality and training curriculum incorporates additional support for CHWs requiring additional guidance For example CHW supervisors schedule more frequent followups with these CHWs or they are paired with neighbouring CHW who is available to serve as peer mentor Monthly meetings and reviews are held with all CHWs Figure Screenshot of the Medic Mobile digital dashboardUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Data from recent CHW intake training reinforces the need for digital skills training for mobile phone use prior to jumping into the Medic Mobile activities Survey responses from CHWs serving more than thirty communities reveal overall fluency with

CHWs Preliminary evaluation findings from the pilot implementation revealed that users believe the mobile application made the CHWs work easier as they do not have to keep constant track manually of the timing for scheduled visits Given the number of expectant mothers CHWs support monthly it can be easy to lose track of paper registers CHWs remind pregnant women about recommended clinic visits every three six eight and nine months The CHWs may do actual home visits to the pregnant women more often The reminders help them keep track of the visitsFINDING Medic Mobile improves service deliveryPilot results One year since full deployment of the pilot in seventyseven CHWs from four villages across Baglung District had used the SIM application to register pregnant women and births almost twothirds per cent of which were at official birthing centres Medic Mobile During series of focus group discussions held as part of the interim qualitative evaluation of the programme the CHWs stated that Medic Mobiles tools had increased the frequency of contact with mothers and newborns increased routine home visits to provide health services to pregnant women and new mothers achieved timely management of complicated cases and created sense of achievement provided by immediate acknowledgement of their work Medic Mobile In addition to achieving broad adoption of the Medic Mobile communication system the pilot showed that lowbandwidth mHealth system can reliably organize and automate SMS messages for improved adherence to the prescribed ANC schedule CHW digital skills Posttest results from training conducted with CHWs across thirtytwo communities revealed the strongest overall gains in the more complex mobile phone operations that CHWs initially struggled with most Figure There were per cent gains in the ability to use SMS functions including retrieving specific SMSs and accessing the phones inbox Scaleup efforts In terms of Medic Mobiles activity metrics the followon to the pilot deployment has seen an average CHW engagement rate of per cent across Baglung district which is above the internal programme target for monthly ANC coverage This engagement rate represents the proportion of the trained CHWs using the Medic Mobile platform to send at least one ANC report per month So far in Baglung itself total of pregnant women have been registered with confirmed ANC visits and deliveries confirmed an swit ch on phone Can check balance Can go to menu Can go to message an go to in box UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Sustainability and future plans Medic Mobile supports growing network of implementing partners running community health programmes and building new models for CHW programmes The platform is also well positioned to achieve government adoption of the approach and analytics tools due to positive uptake by county health management teams in Kenya and district health offices in Nepal Globally Medic Mobile is deployed across twentythree countries supporting almost health workers In Nepal the programme has expanded to three additional districts outside of Baglung reaching over CHWs supported by health facilities In the programme will be expanding to ten further districts in Nepal with cumulative reach of CHWs Some of the districts in Nepal will be using the Medic Mobile tools to track immunizations equally well This intervention has the potential to reach more than million Nepali women and children in lowincome and underserved communities every year Medic Mobile aims to scale its model nationally in Nepal with support from the national government and local buyin and ownership from the district health office In the medium term local and district governments have expressed willingness to cover ongoing costs In the long term recurring costs could be sustained through combination of local district and national support along with publicprivate partnerships Although Medic Mobile will provide targeted support to initial districts replicating the deployment through the team envisions government staff deploying and managing these systems starting in The Baglung intervention serves as valuable example of how local resources can support sustained funding Recently local leaders in the community have allocated funds to cover the SMS costs and the cost of monthly incentives for CHWs To date about US has been allocated from fiftynine villages This is unique costsharing model Medic Mobile has implemented with locallevel administrative bodies and is hoping to replicate this model at higher levels of administration The cost of deployment per CHW is estimated at US in the first year and US each subsequent year Costs associated with this estimate include technical assistance and training support with hardware and software costs decreasing every year Medic Mobile is experimenting with direct ways to incorporate new features and workflows to influence the end users One feature incorporates routine SMS educational messages to help CHWs review their skills and mechanisms to ensure targeted support from their supervisors This complementary feature to the training is intended to sustain learning on the part of the users as well as ensure that the lower skilled CHWs are receiving additional and continuous support An evaluation of the effectiveness of this SMS skills support approach will be aligned with the initial CHW trainings and will commence at the end of IMPACT Medic Mobile improves digital literacy skillsyearold Sabitri Pun has been CHW in Baglung for fifteen years Until very recently she had never used mobile phone During the threeday Medic Mobile training she learned to power on and power off her mobile phone to dial and save phone numbers to compose structured SMS messages to register pregnancies and report on ANC visits of expectant mothers Not only has learning to operate mobile phone made it easier for her to monitor the health of pregnant women in her community she reports that she is now comfortable using the device to communicate with her family and extended network of relativesCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Lessons learned and recommendations Support scientific knowledge while respecting cultural beliefs In rural Nepal traditional beliefs sometimes come into tension with efforts to ensure that

the local level the reality is different Tissington et al Especially disconcerting is the lack of services in predominantly poor communities rural areas and informal settlements of South Africa Algotsson et al Service distribution inequalities emanated from the past apartheid legacy have left high levels of imbalance in access to resources infrastructure and social services Nnadozie Tissington et al lack of service delivery in these areas infringes on the rights of vulnerable citizens to basic services such as clean water sanitation electricity and housing Particularly pertinent to service delivery in South Africa is the need to institute effective and efficient channels of communication between multistakeholder groups involved and affected by service provision processes It is essential that local government engages in twoway interaction giving citizens stake in decisionmaking with the objective of improving service delivery outcomes especially in marginalised contexts Engagement is vital in policymaking as it informs people of public issues drives citizens towards common ground that can break legislative deadlocks and increases the accountability of elected officials Citizens in vulnerable contexts are often unaware of their rights nor do they have the capacity to effectively engage with government Citizen engagement is widely promoted as game changer for development Gaventa Barrett as the voiceless become empowered to evoke change in society Building citizen engagement should be examined by identifying ways to increase participation such as showing results from engagement designing multiple channels of participation providing multitiered levels of engagement reinforcing sense of civic duty and collectiveness and getting precommitment from citizens Spada et al The concept of citizen engagement and citizen participation is universal and fundamental to supporting accountability and transparency of government service delivery however each global context differs in terms of the effectiveness to deliver and voice the needs of citizens and vulnerable groups Citizen engagement is not straightforward process especially in resourceconstrained contexts where citizens have not had the capacity and knowledge of their Basic service delivery is fundamental right for all South Africans especially vulnerable groups Effective and efficient channels of communication between multistakeholder groups involved and affected by service delivery are essential Digital citizen engagement has recently emerged as key approach for supporting twoway communication between citizens and the government It is essential for building evidencebased data to engage with government and apply social accountability measures to lobby for the provision of basic services Key to building capacities and learning is developing the abilities of both local government and citizens to become digitally literate including civic and responsiveness literacy in order to realise and action the true benefits of digital citizen engagement This research set out to identify the roles of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement and how it may be embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing digital citizen engagement initiatives pragmatist philosophical approach was applied studying observing and reflecting on actions in the MobiSAM case study Using Szulanskis fourstage model of knowledge transfer key focus areas for developing digital literacy were identified contributing to QuadrupleE process of explore enable engage

government accountable Coupled with this local government in resourceconstrained contexts often do not have the capacity and rightly shaped institutional cultural to engage in such initiatives resulting in lack of government responsiveness Digital citizen engagement DCE has emerged over the recent years as key tool to enable this much needed twoway communication and engagement between citizens and government Peixoto Fox Digital citizen engagement is defined as Haikin et al The use of new mediadigital information and communication technologies to create or enhance the communication channels which facilitate the interaction between citizens and governments or the private sector Information and communication technology ICT is not necessarily panacea for many challenges being faced in the service delivery sector in developing countries however an ICTenabled environment could be one of many significant means to support service delivery Examples of key initiatives include Ushahidi FixMyStreet Maji Voice and MobiSAM Residents use these platforms to report on service delivery issues and track the progress in getting them addressed Digital citizen engagement initiatives can play the role of bringing together the voices of individual reports and collective action by activists and civil society organisations CSOs illustrated in Figure by Peixoto and Fox Typically citizen would report service issue directly to municipality that remains as an undisclosed individual report which the general public is unaware of On the contrary civil society attempts to lobby for more collective actions on certain issues reported to collective groups which can at times be isolated and insufficiently reflect the true nature of the service delivery issue in the population The role of ICTs is to bring together individual and collective action with realtime access to mechanisms to report issues to all stakeholders Despite the opportunities that exist with ICT and citizen engagement the implementation and beneficial realisation of these initiatives by both citizens and government is not easy Digital citizen engagement projects have not yielded the expected benefits to all key stakeholders resulting in much scepticism around supporting such projects This is also quite typical of many ICT for development ICTD projects in developing countries Nevertheless this does not imply that such projects do not have successful outcomes these outcomes can only be fully realised when an effort is made to apply endogenous practices to understand institutional forces that support or hinder implementation and sustainability Mansell The failures and challenges should be seen by researchers and practitioners as opportunities to learn from them unlearn wrong practices and apply incremental changes or develop possible mechanisms and theories to address these specific failures Dodson Sterling Bennett PadeKhene Lannon The process of learning from failures and unlearning existing practices that hinder progress requires process of continuous engagement with key stakeholders in DCE initiative that is government and citizens Toyama points out three fundamental institutional forces that influence engagement with ICTs in different contexts differential access differential capacity and differential motivation These aspects are often embedded in local practice and context endogenous practice therefore practitioners and researchers need to learn in the local context to obtain insight into the factors that influence DCE Furthermore they need to engage in participatory approaches with key beneficiaries allowing multiple perspectives to emerge in an open dialogue of knowledge transfer and incremental learning through consultative process of decisionmaking Ika Hodgson Mansell Toyama Key to building capacities and learning is developing the abilities of both local government and citizens to become digitally literate in order to realise and action the true benefits of DCE The aim of this article is to present case for digital literacy development in DCE initiatives in South Africa The two research questions addressed in this article include the following What is the role of digital literacy in DCE projects in South Africa How can digital literacy be embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing DCE initiatives To set the background for the article the case for digital literacy and how it is positioned as an outcome of knowledge transfer is discussed in literature review Subsequently case study of DCE project called MobiSAM is presented as reflective case where pragmatist approach was applied to investigate the development of digital literacy for DCE Szulanskis fourstage model is applied as foundation to build an iterative process for developing digital literacy in DCE projects at local government level in the South African context The conclusion summarises the findings and concludes that the process for knowledge transfer and developing digital literacy that is identified in this article can provide guideline for future implementation of DCE in resourceconstrained contextsCivic acgonCigzen eng

Washington DC FIGURE What citizen engagement means in MobiSAMPage of Original Research Open Access The role of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement Digital literacy emerged from the concept of the digital divide which has traditionally been used to describe the inequalities that exist between those who can engage in the digital society and those who cannot Evans Gomes This is quite pertinent in developing countries where deducing the digital divide was mainly based on aspects of access to technology to participate in society the firstorder effect of the digital divide Toyama argues against this limited view of unequal access in the entropy society as access not only goes beyond access to technology or infrastructure but also considers issues of capacity and motivation to effectively and strategically use technology for its intended purpose in the case of this article to use technology to participate in citizen engagement This resulted in what authors call the second order effect of the digital divide which moves beyond access to also consider social access or the lack of skill to take advantage of ICTs Evans Gomes Henninger Huerta SandovalAlmazan The secondorder effect relates to digital literacy which has now become the focus towards addressing inequalities in the information society The definition of digital literacy seems to vary in the literature with authors providing general definitions that can apply to different domains of use This was studied by Leahy and Dolan who provide historical account of the defined meaning of digital literacy before they settled on the definition provided by the European Union Digital Literacy involves the confident and critical use of Information Society Technology for work leisure and communication It is underpinned by Basic skills in ICT the use of computers to retrieve assess store produce present and exchange information and to communicate and participate in collaborative networks via the internet The definition by the European Union seems to be more specific towards the technical skill needed to use technology EshetAlkalai on the contrary speaks to more complex skills associated with digital literacy such as cognitive motoric sociological and emotional all needed to use digital environments effectively He differentiates between five types of digital literacy which can gradually develop over time through different exercises or knowledge transfer processes between project implementers and project beneficiaries government and citizens Leahy Dolan These include photovisual literacy reproduction literacy branching literacy information literacy and socioemotional literacy EshetAlkalai All these types possibly contribute to developing the digital citizen ColdwellNeilson one who is able to purposefully and confidently communicate and find information to engage in processes to address some of their challenges When we interrogate the meaning of digital literacy in the field of DCE there are key skills and knowledge that both citizens and government need to possess in order to effectively engage in the process In this case government and citizens do not only need to be digitally literate but also need to be civically literate Henninger For digital literacy what is paramount is that citizens have the capacity to find retrieve interpret and critically evaluate information provided on digital platforms Civic literacy supports digital literacy in DCE as citizens also possess the domain knowledge ability and capacity to make sense of their political world and hence effectively act individually or collectively to hold government accountable and demand key services Henninger Digital literacy applies to both government and citizens however civic literacy is more specific to citizens Literature does not clearly articulate the domain literacy that governments should possess to effectively participate in DCE This is quite typical in the field of citizen engagement as the focus has mainly been on citizens where initiatives have taken on an adversarial approach to implementation However recent literature has motivated for focusing on building the capacity for government responsiveness to respond to citizen requests and engagement on digital platforms Daskal Gigler Bailur PadeKhene Thinyane Machiri Peixoto Fox This is not forthright process and at times requires process reengineering and an understanding of the valuable contribution of DCE for government any citizen engagement initiative is often looked at by government with suspicion to expose their ineffectiveness rather than support their processes That said this research article proposes the consideration of responsiveness literacy specific to government When we look at digital literacy in DCE it does not exist as general entity for technology use but incorporates domain knowledge Baykurt in relation to civic literacy citizen and responsiveness literacy government see Figure Given the above conceptual framework of digital literacy some of the challenges and failures of DCE projects relate to lack of appropriate literacy in the above aspects As result how can an individual or group become digitally literate if the means to do so are inaccessible and unusable Leahy Dolan is civic literacy and responsiveness literacy effectively embedded in the implementation process Organisations that implement DCE initiatives need to embed informed processes of Digital literacy CIVIC LITERACYRESPONSIVENESS LITERAC FIGURE Reimagining digital literacy for digital citizen engagementPage of Original Research Open Access knowledge transfer between implementers and project beneficiaries to build digital literacy However each context is different and hence project implementers need to ensure that they are open to learning the endogenous practices of the context in order to understand digital literacy deficiencies and opportunities Mansell These practices need to be applied iteratively and incrementally to address barriers and build digital literacy The next sections reflect on this process using Szulanskis fourstage model in the MobiSAM case study Research methodology The philosophical approach adopted for this research is pragmatism This philosophy assists in disclosing the current practices associated with DCE initiatives in local municipality and how these practices generate observations to understand the phenomenon Creswell The pragmatist approach allows the researcher to focus their attention on the research problem using various methods to gather information to address the problem Observations and explanations of the actors in the research problem context allow for the development of knowledge around the aspect of DCE in local municipality of South Africa Goldkuhl discusses three types of pragmatism referential functional and methodological The context of this research study focuses on the methodological pragmatism where the researcher has actively participated in the context to provide suggestions and implement practices for improvement in this case building digital literacy Pragmatism provides researchers with the ability to observe understand reflect and provide guidelines to mediate within social context Goldkuhl Saunders et al The pragmatist philosophy has not been used significantly in research however it is instrumental in developing change and action and how knowledge can relate to that action Feilzer Morgan This is quite fundamental to developing theories within the African context indigenous theory as information systems theory is quite dominated by world views developed in different contexts western and business contexts Mansell The premise of pragmatism is abductive reasoning where the researcher engages in process of developing logical connection between theory and empirical data in an iterative fashion Morgan describes this as an active process of inquiry that creates continual backandforth movement between beliefs and actions Therefore the data collection and analysis process in pragmatist research differs from typical positivist or interpretive research approaches In this case moving back and forth between induction and deduction in an enquiry process of problemsolving does not limit the researcher to forced choice dichotomy between post positivism and constructivism Crewell Plano Clark in Feilzer restricted to particular methodology or thought approach Instead in the context of uncertainty particularly pertinent in DCE in South Africa the knowledge character in pragmatism is constructive in the form of prescriptive knowledge providing guidelines normative knowledge exhibiting values and prospective knowledge suggesting possibilities which are built from descriptions and explanations in the enquiry process Goldkuhl This is quite an emancipatory process not only for the researcher but also for the research participants engaged in the process of problemsolving The research strategy applied is case study to understand how digital literacy is developed in the knowledge process of DCE initiative and why it was the suited approach Yin The case study is MobiSAM which is an initiative located in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa MobiSAM provides platform for twoway communication between local government and citizens on public service delivery issues It is built on an operational model of iterative and incremental development stakeholder engagement strategy formulation and capacity building comprehensive evaluation and citizen education PadeKhene et al The MobiSAM technology incorporates both reporting interface for citizens via mobile application feature phone or smartphone website and short message service SMS and also ticketing function mainly used by the municipality to address internal communication challenges MobiSAM presents useful case study to demonstrate how knowledge was transferred between various stakeholders in the project including the project implementation team to build digital literacy among key beneficiaries unit of analysis This is still an ongoing process as digital literacy development is gradual and uncertain considering the factors that hinder DCE implementation such as information poverty lack of political commitment digital exclusion internet access and lack of incentive and motivation Gigler Bailur Anand Data were collected using qualitative approach with the following tools Interviews Both semistructured and unstructured interviews were applied to allow understanding from the uncertain context to unfold based on the experience of project participants Government officials citizens and project implementers were interviewed Government officials interviewed included three service department managers three communication and two customer care staff three technicians and two IT staff Citizens interviewed included civil society representatives and community activists Participant observation The researcher participated in workshops and forums organised by the MobiSAM project civil society and the local municipality Examples of local government meetings included service management meetings special council meetings and public forums on service delivery Civil society forums and rights workshops were also organised to bring together various stakeholders in the municipality Lastly MobiSAM held public awareness meetings needs assessment workshop civil rights workshops training workshops and strategy formulation workshops Document analysis Documentation from the MobiSAM project was also analysed to supplement the field data baseline study report was reviewed to identify key communication ecologies and challenges in the municipality The case study is described in relation to the knowledge transfer process by Szulanski building explanations on Page of Original Research Open Access the experiences of project stakeholders and the researcher as key participant in the project The analysis of data mainly relied on abductive reasoning using Yins analysis approach of explanation building This approach builds an explanation about the case developing causal links in an iterative manner The iterative process was applied as follows Reexamine the components of the knowledge transfer process proposed by Szulanski Compare the qualitative findings of the observation of the project implementation processes that incorporate knowledge transfer consciously and unconsciously given uncertainty against Szulanskis knowledge transfer model Contextualise Szulanskis knowledge transfer process in the MobiSAM case allowing for the emergence of an organic process of knowledge transfer in digital literacy development The above process was repeated at different phases of the project from early to mid To provide contextual background to the study and to build the analysis the stakeholders of the project and their contribution to the knowledge transfer process are first identified and discussed in the case study description Stakeholders of the MobiSAM project Stakeholders in the knowledge transfer process mainly consist of the project implementation team and key beneficiaries that is local government citizens and civil society Media also plays key role in the DCE however at the current stage of the project this article will not dwell on this particular stakeholder All these stakeholders interact in web of complexity and uncertainty in an environment that is politically influenced as well as marginalised PadeKhene Lannon Conflicting perspectives exist between stakeholders as well as within stakeholder groups in this case each group has specific objective that they expect to achieve with MobiSAM Building digital literacy requires that all stakeholders engage in shared understanding of how DCE can be effectively used and embedded in active citizenship practices and government responsiveness practices The project manager of DCE initiative needs to devise strategies to engage all key stakeholders either separately or together in an effort to learn how best the DCE initiative can function within its context Table provides summary of conflicting aspects that emerge in different stakeholder groups in the MobiSAM project It is important to know these to highlight the challenges that need to be overcome within the iterative process of knowledge transfer and digital literacy development Table also shows the literacy focus areas embedded in digital literacy for each group with the exception of the project team that plays the role of source or facilitator where knowledge exists within the beneficiary groups of knowledge transfer Knowledge transfer and digital literacy development in MobiSAM Knowledge transfer is fundamental process for organisational learning in the business context It emerges from the need to apply knowledge management as key practice for maintaining and sharing key strategic knowledge on business operations In the context of DCE this mainly relates to managing knowledge that can be used by the community or key beneficiaries Conger is known to be one of the few authors who contextualise noesis management for ICTD In the context of ICTD knowledge managed is defined as systematic process of acquisition organisation and communication of organisational member knowledge for reuse by others in the community Conger TABLE Conflicting aspects of each stakeholder group Stakeholder Conflicting aspects Digital literacy focus arena Project Team Diverse mindsets and disciplines The MobiSAM team has an advantage of being diverse in terms of discipline and experience as citizen engagement project requires diverse perspectives to be more holistic and relevant to the target beneficiaries However project team members views can clash based on their backgrounds for example some being taskorientated verses peopleorientated more technical versus more social Mainly the source of building digital literacy However the role does oscillate between source and facilitator of knowledge transfer for developing digital literacy for digital citizen engagement Diversity of skill is paramount in this groups hence working towards shared understanding to implement digital citizen engagement is important Context literacy later emerges as focus area but not necessarily as part of digital literacy Citizens Divided social and economic aspects This is such loaded aspect however perspectives between different groups such as the youth women men and elderly can conflict In the case of South Africa income inequalities are still real and the history of apartheid has different groups in very dire living circumstances What is paramount to one citizen may be different for another Coupled with this is complete lack of trust in government because of lack of government responsiveness that has plagued local municipalities in marginalised contexts Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy Civil Society Conflicting goals and representations Civil Society in Makana Municipality is quite divided and not enough collaboration exists yet they typically share many goals Furthermore it is typically observed that they have an agenda to hold government to account rather than collaborate being sensitive to the constraints of government shared goal needs to be nurtured and facilitate among CSOs Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy Government Political influence and resource constraints Part of the local municipality is politically controlled and the other is administratively managed As result some decisions are based on political agendas Furthermore local municipalities are resourceconstrained because of ineffective planning some staff who try to work effectively are constrained by this and feel that citizens do not understand the challenges experienced Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Responsiveness Literacy CSO civil society organisationPage of Original Research Open Access Organisational learning is closely linked to the process of developing digital literacy for citizens and government Here organisational learning refers to internal adaptation processes triggered by some kind of disjunction or unease in the relationship between the organisation and what lies external and challenging to it in its environment Spender Digital literacy aims to build the capacity of citizens and government to effectively participate in DCE this can be performed through process of learning training and engagement For digital literacy to develop in the MobiSAM project it had to undergo process of learning unlearning and knowledge transfer This process is not necessarily linear but iterative to adapt to changes in the complex and uncertain context Szulanskis fourstage model presents process that is used to describe the process of knowledge transfer in the MobiSAM case in describing this process key features and practices of digital literacy development at each stage are identified Knowledge transfer occurs through the dyadic exchange of knowledge between source and recipient For each stakeholder identified in Table the role of source and recipient is interchangeable depending on the knowledge shared The four stages include initiation implementation rampup and integration Initiation As the first step in the process this consists of events that lead to decision to transfer knowledge In this case the need for knowledge transfer to support DCE is identified as well as the feasibility of such an initiative The constraints of the possible implementation of DCE initiative are also explored in the context In the MobiSAM case study the project team needed to explore the status of digital literacy including civic literacy and responsiveness literacy in the context This is based on the understanding of the communication ecologies of citizens and government in relation to civic participation and responsiveness to service delivery reporting baseline study was conducted which consisted mainly of two surveys the first survey was distributed to citizens and the second survey was distributed to local government staff This survey explored the existing approaches for communication and citizen participation identifying traditional ways of engagement and the use of technology for engagement between government and citizens In addition to the survey the project team engaged in workshops informal interviews and government public forums to understand the status of digital literacy civic literacy and responsiveness literacy After the baseline study needs assessment was conducted to explore the key needs related to the use of technology for citizen engagement and possible constraints This was more focused exercise in relation to the purpose of MobiSAM to provide platform for social accountability monitoring The purpose of this stage was to therefore explore the needs for digital literacy development and the feasibility of building digital literacy in the project implementation process This stage is not static and once off as demanddriven needs can emerge as the MobiSAM project is adopted in the context In this case needs assessment can be reintroduced in project activities to re evaluate existing digital literacy needs in the project Implementation This is the stage where the transfer of knowledge begins and resources flow between the source and recipient The project team acts as source of knowledge for developing digital literacy however they also become recipient of new knowledge from citizen and governments that shapes their activities to develop digital literacy for the context As recipient of knowledge they begin to understand protocol legislation accountability processes transparency requirements local culture and so on that govern the process of local citizen engagement An understanding of these aspects shapes their programme for guiding the development of digital literacy to effectively use MobiSAM platforms In this case government citizens and civil society become the source of knowledge transfer playing an interactive game of learning and informing The MobiSAM project team also played the role of facilitator in enabling an understanding of how to effectively integrate and use the MobiSAM platform This was applied through strategy formulation workshops with citizens and government separately and then jointly to manage conflicting views meetings with municipal management staff and CSO leadership engaging in the revision of the municipal communication strategy civic education and adaptive ICT training on how to use MobiSAM platforms An important aspect is that social ties begin to develop between source and recipient and stakeholders work towards mutual understanding of how MobiSAM can best work in Makana Municipality Szulanski articulates this as follows The transferred practice is often adapted to suit the anticipated needs of the recipient to preempt problems experienced in previous transfer of the same practice or to help make the introduction of new knowledge less threatening to the recipient Initial understanding and development of digital literacy is enabled during this stage of knowledge transfer Furthermore the project team begins to understand contextual dynamics of both government and citizens hence context literacy endogenous practice the competence or knowledge to interact and engage in these spheres Mansell The implementation stage stops when project beneficiaries begin to use the gained knowledge on digital literacy Rampup This is the stage when the recipients of knowledge begin to use the new knowledge in the context This was the stage that citizens began to see the value of the MobiSAM platforms and engage via the Facebook page email SMS and the MobiSAM website In relation to the citizen additional civic education workshops had to be held with civil society media local schools and development centres in Makana Municipality Furthermore the project had hired ward liaisons in the community to impart awareness and knowledge of MobiSAM and based on the trainthetrainer model train local community members in their wards to use the various platforms effectively The value of new initiative Page of Original Research Open Access can sometimes only be seen and understood from the perspective of common members of networked system whether it is the youth woman support networks or schools Therefore MobiSAM activities attempt to incorporate key actors involved in these networks in order to maximise on participation This has been very challenging process as the process of building digital literacy for DCE is often met with resistance and lack of resources to support development This is clearly evident from Figure which is map of reported issues the reported issues are centred on particular location in Makana Municipality more affluent areas which is closer to the centre of town and the local university It is important that unexpected problems or barriers are identified that hinder the alignment of transferred knowledge and expected performance of the adapted practices Szulanski This is no different for local government Local government staff strategised for the integration of MobiSAM in Makana Municipality and participated in workshop sessions to reengineer their existing processes to adapt better communication practice with MobiSAM This was successful among some municipal staff who confessed that they now saw the value of feedback in communicating with citizens based on the development of their digital literacy around government responsiveness Their original system identified in the initiation stage showed how broken their communication ecology was with lack of feedback culture and engagement with citizens Nonetheless MobiSAM was met with much resistance from some municipal staff requiring the MobiSAM project team to rethink their implementation approach to address the existing constraints Some social and organisational culture constraints may be beyond the scope of MobiSAM Source MobiSAM Website Active service delivery issues MobiSAM viewed June from FIGURE Map of reported service delivery issues in Makana MunicipalityPage of Original Research Open Access practices nonetheless formulating key partnerships with other government officials and CSOs may push for the transformation of current practice in the municipality In relation to building digital literacy this stage relates to engaged literacy development Integration This stage is reached when digital literacy is developed and institutionalised in government and civil society practice as well as becoming an embedded skill of active citizens Satisfactory results of the existence of digital literacy should begin to emerge Certain practices related to interaction with evidencebased data for citizen engagement and government responsiveness become associated with various actors departments and individuals As digital literacy showed initial progress in becoming embedded MobiSAM became formerly integrated into the municipality communication strategy The project team is always invited to participate in key strategic forums of the municipality as digitally literate government staff engage in discussions and practices around using MobiSAM and the data generated from it Citizens have also began to use MobiSAM as point of call for reporting issues perusing the digital platform for similarly reported issues to engage in discussion about them with an understanding of the severity of the issue Civil societies such as the Grahamstown Residents Association GRA Public Accountability Monitor PSAM and Black Sash BS now invite MobiSAM as strategic partner into their civic workshops The evidence gathered from the technology platforms is often used by the GRA to follow up on unaddressed issues or to lobby for key services Despite the many benefits of having reached level of digital literacy with some stakeholders there are still issues of stickiness that hinder the effectiveness of the process and call for continuous iterative approach building on the lessons learned from each of the stages of knowledge transfer Therefore this process should not be linear but lessons learned should feed into another staged iteration of initiation to explore emerged aspects of digital literacy and citizen engagement Table provides summary of the knowledge transfer process of digital literacy development in the MobiSAM DCE project Various practices emerged that can guide each stage of literacy development practices indicated in Table are suggestions but not limited to these as practitioners or researchers may apply different approaches within the constraints of the project and context Nonetheless this provides starting point from which to build on What was also identified in the knowledge transfer process was the digital literacy development focus at each stage of the transfer process In this case digital literacy developed through QuadrupleE process of explore enable engage and embed The transfer of knowledge is likely to experience what Szulanski refers to as internal stickiness which is based on the characteristics of knowledge transferred the source of the knowledge recipients of the knowledge Ajmal Koskinen and the context Ajmal Koskinen Yeh Lai Ho PadeKhene and Lannon relate this to the issue of power and political influence in DCE diverse stakeholder perspectives and conflicting views result in the need for ad hoc solutions as problems emerge in the transfer process Nonetheless Orlikowski argues that it is gradual process of developing knowhow in the transfer process so as to understand the origins of stickiness in order to work around them and maximise on digital literacy development The issues of stickiness are not foreign to the ICTD field and hence relate lot to Toyamas three differentials that influence digital implementation in developing countries see Table Project stakeholders need to be aware of these and mitigate their influence in the knowledge transfer process Conclusion The research study presents case for developing digital literacy in DCE initiatives This is pertinent as DCE has emerged as key tool in supporting twoway communication between citizens and government It also contributes to building evidencebased data that can be used to support social accountability and transparency practices The article identifies that DCE is not straightforward process where some factors that hinder progress relate to lack of effectively building digital literacy among citizens and TABLE comparison of

digital literacy of its stakeholders The process was identified as iterative and incremental in nature with key focus areas for digital literacy at the different stages that is the QuadrupleE process of explore enable engage and embed Despite the benefits of knowledge transfer this process is affected by factors that hinder progress referred to as stickiness The aspects identified relate closely to differentials of ICTD proposed by Toyama this highlights the significance of addressing digital access motivation and capacity in developing digital literacy and having DCE classified within the field of ICTD The process for knowledge transfer and developing digital literacy that was identified in this article can provide guideline for future implementation of DCE initiatives in

the local level the reality is different Tissington et al Especially disconcerting is the lack of services in predominantly poor communities rural areas and informal settlements of South Africa Algotsson et al Service distribution inequalities emanated from the past apartheid legacy have left high levels of imbalance in access to resources infrastructure and social services Nnadozie Tissington et al lack of service delivery in these areas infringes on the rights of vulnerable citizens to basic services such as clean water sanitation electricity and housing Particularly pertinent to service delivery in South Africa is the need to institute effective and efficient channels of communication between multistakeholder groups involved and affected by service provision processes It is essential that local government engages in twoway interaction giving citizens stake in decisionmaking with the objective of improving service delivery outcomes especially in marginalised contexts Engagement is vital in policymaking as it informs people of public issues drives citizens towards common ground that can break legislative deadlocks and increases the accountability of elected officials Citizens in vulnerable contexts are often unaware of their rights nor do they have the capacity to effectively engage with government Citizen engagement is widely promoted as game changer for development Gaventa Barrett as the voiceless become empowered to evoke change in society Building citizen engagement should be examined by identifying ways to increase participation such as showing results from engagement designing multiple channels of participation providing multitiered levels of engagement reinforcing sense of civic duty and collectiveness and getting precommitment from citizens Spada et al The concept of citizen engagement and citizen participation is universal and fundamental to supporting accountability and transparency of government service delivery however each global context differs in terms of the effectiveness to deliver and voice the needs of citizens and vulnerable groups Citizen engagement is not straightforward process especially in resourceconstrained contexts where citizens have not had the capacity and knowledge of their Basic service delivery is fundamental right for all South Africans especially vulnerable groups Effective and efficient channels of communication between multistakeholder groups involved and affected by service delivery are essential Digital citizen engagement has recently emerged as key approach for supporting twoway communication between citizens and the government It is essential for building evidencebased data to engage with government and apply social accountability measures to lobby for the provision of basic services Key to building capacities and learning is developing the abilities of both local government and citizens to become digitally literate including civic and responsiveness literacy in order to realise and action the true benefits of digital citizen engagement This research set out to identify the roles of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement and how it may be embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing digital citizen engagement initiatives pragmatist philosophical approach was applied studying observing and reflecting on actions in the MobiSAM case study Using Szulanskis fourstage model of knowledge transfer key focus areas for developing digital literacy were identified contributing to QuadrupleE process of explore enable engage and embed Practices identified in the MobiSAM case study are provided as suggestions for each phase with an indication of possible constraints that may be experienced in the knowledge transfer and

government accountable Coupled with this local government in resourceconstrained contexts often do not have the capacity and rightly shaped institutional cultural to engage in such initiatives resulting in lack of government responsiveness Digital citizen engagement DCE has emerged over the recent years as key tool to enable this much needed twoway communication and engagement between citizens and government Peixoto Fox Digital citizen engagement is defined as Haikin et al The use of new mediadigital information and communication technologies to create or enhance the communication channels which facilitate the interaction between citizens and governments or the private sector Information and communication technology ICT is not necessarily panacea for many challenges being faced in the service delivery sector in developing countries however an ICTenabled environment could be one of many significant means to support service delivery Examples of key initiatives include Ushahidi FixMyStreet Maji Voice and MobiSAM Residents use these platforms to report on service delivery issues and track the progress in getting them addressed Digital citizen engagement initiatives can play the role of bringing together the voices of individual reports and collective action by activists and civil society organisations CSOs illustrated in Figure by Peixoto and Fox Typically citizen would report service issue directly to municipality that remains as an undisclosed individual report which the general public is unaware of On the contrary civil society attempts to lobby for more collective actions on certain issues reported to collective groups which can at times be isolated and insufficiently reflect the true nature of the service delivery issue in the population The role of ICTs is to bring together individual and collective action with realtime access to mechanisms to report issues to all stakeholders Despite the opportunities that exist with ICT and citizen engagement the implementation and beneficial realisation of these initiatives by both citizens and government is not easy Digital citizen engagement projects have not yielded the expected benefits to all key stakeholders resulting in much scepticism around supporting such projects This is also quite typical of many ICT for development ICTD projects in developing countries Nevertheless this does not imply that such projects do not have successful outcomes these outcomes can only be fully realised when an effort is made to apply endogenous practices to understand institutional forces that support or hinder implementation and sustainability Mansell The failures and challenges should be seen by researchers and practitioners as opportunities to learn from them unlearn wrong practices and apply incremental changes or develop possible mechanisms and theories to address these specific failures Dodson Sterling Bennett PadeKhene Lannon The process of learning from failures and unlearning existing practices that hinder progress requires process of continuous engagement with key stakeholders in DCE initiative that is government and citizens Toyama points out three fundamental institutional forces that influence engagement with ICTs in different contexts differential access differential capacity and differential motivation These aspects are often embedded in local practice and context endogenous practice therefore practitioners and researchers need to learn in the local context to obtain insight into the factors that influence DCE Furthermore they need to engage in participatory approaches with key beneficiaries allowing multiple perspectives to emerge in an open dialogue of knowledge transfer and incremental learning through consultative process of decisionmaking Ika Hodgson Mansell Toyama Key to building capacities and learning is developing the abilities of both local government and citizens to become digitally literate in order to realise and action the true benefits of DCE The aim of this article is to present case for digital literacy development in DCE initiatives in South Africa The two research questions addressed in this article include the following What is the role of digital literacy in DCE projects in South Africa How can digital literacy be embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing DCE initiatives To set the background for the article the case for digital literacy and how it is positioned as an outcome of knowledge transfer is discussed in literature review Subsequently case study of DCE project called MobiSAM is presented as reflective case where pragmatist approach was applied to investigate the development of digital literacy for DCE Szulanskis fourstage model is applied as foundation to build an iterative process for developing digital literacy in DCE projects at local government level in the South African context The conclusion summarises the findings and concludes that the process for knowledge transfer and developing digital literacy that is identified in this article can provide guideline for future implementation of DCE in resourceconstrained contextsCivic acgonCigzen eng

Washington DC FIGURE What citizen engagement means in MobiSAMPage of Original Research Open Access The role of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement Digital literacy emerged from the concept of the digital divide which has traditionally been used to describe the inequalities that exist between those who can engage in the digital society and those who cannot Evans Gomes This is quite pertinent in developing countries where deducing the digital divide was mainly based on aspects of access to technology to participate in society the firstorder effect of the digital divide Toyama argues against this limited view of unequal access in the entropy society as access not only goes beyond access to technology or infrastructure but also considers issues of capacity and motivation to effectively and strategically use technology for its intended purpose in the case of this article to use technology to participate in citizen engagement This resulted in what authors call the second order effect of the digital divide which moves beyond access to also consider social access or the lack of skill to take advantage of ICTs Evans Gomes Henninger Huerta SandovalAlmazan The secondorder effect relates to digital literacy which has now become the focus towards addressing inequalities in the information society The definition of digital literacy seems to vary in the literature with authors providing general definitions that can apply to different domains of use This was studied by Leahy and Dolan who provide historical account of the defined meaning of digital literacy before they settled on the definition provided by the European Union Digital Literacy involves the confident and critical use of Information Society Technology for work leisure and communication It is underpinned by Basic skills in ICT the use of computers to retrieve assess store produce present and exchange information and to communicate and participate in collaborative networks via the internet The definition by the European Union seems to be more specific towards the technical skill needed to use technology EshetAlkalai on the contrary speaks to more complex skills associated with digital literacy such as cognitive motoric sociological and emotional all needed to use digital environments effectively He differentiates between five types of digital literacy which can gradually develop over time through different exercises or knowledge transfer processes between project implementers and project beneficiaries government and citizens Leahy Dolan These include photovisual literacy reproduction literacy branching literacy information literacy and socioemotional literacy EshetAlkalai All these types possibly contribute to developing the digital citizen ColdwellNeilson one who is able to purposefully and confidently communicate and find information to engage in processes to address some of their challenges When we interrogate the meaning of digital literacy in the field of DCE there are key skills and knowledge that both citizens and government need to possess in order to effectively engage in the process In this case government and citizens do not only need to be digitally literate but also need to be civically literate Henninger For digital literacy what is paramount is that citizens have the capacity to find retrieve interpret and critically evaluate information provided on digital platforms Civic literacy supports digital literacy in DCE as citizens also possess the domain knowledge ability and capacity to make sense of their political world and hence effectively act individually or collectively to hold government accountable and demand key services Henninger Digital literacy applies to both government and citizens however civic literacy is more specific to citizens Literature does not clearly articulate the domain literacy that governments should possess to effectively participate in DCE This is quite typical in the field of citizen engagement as the focus has mainly been on citizens where initiatives have taken on an adversarial approach to implementation However recent literature has motivated for focusing on building the capacity for government responsiveness to respond to citizen requests and engagement on digital platforms Daskal Gigler Bailur PadeKhene Thinyane Machiri Peixoto Fox This is not forthright process and at times requires process reengineering and an understanding of the valuable contribution of DCE for government any citizen engagement initiative is often looked at by government with suspicion to expose their ineffectiveness rather than support their processes That said this research article proposes the consideration of responsiveness literacy specific to government When we look at digital literacy in DCE it does not exist as general entity for technology use but incorporates domain knowledge Baykurt in relation to civic literacy citizen and responsiveness literacy government see Figure Given the above conceptual framework of digital literacy some of the challenges and failures of DCE projects relate to lack of appropriate literacy in the above aspects As result how can an individual or group become digitally literate if the means to do so are inaccessible and unusable Leahy Dolan is civic literacy and responsiveness literacy effectively embedded in the implementation process Organisations that implement DCE initiatives need to embed informed processes of Digital literacy CIVIC LITERACYRESPONSIVENESS LITERAC FIGURE Reimagining digital literacy for digital citizen engagementPage of Original Research Open Access knowledge transfer between implementers and project beneficiaries to build digital literacy However each context is different and hence project implementers need to ensure that they are open to learning the endogenous practices of the context in order to understand digital literacy deficiencies and opportunities Mansell These practices need to be applied iteratively and incrementally to address barriers and build digital literacy The next sections reflect on this process using Szulanskis fourstage model in the MobiSAM case study Research methodology The philosophical approach adopted for this research is pragmatism This philosophy assists in disclosing the current practices associated with DCE initiatives in local municipality and how these practices generate observations to understand the phenomenon Creswell The pragmatist approach allows the researcher to focus their attention on the research problem using various methods to gather information to address the problem Observations and explanations of the actors in the research problem context allow for the development of knowledge around the aspect of DCE in local municipality of South Africa Goldkuhl discusses three types of pragmatism referential functional and methodological The context of this research study focuses on the methodological pragmatism where the researcher has actively participated in the context to provide suggestions and implement practices for improvement in this case building digital literacy Pragmatism provides researchers with the ability to observe understand reflect and provide guidelines to mediate within social context Goldkuhl Saunders et al The pragmatist philosophy has not been used significantly in research however it is instrumental in developing change and action and how knowledge can relate to that action Feilzer Morgan This is quite fundamental to developing theories within the African context indigenous theory as information systems theory is quite dominated by world views developed in different contexts western and business contexts Mansell The premise of pragmatism is abductive reasoning where the researcher engages in process of developing logical connection between theory and empirical data in an iterative fashion Morgan describes this as an active process of inquiry that creates continual backandforth movement between beliefs and actions Therefore the data collection and analysis process in pragmatist research differs from typical positivist or interpretive research approaches In this case moving back and forth between induction and deduction in an enquiry process of problemsolving does not limit the researcher to forced choice dichotomy between post positivism and constructivism Crewell Plano Clark in Feilzer restricted to particular methodology or thought approach Instead in the context of uncertainty particularly pertinent in DCE in South Africa the knowledge character in pragmatism is constructive in the form of prescriptive knowledge providing guidelines normative knowledge exhibiting values and prospective knowledge suggesting possibilities which are built from descriptions and explanations in the enquiry process Goldkuhl This is quite an emancipatory process not only for the researcher but also for the research participants engaged in the process of problemsolving The research strategy applied is case study to understand how digital literacy is developed in the knowledge process of DCE initiative and why it was the suited approach Yin The case study is MobiSAM which is an initiative located in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa MobiSAM provides platform for twoway communication between local government and citizens on public service delivery issues It is built on an operational model of iterative and incremental development stakeholder engagement strategy formulation and capacity building comprehensive evaluation and citizen education PadeKhene et al The MobiSAM technology incorporates both reporting interface for citizens via mobile application feature phone or smartphone website and short message service SMS and also ticketing function mainly used by the municipality to address internal communication challenges MobiSAM presents useful case study to demonstrate how knowledge was transferred between various stakeholders in the project including the project implementation team to build digital literacy among key beneficiaries unit of analysis This is still an ongoing process as digital literacy development is gradual and uncertain considering the factors that hinder DCE implementation such as information poverty lack of political commitment digital exclusion internet access and lack of incentive and motivation Gigler Bailur Anand Data were collected using qualitative approach with the following tools Interviews Both semistructured and unstructured interviews were applied to allow understanding from the uncertain context to unfold based on the experience of project participants Government officials citizens and project implementers were interviewed Government officials interviewed included three service department managers three communication and two customer care staff three technicians and two IT staff Citizens interviewed included civil society representatives and community activists Participant observation The researcher participated in workshops and forums organised by the MobiSAM project civil society and the local municipality Examples of local government meetings included service management meetings special council meetings and public forums on service delivery Civil society forums and rights workshops were also organised to bring together various stakeholders in the municipality Lastly MobiSAM held public awareness meetings needs assessment workshop civil rights workshops training workshops and strategy formulation workshops Document analysis Documentation from the MobiSAM project was also analysed to supplement the field data baseline study report was reviewed to identify key communication ecologies and challenges in the municipality The case study is described in relation to the knowledge transfer process by Szulanski building explanations on Page of Original Research Open Access the experiences of project stakeholders and the researcher as key participant in the project The analysis of data mainly relied on abductive reasoning using Yins analysis approach of explanation building This approach builds an explanation about the case developing causal links in an iterative manner The iterative process was applied as follows Reexamine the components of the knowledge transfer process proposed by Szulanski Compare the qualitative findings of the observation of the project implementation processes that incorporate knowledge transfer consciously and unconsciously given uncertainty against Szulanskis knowledge transfer model Contextualise Szulanskis knowledge transfer process in the MobiSAM case allowing for the emergence of an organic process of knowledge transfer in digital literacy development The above process was repeated at different phases of the project from early to mid To provide contextual background to the study and to build the analysis the stakeholders of the project and their contribution to the knowledge transfer process are first identified and discussed in the case study description Stakeholders of the MobiSAM project Stakeholders in the knowledge transfer process mainly consist of the project implementation team and key beneficiaries that is local government citizens and civil society Media also plays key role in the DCE however at the current stage of the project this article will not dwell on this particular stakeholder All these stakeholders interact in web of complexity and uncertainty in an environment that is politically influenced as well as marginalised PadeKhene Lannon Conflicting perspectives exist between stakeholders as well as within stakeholder groups in this case each group has specific objective that they expect to achieve with MobiSAM Building digital literacy requires that all stakeholders engage in shared understanding of how DCE can be effectively used and embedded in active citizenship practices and government responsiveness practices The project manager of DCE initiative needs to devise strategies to engage all key stakeholders either separately or together in an effort to learn how best the DCE initiative can function within its context Table provides summary of conflicting aspects that emerge in different stakeholder groups in the MobiSAM project It is important to know these to highlight the challenges that need to be overcome within the iterative process of knowledge transfer and digital literacy development Table also shows the literacy focus areas embedded in digital literacy for each group with the exception of the project team that plays the role of source or facilitator where knowledge exists within the beneficiary groups of knowledge transfer Knowledge transfer and digital literacy development in MobiSAM Knowledge transfer is fundamental process for organisational learning in the business context It emerges from the need to apply knowledge management as key practice for maintaining and sharing key strategic knowledge on business operations In the context of DCE this mainly relates to managing knowledge that can be used by the community or key beneficiaries Conger is known to be one of the few authors who contextualise noesis management for ICTD In the context of ICTD knowledge managed is defined as systematic process of acquisition organisation and communication of organisational member knowledge for reuse by others in the community Conger TABLE Conflicting aspects of each stakeholder group Stakeholder Conflicting aspects Digital literacy focus arena Project Team Diverse mindsets and disciplines The MobiSAM team has an advantage of being diverse in terms of discipline and experience as citizen engagement project requires diverse perspectives to be more holistic and relevant to the target beneficiaries However project team members views can clash based on their backgrounds for example some being taskorientated verses peopleorientated more technical versus more social Mainly the source of building digital literacy However the role does oscillate between source and facilitator of knowledge transfer for developing digital literacy for digital citizen engagement Diversity of skill is paramount in this groups hence working towards shared understanding to implement digital citizen engagement is important Context literacy later emerges as focus area but not necessarily as part of digital literacy Citizens Divided social and economic aspects This is such loaded aspect however perspectives between different groups such as the youth women men and elderly can conflict In the case of South Africa income inequalities are still real and the history of apartheid has different groups in very dire living circumstances What is paramount to one citizen may be different for another Coupled with this is complete lack of trust in government because of lack of government responsiveness that has plagued local municipalities in marginalised contexts Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy Civil Society Conflicting goals and representations Civil Society in Makana Municipality is quite divided and not enough collaboration exists yet they typically share many goals Furthermore it is typically observed that they have an agenda to hold government to account rather than collaborate being sensitive to the constraints of government shared goal needs to be nurtured and facilitate among CSOs Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy Government Political influence and resource constraints Part of the local municipality is politically controlled and the other is administratively managed As result some decisions are based on political agendas Furthermore local municipalities are resourceconstrained because of ineffective planning some staff who try to work effectively are constrained by this and feel that citizens do not understand the challenges experienced Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Responsiveness Literacy CSO civil society organisationPage of Original Research Open Access Organisational learning is closely linked to the process of developing digital literacy for citizens and government Here organisational learning refers to internal adaptation processes triggered by some kind of disjunction or unease in the relationship between the organisation and what lies external and challenging to it in its environment Spender Digital literacy aims to build the capacity of citizens and government to effectively participate in DCE this can be performed through process of learning training and engagement For digital literacy to develop in the MobiSAM project it had to undergo process of learning unlearning and knowledge transfer This process is not necessarily linear but iterative to adapt to changes in the complex and uncertain context Szulanskis fourstage model presents process that is used to describe the process of knowledge transfer in the MobiSAM case in describing this process key features and practices of digital literacy development at each stage are identified Knowledge transfer occurs through the dyadic exchange of knowledge between source and recipient For each stakeholder identified in Table the role of source and recipient is interchangeable depending on the knowledge shared The four stages include initiation implementation rampup and integration Initiation As the first step in the process this consists of events that lead to decision to transfer knowledge In this case the need for knowledge transfer to support DCE is identified as well as the feasibility of such an initiative The constraints of the possible implementation of DCE initiative are also explored in the context In the MobiSAM case study the project team needed to explore the status of digital literacy including civic literacy and responsiveness literacy in the context This is based on the understanding of the communication ecologies of citizens and government in relation to civic participation and responsiveness to service delivery reporting baseline study was conducted which consisted mainly of two surveys the first survey was distributed to citizens and the second survey was distributed to local government staff This survey explored the existing approaches for communication and citizen participation identifying traditional ways of engagement and the use of technology for engagement between government and citizens In addition to the survey the project team engaged in workshops informal interviews and government public forums to understand the status of digital literacy civic literacy and responsiveness literacy After the baseline study needs assessment was conducted to explore the key needs related to the use of technology for citizen engagement and possible constraints This was more focused exercise in relation to the purpose of MobiSAM to provide platform for social accountability monitoring The purpose of this stage was to therefore explore the needs for digital literacy development and the feasibility of building digital literacy in the project implementation process This stage is not static and once off as demanddriven needs can emerge as the MobiSAM project is adopted in the context In this case needs assessment can be reintroduced in project activities to re evaluate existing digital literacy needs in the project Implementation This is the stage where the transfer of knowledge begins and resources flow between the source and recipient The project team acts as source of knowledge for developing digital literacy however they also become recipient of new knowledge from citizen and governments that shapes their activities to develop digital literacy for the context As recipient of knowledge they begin to understand protocol legislation accountability processes transparency requirements local culture and so on that govern the process of local citizen engagement An understanding of these aspects shapes their programme for guiding the development of digital literacy to effectively use MobiSAM platforms In this case government citizens and civil society become the source of knowledge transfer playing an interactive game of learning and informing The MobiSAM project team also played the role of facilitator in enabling an understanding of how to effectively integrate and use the MobiSAM platform This was applied through strategy formulation workshops with citizens and government separately and then jointly to manage conflicting views meetings with municipal management staff and CSO leadership engaging in the revision of the municipal communication strategy civic education and adaptive ICT training on how to use MobiSAM platforms An important aspect is that social ties begin to develop between source and recipient and stakeholders work towards mutual understanding of how MobiSAM can best work in Makana Municipality Szulanski articulates this as follows The transferred practice is often adapted to suit the anticipated needs of the recipient to preempt problems experienced in previous transfer of the same practice or to help make the introduction of new knowledge less threatening to the recipient Initial understanding and development of digital literacy is enabled during this stage of knowledge transfer Furthermore the project team begins to understand contextual dynamics of both government and citizens hence context literacy endogenous practice the competence or knowledge to interact and engage in these spheres Mansell The implementation stage stops when project beneficiaries begin to use the gained knowledge on digital literacy Rampup This is the stage when the recipients of knowledge begin to use the new knowledge in the context This was the stage that citizens began to see the value of the MobiSAM platforms and engage via the Facebook page email SMS and the MobiSAM website In relation to the citizen additional civic education workshops had to be held with civil society media local schools and development centres in Makana Municipality Furthermore the project had hired ward liaisons in the community to impart awareness and knowledge of MobiSAM and based on the trainthetrainer model train local community members in their wards to use the various platforms effectively The value of new initiative Page of Original Research Open Access can sometimes only be seen and understood from the perspective of common members of networked system whether it is the youth woman support networks or schools Therefore MobiSAM activities attempt to incorporate key actors involved in these networks in order to maximise on participation This has been very challenging process as the process of building digital literacy for DCE is often met with resistance and lack of resources to support development This is clearly evident from Figure which is map of reported issues the reported issues are centred on particular location in Makana Municipality more affluent areas which is closer to the centre of town and the local university It is important that unexpected problems or barriers are identified that hinder the alignment of transferred knowledge and expected performance of the adapted practices Szulanski This is no different for local government Local government staff strategised for the integration of MobiSAM in Makana Municipality and participated in workshop sessions to reengineer their existing processes to adapt better communication practice with MobiSAM This was successful among some municipal staff who confessed that they now saw the value of feedback in communicating with citizens based on the development of their digital literacy around government responsiveness Their original system identified in the initiation stage showed how broken their communication ecology was with lack of feedback culture and engagement with citizens Nonetheless MobiSAM was met with much resistance from some municipal staff requiring the MobiSAM project team to rethink their implementation approach to address the existing constraints Some social and organisational culture constraints may be beyond the scope of MobiSAM Source MobiSAM Website Active service delivery issues MobiSAM viewed June from FIGURE Map of reported service delivery issues in Makana MunicipalityPage of Original Research Open Access practices nonetheless formulating key partnerships with other government officials and CSOs may push for the transformation of current practice in the municipality In relation to building digital literacy this stage relates to engaged literacy development Integration This stage is reached when digital literacy is developed and institutionalised in government and civil society practice as well as becoming an embedded skill of active citizens Satisfactory results of the existence of digital literacy should begin to emerge Certain practices related to interaction with evidencebased data for citizen engagement and government responsiveness become associated with various actors departments and individuals As digital literacy showed initial progress in becoming embedded MobiSAM became formerly integrated into the municipality communication strategy The project team is always invited to participate in key strategic forums of the municipality as digitally literate government staff engage in discussions and practices around using MobiSAM and the data generated from it Citizens have also began to use MobiSAM as point of call for reporting issues perusing the digital platform for similarly reported issues to engage in discussion about them with an understanding of the severity of the issue Civil societies such as the Grahamstown Residents Association GRA Public Accountability Monitor PSAM and Black Sash BS now invite MobiSAM as strategic partner into their civic workshops The evidence gathered from the technology platforms is often used by the GRA to follow up on unaddressed issues or to lobby for key services Despite the many benefits of having reached level of digital literacy with some stakeholders there are still issues of stickiness that hinder the effectiveness of the process and call for continuous iterative approach building on the lessons learned from each of the stages of knowledge transfer Therefore this process should not be linear but lessons learned should feed into another staged iteration of initiation to explore emerged aspects of digital literacy and citizen engagement Table provides summary of the knowledge transfer process of digital literacy development in the MobiSAM DCE project Various practices emerged that can guide each stage of literacy development practices indicated in Table are suggestions but not limited to these as practitioners or researchers may apply different approaches within the constraints of the project and context Nonetheless this provides starting point from which to build on What was also identified in the knowledge transfer process was the digital literacy development focus at each stage of the transfer process In this case digital literacy developed through QuadrupleE process of explore enable engage and embed The transfer of knowledge is likely to experience what Szulanski refers to as internal stickiness which is based on the characteristics of knowledge transferred the source of the knowledge recipients of the knowledge Ajmal Koskinen and the context Ajmal Koskinen Yeh Lai Ho PadeKhene and Lannon relate this to the issue of power and political influence in DCE diverse stakeholder perspectives and conflicting views result in the need for ad hoc solutions as problems emerge in the transfer process Nonetheless Orlikowski argues that it is gradual process of developing knowhow in the transfer process so as to understand the origins of stickiness in order to work around them and maximise on digital literacy development The issues of stickiness are not foreign to the ICTD field and hence relate lot to Toyamas three differentials that influence digital implementation in developing countries see Table Project stakeholders need to be aware of these and mitigate their influence in the knowledge transfer process Conclusion The research study presents case for developing digital literacy in DCE initiatives This is pertinent as DCE has emerged as key tool in supporting twoway communication between citizens and government It also contributes to building evidencebased data that can be used to support social accountability and transparency practices The article identifies that DCE is not straightforward process where some factors that hinder progress relate to lack of effectively building digital literacy among citizens and TABLE comparison of

['Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit Tati Lathipatud Durriyah Muhammad Zuhdi Fakultas Ilmu Tarbiyah dan Keguruan Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Indonesia Corresponding author Tati Lathipatud Durriyah Email ABSTRACT Research found that many student teachers are active users of digital technologies yet they are reluctant to make use of digital technologies for literacy teaching purposes Efforts to prepare student teachers for technology integration are pressingly needed Also needed is data that informs us about student teachers participation engagement with digital technologies and how they might utilize those technologies for literacy teaching The article reports on classroom research project that explored Indonesian student teachers initial perception about the use of digital technologies for EFL teaching For one semester the first author taught course to group of student teachers at state Islamic university in Jakarta in which they learned conceptual and practical knowledge about digital technologies in teaching and learning The student teachers were tasked to explore digital technologies available and had to integrate those technologies into teaching units contained in junior high English textbook Popular digital technologies selected included Facebook blogs Skype and WhatsApp Each offers unique potential to facilitate and enhance language learning Student reflections provided insight into their considerations for their digital technology selections Key words Digital Literacy Qualitative Student Teachers EFL Indonesia INTRODUCTION Acquiring literacy is fundamental for ones development People whose literacy skills are developed are more likely to explore and reach their potential UNESCO The International Literacy Association ILA an authoritative world literacy organization publishes on their website definition of literacy Literacy is the ability to identify understand interpret create compute and communicate using visual audi ble and digital materials across disciplines and in any context The ability to read write and communicate connects people to one another and empowers them to achieve things they never thought possible para The statement highlights two important points First the lit eracy teaching currently needed should enable people to com municate and connect Second people currently use various modes of communication including text audio graph ics and video This literacy definition encompasses literacy engage mentalso an aspect of digital literacy as students engage with digital contexts eg digital technologies Literacy engage ment here is understood to be the manner in which students engage in learning participate using those contexts Hafner Chik Jones It is clear then that teaching literacy skills that enable people to communicate and connect through such modes is key that drives current literacy education Published by Australian International Academic Centre PTY LTD Copyright the authors This is an open access article under CC BY license students literacy skills are unfortunately not well developed USAID reported that many Indone sian students displayed low critical thinking ability they lacked the ability to reflect and evaluate information presented to them This ability is paramount for students to be academically and professionally advanced Spires Bart lett Spires and Bartlett contend that in an increasing ly digital environment students must acquire digital literacy skills that enable them to select and use digital tools that are suitable for their purposes Echoing ILA Spires and Bartlett view digital literacy as wideranging set of practices that enable students to create share and understand meaning and knowledge in digital environment According to ILAs report digital literacy tops the list as the most prescient topic to be addressed in literacy education The report surveyed and interviewed research ers and literacy educators from around the world The re port also noted that there should be more attention given to strategic efforts for excellent literacy education One of those efforts involves teacher preparation that equips student teachers with skills to foster students literacy development Specifically one that is concerned with digital technology To our knowledge studies that attempted to investigate Indonesian student teachers use of digital technology for teaching and learning are small in number and they tend to International Journal of Education Literacy Studies ISSN ARTICLE INFO Article history Received January Accepted July Published July olume Issue Conflicts of interest None Funding None IJELS be quite specific in terms of the use of digital technologies eg Rodliyah Our research is explorative in the sense that we asked student teachers about their preferred digital technologies when planning to teach We claim that there is large gap between the available research and our need to be informed about digital technology use among stu dent teachers Objectives and Research Questions In this research we sought to address question related to the digital technology use within teacher education pro gram We were interested in investigating the learning expe riences of student teachers enrolled in course titled Media and Language Learning The course goal was to educate stu dent teachers about teaching subject English that is in formed by digital literacy Specifically our research aimed to investigate the student teachers perception about the use of digital technologies as they learned about theories and prac tices related to the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning Our guiding questions were What kind of digital technologies would student teach ers select to integrate into their teaching plan What were their considerations when selecting digital technologies for teaching and learning Digital Literacy and Teacher Education Research on digital literacy is well documented eg Coiro et al Recent developments have provided us with information about some digital literacy roles in literacy ed ucation Major reports such as the Cambridge Assessment Report summarized several conclusions concerning digital literacy in literacy education First literacy education should encompass the teaching of print media literacy and digital technology Second literature is at the core of literacy teach ing and it should be taught within the context of digital dis course Cambridge Assessment These conclusions emphasize that digital literacy is vitally important skill that students in the digital age should acquire What counts as digital literacy Spires and Bartlett simplify the scope of digital literacy into three categories finding and utilizing digital content producing digital con tent and disseminating digital content These categories highlight complex skills and abilities that students must obtain Skills such as critical thought and value judgment are very important for locating and utilizing digital content Likewise creativity innovation and understanding of socio logical context are very critical for producing and dissemi nating digital contents number of studies have explored digital literacy in the context of teacher education PriceDennis and PriceDennis and colleagues investigated some ef forts to prepare student teachers to integrate technology into literacy teaching Their findings reveal gap between the availability and use of digital technologies in classrooms The sentiment is shared by literacy researchers with similar interests Bauer Kenton Doering Hughes Huff man Koc Bakir Lei Wright Wilson This gap in technology use is concerning when con sidering that technology is available and part of students daily lives Additionally lack of accommodation of digital technologies use in teacher education program will not help student teachers to imagine how pedagogy that involves digital technologies can be structured and implemented in an established learning environment classrooms Although limited in number available research notably demonstrates that student teachers tend to be more sensitive to the use of digital technologies when they are accustomed to and are active users of the digital technologies Collier Foley Mo guel Barnard Hundley Holbrook Williams Baumann We may conclude that what is pressing in promoting digital technologies in teacher education is the effort to instruct student teachers to learn about through and with technology Cervetti Damico Pearson including instruction on how to be active participant in digital literacy practices Hundley Holbrook Meanwhile other studies also present us with the possibility of managing an online learning environment Juzwik et al and its relation to promoting student teachers confi dence in writing skill Norman Spencer To summarize the aforementioned research has informed us that it is crucial for teachers to be active users of digital technologies in order to benefit from them Included in those benefits is the use of digital technologies within learning environment that enables student teachers to increase their confidence in literacy skill learning METHODS Context and Participants Our research utilized qualitative paradigm and took place within an undergraduate English education program at state affiliated Islamic university in Jakarta For one se mester the first author taught course called Media and Language Learning The enrolled student research par ticipants could be described as active users of leading social media platforms For instance quick survey conducted at the beginning of the course showed that all student teach er participants had Facebook accounts and were actively logged in All of them owned digital technology devices such as laptops and smartphones enabling them to access digital information and data using wireless network The Course and Data Sources The course content encompassed basic discussions of tech nology in teaching different kinds of technology and dig ital literacy and its teaching application The course aimed to promote development of Indonesian student teachers digital literacy In order to do that course goals empha sized building the student teachers conceptual and practi cal knowledge about teaching English through the use of modern technology To facilitate this process the student teachers were assigned the text Teaching English Language Learners Through Technology by Erben Ban and Castae da Each week they took turns leading the book Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit discussion Selected chapters from Dudeney Hockly and Pegrums Digital Literacies were also assigned and discussed to broaden the perspective about technology use in teaching that would include digital literacy especially the idea of creating and sharing digital contents The course as signments were directly tied to the use of media technology for language learning They included writing weekly reflec tive papers on the readings and classroom discussions The student teachers were assigned to expand teaching units by integrating digital technologies relevant to each unit Work ing in groups they used grade seven English textbook an official Kurikulum textbook to exercise their working understanding about technology and learning by way of in fusing relevant technologies into units of teaching contained in the textbook The students were encouraged to explore available and familiar technology and to make sense of how those technologies might be beneficial for learning All of these assignments were submitted to the instructor in both paper and electronic copies The copies become the data sources for this research Digital Literacy Focus Digital literacy in relation to the teaching of English in this research focused on the integration of digital technologies into language teaching Dudeney et al Hockly In Hocklys work entitled Digital Literacies What are They and Why Should We Care Hockly argues that it is impera tive for language teachers to teach media literacy skills and digital competencies digital literacy or an ability to effec tively make use of the technologies at our disposal para Beyond simply gaining practical technical skills Hockly asserts that digital literacy in EFL teaching will en able students to use and create digital products and connect to wider audiences of fellow digital readers and writers Data Analysis To analyze our data we followed tradition of Grounded Theory which enabled us to approach data organically and minimize certain theoretical assumptions We used Ground ed Theorys general principles as put forward by Strauss and Corbin Glesne of rereading the data sources for the identification of themes reanalyzing the data by continu ously comparing themes across data constant comparative method and then using open coding to identify themes and patterns of data Overall this process included four phases first compar ing results with emerging themes second testing and rede fining the themes third continuing to reduce the number of themes and fourth constructing explanatory theory position data In the first phase we categorized our coding following wide range of themes including the four language skills listening read speaking and writing and vocabulary teaching Second as we coded we learned that number of digital technologies were frequently found across the themes For instance Facebook was found in the themes of writing reading and vocabulary teaching We also collapsed the initial themes that separated technologies being used as tool for instruction and being used for learning activities instead we focused on describing activities that student teachers performed with digital technologies Therefore as result of reduction in the third phase we focused on the themes that specified explicitly the kinds of digital technol ogies that student teachers preferred in the activities within their lessons Finally we connected the themes with theo retical justification For instance in explaining the student teachers preference for learning in Facebook closed group space they used it as an electronic classroom that allows anyone to engage in active participation we referred to theory that highlights the importance of providing language learners with many opportunitiesspaces to use their lan guage productively and meaningfully Erben et al In every phase of data collection and analysis our goal was the data would present us literacy teaching that emerged from data sources collected from research participants Spe cifically we focused on digital literacy put forward earlier by Hockley that entails the ability to effectively make use of the technologies at our disposal para We want ed to know which of many accessible teaching technologies the student teachers preferred as shown within their lesson plans We then narrated the final themes while guided by these research questions What kind of digital technologies would student teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan and What were their considerations when selecting digital technologies for teaching and learning RESULTS The main themes that we highlighted from our data involved digital technology use for teaching More specifically our data suggest that the digital technologies appeared to have great potential for teaching English language skills In show ing the findings we discuss the amounts of data that corre spond to digital technologies being selectedanswering the question What kind of digital technologies would student teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan Embed ded in the discussion are student teachers considerations for selecting those technologies answering the question What were their considerations when selecting digital technolo gies for teaching and learning Our findings discussion will follow the following order Facebook closed groups blogs Skype and other oIPs and WhatsApp Facebook Closed Group Of all the features in Facebook Facebook closed group was the student teachers most preferred digital technology Creating closed group is the first step to transform Face book into space for teaching and learning activities Many student teachers in this research claimed that Facebook closed group is an ideal place to facilitate eclassrooms as the platform enables students to have interactive discussions According to our student teachers Facebook closed group offers experiences found in typical online classrooms online class environment They are free to post from IJELS wide variety of digital formats such as videos and news links They can invite others for discussion in the comment section Similar to regular class students in Facebook group can conveniently perform activities such as getting information from students disseminating information and reviewing books with ease Students just need to copy link and share it to group wall Images videos and video links from Youtube can all be posted and all of these can be used for classroom discussion Students can also post an elec tronic document for example as part of class assignment submission they can submit their assignments by upload ing electronic copies onto group wall They would then tag the teacher to notify him or her that the assignment has been submitted Similarly teachers can also tag any students whose assignments have not been submitted Many student teachers found this seemingly transparent process exciting and motivating For one they are able to read classmates work Furthermore they enjoyed participating in the Face book group since it opened wide opportunities for students to comment and to give likes thumbsup icon They argued that teachers leave benefit from having opportunities available to provide additional teaching resources beyond the textbook by sharing digital content to Facebook group wall stu dent teacher succinctly stated these aforementioned potential benefits of Facebook closed group as follows Facebook closed group as an online platform can be used as place to share materials discussions between teachers students and colleagues collect assignments and other activities The student teachers felt that Facebook groups most useful feature lies in its ability to provide space for inter active discussion One type of interactive discussion they planned to do in Facebook group would look like the fol lowing the teacher writes on group wall questions related to song and students then comment on these questions the song should have been played earlier in classroom In an other case the teacher uploads set of images with differ ent expressions which then students will comment on with narrative descriptions for each one of those images Other interactive discussions may occur when students exchange comments or give feedback on assignments that their class mates upload on the group wall Students will gain benefits from both exercising their writing skills as well as learning from classmates For teachers activities such as these will allow them to monitor students writing skill development Continuing the example activity above student teachers in this study planned an activity involving writing descrip tion about range of different expressions They would then ask specifically for students to write descriptive piece using adjectives Other students would have chance to comment on each adjectival description and state which one they found well written Student teachers felt that this peer commenting and liking would motivate their students to do their best in order to earn positive feedback In short student teachers in this study appeared to be convinced that Facebook group is good space for interactive activities Similarly the stu dent teachers suggested that the use of Facebook group to enhance student learning could be maximized Most specifi cally they planned to use online groups to extend the limited hours of classroom instruction In their teaching plan they assigned after school online work to maintain the interactive discussion about topics yet to be masteredcomprehended by students Student teachers also expressed feeling less intimidated within the Facebook group and they felt this more com fortable space increased their potential for learning They reflected on their own experiences as active Facebook users and noted that they could express their opinions more freely there than in typical classroom As one student teacher re marked We prefer Facebook because in here students tend to be active and free to express an opinion when asked by teachers Many confessed that they often feel too embar rassed or intimidated to share opinions in class One student teacher claimed that Facebook has an ability to encourage students so that they feel comfor table to express opinions without fearing of making mistakes Blogs Blogs weblogs or online journals were quite popular among student teachers Many maintained blog and wrote regularly about variety of topics that interested them They seemed to nurture their writing habit on blog so it is not surprising that blogs potential for writing skill develop ment appeared obvious for many of them Creating blog involves establishing an account with blogging platform Many student teachers mentioned Blogspotcom Wordpress com and Wattpad as popular sites in Indonesia Some of the writingrelated activities they planned to make out included explor ing different genres of writing Student teachers discussed having their students study the descriptive writing genre by writing about their favorite singers Other genre writing such as poetry could be based upon theme of their choice such as parents friends and teachers Student teachers also planned to ask students to complete an interactive dialogue activi ty on blog First students would write dialogue from picture depicting settings characters or an activity They would then write their version of dialogue on their own blog Later students would visit their classmates blogs and leave comments suggestions and perhaps alternative dialogues The students could use classmates feedback and comments to revise their writing Another interactive writing idea was to have students develop letter for correspondence to classmate letter writing Unlike the previous activity students would publish revised letter on their blog They would address it to classmate whom they intend to become letter recipient Student teachers also proposed blog activity for reading and writing connection Lee The planned teaching process would begin with students responding to reading Through the written summarizing or retelling student com prehension would be apparent and their writing progress within the blog posts would be evident Their gradual writing process would be documented on the blog from beginning to final draft In this case documenting their writing process on blog would enable students to have firsthand experience of writing as process and give them control and responsi bility for their writing process sense of writing ownershipDigital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit Including blogs in their teaching plans may seem natural as the student teachers have already used blogs to write and document their thoughts and feelings When blogging they include hashtags defined by MerriamWebster web dictio nary as word or phrase preceded by the symbol that clas sifies or categorizes the accompanying text Incorporating hashtags within these digital platforms such as Wattpad gives them sense of connection to others who have simi lar interests Clicking on hashtags takes them to other blogs where they are able to learn and be inspired by other peo ples writing Having personal space through blog and at the same time wanting to connect with others seemed to dominate the student teachers preference to integrate blog technology into teaching plan Skype Skype and other similar oIPs oice over Internet Protocol digital technology used for live verbal communication via the Internet is popular in Indonesia The student teachers in this study identified Skypes potential for learning espe cially as tool to exercise students oral English proficiency Erben et al Categorized as synchronous technology Skype needs an Internet connection to function An ideal use of Skype for learning is an activity that happens in realtime live where being spontaneous is part of the learning pro cess as with speaking skills The student teachers felt Skype would work well as tool for oral English proficiency prac tice with peers Using Skypeinstalled smartphone that connects to the Internet students would be able to conve niently practice with partners One student regular user of Skype and similar oIPs cited the popularity of Skype and its potential for learning when endorsing the practice For teaching speaking skill suggest Skype and Google hang outs since these two are commonly used in Indonesia When was in high school my friend and often used Skype and Google hangouts for video call think they are also sui table for teacher to use the tools both as training and assessing speaking skill Skype is also commonly used for conferencing The stu dent teachers preferred Skype technology for its ease of in stallation on personal technology devices like laptops and smartphones In addition to its clear voice quality they ar gued that Skype has features that enable them to have con ference in group group conference WhatsApp An instant messaging platform WhatsApp popularity is credited to its affordability immediacy flexibility of space could contain long text and sense of community Church Oliveira These factors about WhatsApp were confirmed in the present study as student teachers explained how they planned to take advantage of using WhatsApp for teaching and learning purposes First they re ferred to group feature in WhatsApp that allows them to communicate and disseminate information to invited mem bers typically created exclusively for range of different interests WhatsApp group makes it possible for members to distribute documents video clips photos and links to oth er sites or information and even to broadcast news to much wider audiences The following quote is from student teacher describing how she planned to infuse WhatsApp into classroom activity teacher asks students to go out classroom to find room similar to the description in the book or that have been discussed Students will take note what they will be findings Working in group they are free to look for room with sui table description During the search ing time the teacher and students will be connected via WhatsApp in one of their digital devices smartphone or Ipad Using WhatsApp students will share what they have found images and description After the time is up and images being searched are collected students will write description about each one of the pictures The use of WhatsApp in the above activity is not only as an immediate communication tool during dynamic group activity but also as detailed and transparent process during the time students are con figuring their understanding learn ers community Student teachers enjoyed WhatsApp for its intimacy and for the communal experience They maintained that they formed sense of community when they were in WhatsApp group This sense of community and intimacy within WhatsApp differed from their Facebook group ex perience where they felt less privacy However the student teachers agreed that WhatsApp carries some limitations for learningmore so than other technologies like Facebook for instance In WhatsApp users have to download videos within messages in order to watch them this is not the case with Facebook where users can watch videos instantly from the Facebook page Student teachers also found WhatsApp message threads somewhat overwhelming and hard to fol low They were skeptical about using WhatsApp for class room discussion and considered Facebook group to be more preferable and conducive for learning DISCUSSIONS This research sought to explore Indonesian student teachers initial perceptions about digital technologies for teaching and learning Our report focused on digital technologies that they selected to include in their teaching plans as well as their ideas for including them When selecting those digital technologies the student teachers referred to their personal experiences when explaining what made these technologies potential tools for teaching and learning In other words these digital technologies emerged organically among these research participants For discussions we will focus on con necting the findings with research about potential digital technologies that confirms our exploratory research findings We intend to show that the potential of the student teacher selected digital technologies has also been found in other research contexts and approaches beyond the present study The student teachers inclusion of Facebook in their teaching plans reveals information that echoes the analysis advanced by Manca and Ranieri two Italian schol ars who conducted metareview analysis on the use of IJELS Facebook for learning We will use their review as refer ence in discussing our Facebook findings Facilitating eclassrooms Our findings confirmed Manca and Ranieris review on studies about the way in which Facebook group and some of its identifiable characteristics are useful as learning space The characteristics that they identified in clude being able to share learning resources to leave com ments to write on walls and to initiate discussions The fact that Facebook group provided features such as these deems it good space for learning Having interactive discus sion To some extent this finding echoes Manca and Ran ieris conclusion that Facebook groups use for learning is overwhelmingly for interactive discussions Furthermore they have an interesting finding that in having an interactive discussion in Facebook group students appear to bene fit from learning from each other mutual learning which makes them more aware of exercising critical thinking Providing safe and less intimidating space This confirms Manca and Ranieris research review which concludes that Facebook is one digital technology that is able to provide supports and facilities to learn as while on Facebook stu dents tend to freely participate discuss and share informa tion They also tend to be more open to discussion Addition ally in some cases English language learners participated and interacted more online than in traditional classrooms where they tend to be passive due to language barriers and social pressures Our blog findings especially when pertaining to the stu dent teachers suggestion that they had more sense of own ership echo the research finding by Ducate and Lomicka Ducate and Lomickas research showed that blog appears to be helpful skill practice for students who are learning to write in foreign language Their findings about the advantages of writing on blog are especially evident in providing learners strong sense of belonging and writing creativity ownership and creativity Ducate and Lomicka also point to other benefits of blogs for students students appear to be comfor table on their blog experimenting with language use crucial factor in mastering new language In short writing on blog gave students space where they felt more relaxed in experimenting and exercising expres sions while learning foreign language At the same time though blog is by default public space unless the set ting is changed to private In this case foreign language learner who feels comfor table writing on blog is somewhat connected to teachers and classmates who are able to leave comments and offer suggestions This finding is similar to the present study about including tags hashtags in blog posting in order to connect with others who share interests The student teachers in the study noted Skypes poten tial benefit for developing students verbal abilityas in this case oral English proficiency question whether Skype presents itself as beneficial for language learning was ex amined in an experimental research by Japanese researchers Kato Spring and Maori where they assigned con trol and experimental groups of students who learned for eign languages English and Japanese The researchers used Skype as support to provide meaningful experience in an authentic environment In using Skype both groups had na tive partners in respective language American students with Japanese native partners and Japanese with American part ners with whom they practiced using structures and activi ties developed by the researchers Their findings showed sta tistically significant improvement of communication skills listening and speaking skills in both groups of language learning students When they communicated they tended to talk longer and were able to react to the target language being spoken Especially with American students studying Japanese the improvement showed in their ability to speak with more varied vocabularies and longer sentences In contrast control students of both language groups who re ceived no Skype practices showed little improvement Also their qualitative findings explanation is quite convincing in affirming the benefits of using Skype as medium for lan guage learning development This studys student teachers appreciated WhatsApps ability to offer sense of immediacy and intimacy in learn ing activity To some extent WhatsApp serves as window that gives us insights about the student teachers personal agency in the learning process as well as insights about their social interactions and collaborations with others Dabbagh Kitsantas This is perhaps what British researchers OHara and colleagues called process of doings in WhatsApp where members build connections by shar ing brief notes and short narrations and sharing light mo ments by communicating thoughts feelings news photos videos and links OHarra and colleagues contend that the use of WhatsApp for such activities fits the description of dwelling place in which WhatsApp is digital platform where peoplemembers enjoy being involved in dynam ic discussions that cover wide range of topics and inter estsdwelling is not simply place but doing and needs to be seen as constituted by things done and felt endlessly in the momentbymoment of togetherness and directionality CONCLUSIONS Earlier we cited English teaching specialist Nicky Hockly who insisted that English teachers should incorporate digital literacy competency in digital technologies use into teaching Our semester long data revealed insights pointing to number of advantages as perceived by the Indonesian EFL student teachers The student teachers in this research agreed that digital technologies like Facebook closed group offer inviting environments for students to participate stu dents feel safe to share thoughts in Facebook closed group Classrooms that integrate digital technologies have good chance to foster students ownership in developing writing skill blogs and to develop spontaneous and authentic oral communication Skype Finally student teachers felt that the ability of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to offer intimacy and immediacy provides the potential to nurture dynamic community of learners where feelings of together ness and accessibility are expected As the authors final note the digital technologies mentioned above are categorized as synchronoustechnology requiring users to be online at the Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit same time in order to communicate in real time Erben et al This online connectivity requirement may be an issue for students in Indonesia who like the student teachers in this research would likely be dependent on the free wireless network available on schooluniversity campus Otherwise they would have to ration their use of limited Internet data from smartphones We are suggesting this as point of con sideration for teachers who are interested in exploring digital technology integration into their teaching Finally the present study limits its discussion on student teachers engagement with digital technologies for teaching Therefore we decided that concerns related to data privacy and online security were beyond the scope of the current discussion ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research for this paper was supported by Pusat Penelitian dan Penerbitan Puslitpen Universitas Islam Negeri Jakarta REFERENCES

the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan Keywords Jordan Digital Media Literacy Arab Education Technology Introduction The concept of media literacy is not new but is definitely important among the researchers in the fields of education and the media Potter Several Western educat ional systems developed media literacy as way to enable citizens to achieve informed interactions with media messages Alhamadani Along with technological advancements came the concept of digital media literacy that emerged as broader and mor comprehensive Volume Issue December PP DOI

understanding of basic skills such as reading writing understanding and using modern technologies Pa rk Burford Digital skills have now become necessary to equip ommunity members with basic skills that will enable them to solve digital issues in their environment and the world at large Digital media literacy refers to having the ability to cr eate and use technologies to participate in and contribute to social cultural political and economic life It includes understanding the impact of recent technologies on society understanding and having the ability to manage digital identities fittingl and having the ability to find organize understand evaluate analyze and cr eate digital information Hobbs Digital literacy involves critically participating in technology and developing social awareness However variety of things together with business agenda and cultural understandings will form how technology is employed to convey information Assal Having the ability to speak and represent data is entirely different in numerous contexts and to different audiences for example visual audio or matter modes This involves finding and choosing relevant information critically evaluating and re contextualizing data and is underpinned by an understanding of the cultural and social contexts during which this takes place Digital literacy provides the citizens with the flexibility to require advantage of the wealth of recent and rising opportunities related to digital technologies while additionally remaining aware of what the different challenges technology will give In short di gital literacy is the savvyness that permits to participate in the digital realm meaningfully and safely In order for the desired benefit of digital media literacy to be realized it is necessary to possess the skills that constitute the measurement to ols for the effectiveness of digital media literacy for individuals Digital media literacy skills are extensions of media literacy skills where the essence of the vocation and competence are to equip citizens the ability to search for the right informatio and using those information efficiently and positively Individuals need skills to get good understanding of how to create knowledge express reality and engage in civic activities and social work Hobbs When measuring media literacy competenc conventional definitions

generic conventions design features and rhetorical devices It also involves knowledge of production processes and of patterns of ownership and institutional control and an ability to critique media for example in terms of the accuracy or reliability of their representations of the real wor ld Finally create involves the ability to use the media to produce and communicate ones own messages whether for purposes of self expression or in order to influence or interact with others However with the inclusion of digital media the kill of production or creation become significant Media

Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved media creation is the main characteris tic that distinguishes digital literacy from media literacy Park In UNESCO concluded that the most common digital literacy abilities are awareness access evaluation and creation This statement is agreed by scholars who have considered the se skills as measurements of digital media literacy competency Assal Fedorove Hallaq Jordanians are very much exposed to different types of media With population of million people there are thirty eight TV channels thirty nine radio stations and about thirty newspapers daily and weekly Media Commission According to the Jordanian Department of Statistics social media usage has reached With this widespread media usage particularly online media the Jor danian audiences are not solely exposed to smart data they are conjointly subjected to the risks of harmful usage and content This might embody violence extremism cultural invasion and incorrect conventional pictures regarding status race or gender additionally to the industrial nature of media messages Darweesh The level of digital media literacy in Jordan has been developed in recent years there is positive move towards educating the Jordanian people about digital media Ashdiefat Khasawneh Melki Jordan Media Institute JMI is probably the countrys biggest proponent for media literacy JMI is freelance media institute that aims to enhance the output of Jordanian media and to promote the name and image of the media profession domestically and regionally by establishing medium that helps to circularize the ideas of media literacy JMI In this paper we will revie the digital media literacy in Jordan and we will describe the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan

recent developments of digital media literacy in Jordan Finally in section we will provide the conclusion and recommendation Methodology This paper is conceptual in na ture However the historical analysis provided was done through careful reading of literatures on media literacy in the Arab world generally and in Jordan more specifically This study is also part of the first authors PhD thesis in which he had conduct ed multiple interviews with relevant parties such as media experts and members of the Jordan Media Institute JMI Therefore the discussion provided is also based on deliberate input from experts in the area who are very familiar with the media and educ ation landscape in Jordan History of Digital Media Literacy in The Arab World and Jordan The Arab world neglected media literacy for long time which led to negative consequences that exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic disturbances AbuFadil described the reason for neglecting digital media literacy to the Arab higher education systems which have been suffered from the absence of facilities and equipment that require digital literacy Moreover the individual academic initiati ves that called for media literacy in Arab universities have been met with opposition and lack of support from traditional academics while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of Media and digital literacy Melki and Maaliki Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Furthermore media literacy is at the bottom of the list of Arab priorities as it reflects the state of the media itself which is tool of power and indicates lack of respect for the press and its lack of prestige and this is reflected in the degree of credibility thus it serves the interest of the ruling elites Saleh However digital media literacy has been included in the curricula of number of Egyptian universities since in addition to WeChat organizing workshops for final year students at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University on media literacy Tayie In Palestine the concept of media literacy was new concept at the level of civil society so efforts were limited to some initiatives activities and projects that have increased since Nuseibeh and Abu Arqoub At the begin ning of the new millennium nterest in digital media literacy began in Jordan through some official Jordanian initiatives to develop digital literacy such as the Minis try of Education training te achers to use computers by obtaining the International Computer Driving License ICDL program as well as the INTEL Education for the Future program hoping to provide teachers With computer skills and employing them in the ducational process and using them in obtaining media content that affects digital media literacy Olaimat The Ministry of Education in cooperation with several bodies including the Center for the Protection and Freedom of Journalists launched th Education Through Journalism program which was considered the first training in media literacy in which schools invest on daily newspapers to teach many educational materials such as history geography science reading civic education creatio and expression to group of school students The exercises and activities were are carried out inside the classroom at the rate of one session per week to enable students to keep pace with the developments of the age and the knowledge revolution and to creat spirit of dialogue and interaction with various community issues With the aim of training Jordanian youth providing them with knowledge and skills to deal with the media facing illiteracy in information and communication technology and promoting fr eedom of expression the Jordanian National Committee for Education Culture and Science in cooperation with the UNESCO Office in Amman and the Arab Women Media Center implemented an exploratory project entitled Introducing the concept of media literacy in Jordanian schools With funding from the Swedish government in Assal The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations UNAOC and Google in cooperation with the World Bank Institute held training workshop in entitled Digital Tools or News Gathering and Cross Cultural Reporting at the Jordan Media Institute in Amman UNAOC Durra which was considered step towards Introducing the concept of digital literacy in Jordan The International Center for Journalists organized training course at the Jordan Media Institute in on the use of electronic tools in public service issues which dealt with preparing press reports building electronic news websites media ethics in the electronic age and social media and how to em ploy This is in its coverage of result related to public services with the participation of media professionals and journalists from several Arab countries Jordan Media Institute Accordingly it appears that the stages by which the adoption of th digital media literacy concept by Jordanian official institutes was not part of clear process and policy based on strategy for developing this concept and benefiting from it while not being adopted by the Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Jordanian government and placing it among its priorities during the period before They were just initiatives by international institutions and Jordanian civil society institutions Challenges That Face the Implementation of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan Recently the concept of digital lit eracy has entered which is broader and more comprehensive than media literacy but it is not substitute for it Rather it needs broader awareness of basic skills such as reading writing understanding and accessing new technologies Park The state of digital media literacy in the Arab world including Jordan is weak as interest in it comes at the bottom of the list of priorities for Arab countries noting that it reflects the state of media itself Saleh On other words the digit al media literacy in the Arab world is still in the initial foundational stages Melki The challenges facing digital media literacy are summarized by several reasons including political economic and social culture For instance The Arab wor ld including Jordan neglected digital media literacy for long time which led to negative consequences that exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic unrest Abu Fadil Many obstacles stand in front of the spread of media and digital literacy such as the structure of the media which in turn does not provide the opportunity for sufficient number of voices to participate and the various political and social situations restrict the flow and availability of information in addition the imbalance in the ability of individuals to communicate their opinions and voices Assal Among the factors affecting Digital Media Literacy in Jordan are the economic weakness and the high costs of production and publishing with the lack of financial support provided for the development of human resources and education on which media literacy depends on Saleh Moreover Arab higher education systems suffer from the absence of facilities and equipment that require digital literacy nd individual academic initiatives that called for media literacy in Arab universities were met with opposition and lack of support from traditional academics while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of digital media literacy In addition it does not feel that it should be integrated into the school curriculum Melki and Maaliki Although Jordanian youth have the skill and intelligence to use digital technologies they mostly still unaware of the dangers of social medi and that most of these young people are ignorant of the Internet thr eat such as privacy threat espite their extensive use of social media they cannot be described as fruitful producers Consequently Jordanian youth who used the nternet have suffere from the lack of effective application of blogs Like young bloggers in many other developing countries Mohamed they predominantly blogged about entertainment and light news indicating the lack of their awareness regarding the power of these mean in influencing social and political views Melki Despite the challenges the application of digital media literacy in Jordan has witnessed remarkable developments during the recent period and this will be discussed in the next section Develop ment of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan Recently digital media literacy has been developed remarkably as these developments were represented in several stages the beginning of which was in when the Jordanian Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved academics became aware and interested in the concept of digital media literacy and they pressured the politicians to pay closer attention to this concept In response new researches and studies were published to delineate and discuss the concept of digital media literacy Jordanian academics were focused on identifying the tools that individuals must possess to qualify them to interact with the media in positive way For instance Ash diefat Khasawneh studied the extent to which Jordanian school students possess the concept of digi tal media literacy which gave simplified picture of the scene Assal studied the extent of parents awareness of digital media literacy and the importance of this concept to them because of its potential Subsequently the UNESCO Amman office aunched project to support the media in Jordan with funding from the European Union starting from until and the project included developing media education capabilities UNESCO In addition to this the Jordan Media Institute in part nership with UNESCO launched the Media and Information Education Project in Jordan in May which comes within the main project to support the media in Jordan which UNESCO began implementing in with funding from the European Union Jordan Media Institute The project came in two phases the first included the institutes development of Jordanian public policy paper in the field of media and information educatio in educational institutions The paper analyze the universities curricula and the extent to which they contain media literacy concepts The paper suggested strategy that will work to introduce these concepts while the second phase introduced the concept of Media education in educational curricula within the framework of coop eration with relevant parties that included the Ministry of Education and the Jordanian universities Among others this Initiative wanted to train male and female teachers on media and information literacy skills so that they can transfer the necessary kn owledge to students of grades seven eight and nine in number of schools Jordan Media Institute In the Jordan Media Institute launched the Jordanian Media Credibility Observatory Akeed with an important role in providing recipients with digital media literacy skills and enhancing th eir presence among individuals The observatory contributed by verifying and monitoring media content published in the Jordanian media to enhance the quality of information by stressing on the elements of object ivity redibility and accuracy It also proposed for awareness be imparted to Jordanians so that they can verify hose elements in the messages they receive Akeedjo The objectives of the observatory reinforce the objectives of the existence of digital media literacy by protecting individuals and groups from the negative and unethical influences that may exist in the media content It also enhances the accessibility skill of the recipient by assigning the human right to knowledge by being able to achieve objecti vity and separate between news and advertisements between facts and speculation and the separation of information facts on the one hand and imagination and emotions on the other hand and it also contr ibutes to providing students and journalists with the tools necessary to enhance future media education programs Durra In the Jordanian government adopted the policy paper on digital media literacy that was drafted by the Jordan Media Instit ute in partnership with the European Union and UNESCO Followed by training for school and Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved university students on digital media literacy concepts through several training programs funded by external donors and most notably UNESCO Most recently while be ing affected by the global Corona pandemic the government has developed through the Ministry of Culture an executive plan for the National Initiative for the Promotion of Media and Information literacy for the years Because of the dire ne ed to depend on digital technologies caused by the pandemic the Ministryn develop ed work program to improve societys ability to deal with information sources news and digital media tools The strategic objective of the plan is to integrate media and informational literacy concepts and skills into the Jordanian educational system publish them in schools and universities incorporate the activities of cultural and youth institutions and civil society institutions and spread awareness of them through he media and in the public sphere According to the general policy paper presented by the Jordanian government these are the main reasons why digital media literacy is societal necessity in Jordan First Knowledge Transfer Tool Digital Media literacy is tool for developing and reforming education and tool for transferring knowledge through technology oday he use of information and communication technology ICT is the most prominent and important tool in increasing access to education raising the quality of education using advanced teaching and learning methods improving learning outcomes and reforming educational systems management UNESCO Second Digital Media Literacy is Considered Means of Social Integration It can be point ed out that digital media literacy is an effective tool that improves opportunities for social harmony and opportunities for societal understanding and understanding as the press and radio were used in early periods in the reproduction of more integrated societies that agreed on common large goals without exceeding the value of diversity for example as happened in the Malaysia Mohamed Contemporary Jordanian society is now very diverse mainly due to the modern formation of society and the emergenc of the state The waves of refugees that have not stopped over the course of six decades have increased society diversification and although the state and society have been able to digest this diversity and reproduce it in many stations Jordan still ne eds to a greater extent in depth efforts in support of social integration processes bridging gap and some aspects of fragility Thus communication technology can assist Jordanians to beco me more integrated by sharing and expressing through digital and social media Third Bridging the Political and Social Participation Gap Learning the skills of sharing information and producing and sharing media content is the basic feature of the communication and informat ion revolution and the events and transformations that the world is witnessing in the last decade confirm that this pattern of participation is contributing to determining the level content and size of participation that individuals practice in various aspects of life foremost of which is social and political participation As is well known participation is the solid foundation for development and modernization when the responsibility base expands The quality of dealing with information and news improves opportunities for political participation whether elect oral participation or participation in public affairs in addition to the role of digital media education in improving Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved citizens ability to accept equality and seek it specifically between ender the empowerment of women and strengthening the participat ion of special groups Digital media education today defines this way in which more generations can be brought up ready for positive and productive participation thanks to the cognitive and cultural cultivation of participation based on evaluation selec tion of ideas and critical thinking Jordan suffers from multi faceted participation crisis whether in the political or socio economic dimensions evidenced by the weak electoral participation that did not exceed in the Eighteenth Council elect ions The gender gap in womens participation rates appears more obvious and embarrassing as the rate of Jordanian womens economic participation in the labor market is still low and does not exceed compared with at the Arab point and at the global level and weak and distorted participation extends to other sectors such as work Volunteering and non profit work as this sector only accounts for compared to of the global average Jordanian Department of Statistics Fourth ationalize Societal Culture in Confronting Extremism and Hate Speech Digital media has become one of the open sources today that allows participation for young people untried and old and at time when the mass media and new information sources along with the traditional media have come to dominate wide area of individuals times they have been transformed by the political conflict in the Middle East and North Africa regions And others to effective platforms for spreading extremism and spreading hate speech as many reports indicate that these means have become trap for hunting young people by terrorist organizations in addition to their role in spreading extremist ideas and creating followers for them Therefore Jordanian youth find themselves in the midst of torrent of information flow and at time when traditional educational institutions deny them expression and traditional media do not give them real attention young people find the new media of expression available on digita media specifically social media an escape from exclusion and marginalization Its ability does not depend on the inexpensive means it provides and without direct censorship but rather allows anonymity which has opened the way to anomalous expressions such as expressions of cultural and verbal violence and hates speech on the one hand and extremist religious and political discourse Digital media literacy contributes to large extent to developing the capabilities of individuals to examine evaluate accept or reject media messages as what media literacy provides makes young people and new youths more immune to political and ideological propaganda at the forefront of which is the distinction between messages with political and ideological goals and news Impartial information makes the recipients more alert and aware of extremist messages In order to benefit from the integration of digital media education plan had to be developed Implementation of the national initiative that according to the Mi nister of Culture Twissi includes four areas which are the Schools Univesrities youth and cultural institutions and civil society and the public sphere in cities Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Area Schools It includes training activities and access to about of the Ministry of Education schools in the Kingdoms governorates within directorates of education and training male and female teachers and the introduction of digital media literacy concepts and skills to the educational curricula in the concerned classes and ensuring their sustainability reviewing them and developing student activities guides specialized in digital media education For students of basic education and establishing student clubs specialized in this field Area Unive rsities It aims to build the capacities of group of faculty members in Jordanian universities and to invite universities to offer specialized courses in digital media education and the establishment of university student clubs and parallel activities the field of media and information education This goal includes establishing student clubs in the field of media and informational education and working with teacher training colleges to offer educational programs in media and informatics education Area Youth and Cultural Institutions It aims to train and build capacity for members of the youth centers of the Ministry of Youth and the cultural bodies of the Ministry of Culture in all parts of the Kingdom and to enable group of youth centers and young women and cultural bodies to develop units for digital media awareness and the production of media and information content Area Civil Society and The Public Sphere in Cities The plan aims to administer sub grants targeting group of civil society institutions interested in launching new and innovative initiatives in the fields of media and information education under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and the Office of the Minister of State for Media Affairs and the implementation of awareness campaigns to spread the concepts of media education And informatics through group of public service media and the creation of digital platform for free education and training Conclusion and Recommendations In short we have explicated the challenges and development of di gital media literacy in Jordan he sequence of entering the concept of digital media literacy Jordan was reviewed and the challenges that faced Jordan to apply the concepts of digital media literacy were presented For instance the digital media literacy programs that were implemented were financed and supported by external institutions in addition to the challenge of cultural awareness among young people in dealing with digital media correctly and in produc tive way was constituted as an obstacle for the digital media literacy in Jordan The political challenges also clearly affected the progress of the development of digital media literacy through the various media outlets that represent the decision makers opinions and control what is presented As for recent years specifically since government interest in the concept of digital media literacy became apparent through practical steps that were manifested by the introduction of training programs in sch ools and universities and the development of strategic plan for digital media literacy In response to the analyses provided the au thors recommend for the Jordanian authorities to further enhance their digital media initiatives by adopting the following Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Establishing clear digital media literacy curriculum in schools and universities as separate and independent curriculum to be taught in theoretical and practical way and to be designed locally in Jordan to comply with local culture and cu stoms The teachers and trainers of digital media literacy must be specialized in digital media to provide content related to digital media literacy in professional and beneficial way Disseminating media messages through various media outlets explaining the importance of digital media literacy Which includes understanding media contemporary communication news literacy information literacy digital citizenship to create state of public trust and cognitive immunization in the face of rumors and misinformation and this perspective is committed to promoting the principles of human rights freedom expression and gender justice The paper concludes by confirming that the potential of digital media literacy in Jordan is very positive If the government and the relevant authorities maintain their commitment to realize the strategic plans that are already in place it wont be long before Jordanians become savvy technology users and Jordan will become the leader on digital media literacy especi ally in the Arab world The authors also propose for more studies to be conducted to understand how digital media literacy can be made more effective and relevant when it is studied within the context of particular culture and socio political backgrounds Such studies can provide more avenues for comparing the applicability of different digital media literacy methods and modules References AbuFadil Torrent Grizzle Opportunities for media and information literacy in the Middle East and North Africa The

data suggests the feasibility of text or voicebased interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southern Tanzania but there was less readiness for

use of bundles both of which require menubased interactions with phones suggest that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data USSD assessments or interv entions may be feasible Potential applications could include short questionnaires for data collection or monitoring Due to observ ed variations in phone access and ownership it is likely that any mobile phonebased interv entions will be delivered to shared phones for some participants This findingmay be of relevance to studies involving sensiti ve health topics eg HIVAIDS and other infectious diseases intimate partner violence According to our data the population in the Mtw ara region are relati vely smartphonenai ve compared to some other Tanzanian cities like DaresSalaam and Arusha where netw ork infrastructure has been previously reported Smartphonebased interv entions may be possible in Mtw ara but may require larger financial investments for the provision of smartphones to participants as well as higher training needs to facilitate their use We did not formally assess whether mobile netw orks in the Mtw ara region would be able to support broad use of smartphones This study is subject to several limitations First only women who had access to mobile phone were enrolled for the survey Our study therefore excludes women from families that do not have access to mobile phone Literature suggests that women from socioeconomically disadv antaged families are more likely to lack mobile phone access Such women may be more vulnerable and could potentially benef it more from interv entions promoting health information and health service use Second the selected facilities were within kilometers of Mtw ara the urban regional capital and commercial center Generalizability of the study findings is limited to the specif ic study area in late as mobile phone use and ownership characteristics may vary in other regions and is likely to increase over time Third the study provides only conte xtual information for the design of interv entions qualitati ve work concerning end user perceptions on feasibility and acceptability should complement the design and implementation of specif ic digital health interv entions In conclusion study findings suggest high feasibility of text voice or USSDbased interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southerly Tanzania The use of social media and internet among pregnant women is limited Future studies may use this study findings to track growth in mobile phone ownership and changes in use patterns among

say that toddlers are nuts about YouTube would be an understatement Kumar One in three teens lose sleep over gadgets social media Dutt Social media and technology are not always portrayed in bad light There were articles about using social media forassignments and exam preparation Pednekar experts wanting to include it in school curriculum Pednekar but positive or even more re ective stories are harder to come by Perhaps the older generation mirrors its struggles and anxieties of navigating through the complex web of social media on young people and their protective instinct comes to the foreChildren are considered vulnerable and in need of protectionacross almost all disciplines However young people engagement with digitalsocial media is very different fromthat of adults Children practices online have evolved differently because they are often described as digital natives Burn et al Of course the impact of the COVID related lockdown subsequent to March has shifted perspectives considerably in relation to some of thesedebates with focus returning once more in the populardiscourse to accessibility and digital literacy and sideliningconcerns around screen time and other related debates In this paper we share insights from indepth personal interviews with community leaders from civil society researchand advocacy as well as professionals working with young peoplein India that address important questions relating to medialiteracy social connectedness and digital citizenship in adigitalsocial world Digital society is conceptualized as being governed by datacation and platformisation asKatzenbach and Bchle discussed the work of Mejias and Couldry who de ned data cation as cultural logic of quanti cation and monetisation of human life through digital information and Poell Nieborg and van Dijck who conceptualized platformization as key development and narrative of the digital society Digitalsocial media platforms are now indispensable infrastructures of private and public lifeshifting cultural practicesbecoming the dominant modeof economic and social organisation Katzenbach and Bchle pp This paper addresses the following research questions What speci research priorities might emerge in the context of India around media literacy social connectedness anddigital citizenship How can these issues be studied inrelation to the lived realities of young people and their carers How can we contextualize existing knowledge about digital media use and literacy to help support young people andtheir adult caregivers and maximize bene ts of this digital social world while taking into account nuances of the local bymapping stakeholders and bringing in their voices In order to learn more about issues faced by parents and young people as they navigate digitalsocial media world in India weinterviewed range of stakeholders working directly or indirectlywith parents and young people schools and teachersinternational institutions and organizations MEDIA LITERACY SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND DIGITALCITIZENSHIP Notwithstanding the recent efforts to expand the scope of media literacy scholarship much of the literature on children and mediahas focused on Western countries and on dominant groups Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiawithin the middle classes which some scholars have referred to as WEIRD families those in Western Educated IndustrializedRich and Democratic contexts Henrich et al Alper et al In Western democracies citizenship is often tied to behaviors such as voting campaigning volunteering petitioning and protecting individuals rights For instance Choi found that digital citizenship is conceptualized by scholars in four main ways in terms of ethicssafety as political orpersonalized participation the ability to evaluate informationand critical resistanceactivism Below we have discussed somekey themes in the existing literature on digital citizenship amongyouth including safety and privacy engagement andparticipation and the role of various stakeholders in differentlearning environments Safety and Privacy One way in which digital citizenship has been conceptualized hasbeen through the lens of safety and privacy Issues of ethics mutualrespect creating safe environment and digital rights andresponsibilities were central to such conceptualizationsMossberger et al Ohler Robb and Shellenbarger FrauMeigs et al Vlaanderen et al The discussion around risks and literacy has related mainly toidentifying different kinds of potential risks social media posefor children and youth and ways of mitigating them Early workhas also been about quelling fears regarding technopanics moral panics over contemporary technology and its risks to young users eg cyberporn and online predators and showing links between hyped media coverage and consequent content legislationCassell and Cramer Marwick The nuances of lived realities were often ignored but recent studies have attempted toaddress these for example in Livingstone and work by Staksrud and colleagues and more recent work has startedfocusing on strategies to help children minimize these risksLivingstone et al Desimpelaere et al Some of these discussions have also revolved around digital rights andresponsibilities including free expression respecting intellectual property digital etiquette and wellbeing and lawful use of online spaces Robb and Shellenbarger McDool et al Subrahmanyam et al Desimpelaere et al Concerns regarding safety including bullying shaming violence and sexting of young people on social media werealso important themes in the literature Safety online has to dowith the environment available to children and youth just as onewould expect safety at home in school or at mall Livingstone et al found that children encountered solicitation of sex porn violence bullying shaming etc online They categorizedthese items into three type of risks content related conduct related and contact related Ringrose et al found link between online and of ine lives with gender issues reported in sexting and shaming girls especially on social networking sitesSNSs Other contextual variables apart from gender were age existing emotional issues broader family context andparents familiarity with technology with reference to adolescents excessive internet use and parental mediation in Europe Kalmus et al Additionally Marwick and boyd described how drama operates in teens online lives andhow widespread use of social media among teenagers has altered dynamics of aggression and con ict Recent scholarship focused on cyberbullying and how children can intervene to help victimsas well as parents role in imparting digital skills Vlaanderen et al Livingstone et al related concern is that of privacy which centers around the control one exerts over the nature and amount of personalinformation that is shared on social media and howknowledge about protecting one privacy online can help children Lee Desimpelaere et al Youth are sharing more personal information on their pro les than in the past They choose private settings for Facebook but sharewith large networks of friends Most teen social media users saidthey aren very concerned about thirdparty access to their data Madden et al Marwick and boyd also noted that social media has changed the ways in which one practices visibility and information sharing and offered model ofnetworked privacy to explain how privacy is achieved innetworked publics Another more recent study reported thatyoung people did not see their online and of ine lives as different and there was relation between facetoface anddigital interactions and selfesteem Palfrey Subrahmanyam et al Participation and Social Connectedness Participation has been conceptualized as both political and civic participation as well as personal or cultural participation Work on uses including expression and presentation of social mediaby children dealt with selfexpression identity formation statusnegotiation and peertopeer sociality as observed by boyd Hogan described the splitting of self presentation into performances synchronously situated and artifacts asynchronously exhibited derived from Goffman work on dramaturgy Lenhart et al described teens use of social media for romantic purposes like irting wooing breakingup controllingabusing and sharing usuallyofine relationship online Participation was also analyzed from uses and grati cations perspective Dunne et al QuanHaase and Young Within the United States social connectedness and digital citizenship have been viewed largely through the lens ofparticipation creative expressions and popular culture Forinstance Jenkins argued for policy and educational interventions to address the participation gap in how young people access and use media to develop competencies andexperiences to more fully express themselves as engagedcultural citizens However other scholars have emphasizedthat it is essential to foreground ethical and social justice issues by reimagining media literacies and social connectedness through civic engagement and antioppressionliteracies Scharrer and Ramasubramanian Mihailidis Ramasubramanian and Darzabi Scholars also found association between social media use and children wellbeing While social media use was found to be strongly associated with social capital it was not directly linkedwith wellbeing Ellison et al Best et al Researchers have noted an absence of robust causal research regarding this Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiadirect impact However McDool et al used proxy data to point to potential adverse effects of increasing time spent onlineon children wellbeing Nonetheless given that increase in social capital enhanced adolescents selfesteem and in turn sense of wellbeing this perspective merits further research Valkenburg et al Holmes outlined opportunities provided by socialization online as it leads to increased socialcapital and support and fosters connectedness thus making itpossible for young people to have possible positive experiences in the future Work has also been done on using social media toengage with youth on health related matters Byron et al Evers et al Hswen et al Hausmann et al Coyne et al Swist et al and more recently Coyne et al acknowledged the link between children ss media use and their wellbeing In their exhaustive review Swist et al observed that social media impacts children physical and mental health identity and relationshipslearning and play and risk and safety among other aspectsand those positive and negative mpacts must be seen in context On the other hand Coyne et al in their eightyear longitudinal study based on the Flourishing Families Project atBrigham Young University United States revealed thatincreased time spent on social media was not associated withincreased mental health issues and implored research to movebeyond its focus on screen time This is especially relevant in thecontext of our pandemic world Factors In uencing Learning Environments Several external factors in uence how youth engage with social media For instance access to technology parental involvementschool curricula and sociopolitical factors in uence both formal and informal learning environments Using socialmedia to enhance education and learning especially onlineFriedman and Friedman addressing the digital divide differential levels of access to digital devices and networksas well as the capacity to use them in productive andmeaningful ways suggesting media education as bridge and the creation of third space as way to address the divide Burn et al and advising caution in dealing with the moral panic related to it Bennett et al were the ideas dealt with in this theme Other scholars have emphasized onthe need for formal education of students on the professionaluse design and implementation of social media systems Jacobs et al In the realm of parenting it was noticed that mothers were likely to give and receive support on social media and use it as aparenting tool Duggan et al Active parental involvement was detected when the child had experienced online harm Kalmus et al Parenting strategies re ected anxieties about online risks and inadvertently contributed to limitingchildren opportunities Tripp Clearly balance needs to be found between panicking about risks online andopportunities that digitalsocial world offers young people AEuroAmerican parenting perspective emphasizes independenceand autonomy and other evidence Ho et al Smetana points towards cultural differences in parenting styles and its impact on children behaviorParental mediation was key to in uencing children sb sa behaviors Gelman et al thus making the development of open communication and trust in parentchild relationshipssignicant to young people wellbeing Lee and Chae PadillaWalker et al This was true in case of media ranging from television to the Internet Livingstone and Helsper Clark and included approaches like modeling and couse Connell et al Harrison Parental mediation was often categorized into two broad stylesactive and restrictive Lee and Chae PadillaWalker and Coyne while accepting this categorization characterized it as prearming and cocooning respectively Theactiveprearming style was more conversational open and trustbased relationship between the parent and children grounded incommunication modeling and couse strategies whereas restrictivecocooning style was more about rules and restrictions set by parents for their children to protect them from onlineharms and risks Livingstone in her study with Helsper andmore recently in her work with BlumRoss that extensivelyused interviews with parents has described parental mediationas active restrictive and cousing Livingstone and Helsper and as embrace balance and resist Livingstone and BlumRoss Livingstone and BlumRoss also tended to associate the embrace and resist strategies as potentially riskyin the sense of planning towards the longterm digital futureof young people favoring balance in world fraught with uncertainty Beyond Media Literacy Perspectives From the Global North While literature reviewed thus far is important for understanding key themes and factors in uencing media literacy digital citizenship and social connectedness it draws almost entirelyon scholarship from the Global North The paucity in literaturefrom the Global South is only now being remedied In the case ofIndia the problem might be partially alleviated by decolonizing research and the way it is reported and by building more diverse networks of scholarship both amongst scholars from within theGlobal South and across regions Other researchers have arguedfor the need for global approach to media literacy scholarship ina digital context Mihailidis Byrne et al De Abreu et al De Abreu et al Despite acknowledgement of the need to diversify and internationalize media literacy scholarship most often it isdiscussed within the context of nonUnited States Westerncountries in the Global North rather than including countriesand contexts from other parts of the world Consequently there are productive and active collaborations across Europe fuelled partly by European Research Council grants and transAtlanticpartnerships In other words such internationalization efforts tomedia literacy scholarship often end up unintentionallyreinforcing Eurocentric notions of media literacy constructedand perceived through Western lens We need to widen thisview which situates media literacy as originating from theUnited States Canada and Britain to acknowledge multiplesociocultural locations from which knowledge about literacies Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaand media technologies have evolved and continue to evolve It is important to further complicate and challenge the dominantEurocentric narrative given the diverse nature of communitieseven in the geographic region that falls into the Global North due to historical and contemporary migrations Examining central issues in nonWestern contexts Mihailidis discovered that nding support for media literacy work among decisionmakers and policymakers is often challengeSeveral media literacy educators in the Global South continue todraw on curricula developed in United States and Europeancontexts and stemming from Western models of mediaeducation and certain cultural understanding of childhoodThese curricula tend to focus on democratic practice freedom ofexpression and advertising literacies which might not necessarilybe relevant in all contexts Additionally there are other challenges in terms of building collaborations across various sectors focusing on children and media such as government nonpro ts industry and education respondent from the Middle East interviewedby Mihailidis cited in his study said Media literacy is about more than just analyzing media messages and barrierto entry in the public school system is that there are manydifferent of cial bodies who believe they should have say in the implementation of media literacy curricula Ramasubramanian and YadlinSegal conducted interviews with scholars and educators from various youth andmedia contexts from around the world to bring to light cultural differences in de nitions practices resources and policymaking which need to be considered in media literacy scholarship Forinstance Livingstone and Bulger discussed crosscultural differences between how children in the Global North access theinternet mostly through computer whereas those from theGlobal South typically access it through mobile phones with asingle device often being shared among several members of afamily They pointed to barriers such as lack of access totechnology teacher training parental knowledge andculturallyrelevant or locally produced curricular materials inthe Global South Similarly team of researchers Byrne et al who examined crossnational data from Argentina Philippines Serbia and South Africa found that childrentypically accessed the internet at home using mobile phonesThey also found that children in South Africa and Philippinesengaged in fewer online practices and had lower level of digitalliteracy compared to those in Argentina and Serbia Within Asian contexts existing research focused on topics such as ICT adoption censorship cybersafety and more broadlyon protectionism Cheung Lee AlNajjar For example AlNajjar found that in the Middle Eastern context much of the discourse surrounding youth media use has focused narrowly on media risks with little attention paid to the role of digital media in the betterment of self and societyFrom conservative Singaporean context Yue et al called for more research on digital citizenship from the Global South Intheir focus group discussions with Singaporean youth they foundthat media literacy skills in uence negotiations of public opinions in ways that challenged mainstream ideologies Similarly amongyoung Indonesian Muslim women they found that issues of pietyreligious obedience and ethical entrepreneurship wereemphasized Patankar et al observed the critical need for digital literacy in country like India that is diverse in itspopulace and inequalities and described government efforts tomake rural India digitally literate Focusing on unemployed women in India Mukherjee et al examined the impact of these programs and their perceived value and found theyenabled rural women to get jobs in for example BPOs BusinessProcessing Outsourcing units Akram and Kumar offered broad view of the positive and negative effects of social media onsociety while Kumar and Rangaswamy drew on actor network theory to ip notions of piracy and viewing pirated content arguing that it fuels media consumption technologyadoption and digital literacy Examining Digital Citizenship and Social Connectedness Within Indian Contexts Media literacy and media literacy education in India began receiving government attention only in early withperceptible growth of the internet both as driver of theeconomy with focus on skills and capacities and as spacefor leisure activity and communication and perhaps mostimportantly in relation to children as vehicle forinformation and knowledge dissemination and the potential todemocratise access to education especially in the pandemic context The discussion on media and children therefore proceeds on two occasionally intersecting pathways one is education through media and the other is education about media bothproduction and consumption Our interest in this project is thelatter In this regard the National Curriculum Frameworkproposed in that education in India should be connectedwith knowledge to life outside school which led to theintroduction of course on media studies for secondarystudents The Central Institute of Educational Technologyhelped in creating Media Clubs in schools to promote medialiteracy in India in up to NCERT with further records being unavailable However their focus was on media production as students brought out school newspapers as part of the Media Club rather than critical engagement with media State level bodies implemented andexecuted such media literacy and education activities at lowerlevels These tend to include literacies about media as well asmedia used to develop multiple literacies thus confounding the two pathways mentioned above For instance the GujaratInstitute of Educational Technology Education DepartmentGovernment of Gujarat produced television programmers forteachers and children of years of age GIET on media literacy However it was found that programs were often broadcast during school hours when children could not watch although some schools scheduled time for viewing inschool and college for undergraduate students Govindaraju and Banerjee Different state and central boards of education in India also periodically share guidelines regarding social media usage atschool and to keep stakeholders noti ed of activities that are encouraged for children learning But there appears to be gap between research praxis and policy in manner that Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiacontextualizes existing knowledge and helps support young people and carers maximize the bene ts of this digitalsocial world even as we take into account nuances of the local Currentpolicies do not insist on evidencebased decisionmaking or draw on experiences and expectations of wide range of stakeholders and clearly young people voices are not driving them nor have they been expected to in what has largely been topdown nonparticipatory policy process Similarly media is quick to offerbasic parenting advice regarding children online practices without attention to speci circumstances sometimes forcing relationships between the latest fad and its adverse effects There is slowly emerging body of interdisciplinary literature that looks at the need to build critical skills among young peoplein India These skills will allow them to negotiate digitallymediated world in terms of relationships and political and cultural realities Bhatia and PathakShelat It will also help children unpack media representations Sreenivas their engagement with social media like YouTube and WhatsAppdeepens Sarwatay Examining attitudes towards advertising literacy among Indian tweens Trehan found low levels of comprehension of persuasive intentexaggeration and misinformation but high levels of celebrityrecognition visual literacy and gender divide in terms ofperceived sexual objecti cation of women in advertising As part of tencountry comparative study of youth and digitalmedia use Raman and Verghese observed that political and civic socialization of urban Indian youth was largely dependent on social media fact that was similar to their counterparts in most parts of the world Such scholarshipbeing guided by the vision of developing an inclusive andmulticultural mindset will thus ll out the idea of what it means to be an informed citizen The present study adds to the sparse literature on media literacy from the Global South especially in terms of the roleof policymakers such as educators nonpro leaders and community leaders It examines how they shape discoursesabout digital citizenship and social connectedness within the Indian youth and media context The uncertainties of the online world have led parents in India to depend on mediadiscourse digitalsocial media teachers local parentingexperts digital media experts and organizations working withchildren for advice on how to deal with young people experiences online Questions of access uses practices risksand opportunities are common but many parents lack accessto wellresearched answers Newspapers largely run storiesmotivated by technopanics there is generational digitaldivide and parents often do not model what theypreach especially when their mediation follows restrictive style They tend to believe that regulation of some kind is solution at the family level by restricting use or accepting onlycertain kinds of access at the societal level by depending onschoolsteachers or at the institutional level with governmentalbans or board guidelines While some parents and teachers cited media literacy as possible solution Sarwatay policy and implementation arelacking in this regard As children digital natives might navigatethrough these digitalsocial worlds differently than their eldersthere is confusion about the dos and don ts and while advice is available access to parental mediation and communicationstrategies in digital world is unequal As more of ourexistence is digitally data ed citizenship itself is being digitized but there are myriad issues of how this existence is structured and designed and how parents can guide young people and learn fromthem as they navigate through these worlds ideally together Thisis why it is important to examine the underlying systems thatenable young people and their parents in these online worlds Whathelps them dispel notions fuelled by technopanics Can regulationhelp What is the role of media literacy How can socialconnectedness lead to better communication and engagementbetween parents and children and reduce navigation confusionHow do we become digital citizens even as structures and designsare evolving and getting optimized METHODS In this project we take an ecosystembased approach tounderstanding digital citizenship and social connectedness inthe Indian context using series of indepth interviews with aselected group of stakeholders As literature reviewed in the previous section suggested informal and formal learning environments have shaped how youth engaged with digitalcitizenship how media literacies are practiced and how socialconnectedness emerged in various contexts Various types ofcontextual factors such as family environments school curriculasociopolitical climate and technological access in uenced how youth used media to connect learn and participate in creativepersonal political and civic activities Therefore it is importantto examine the role of stakeholders such as parents teacherssocial workers children advocates and others who shape the media environment for young people Several educational and research organizations as well as the media in India have shown interest in youth and social media andhave considered in varying levels of detail how parents and children navigate experiences online Speci research priorities have emerged in the Indian context and given the relativerecency of such research in the Global South most oftenquantitative methods like surveys questionnaires andstructured interviews have been employed the main target ofthese being teachers and parents However little attention hasbeen paid to other in uencers of youth and media spaces such as social workers industry experts and children advocacy groups all of which also in uence mesolevel and macrolevel policies and practices related to digital media literacy From the management of technology and innovation standpoint Tsujimoto et al

policypraxis research axes Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in IndiaThe main questions that guided the interviews were How do they frame and perceive issues related to young people media literacy social connectedness and digital citizenship What insights have they gained through working with parents and children In this paper we de ne media literacy as young people ability to safely access and use digitalsocial media for identity andrelationships learning and play and consumer and civicpractices Social connectedness is characterized as the sense ofbelonging between young people and their adult caregivers in adigitalsocial world Digital citizenship is closely tied to the twoconcepts above in the broader context of engaging with the society around them in digitalsocial world Local ecosystem mapping through interviews was conducted to better understand how these experts describe and examine thecurrent scenario in India The nine experts interviewed are brie described in Table with their relative positioning in Figure along the policypraxisresearch axes Pseudonyms have been usedto protect their identities These stakeholders are either directly or indirectly working with parents and young people schools and teachersinternational institutions and organizations to become part ofthe ecosystem of connective media through their practice research andor eventually policy and have their ear to the ground as to how young people and parents navigate digitalsocial media world They come from relatively privilegedsection of the Indian society to be in position to impactpolicy directly or indirectly within their local ecosystem whiletheir work covers people across the socioeconomic spectrumThese experts engaged with the rst author in semistructured interviews around the following topics New media speci cally the Internet digitalsocial media Children and media in the local context Understanding of existing systems media discourse around this topic Gaps in research advocacy policy and academia Informed consent was obtained from participants at the start and scanned copy of the form was sent to them after completionof the interview Interviews were recorded and transcribedInterviews were conducted in English with conversationsometimes slipping into Hindi or Gujarati An interestingmethodological sidenote is that an application was used totranscribe interviews instantly and while it performed fairly decently in English it had trouble recognizing the Indian accent in some places and failed to transcribe nonEnglishspoken words correctly We had to correct those parts bylistening to the recording and editing the mistakes out With theexception of two who were interviewed by phone and emailrespectively due to their strict preference all interviews took placeat their of ceshomes Interviews were scheduled after explaining the purpose with each lasting between min to All participantsremarked on the importance of the topic in current timesThe interviews began with broad questions aimed at drawing out their ideas about digitalsocial media and their understandingof the local children and media landscape Across participantsthere was common theme of children and adolescents being inundated by media messages the compounding effect of digital social media and increased importance of parenting in thesetimes to safeguard children rights This led to deeper dive into issues they outlined to elicit responses related to existing systemsperceived gaps media discourse and possible solutionsResponses to these questions varied re ecting their different locations The child psychologist focused on the importance of goal setting and communication those involved with social mediaspoke about couse and balanced consumption experts who dealtin cyber crime took cautionary stance and academic and research experts focused on the need for research and foregrounding children voices Many asked why this topic was chosen perhaps to place it in loop of the discoursesurrounding these issues Data from interviews wassupplemented with researchers observations background peripheral conversation with experts and eld notes suggesting Nearly all interviewees had children and brought some context from existing experiences or voiced concernsabout anticipated problems Solutions cited came from personal experience peer discussions events about digital parenting and other professional avenues Identi cation of relevance of this topic and gaps in research advocacy policy and academia stemmed fromreections above While guided by literature we did not approach data with preexisting themes and used an inductive approach allowingthemes to emerge from the data semantic approach wasapplied to thematic analysis The transcripts were coded andthemes were generated as shown below FINDINGS Indepth interviews help participants express themselves andguide the interview thereby allowing the researcher to rectifyand add to the process and remain open to developing ideasfurther even seeking new directions and interpretationsBrenner Glesne rst order of themes from the interview data was extracted which was further consolidated into second order which were the basis of thissection Analysis was done and quotes were pulled frominterviews to give layered detailed context Issues of childcentereddesign dearth of knowledge about opportunities andrisks of social media among parents and confusion around howto navigate this digital world were some of the themes thatemerged as interpreted from the interview data Questionswere raised about children wellbeing including what parents could do about this the possibility of and the problems withregulation and the need to focus on how parents could foster Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiatrust and meaningful connection with young people that would frame their engagement with technology Main themes from the interview data are shown in Figure Respondents pointed to what they saw as problem areas such astechnopanics digital divide navigation confusion andtechnology design that was not childcentric but alsoindicated possible approaches to addressing these issuesthrough regulation improved parental engagement and moreopen communication with all stakeholders These were groupedinto three broad themes of media literacy social connectednessand digital citizenship roughly corresponding to the themes inthe global scholarship as outlined in an earlier section ofthis paper Some experts spoke from cautionary perspective while others focused on safeguarding young people interests ABC was vehemently against giving social media access to very youngchildren observing that handing over phones to toddlers as abehavioral incentive was bad idea She also opined thatteenagers are going through rough phase in life as it is andparents need to be extra careful when they observe behavioralchanges in their adolescent children possibly due to digitalsocialmedia DEF was big believer in cousing digitalsocial mediawith children as strategy to digital parenting While she or herchild had not faced cyber crime personally she was wary of coming across unpleasant or dangerous experiences and felt one needed to be prepared Many sessions she organized for hermothers club focused on this theme Her mantras were practice what you preach and precaution is better than cure and this reected throughout the interview GHI and JKL believed parents exert lot of control over children media diets especially younger children and they needed to be aware of the digitalsocial world to make the right decisions for their wards They hadidenti ed an acute lack of awareness about several issues likeprivacy safety tools to safeguard young people online and hence organizedparticipated in events aimed at parents to spread awareness and aid parental mediation regarding children technology use MNO and PQR had seen many cases of cyber crime and victimization They were aware of the level of ignorance related torisks in digitalsocial world They hold frequent workshops andtrainingcounseling sessions for young people victims or highrisk individuals or organizations like corporate and governmententities While STU work is not directly focused on the impact of social media on young people he works on children rights and capacity building which ties in with awareness and trainingVYW strongly believes young people attention span and sleep are adversely affected and this needs research attention When confronted with the argument that young people love to bingewatch she countered with the nuance of viewership vsengagement and how the latter is getting more super cial XYZ posited generational shift in media consumption andengagement patterns Young people are moving towards avisual medium of expression however many of them strugglewith communicating verbally he said He also mentioned lackof acknowledgment of personal responsibility for your actions onsocial media and opined how that might contribute to increasingcases of cyberbullying Based on these interviews and the researcher seld notes the average middleclass schoolgoing urbanbased young personwith access to digitalsocial media would have full day routine with school extracurricular and other activities in amedia rich and dense environment as follows Waking up in themorning as the radio is playing tinkering with the smartphoneusually mom and television

access should be given to young people in this digitalsocial worldand were occasionally swayed by media discourse ontechnopanics to limit usage leading to tensions in relationshipswith their wards This gets further complicated when parentscantdon twon practice what they preach and young people call them out on these contradictions Parents tend to perceivecomputerlaptop use as productive behaviour while televisionsmartphone use as unproductive behaviour leading todisagreements and disharmony sometimes leading to breakdown of trust and communication between the parent and child While the opening questions helped build context regarding the local realities speci questions as the interviews progressed helped identify the following themes Technopanics Digital Divide and Hypocrisy Issues of risks and literacy health and wellbeing safety includingbullying shaming violence and sexting and privacy were raisedby experts who work directly and indirectly with young peopleand parents schools organizations etc Lack of digitalsocial media literacy was cited as one of the reasons why most parents and some young people were concerned regarding their onlineuses practices and experiences Media discourse also added fueltore as coverage about social media addiction challenges like blue whale and momo Pednekar and safety and privacy issues were sensationalized However this is challenge that canbe met by inculcating media literacy and digitalsmart parentingwhich is an uphill climb because we are still battling technopanicsdigital divide and hypocrisy DEF was frank in her admissionwhen she said We held panel discussion recently on digital media parenting on what should be the role of parents in today digital media scenario how do we cut down on screen time But sometimes we act like hypocrites We ask themchildren not to use it and as parents we use it so it partof the panel focused on how to balance it screen time MNO had the strong opinion that privacy does not exist in dataed world This problem is compounded by lack of awareness regarding online safety among majority citizensPQR concurred when she opined that usually people becomeaware of risks when something untoward happens The new media forms are much more easily accessible than the other forms of media and they are up to date However we must also note that such media is also plagued by fake news non consensual images revenge porn contents etc This makes theyoung minds sometimes glued to such media because they mayhave never seen such things and due to adolescent curiosity theymay be more than willing to share such things in groups secretlywhich may increase the humiliation of the victims To this end recognizing the need for steering discourse the Central Board of Secondary Education CBSE national level board of education in India managed by the Union Governmentand implemented in several public and private schools throughout the country issued the Guidelines for Safe and Effective Use of Internet and Digital Technologies in Schoolsand School Buses including Tips to stay safe on social networking sites for students This serves as primer for ideal online behaviour and can guide parents regardingtechnology mediation at home as well Experts also insisted that parents need to set aside their reservations about the digital divide and not being techsavvyenough They have to be more digitallysocially clued in so theycould pass on literacy lessons to children PQR found patterns inlevels of awareness and corresponding styles of parenting indifferent regions of the country She reported my organization receives cases from all across India However Ican highlight patterns from three regionsTamil Nadu West Bengal and Gujarat speci cally Parenting style may differ as per the culture of the region experience seen that compared to Gujaratand West Bengal Tamil Nadu parents are more aware andstricter when it comes to using of internet and social media bychildren Parents may be busy and they may not be able to monitor children always Cyber safety issues still remain laggingbehind when it comes to comparing Southern Western andEastern regions Clearly given the diversity and breadth of India one may nd different trends in different regions She opined that awarenessregarding cyber victimization was higher in South India compared to West and East India as they seemed to only spring to action after crime has been committed Howeverit is important to note that preexisting notions regarding adults or children digitalsocial abilities in uenced by technopanics or digital divide will only exacerbate the problem at hand This getscompounded when parents give out and act on contradictory setsof norms for uses and practices online as children tend to followin the parents footsteps Navigation Confusion ABC was of the rm opinion that digital and social media technologies do more harm than good for especially young and impressionable minds that can be swayed by the glamourand glitz of online platforms if certain opportunitybasedperspective was not built into young people psyche She insisted It is our responsibility as parents and teachers to show the younger generation through our actions that theseare but tools you use in life after receiving due instruction in howto effectively utilize them for your bene becoming ideal digital citizens Reecting on her practice as child psychologist she gave the analogy of children being soft as clay and how we can mold them through our words and actions She gave the example of goal setting exercise and how it is important to ensure children forgeand follow certain path for themselves She added And that we cant just teach them this by talking about it we have to show it to them to avoid navigation confusion Digital and social media canwork for or against our children positive experiences depending on how we have shaped their perspective about it She elaborated how this works by citing phenomenon she has come across many times especially among teenagers Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiabecause they are in the phase where they want to show off They want to show that they are something have friends have boyfriends have done this as status symbol So for teenagers rmly believe that in their formative years if we get them into the habit of goal setting then social media can be of good use because then it will serve as positive in uence Like when they follow celebrities on social media they will focus onhow Virat Kohli cricketer became such great sportspersonwhat does Bill Gates businessman say about becomingsuccessful But if this connection between goal setting andhow social media is perceived and can be used for our bene has not been established then they teenagers get into the showoff mode where they try to put up show of that which doesn exist What she is saying can be tied to our existing understanding that technology is neither good nor bad and it depends on how we use it Opportunities and risks exist in digitalsocial world justlike they did before and we need tools like goal setting to utilizethe affordances to our advantage DEF agreed as she ruminatedabout sharenting parents sharing about kids lives and their photos and videos online as she goes back to issues of hypocrisy and lack of policies to protect children from online risks Sheinsisted that we are confusing children when we create socialmedia accounts for infants and then insist they shouldn use these platforms because they are bad for them She also attributeda lack of awareness among parents and young people about safely navigating online to making contradictory andor restrictive decisions She believed cybercrime is hard to faceConsequences of cybercrime also affect you mentally so we must know about online safety precautions Every school andcollege should have sessions on cybercrime She mentioned that while guidelines like the CBSE ones above are helpful we need more to spread awareness andhelp parental mediation of children technology use This is because parents in India can sometimes go from one extreme ofsharenting and making accounts for underage children to anotherextreme of announcing blanket bans for adolescents usually based on academic performance and feedback This can confuse young people and raise questions like How do we navigate in this socialmedia world What can be the consequences of navigationconfusion How can we stop negative consequences Thesewere also some of the questions raised by the stakeholdersThe next issue gives us more insight into the genesis of thisnavigation confusion Technology and ChildCentered Design Digital and social media are considered ideal platforms forconnection communication and community building However sometimes platforms can alienate people even as we have false sense of security from being on the application orwebsite as we take its bene ts for granted GHI shared how websites she creates for schools to keep parents clued in onattendance homework and performance of students sometimesfosters deeper disconnect while maintaining the illusion ofinformation richness This is where an emphasis on socialconnectedness becomes important Issues of technology andchildcentered design enable you to have access to sometimeslarge scale aggregated data but you miss out on nuances that are unique to an individual She shared there is no communication between the teacher and the parentsEverything is updated on the website or application in way technology does lessen the burden but there is no personal touch But it depends on the school as well have enrolled my daughterin school that uses technology like smart board WhatsAppgroups but also believes in personal connection andcommunication Navigating digitalsocial media world also depends on the intrinsic composition of the platform JKL who heads an onlinemarketing rm insisted that lack of childcentereddesign is to blame for risks faced by young people and added that low levels ofawareness among adults is also problematic He cited examples ofcyber crimes and cyberbullying and made his case by explaining Online safety is currently not taken too seriously until they become victims or someone closer to them becomes victimand at that time they surrender to the situation and say Oh should do that take precautions we are not kidsdriven societylike for eg nding restaurant that has kidfriendly food You only realize these things when you experience them GHI insisted that technology is only an enabler and it is our responsibility to lean toward or away from it to balance thecommunicative aspect of our relationship with and surroundingchildren She posited that there is threeway relationshipbetween parents children and teachersschools and this triad is mediated by technology and personal communication The child needs to be at the focal point of this triad and technologyshould help not harm while centering young people in amediated communication design Social media technologiesrespond to user behaviors their affordances can be shaped bydeliberate and informed patterns of use We can either createsilos and echo chambers or actively seek multiple perspectives tofoster understanding Regulation and Policymaking Media literacy is often cited as one of the solutions to risks that new media bring along with its bene ts However is it too much to ask of individuals to be aware of everything and itsrepercussions Should the industry selfregulate Should thegovernment bring legislative regulation VYW agreed that thisproblem needs industry and government involvement and addedIf we give free rein to corporate and media companies they do what they do and then every time something new comes out theindividual or parent has to constantly worry about what newimpact it will have on me or my kid But at the same time censorship and regulation will always be problematic right XYZ who is also part of think tank on digital media platforms asserted the importance of keeping discourse around digital and social media and its impact on society aliveand current He urged Its important to bring experts together to put forth their ideas and perspectives on how digital and socialmedia is impacting people health and mental wellbeing Young people are digital natives and we are witnessing generationalshift in the way these new media technologies are being used However experts pointed that young voices are distinctly absent in the policymaking process possibility in regulation Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiacould be evidencebased policy and decisionmaking where digital natives participate along with older generationsHowever currently there is massive gap between whathappens on ground vs legislation or even advocacy around these issues Illustrative in this regard are recent bans on TikTok and PUBG etc popular platforms which youngpeople used for identity creation selfexpression communitybuilding among others While current bans are for politicalreasons earlier bans due to sensationalist media stories werelater lifted only to be reinstated again Many young peopleespecially from marginalized backgrounds used these platformsand these decisions overlooked impact on said audiencesusers Social Connectedness and Engagement Social connectedness in digitalsocial world depends on our communication and engagement with and demonstration of it to our children ABC emphasized Social media is absolutely ne because that the world we live in where everything is digital and thats how it going to be and there is nothing to worry about But as parent or educator or school which direction do you showyour children towards Do they think social media is resourcefor learning or to show off DEF echoed the sentiment Parenting in digital and social media world is just like coin with two sidesthe internet has everything from porn totips on parenting It is up to us where we draw the line andchoose and tell our kids what is good and bad Kids are after all kids and we as parents need to control ourselves and check our behavior practice what we preach Some experts though thought social media for very young children was complete nono If social media was having badimpact on teenagers parents were encouraged to limitrescindaccess for older children too Nonetheless the quantity andquality of social connectedness depends on goal setting as youhelp create systematic template for children to follow They havea sense of direction and will most likely nd ways to optimize opportunities and disarm risks in this online experiencenavigating these social worlds without confusion and with condence ABC added Assigning speci responsibilities to and setting goals withfor your children ensures they use theirscreen time wisely And this needs to start at the young age of twoto twoandahalf years because this approach becomes the wayof life as your child becomes teenager This becomes easier to do when you share communicative and engaging relationship with your children DEF shared heard panel expert say we should always add coin front of everything we do with our kids like coplay cosleep coread inthe initial years because we cannot completely shun these new technologies and their exposure in today world How long will you not tell your kid not to use any of the gadgets when you yourself are using it for hours This brings an interesting dynamic to notions of trust and communication between parents and children Parents can bondwith children over the latest online or do things together likewatch movie This helps foster and strengthen socialconnectedness and engagement and is in line with parentalmediation techniques like balance Livingstone and BlumRoss where the parentchild relationship is about doing things together and in moderation Parental Involvement Practice What Preach The involvement of parents in children digitalsocial lives is crucial towards ensuring young people long term wellbeing healthy relationship must be based on communication and trustIt is important that parents practice what they preach andremember that young people have rights in this digital age justas in other spheres of life STU who heads an initiative forchildren rights reiterated Children need guidance regarding their online practices just as they need guidance in educationsports career and life this is their right and digital citizenship is becoming an essential in our everchanging world VYW recounted that ordinary people use media positively ie using media to enhance life getting new friends getting new knowledge making you aware of something that enrichesyour life making you feel valued as citizen all of these thingsenhance lifeit not unimportant just because it on new media She added that parentchild communication can foster discipline and moderation in use chalk up multiple optionsfor activities and ensure certain minimum hours of sleep foreveryone as essential something that people are missing out on these days Parents and young people could navigate social world better by understanding how media literacy socialconnectedness and digital citizenship can help them with better sense of links between policy governance and regulation Social connectedness and engagement with young people Practicing what they preach There could be many social factors along with emergence of digital and social media contributing to trends in children uses practices and experiences online Additionally as PQR noted parenting styles may differ as per the regional culture and giventhe world we live in MNO reiterated digital parenting as the needof the hour We need to understand why and how young peopleuse social media to express and present themselves and focus onopportunities like education and learning to make the best use ofthese platforms DISCUSSION range of issues such as lack of childcentereddesign dearth ofknowledge about opportunities and risks of social media andconfusion about navigating this digitalsocial world emergedfrom thematic analysis Based on these insights we offerways to think about children wellbeing how adult caregivers can maximize children wellbeing the possibility of and problems with regulation and recommendations for parents tofoster trust and meaningful connection with young people to Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaframe their engagement with technology while pointing to research gaps and directions for future scholarship in India In most conceptions of society children are considered group that is vulnerable and in need of protection This responsibility to protect and care is placed by society largely on the shoulders of parents and other adults like teacherscaregivers etc and more broadly on the institutions that playa role in children growth and development Children have from their very inception been treated as special group by lawacademia and the market and in this regard media studiesare no exception As our review indicated scholarship hasbeen equivocal and often polarized regarding children media especially digitalsocial media access usage and its moderatingrole in identity formation and social interactions and morerecently on how children develop civic cultural and political ideas and notions of citizenship Nolas et al Concerns articulated in research and policy circles about children literacies rights and parental cautions about appropriate andproductive media useparticipation have also been re ected in mainstream media discourse In regard to the rst concern articulated in this paper of identifying research priorities speci to the Indian context these conversations offer some direction that research could take toinform developing digital media literacy programmers thataddress the fears anxieties hopes and everyday realities ofIndian families As some of the informants in this study have suggested this has led to multipronged yet somewhat uncoordinated response to managing anxieties and promisesof digital media in relation to children in the Indian contextAcross all the themes that emerged well conceived medialiteracy effort was seen as pivotal to mitigating risks andfacilitating positive relationship with media for youngpeople It is interesting that parents too are seen as importantparticipants in such literacy efforts both as targets of critical media literacy programs and as facilitators This may beparticularly important in the Indian context as parents experiences with media both digital and predigital vary widely depending on socioeconomic and cultural milieu This brings us to the second research question we set out to address how can such media literacy programmers address thenuanced needs of local cultures while working with existingoften civic literacy gaps There is also an important but in these conversations less perceptible shift from the language of responsibility to that of rights and participation In such aframework in the context of India communication rights arerealized through media literacy where children discover or are sensitized to issues of representation and participation in digitaland other media through deliberately thought out literacy programmers designed bearing in mind the very diverse contexts that Indian children occupy Shakuntala Banaji work for instance brings into conversation historical ideasabout children and childhood in India with everyday livedexperiences of children from the margins drawing from this the understanding that intervention for and about children mustinvolve children voices and recognition of their agency Banaji This perhaps is one way to respond to concerns expressed by some of the stakeholders around the topdown approach totechnology design as well as the relatively little effort put into actually involving children in conversations around theirmediatedmedia lives Such conversations of course cannotignore the fundamental truth about India that as is the case in other diverse cultures there is no one group of children that represents the whole and that even as we think about policybroadly there must be room for multiple local variations inapplication In recent years some multilateral agencies such as UNICEF and UNESCO have attempted to de ne and advocate for children rights drawing on researchbased inputs from activists and academics taking forward to some extent media literacy movement that emerged in the wake of thespread of television In most of these projects there has beenrecognition that children occupy complex worlds and shared understanding of these diverse realities based on rigorous research must inform policy and programmatic interventionsThese have engendered partnerships between developmentagencies and academics with slowly increasingrepresentation from the Global South The Global Kids Onlineproject initiated by UNICEF the London School of Economicsand Political Science for instance while starting off with aEurocentric focus has now broadened to include network ofresearchers from countries India among them Theinterdisciplinary and international nature of such networksholds promise for widening of the lens that informs policy in areas such as education and technology development both key to realizing any media literacy agenda However what seems to bemissing is the link with the state institutions that allow forinterventional ideas to be supported at scale in sustainable ways But no matter where one looks it is dif cult to escape the ambivalence that pervades thinking in the area of children andmedia and the usefulness of media literacy efforts in the face of arapidly changing increasingly interconnected world wherechildren and the adults in their lives seem to have to continually recalibrate their ways of being learning andrelating While some hail social media developments as opportunities for children to learn and grow others fear risks of exposure to world we do not fully know and understandLivingstone and Helsper There is also the fear of the older generation parents teachers etc of being left behind due totheir lack of understanding and ability of maneuvering thesemedia as compared to the younger generation which is identi ed asdigital natives Burn et al Some also question the skills of these natives in navigating the complicated world of socialmedia Hence the emergence of literature aroundliteracy ranging from information literacy to media literacy and digital literacy to social media literacy to enable children and parents to skillfully and safely engage with this virtual environment Buckingham Bennett et al Livingstone All these questions acquire different nuances and meanings in different cultures and in India asperhaps in other transitional societies they must be consideredagainst range of social political and economic issues In thedeeply paternalistic and patriarchal family structures forinstance how might children autonomy and parental engagement operate How might social metier use or device Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaownership and control vary across demographic categories What in fact might social connectedness or digital citizenshipfor children mean in context where even adults nd themselves multiply disadvantaged and disenfranchised How does media literacy then work alongside other urgently required literacies to empower children and facilitate their growth There is no doubt that there is rich and rapidly growing body of scholarship on children engagement with digital technologies and many convincing arguments for robustmedia literacy programs While opinions will always range andoften fall into sharply divided buckets together they open upquestions for future research some of which are alluded to aboveAs noted earlier much of the work that is currently drawn uponby researchers educators and policy makers and cited hereoriginates from the United States and United Kingdom to lesser extent Europe and Australia In this review there was one study from Saudi Arabia one on Latino immigrants with fewfeaturing sections on Asian countries like China and India In theIndian context the authors could only nd limited industry research on this topic from organizations like ASSOCHAMTCS etc some academic research done by students which cameto the foreground because of localregional newspaper coverageand spot of mainstream media work circling around sensationalstories like underage use social media crises such as the BlueWhale game and the more recent BoisLockerRoom incidentand tips to parents While issues related to digital media use and practice comes into public attention during such incidents there has been little sustained scholarly engagement that spans thespectrum from educators to media scholars to policy makers toprogram implementers the full complement of perspectives and disciplinary knowledge that may be required to make medialiteracy in the country an evidence based project In terms of methodology the larger research projects currently underway in India are modeled on or directed largely by Westernframeworks including the Global Kids Online project which of course offers room for cultural contextualization Deeperethnographic engagements that allow for contextualized understanding of children media practices and qualitative interviews with teachers and parents would help build morerobust evidence base that can inform policy It may be worthwhileto think back on efforts such as Newspapers in Educationprograms that were led by the media industry recognizingtheir need to build consumer base among younger readersand understand how they also served as media literacy efforts soas to gain some sense of what might work today and with whatkinds of partners industry the state educational institutions and parents After all digital media are here to stay and whetherwe like it or not we need to make productive use of them as tools as environments or as interfaces Despite the considerable technopanic generated around the negative aspects of socialdigital media like violence bullyinghate addiction and privacy there are also positives including thepossibility of agentic self representation productive interactionsand rich relational experiences increased access to education andlearning opportunities and even employment We need moreresearch that looks at the differential ways in which mediapenetration and access might affect children opportunities inthis regard and how media literacy could be way to mitigate some of these issues There is also need to consider such issues asyoung people understanding of ethics in the digital world their adoption of and thoughts about technologies like virtual reality augmented reality and arti cial intelligence and how they use their networked self to cross over into adulthood again all within the cultural contexts of India For instance how might we understandethical decisionmaking within the framework of religiouscommunity What forms does bullying take online wherestudents of diverse backgrounds might be interacting and can the lessons from racebased discrimination stand in for castebased discrimination in India How can children activate theiragency through and with digital media The example of UNICEF Children as Media Producers CAMP suggests that children even in resource poor contexts can engage with media technology when given chance and when equipped with the right tools of critical literacy But to build such media literacyprograms one requires the understanding gained from robustresearch using methods that are appropriate to particularcontext and the participants who occupy it All these issues have gained new salience in the global experience of the COVID pandemic and its widerangingimpact on social life particularly on children education As briey alluded to earlier this has brought in new urgency to the issue of digitalsocial media literacy for both children andcaregivers It also forces us to recognize and address in literacy programs the complexities introduced when children need to learn online where parental involvement takes on completelynew texture and the granularities of lived context accessconnectivity space familial structures and responsibilitiesdetermine the ways in which young people relate not only tothe digital but also to life in general The informants in this study offered media literacy as broad umbrella approach that could address most of the issues that theythemselves identi ed as problematic in relation to children engagement with digital media But they could point to almostno locally generated knowledge that could undergird culture centered approach to media literacy This then becomes an area that is ripe for exploration by young scholars in not only mediaand communication but also education child developmentsociology and social policy studies In other contexts scholarshave called out the need to decolonize digital culture studiesRisam Arora it is important that we begin this process in relation to media literacy studies as well Given thatmedia literacy is second order research area dependent on diverse bodies of knowledge including those mentionedpreviously this would mean that we need to develop creativecollaborations across disciplines and engage not only in extensive primary research but also actively dialogue across subject borders LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION This paper is starting point for more dialogue and support rst for developing culturecentered approach to understanding coreissues developing argumentation taking into account multiplesocioeconomic realities and ultimately for using media literacy Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiafor active engagement and participation by youth in pluralistic nonWestern democratic context We acknowledge that majorlimitation of this study is its dependence on narrow range ofstakeholders which gives us only slight avor of the range of opinions and experiences that could inform further research The larger project this data is from will also bring in additionalinsights from indepth interviews with children themselvesparents and educators Nevertheless while stakeholderparticipants interviewed were privileged in many ways theirwork spread across the socioeconomic spectrum which meansthat their views are certainly informed by sensitivity to largerIndian contexts Policy formulation in this area and more importantly implementation needs to take exible approach that is sensitive to multiple lived realities of children across India Certainly contextual factors like age gender family background education income and ruralurban location feedinto these differences But this is both the challenge and value ofqualitative research that while drawing out broad themes likely to resonate across situations there is acknowledgment ofvariations therein Another limitation is digital learning and social connectedness have been greatly affected in the pandemicrelated lockdownWhile this study was conducted preCOVID future researchmust consider how these relationships affect young people andmedia literacy in India in the context of virtual learning working from home and greater social isolation during the pandemic Further research using culturecentered approaches to medialiteracy and digital citizenship are needed within the GlobalSouth including in India Additionally as this study revealsbeyond youth and parents conducting research on otherstakeholders who shape media and educational policies areimportant to consider within media literacy scholarship inorder to fully understand

mNutrition initiative is five year global programme supported by he UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO managed and supported by the GSM Association GS MA and implemented by in country mobile network operators MNOs and third party providers that seeks to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults in low income countries around the world The mNutrition initiative is implemented through existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in countries throughout sub Saharan Africa and South Asia FCDO committed to conducting an independent evaluation of the mNutrition initiative Given the scale of the mNutrition service the decision was made to select two countries for inclusion in the evaluation the mHealth service in Tanzania and the mAgri service in Ghana The mNutrition intervention that is the focus of the evaluation in Tanzania and of this report is an integrated service that combine an existing SMS based health communication campaign that target ed pregnant women and mothers of young children known as Healthy Pregnancy Healthy Baby HPHB with approximately nutrition focused SMS messages in Swahili The combined service is called Wazazi Nipendeni and is managed by Cardno and delivered through platform implemented by Rasello The combined service sendsout SMS messages timed to the stage of pregnancy or age of child The service is designed to provide relevant information for pregnant women and children up to the age of five in order to affect beliefs and behaviours in key nutrition related areas including infant and young child feeding IYCF and womens dieta ry diversity in recipient households Evaluation design The aim of the impact evaluation is to assess the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of the mNutrition service The evaluation is being conducted by consortium of researchers from Gamos the Institute of Development Studies IDS and the International Food Policy Research Institute IFPRI and it relies on variety of different tools and methods to collect evidence on the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania Broadl the evaluation can be classified into three distinct but closely integrated components qualitative component quantitative component and business model and cost effectiveness component Given the complexity of the partnerships involved in the Nutrition projects Osterwalder and Pigneurs inductive approach to business model generation is used as framework for the research summarised in Annex The aim of this endline report is to provide detailed description of each of the building blocks of the business model canvas based on insights gained throughout the duration of the study This business modelling report draws on the quantitative component which employed cluster randomised controlled trial to identify the causal effect of the service on nutrition knowledge IYCF practices womens dietary diversity and the nutritional status of young children Surveyed households villages randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered access to the mNutrition content on mobile phone free of charge through door todoor in person visit households in villages randomly assigned to the control group did not receive any offer of access The framework is used to describe business model in the nine building blocks of the business model canvas At the centre of the canvas is the Value proposition half of the remaining blocks are customer facing eg customer segments and channels and the other half focus the internal workings of the organisation eg activities and partners Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact to the service Baseline and endline surveys were conducted at two year interval Details of the methodology can be found in Gilligan et al The history of Wazazi Nipendeni The original GSMA and FCDO vision for the mNutrition rogramme was to create something different to the many exist ing pilots which up to that point focused on utilising mobiles and smart devices to strengthen health systems The intention of the mNutrition programme was to offer consumer facing product at scale The original vision was for convening space or clearing house which any party interested in providing health related services could subscribe to This onestop shop would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services with infrast ructure and agreements with MNOs already in place any institution wishing to set up an mHealth information dissemination service other related value added services VAS could do so at relatively low cost This concept was ambitiousand centred around getting potentially competing organisations to collaborate Eventually timescales conspired against that concept and GSMA entered into more conventional partnerships with mobile operators They identified in Tanzania an mHealth Tanzania Public Private artnership mHealth Tanzania PPP which was supporting consumer facing product for pregnant women called Wazazi Nipendeni The product was something of an exception to the original intention as it was hosted by public private partnership PPP that although it ha agreements with four mobile operators was independent of any single MNO The Wazazi Nipendeni service and the mHealth Tanzania PPP can trace its roots back to one of the earliest information and communication technologies ICT for devel opment pilot projects Voxiva funded by InfoDev The Voxiva system was deployed in in Peru and enabled real time data collection data analysis and dissemination of response information using public payphones When the Presidents Emergency Plan or AIDS Relief PEPFAR programme was launched in it partnered with Voxiva as part of consortium in Rwanda PEPFAR was keen on working with PPPs and it set up seven multi country PPPs in one of which was Phones for Health in which Voxiva and GSMA were partner amongst others In the Phones for Health programme set up local PPP in Tanzania and in the name was changed to the mHealth Tanzania PPP Then Cardno was contracted to manage the mHealth Tanzania PPP under five year agreement covering the period Most recently the appointment of health specialist as the team leader signals shift in the focus of the PPP away from technology and towards public health The Wazazi Nipendeni service Insights into the Wazazi Nipendeni service are described using the structure of the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas Customer segments The vast majority of active users were women who had given birth Although men are recognised as key customer segment supporters which includes husbands make up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users Value proposition Evidence from the quantitative study confirm the quality of messages Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received and ver of users either always or very often found the messages useful indicat ing that the messages are highly valued Over of users of females and of males would recommen the service of females and of males self reported implementing at least one tip and he Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact vi quantitative study confirmed that that access to the service did lead to changes in some nutrition related behaviours Channels In the Tanzania DHS sur vey respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni mostly through the adio The single largest reason for not receiving messages was that users had lost their SIM Registration data show that up to of users were registered by partners This highlight the importance of partners in getting users onto the system Customer relationships Customer relationships are important for acquisition retention and compliance Registration data confirm the importance of field partners and the face toface interac tion they provide in encouraging users to register for the service Opt out rates were lower among users who had been registered by partners High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Revenue streams and indirect bene fits Average revenue per user ARPU was higher among users Control households spent an average of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment com munities The qualitative study found this was due to women becoming more confident in using their phones There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni had reduced churn Key resources The content database was brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP with additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through their Knowledge Bank resour ce The new technology platform offers improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities The key resource in convening partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre TFNC and its linkages to both national nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country Key activities Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP have good networking contacts with which to broker partnerships with fi eld nongovernmental organisations NGOs and MNOs This facetoface field presence is important given that messages play an important role in reinforcing and supporting the efforts of health workers TFNC also played an important role in localising content Key partnerships Wazazi Nipendeni is unique in the complexity of the underlying partnerships Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Content development Technology platform Telecoms operators Field partners Government agencies During the study he mHealth Tanzania PPP has successfully revised agreements with MNOs negotiated partnerships with new health agencies and migrated the system to local platform provider Costs and investment Since the baseli ne study more detailed breakdown of costs has been provided by partners and has been used as the basis for the financial analysis The per country mNutrition budget was just over million for mHealth projects but the investment needed to replicate he content was estimated at localising content user experience UX research and monitoring and evaluation Fixed costs were dominant notably administration staff and the cost of the platform even when SMS messages were costed at retail pri ces User numbers The report includes an analysis of registration data provided by Rasello which contained known anomalies encountered when porting data from the old to the new platforms working dataset covers two year period between December and October New registrations were running at an average of around month whereas people were leaving Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact vii the service at less than month ie of new users When combined with the number of users already on the service as at November this gives an estimate of active users as at Nov ember The majority of users were signed up as pregnant women were general information seekers and were supporters of one type or another There is peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Data on the opt outs suggest that if women used the system throughout their pregnancy then they liked it and continued to use it in motherhood Optout data te nd to confirm he TFNC hypothesis that women who were assisted with registration might have stronger commitment to the service stay on the service for longer be more likely to read the messages and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours Busines models and sustainability Under the current arrangement the mHealth Tanzania PPP is funded by public money from international donors and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by the MNOs The osts of developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service were covered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as part of its public health programmes The osts of developing the additional nutrition content were covered by the mNutrition programme The service is funded and regarded as providing public good which it undeniably is In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni it is difficult to argue case for financial viability of the mHealth Tanzania PPP because none of the partners generates revenue directly from providing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Indeed all parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the Government of Tanzania has ruled that all health services should be free to consumers However the quantitative res earch has found that ARPU increased among users so it is possible to develop business case for MNOs to provide an mHealth service on the basis of indirect benefits should this be the model that is transferred to another country Two hypothetical commer cial models have been explored in detail Commercial content provider This speaks to the opportunity for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country At revenue share with MNOs ie all TZS usermonth in increased ARPU goes to the content provider the model suggests the service would break even at the beginning of Year However the rate of return on investment over four year time horizon would be negative Given the assumed trajectory of growth in user numbers much greater revenues are generated if the timescales can be extended Therefore at revenue share the service could generate positive internal rate of return IRR of over sixyear period However rate of return highly sensitive to revenue share at revenue share ie the MNO retains only of the increase in ARPU the IRR turns negative MNO in house service There is also hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO in another country sets up an mHealth service in house The key differences from the commercial content provider scenario considered above are that the MNO would retain all of the additional revenue generated and there would be no real costs associated with the SMS messages sent If SMS messages and unstructured supplementary service data USSD sessions are zero rated then the service would break even in Year although it would not generate enough cash to provide positive return on investment over fouryear period Assuming the same trajectory of increasing users the large number of users rising to million would generate enough revenue to provide IRR in five year period However Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact viii it should be noted that Wazazi Nipendeni as PPP has gained users across all four MNOs and it is not clear whether an MNO in house service would reach as many users Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as national serv ice available through multiple networks and does not therefore have particular poverty focus An MNO providing service has the flexibility to charge SMS and labour at cost price or lower which is important for free or low costs services Reach is however limited to customers of the MNO In balanced competitive market third party models can buy SMS from multiple MNOs which increases their reach in underserved areas where only one network is available Reach is also increased where third party providers enter into agreements with implementing health agencies that focus on vulnerable communities in rural areas BB models Voice based services eg outbound dialling can overcome literacy and language constraints among the extreme poor but ar expensive The extreme poor could also benefit from emerging data based services that use audio and video but these are also expensive and there is danger that they may require level of digital literacy skills that would render them inaccessible It would appear therefore that SMS is the only viable option for free services where minimising cost of sales is crucial Conclusions The Wazazi Nipendeni service offers strong value proposition to users It is highly valued by users over of househo lds read the content they received over of users found the messages useful satisfaction levels were high and over self reported implementing at least one tip The quantitative study found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had modestly improved range of nutritional outcomes most notably diets among young children Field partners play crucial role in providing face toface presence that supports users by getting registered reinforcing messages and enhancing the effectiveness of he service SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women SMS may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for subSaharan Africa and the country is united by the lang uage of Swahili It is important to target men with awareness raising so that they are more likely to permit partners to access phones However it is less important to enrol men as users on the system The mHealth Tanzania PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for reaching the next generation of users given increasing use of smartphones social media and the internet As Wazazi Nipendeni can trace its roots back to Voxiva in the study highlights the importance of long history of inve stment partnerships and political commitment in nurturing facility to the point where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service and other service at national scale The ability to broker complex set of partnerships with diverse range of stakeholder groups has been crucial to the success of the service These partnerships have been successful due at least partly to the personal skills of the mHealth Tanzania PPP team The Wazazi Nipendeni service yields substantial ind irect benefits to mobile operators in terms of increased ARPU The effect size had in the quant itative study was at least increase in ARPU TZS month and is likely to be higher still at national scale This is as result of women becoming more confident in their use of phones There was no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni users held on to their SIM cards for longer reduced churn Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact ix Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni generates real revenue for operator opens up possibilities for alternative commercial business models Analysis has focused on two hypothetical cases representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country An in house mHealth service developed by an MNO appears to be the most attractive proposition for two key reasons Firstly all of the increase in revenue is retained by the MNO and secondly the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal Based on an initial investment of to cover the cost of product development UX research monitoring and evaluation content localisation scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU indicate that service could provide an IRR of approximately over fouryear period Less attractive although possibly still viable is an independent content provider model the provider would need to pay bulk SMS price for all messages sent and it would need to share revenue with each participating operator scenario based on posit ive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU and revenue share indicates that service could only provide positive IRR over year period However it is unlikely that an aggregator could convince an MNO to sh are increased ARPU as an indirect benefit tracking and allocating such would be challenge The business model continues to be multi sided platform business model that provides value to funders with health mandate Ministry of Health Community evelopment Gender Elderly and Children MoHCDGEC and CDC who pay for the service thereby enabling users to access it free of charge As the MoHCDGEC assume responsibility for more of the activities conducted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP the business model will tend towards hybrid of government tocitizen model and the multi sided platform Despite vulnerabilities of the current business model to continued funding from CDC and free SMS messages donated by MNOs the model articulated by the mHealt Tanzania PPP appears to be sustainable The mHealth Tanzania PPP continues to enter into agreement with new public health programmes recent policy documents suggest that continued donor funding is likely to be forthcoming and negotiations with CDC for renewed donor funding are at an advanced stage There may be merit therefore in the donor funded business model In the event that health information service provider is permitted to levy charges eg in other countries ossible mechanisms for revenue generation include charg ing NGO gov ernment clients sponsoring of messages as form of advertising eg by fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies and commission from sales of private health sector financial products eg life insurance Telecommunications companies have come under pressure from the Government of Tanzania as part of its anti corruption campaign Companies have been required to make shares available to the Tanzanian public and several mobile compani es have been charged with range of charges including tax evasion Support for Wazazi Nipendeni has political capital in this context and operators have now signed agreements directly with MoHCDGEC rather than indirectly with the mHealth Tanzania PPP Previously operators promotion of Wazazi Nipendeni has been weak so they should be supported to capitalise on the positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni Although SMS remains an appropriate medium for reaching women data based services may split the market Emerging mHealth services exploit the potential of the internet of smartphones of data acquisition and analysis and of mobile money services This is consistent with trends in the telecoms market of rowth in data and mobile money mHealth Mobile phones

managed by GSMA and implemented by in country MNOs and third party providers to use mobile technology that ought to improve the health and nutritional status of children and dults in the developing world The potential to utilise mobile technology to change attitudes knowledge behaviours and practices around health and agriculture for improved nutritional status has been recognised for some time but to date there have been no rigorous evaluations of services at scale consortium of researchers from Gamos IDS and IFPRI were contracted to conduct rigorous mixed methods evaluation to estimate the impact of mNutrition on children and adults and to understand how the co ntext and the components of the mNutrition intervention shape its impact In Tanzania the service Wazazi Nipendeni focuse on the provision of nutrition and health information and services to vulnerable pregnant women and caregivers of children under he age of five on their mobile phones with the goal of improving nutrition outcomes and behaviours for mothers and young children Objectives The mNutrition evaluation intends to understand and measure the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viabi lity of the mNutrition product using mixed methods evaluation design The evaluation includes quantitative component qualitative component and business model analysis The evaluations were conducted by onsortium of researchers from Gamos IDS and IFPRI The team drew on number of methods and interlinked workstreams to gather evidence about the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania quantitative impact evaluation employing cluster randomis ed controlled trial to determine the causal effect of the service qualitative impact evaluation which consists of three qualitative data collection rounds ie an initial exploratory qualitative study in depth case studies at midline and rapid explanatory qualitative work after the quantitative endline survey data collection which aims to provide an understanding of the context underlying mechani sms of change and the implementation process of mNutrition and business model and cost effectiveness evaluation emplo ying stakeholder interviews commercial and end user data document analysis and evidence from the quantitative and qualitative evaluations to generate business model framework and to estimate the wider imputed benefits from the VAS for the range of sta keholders involved The mixed method evaluation design aims to address the following research questions specified in the terms of reference Annex What are the impacts and cost effectiveness of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture services on nutrition health and livelihood outcomes especially among women children and the extreme poor How effective are mobile phone based services in reaching increasing the knowledge and changing the behaviour of the specific target groups Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Has the process of adapting globally agreed messages to local contexts led to content that is relev ant to the needs of children women and poor farmers in their specific context What factors make mobile phone based services effective in promoting and achieving behaviour change if observed leading to improved nutrition and livelihood outcomes How ommercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level What lessons can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile phone based nutrition services to ensure behaviour change and continue private sector engagement in different countries Research questions of the business modelling component The business model and cost effectiveness constituent of the evaluation is designed to contribute evidence to help answer the first of the broad resear ch questions specified in the terms of reference Annex and can be considered as specific to the following research questions What are the impacts and cost effec tiveness of mobile phone based nutrition services on nutrition health and livelihood outcomes especially among women children and the extreme poor How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level What lessons can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile phone based nutrition services to ensure behaviour change and continued private sector engagement in different countries The mNutrition intervention is being external ly evaluated in two countries In Tanzania where the research consortium is evaluating mNutrition within broader mHealth service the intervention aims to promote behaviour change around maternal and early childhood health and nutrition The target grou of the quantitative component was therefore comprised of pregnant women and caregivers of children under the age of five years who reside in rural areas of the study region Iringa In Ghana the intervention was implemented via an mAgri culture programm in which nutrition information has been integrated with crop information as part of package of agriculture support services The target group were lowincome farmers in rural areas throughout the country The terms of reference refer to the impacts and effectiveness of mobile phone based services so the scope of the evaluation is the mobile based service as deployed under the mNutrition programme rather than the incremental impact of support provided through the mNutrition programme For th quantitative sample of pregnant women and caregivers of young children in rural Iringa that were selected to participate in the quantitative study the evaluation focuses on estimating the causal effect of access to the mNutrition service The business modelling relies on other components in the evaluation study To determine whether the mNutrition programme in Tanzania was meeting its stated objectives and targets the quantitative impact evaluation employ ed cluster randomis ed controlled tria to determine the causal effect of the service That is the evaluation identif ied how nutrition related behaviours knowledge and outcomes were altered for service beneficiary households relative to their counterfactual levels it sought to determine what the value of the outcome would have been for beneficiary households in the absence of access to the mNutrition service While the quantitative evaluation was designed to produce evidence to contribute to the broader research consortiums answers to the first two questions listed in the terms of reference IFPRI also specified set of primary and secondary research questions that were answered using information collected by the quantitative research team For each of the primary and secondary research questions the evaluation focuse on estimating the causal impact of the offer of access to the mNutrition service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact and of registration for the mNutrition content among households induced to participate in the service by the treatment offer The primary research questions addressed through the quantitative evaluation were What is the impact of the mNutrition service on womens dietary diversity What is the impact the mNutrition service on IYCF practices What is the impact of the mNutrition service on nutritional status for children under months of age at baseline The three primary research questions specify the main outcomes that were studied under the quant itative component of the evaluation These directly contribute to answering the first overall study question of the mNutrition evaluation see Section above he impact questions feed into the cost effectiveness analysis presented here The intended audience for the business modelling endline report is FCDO along with other organisations involved in mNutrition and mHealth programmes globally including local MN Os and nongovernmental organisations NGOs implementing mNutrition services national governments in particular MoHCDGEC and TFNC in Tanzania international agencies and donors and community level health workers It should also be of interest to MNOs that are implementing or considering implementing similar service The reports from the evaluation will be publicly available on IFPRIs and IDSs websites Purpose and scope of the business modelling endline report This report is milestone in the evaluation study it documents the journey of the Wazazi Nipendeni service in Tanzania supported by GSMA and FCDO over the duration of the evaluation The report is one of four endline deliverables This report should be read in conjunction with the base line business modelling report Batchelor et al the endline cost effectiveness report Batchelor et al and the quantitative endline report Gilligan et al which provides evidence of the impact of access to the service on both primary and secondary outcomes The qualitative endline report Barnett et al gives additional insights into consumer priorities and behaviours and how the service was used The baseline business modellin report covered the initial data gathering stage up to March At this point the GSMA grant was finishing but the service continued to develop as it had had received direct funding through the mNutrition programme so progress was in no way depend ent on the mNutrition support The findings from the four endline deliverables described above will be combined and triangulated in workshop planned for The two day workshop will examine the insights from the quantitative qualitative cost effect iveness and business modelling components of the evaluation and will be attended by the lead partners from IDS IFPRI and Gamos responsible for each of these components The main purpose of the workshop will be to disseminate learnings from the impact ev aluation in Tanzania This qualitative research report is commonly referred to simply as the qualitative research throughout this report Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Organisation of the report Section describes the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania while section describes the broader evaluation design The business modelling narrative tracks changes that have occurred during the course of he study and the reasons behind the decisions made so Section starts by reviewing the thinking behind the mNutrition programme and by exploring the history of the mHealth Tanzania PPP The business modelling canvas is reviewed in Section partly by summarising findings from the baseline report bu enhanced with further details gathered in the intervening period The mHealth Tanzania PPP managed to source registration data requested by the team and so based on these data the analysis presented in Section provides insights into growth trends how people use the service and the importance of partners Estimates of active user numbers from this analysis form the basis of the financial model used to explore the financial viability of the current business model as well as hypothetical scenarios that represent possibilities for setting up similar service in another country Section Telecoms is an important and dynamic market and Section presents an overview of key developments that have taken place during the study period focusing on the political economy and technical developments Finally Sections and present discussion of key issues raised in the report along with set of conclusions and learnings Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact The mNutrition intervention The mNutrition initiative is five year global programme supported by FCDO managed and supported by GSMA and implemented by in country MNOs and thirdparty organisations that seeks to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults in low income countries around the world The mNutrition initiative was implemented through existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in countries throughout sub Saharan Africa and South Asia The nutrition content aim ed to promote behaviour change around key farm ing practices and around dietary and child feeding practices likely to result in improved nutritional health within household In Tanzania the mNutrition service that is the focus of the evaluation and of this report was an integrated programme that enhance an existing SMS based health communication campaign targeting pregnant women and mothers of young children known as HPHB The mass media programme accompanying the service is called Wazazi Nipendeni The Wazazi Nipendeni programme is CDC funded pr oject bringing together multiple partners contributing towards shared goals Phase of the service launched in was initially developed in coordination with the Tanzania Capacity Communication Project United States Agency for International Develo pment USAID funded service led by JHCCP Wazazi Nipendeni is one of several behaviour change services using methods as diverse as TV drama series radio distance learning for community health volunteers and several integrated mass media campaigns The ass media campaign was developed by JHCCP while the SMS component of the campaign is led by the mHealth Tanzania PPP The PPP was initiated by MoHCDGEC with financial support from CDC Wazazi Nipendeni is available nationally and on all phone networks The HPHB SMS service sen free text messages with healthcare information to pregnant women mothers with newborns and male supporters and general information seekers in Tanzania to drive health seeking behaviour The SMS messages were sent in Swahili to omen up to weeks postpartum on range of pregnancy and early childhood issues timed to coincide with the stage of the pregnancy and the age of the child Anyone interested in receiving healthy pregnancy information can text the word MTOTO child the short code Registrants receive instructional messages allowing them to indicate the womans current week or month of pregnancy or the age of the newborn baby during the enrolment process This process allows the recipients to receive specif ic text messages relevant to the time and stage of pregnancy or early childhood The message frequency also varies depending on the life stage of the woman and child ranging from nearly daily during key periods of pregnancy to less than weekly for mothers of children over the age of two Nutrition related content was small component of the original HPHB SMS service but was expanded substantially with the addition of the content contributed through GSMA under the mNutrition service mNutrition added rough ly nutrition messages which are delivered to mothers or caregivers of children up to five years old At the beginning of the study period HPHB and mNutrition were available to households in all regions of Tanzania on all mobile phone networks Participating individuals receive the text messages free of charge The resulting product is referred to as the mNutrition service in the remaining sections of this report The nutrition messages included in the mNutrition service were drawn from factsheets on nutrition related behaviours identified as key determinants of outcomes that were developed by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition GAIN together with local partners the Centre for Counselling Nutrition and Health Care COUNSENUTH and Everymobile The information contained in these factsheets was then adapted to the context of Tanzania and made mobile ready by the local content providers under the guidance of MoHCDGEC and TFNC As part of the adaptation process the message content was tested with potential users in Tanzania after which Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact the language and substance were adjusted and messages that were identified as not being useful were removed from consideration for the final service The message testing process high lighted the importance of replacing technical terminology that was likely to be unfamiliar to the message recipients with language that was more commonly used but that still conveyed the evidence based content of the original factsheets Included in the fi nal service are messages that encourage the consumption of iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy and messages that promote vitamin rich complementary feeding practices and the inclusion of animal source foods in young childrens diets as well as mes sages providing information on other behaviours accepted as being critical determinants of nutrition outcomes For more details on the intervention see the baseline report Gilligan et al Study region context The United Republic of Tanzania is an East African nation with an estima ted population of million of whom reside in rural areas World Bank As at of working age males and of working age females were employed in agriculture International Labour Organizati on with the main agricultural export commodities including tobacco cashew nuts coffee cotton and sesame seed Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Tanzania is divided into regions and regions are further subdivided into total of districts Child undernutrition is pervasive problem in Tanzania particularly among young children In the DHS of children under five were identified as being stunted height forage score below Wasting is less common with only of measured children under five having weight forheight score below the threshold Ov er half of measured children between and months of age are anaemic DHS The quantitative and qualitative components of the evaluation took place within the three rural districts of the Iringa region in Tanzania Iringa rural Kilolo and Mufindi Figure displays the location of Iringa region in Tanzania Iringa became an independent region in efore which it was part of the Southern Highland Province As at the Population and Housing Census the total population of Iringa region was estimated to be million of whom resided in rural area Agriculture is the primary means of livel ihood for most households in the rural parts of Iringa region roughly of households in Iringa rural of households in Mufindi and of households in Kilolo are involved in agriculture At the time of the census verage household size was nd the adult literacy rate was among the rural population Population and Housing Census In Tanzania more broadly ch ild undernutrition is severe problem in Iringa of children under the age of five in the DHS were stunted This figure was nearly percentage points higher than the national average suggesting child malnutrition may be more prevalent in Irin ga than elsewhere in Tanzania Additionally of children under five were wasted and of children aged months of age were anaemic In part Iringa was selected as the location for the study because of dearth of existing relationships betwee mHealth Tanzania PPP and organisations with presence in the region Consistent with this the mNutrition baseline qualitative report found that households in study villages typically rely on health workers at local health clinics and community health orkers for their nutrition information needs Often the information from health clinic workers is received during antenatal visits which also involve the provision of non nutrition related information testing and other services sometimes leaving little time for issues related to nutrition Barnett et al Though at the start of the study there was limited availability of nutrition information and nutrition services the Government of Tanzania has prioritised improving nutrition outcomes nationwide through different initiatives see more detail in the basel ine report Gilligan et al Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Iringa region in Tanzania Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Summary of the quantitative component approach The quantitative evaluation was designed as cluster randomi sed control trial with two stages of randomi sation village level randomi sation where villages were assigned to treatment group or to control group and household level randomi sation within treatment villages whereby households were either assigned to receive the mNutrition content on just the mobile phone of the primary female or on the mobile phones of both th primary female and the primary male In villages that were assigned to the treatment group sampled households were offered access to the mNutrition content on their mobile phone free of charge through door todoor in person visit In villages that were assigned to the control group no offer of access to the service was made Though registration for the mNutrition service was possible for all households regardless of treatment assignment prebaseline discussions with the organisation implementing he mNutrition service in Tanzania suggested that takeup of the ir existing service was low in the study region From the randomly selected sample of villages participating in the evaluation IFPRI randomly assigned households in half the villages to tre atment group where sampled households received door todoor offer of access to the content and households in the other half of participating villages to control group that did not receive similar offer Because the assignment of villages was random any average difference in outcomes between households in the two groups can be attributed to the difference in access to the mNutrition service In addition to the village level randomisation the evaluation also included second stage household level randomisation within treatment villages households in treatment villages where both the mother of the young child or pregnant woman the primary female and the primary male own distinct mobile phones and were surveyed were randomly allocated to ei ther just receive the Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact mNutrition content on the mobile phone of the primary female or to receive the mNutrition content on the mobile phone of the primary female and the mobile phone of the primary male FM By comparing behaviours and outcomes between treatment households in the FM group and those in the group and contrasting both the and the FM group to households in control villages that would have been eligible for the household level randomisation it was expected that learnin would be generated about how information flows between spouses Summary of the qualitative component approach The sample selection for the qualitative study was purposive and based on the quantitative baseline data Three sites were selected from the sam ple of treatment villages At community level the main data collection tools were semi structured in depth interviews with treatment mothers and fathers ie mothers and fathers who were signed up to receive Wazazi Nipendeni plus mNutrition messages by the Oxford Policy Management OPM Tanzania team during the quantitative baseline survey key informant interviews and focus group discussions with treatment mothers and fathers and elderly women Indepth interviews were conducted with mothers who had signed up to receive the Wazazi Nipendeni mNutrition service on their phone or their partners mobile phone as part of the baseline survey Indepth interviews were also conducted with fathers whose partners were signed up to the service who received me ssages on behalf of or in addition to their wives Key informant interviews were conducted with influential and knowledgeable people in each village including village chairmen andor community health workers The purpose was to explore their knowledge aw areness and opinion of the mNutrition messages that people in the community had been receiving and to capture information on current contextual issues relating to maternal and child nutrition Focus group discussions were carried out with four or five articipants per group The aim was to select heterogeneous groups of mothers by occupation age number of children who had signed up to the Wazazi Nipendeni plus mNutrition service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Evaluation design Study design This report is constructed based on interviews with key stakeholders and access to secondary data list of contacts made can be found in Annex The study has used the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework to structur insights into the business model Osterwalder and Pigneur Few business models in the st century are straightforward and simple Production of product sales of the product and revenue from that product are only part of the overall model Revenues are often made based on associated advertising or on the value the product adds to the brand The landscape report published as part of this study details some of the possibilities for MNOs Barnett et al In this report we use the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas as basis for the analysis An introduction to the framework is given in Annex While this generally works well we acknowledge that the canvas is good for taking snapshot of business model but in this report documenting the timeline and history of the product is important These business model insights are intended to answer the key research question How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level In development sector in which public funds are increasingly under scrutiny for value for money the rollout of public good via private sector commercially sustainable mechanism is very attractive The heart of the question just quoted is predicated on assuring that future actions taken by donors and the private sector regarding similar products are informed and lessons are learned in order to increase the chances of sustainability Hence while we try to use the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework in an applied manne there are times when we have document ed the back story that lay behind certain decisions The aim of the baseline report was to provide detailed description of each of the building blocks of the business model canvas as at the time of the beginning of the independent study That report also provide review of operating experience since the beginning of the mNutrition projec on the basis that that may have provide the context for changes that had taken place in the product design This report builds on the baseline bringing the canvas up to date Data collection methods The endline report is based on information collected from multiple sources qualitative interviews conducted with stakeholders and MNOs in Tanzania commercial data provided by stakeholders and MNOs or brokered by GSMA monitoring data gathered by Altai data available in published literature additional unpublished information on costs and business models from overnment stakeholders and alternative service providers the quantitative component of the study led by IFPRI Gilligan et al and the quali tative component that focused on consumer perceptions led by IDS Barnett et al Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Processing information Evaluation activities carried out by Gamos to inform the endline report include the following Field visits to establish and maintain relati onships with key stakeholders Interviews conducted with key representatives of stakeholder institutions to gather additional data to populate the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework Ongoing communication and field visits undertaken to monitor developments in services and to track the commercial justification for changes Populating the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas with information gleaned from reports previously published under the mNutrition programmes eg UX testing case studies rapid feedback surve ys etc as well as grey literature Working with IDS and IFPRI to contribute to the design of both qualitative and quantitative instruments both baseline and endline to incorporate indicators relating to non financial attitudes of customers to servic es and to MNOs in particular such as customer satisfaction and brand loyalty These instruments also explore attitudes towards alternative services offered by other providers eg media face toface extension Interview ing alternative service provide rs to explore alternative business models among alternative mobile services Analysing financial data with view to creating financial model to test key cost sensitivities The process of enquiry and information collection was flexible and responsive to events on the ground given that the service offerings were constantly evolving eg the publication of significant outputs from the research project This component of the evaluation is therefore based on opportunistic gathering of data from key individuals such as representatives of the core partners and other partners to the project Ethical considerations and approval As an overall guiding principle the research team sought to conduct themselves in professional and ethical manner throughout the work with strict respect for the principles of integrity honesty confidentiality voluntary participation impartiality and the avoidance of personal risk These principle were informed by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Development Assistance Committee Quality Standards for Development Evaluation and FCDO Ethics Principles for Research and Evaluation which have been followed for the duration of the evaluation Overall this component draw on the qualitative and quantitative data collected in the other two components of the evaluation which have their own ethical protocols The key business modelling data sources are stakeholder interviews with MNOs and data collection commercial and monitoring data from MNOs and other relevant organisations Although most research participants were familiar with the mNutrition programme and with the principle of independent evaluation this component sought to obtain the informed consent of participants This was achieved by sending them emails and briefing documents describing the research In particular we describe the relationship between the consortium FCDO and GSMA in order to avoid any possibility of deception Research activities with participants involve interviews only there were no observational activities Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact While this evaluation component has not involve any primary data collection from human su bjects at community household level ethical considerations are still considered important for all work carried out under this component In particular GSMA remain highly aware of the commercial sensitivities of their partner MNOs so the issue of commer cial confidentiality is very important for this area of work given that it relies on the sharing of sensitive commercial data Therefore the Gamos team has paid specific attention to this issue as part of their ongoing work The Gamos team is currently operating under the nondisclosure agreement signed by GSMA and OPM during the inception phase of the project Where relevant stakeholder respondents were informed that nondisclosure agreement with their trade association has been si gned and that the interview was bound by it All the data being gathered fell within the scope of this agreement eg development business plans marketing operations and finances although there is provision that such information should be designat ed as proprietary or confidential For the avoidance of doubt all internal reports shared by Gamos were marked as confidential and were not to be circulated outside of the evaluation team Any outside reporting will not contain any detail that could be construed as proprietary or confidential information All external reports were and will be shared with key research participants in early draft form in order to establish principles of trust and reciprocity This is to ensure that participants have an opportunity to confirm that their views have been reported accurately and that publications do not breach their confidentiality requirements As this component draws on qualitative and quantitative data collected through the other two workstreams appropri ate measures were taken to ensure that the shared data are anonymised and there is no risk of confidentiality breach For the quantitative data unique household ID has been assigned to each household which allows for following up with respondents as necessary without providing access to any personal information on datasets that are made available for analysis Similarly all qualitative transcripts are anonymised and pseudonyms given and any information that can lead to personal identification has been removed Limitations The methodology relie on the willingness of key stakeholders to share their data and their thoughts In commercial environment this is not always forthcoming and limitation of the report is that it relies on these shared data Risks associated with this transfer of data have been mitigated as much as possible by clear communication and follow up with stakeholders Sensitivities among the major mobile operators along with structural changes and turnover of staff made it difficult for GSMA and the study team to build rela tionships with MNOs Changes in relationships and personnel among all stakeholders were the principal threats to the mitigation strategy The mHealth Tanzania PPP has been instrumental in securing the data used in the report The agreement permits Gamos to share confidential information among the team if they need to know they have entered into confidentiality agreement and they are not competitor Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Wazazi Nipendeni the back ground The vision for mNutrition The original GSMA and FCDO vision was to create something different in mHealth They had seen many mHealth pilots that utilised mobiles and smart devices to strengthen the health system of various countries and to offer consumer facing product at scale Many pilots existed but few if any scaled activities that were coordinated with the health service nationwide The terms of reference state that under the mNutrition programme GSMA was to provide assistance to MNOs and partnerships to scale up services Annex FCDO vision then was to create service that could achieve scale by being made available to MNO subscribers GSMAs original vision was for convening space or clearing house which ny party interested in providing health related services could subscribe to The complexion of the institution that would manage the clearing house was not specified It could be some kind of collaborative membership organisation or it could be managed by private sector organisation typically an aggregator it would anyway require an aggregator to set up the links to each of the MNOs in the country The key feature of this vision was that it would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services the infrastructure and agreements with MNOs would already be in place so any institution wishing to set up an mHealth service could use the arrangement to send mobile based information at relatively low cost By creating focal point for mHealth services opera ting within the country it would also promote coordination collaboration and sharing of resources thereby helping to address the all too frequent complaint of duplication of effort By devolving responsibility for content including the nature of the services to be made available by participating organisations the concept had the potential to support the dissemination of diverse content and to support innovative mechanisms for reaching resource poor mobile phone users The system was expected to work as follows The managing institution would secure short code valid on all networks The first time users would dial into the system they would be guided through series of menus and questions to complete their profile They would then be routed to re levant information based on their profile eg gender pregnant mother or mother of child under two Once routed to relevant menus they would be presented with options regarding which type of information they wanted to receive and within that type of information they could choose from relevant content providers Once they had chosen the content provider the profiling information would be sent to that content provider and the user would be signed up to that partners service which may or may not in clude further profiling Services were to be made available on freemium basis ie certain information was to be available to users for free and they would need to pay for other premium content The nutrition messages generated as part of the GSMA mNutrition programme were to be made available as free messages In early GSMA was negotiating with Green Telecom Tanzanian private sector company that had been founded just over year earlier about role as nutritional messaging service It appeared to offer good fit with the kind of partner that GSMA was looking for as it had links to each of the mobile operators and was in the business of developing low cost mobile solutions to enable its clients to reach consumers The company was fo rmed as result of merger between an aggregator and platform developer so it had all the technical skills needed In the end Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact however GSMA entered into partnership with Wazazi Nipendeni which had proven track record in delivering SMS content to mothers The original concept was ambitious and centred around getting potentially competing organisations to collaborate which is time consuming business Eventually timescales conspired against that concept and in the first wave of countries GSM entered into what might be regarded as more conventional partnerships with mobile operators The partnership in Tanzania with the Wazazi Nipendeni product is something of an exception to this rule as it is hosted by PPP that although it has agreement with mobile operators is independent of any single MNO History of Wazazi Nipendeni Voxiva was founded in as disease surveillance system that enabled health workers to submit local reports of disease outbreaks using phone This was one of the arliest examples of an ICT based innovation developed to solve developing world problem The system enabled realtime data collection data analysis and dissemination of response information back to health workers in the field Initially set up in Per the Voxiva system was later replicated in Africa When the PEPFAR programme was launched in it partnered with Voxiva as part of consortium in Rwanda Casas and Lajoie Voxiva then provided link from early pioneering work on exploiting mobile technology in public health to the subsequent Phones for Health programme PEPFAR was keen on working with PPPs as mechanism for achieving its objectives and it set up seven multi country PPPs in PEPFAR one of which was Phones for Health Phones for Health was PPP between Accenture Development Partners GSM Motorola MTN and Voxiva All fund ing initially came through PEPFAR but was administered by CDC Other organisations involved in he PPP incl uded the USAID rivate Sector Engagement Unit and the Organisation for Global AIDS Co ordination Although the PPP was riginally intended to be implemented in countries only Kenya and Tanzania signed up and committed funding In Tanzania ctivities ere transitioned from Voxiva to local organisations in he transition was facilitated through CDC with management oversight from Phones for Health In the Phones for Health programme issued call for interest in creating local PPP for mHealt in Tanzania The CDC foundation described Phones for Health as pilot and this next step was intended to bring services to scale In the name of the local PPP then changed from Phones for Health to the mHealth Tanzania PPP CDC managed the mHealth Tanzania PPP from to and then contracted ardno to manage the mHealth Tanzania PPP under five year agreement covering the period GSMA has played an instrumental role in the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP It was one of the original partner in the Phones for Health partnership in GSMA twice nominated the programme as one of the five most successful mobile health interventions and it was selected for an award This was important as the profile helped to secure the support of mobile operators for the service CDC view the mHealth Tanzania PPP as success story as it is rare to see successful transition from centrally held programme to country held PPP and especially one in which there is true partnership with the national ministry of health Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Partnerships The mHealth Tanzania PPP evolved as group with expertise in brokering partnerships which are defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partners fall into range of categories represented in Figure MoHCDGEC Multiple departments within the ministry have convened various initiatives

mNutrition programme Wazazi Nipendeni as an mHealth service offers good fit with MoH CDGECs eHealth Strategy and supports the Government of Tanzanias commitments under the Open Government Partnership Content providers Over the course of multiple initiatives various organisations mostly NGOs have assisted with the development of content to augment the Wazazi Nipendeni database this includes number of MoHCDGEC departments Mass media organisations These have worked with content partners to generate multimedia outputs this was largely funded by JHCCP under the Tanzania Capacity and Communications Project Telecoms partners Airtel Tigo Vodacom and Zantel These provide zero rated SMS messages at the heart of the system This represents the largest single cost item of the service if valued at market rates for SMS messages The four largest MNOs in the country have partnered with Wazazi Nipendeni messages are funded through their corporate social responsibility CSR departments and the Vodafone Foundation Technology platform The service was origi nally facilitated by the open source Vusion platform provided by TTCM originally non profit However this system had number of shortcomings many of which were consequence of the technical setup In October the system migrated to new plat form commissioned by MoHCDGEC funded by CDC and provided by Tanzanian company Rasello Implementing

Figure Organisations involved in Wazazi Nipendeni Source Authors The original Wazazi Nipendeni text messaging service did not have the capability to deal with voice messages but voice messages were developed as part of the local content development process in Tanzania Under separate agreement GSMA subsequently commissioned HNI now Viamo to incorporate the mNutrition content into its service provided in partnership with Vodacom Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Tanzania In contrast to Wazazi Nipendeni the service is pull type of service whereby users dial short code and navigate through interactive menus to find the information they are seeking The system mostly plays audio clips to users rather than sending SMS text messages interactive voice response IVR scripts were selected to be integrated into the health service and were recorded Developments in Tanzania The revise Wazazi Nipendeni service including the additional nutrition messages incorporated under the mNutrition programme was officially launched by the Minister of Health Community Development Gender Elderly and Children during World Breastfeeding Week in ugust In line with the strategy articulated at the baseline MoHCDGEC continue to assume greater responsibility for functions previously carried out by the mHealth Tanzania PPP especially the technical operations The mHealth Tanzania PPP continu es to work closely with MoHCDGEC staff in the field and estimate that there are roughly health workers currently active in promoting and registering women onto the system The Rasello platform is tool that is paid for and used by MoHCDGEC The mH ealth Tanzania PPP continue to be responsible for the technical management of the platform The ICT Unit in MoHCDGEC have responsibility for wide range of digital tools used in different aspects of health services not only those that use mobiles to disseminate information to clients MoHCDGEC programmes that

diagnosis system HIV The mHealth Tanzania PPPs relationships with MNOs has changed Originally the mHealth Tanzania PPP signed agreements on behalf of MoHCDGEC but now MNOs are changing to sign agreements directly with MoHCDGEC For example Tigo and Halotel have signed new agreements to provid zerorating of messages with the ministry rather than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP Funding from Vodacom is transitioning from the Vodacom Foundation to the commercial Vodacom company which will also be entering into an agreement with the ministry This reflects growing awareness among MNOs of the value of their support for Wazazi Nipendeni which is important to them given the current political climate see Section This shift is consistent with the sustainability plan of the mHealth Tanzania PPP to transfer responsibilities to government agencies Rapid staff turnover within the telecoms industry continues to pose challenge for the work of the mHealth Tanzania PPP For example here was change in leadership at Tigo and responsibility for Wazazi Nipendeni was transferred to completely new team which changed the CSR priorities to education and financial inclusion so that Tigo wanted to discontinue support for Wazazi Nipendeni It is likely that this was linked to changes in the company structure following the acquisition by Tigo of majority stake in Zantel see Section The mHealth Tanzania PPP with the support of nutrition officer from MoHCDGEC had to put lot of effort into convincing the new Tigo team of the value of Wazazi Nipendeni and eventually secured an ag reement to continue their support Similarly after time and effort had been invested in building relationships with the CSR contact at Airtel that tangency then moved on The mHealth Tanzania PPP continue to run public awareness campaigns from time to ti me When it runs particular campaign that is sponsored by particular MNO it has to make sure the promotional materials only have the sponsoring MNO branding Some MNOs put limit on the number of messages that they will donate in year This will cau se increasing difficulties given the current registration growth trend evident in Figure Under the arrangement with Rasello MoHCDGEC departments and MNOs have been given their own dashboards so they can access up todate predefined metrics on registrations However even the dashboard furnished to the mHealth Tanzania PPP only gives access to predefined metrics meaning it does not have direct access to the back end database Any request for nonstandard reports requires specific request to be made to Rasello to construct query there is no additional cost for these requests The PEPFAR country operation plan acknowledges the mportance of the role that the mHealth Tanzania PPP plays in leveraging the support of MNOs The plan pledges to further expand its activities with the mHealth Tanzania PPP and emphasises the leadership role of government agencies Expand mHealth PPP and support implementation and expansion of Fast Track ARV refills FASTA initiatives under NACP and MOH leadership PEPFAR Although the current management contract with Cardno is due to expire in negotiations between the mHealth Tanzania PPP nd CDC for subsequent phase are already at an advanced stage It is proposed to divide responsibility for the suite of products currently supported by the mHealth Tanzania PPP between three main partners Ministry of Health Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Management Development for Hea lth MDH Tanzanian NGO providing research and services on public health Management Sciences for Health MSCH public health non profit working in over countries This will provide continuity of funding from CDC as CDC is major donor to both of the se management programmes It is expected that new management contract will go out to tender possibly for further years as is typical for CDC funded programmes Looking to the future there is growing recognition of the role of nutrition in HIV programming Good nutrition is important for people who are HIV positive and good nutrition is required for ARV therapies to be successful Therefore nutrition is becoming larger part of ov erall HIV support packages In terms of technology GSMA and the mHealth Tanzania PPP were keen to develop the service to include IVR which it was thought would improve reach into poorer communities with lower levels of literacy and would enable users to actively seek information rather than passively receive SMS messages However this proved not to be popular when they trialled it and MNO partners remain reluctant to zero rate IVR calls Nevertheless they would like to try again with the technology An other idea for providing two way communication is to work with partners who can provide call centre facility The mHealth Tanzania PPP is considering ways of exploiting the reach and power of social media which is becoming increasingly popular among you ng men and women Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Review of the business model Introduction This section is structured around the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas building blocks This section summarises key observations made in the baseline report supplemented with additional findings from the intervening period as well as finding from both the qualitative and quantitative studies An introduction to the canvas and more detailed description of Wazazi Nipendeni as it relates to the framework are provided in Annex Customer segments At registration use rs are allocated to one of four categories pregnant women mothers with newborns supporters of pregnant women or young mothers and general interest The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP covers users registered onto the system during two year period from November to November During this time many women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth and were then re categorised on the system as mothers with newborns Figure shows that these women make up the vast majority of active users Figure Mix of active users as at November Source Authors Phone ownership and access are key to ccessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Having at least one household member that owned phone was part of the screening criteria for the quantitative study so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service and phone ownership In terms of access men were reluctant to let their wives have phones fearing they would be used to facilitate affairs and women themselves recognised that phone ownership can cause problems in the family because of trust issues Among young married women who Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact are the primary customer egment it tends to be husbands who control their access to phones either through consent to ownership by buying handset SIM for their wives or by sharing their own phones with their wives The qualitative study highlighted the importance of enlisting mens support for if not participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni service as means of facilitating womens access to content For example the quantitative study found that womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as they often did not share them with their partners They also found that men often disagreed with some content particularly that on family planning in which case they would withhold access to the messages and would not share information with their partners As national service that is available through multiple networks Wazazi Nipendeni is available all across the country wherever there is network coverage It does not therefore have particular poverty focus However the majority of users were signed up by field partners who tend to focus rogrammes on rural and low income communities Value proposition The aim of the original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign was to encourage women to avail themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health outcomes Content had been developed over number of previous partnerships each of which had slightly different thematic focus including prevention of mother tochild ransmission of HIV Aids antenatal care family planning malaria prevention nutrition for mother and baby danger signs having an individual birth plan and postpartum care The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by contributing substa ntial additional nutrition content Added content cover ed life stages up to five years key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was the procedures put in place to ensure quality of information TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content was accessible and consistent with national nutrition strategies UX research was conducted early on in the project to ensure that messages were appropriate how they might fit with different types of consumers the archetypes and how to improve the customers experience of the service GeoPoll tested small sub sample of messages for comprehension and relevance ThinkPlace conducted user focused research using human centred design principles Frog later conducted further UX research based on in depth inte rviews Evidence from the quantitativ study appears to confirm the quality of messages Value and satisfaction metrics among treatment household members were high Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received Over of users either always or very of ten found the messages useful see Figure Figure shows that information on maternal

endline report ePact Figure Most and least useful mNutrition message topics by gender Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their behaviours as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range nutritional outcomes Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved as follows Dietary diversity for children aged month The number of food categories consumed increased by value The likelihood that children aged months met the minimum dietary diversity Children in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to have consumed from four food groups value Children aged months in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet Diets among women of reproductive age primary females had also improved The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women had increased by perce ntage points value Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices among men There was statistically significant impact on the combined household level measure of nutrition knowledge Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Channels In the Tanzania DHS survey respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni Note that the five year TCCP programme started in and finished in so the DHS survey will have been conducted when the programme had achieved nearly maximum reach Radio was clearly the single channel that achieved greatest reach of people had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni from the radio Table About quarter of respondents had heard about the campaign on the television with another quarter doing so through printed media poster magazine newspaper billboard Table Responses to question How did you hear about the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign How did you hear

Authors own based on DHS dataset accessed September During the initial campaign as part of the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP printed materials were distributed to range of health facilities where women come into contact with health professionals eg hospitals health centres dispensaries The mHealth Tanzan iaPPP worked in partnership with the health sector providing training for health professionals who were then able to help women register on the system There are three ways of registering for the Wazazi Nipendeni text messaging service analysis can be found in Section Assisted by health facility worker women can be signed up when they come for antenatal care visits etc Assisted by community health workers community workers can sign women up when they visit them in their homes or other local venue Selfregistration instructions were given in the multimedia campaign People dial the short code and then are guided through small number of profiling qu estions category of user and stage of pregnancy age of child Registration data show that of users were registered by partners It is not possible to determine exactly how many of the other users actually registered by themselves but were re gistered using USSD suggesting that they were in fact registered or at least assisted by health worker This means that up to of users were registered by partners Although mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nip endeni Multiple response respondents may have heard of Wazazi Nipendeni through multiple channels ie adds up to more than Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact campaign it is facetoface contact through partners that is instrumental in signing people up TFNC also believes that people who register with health professional will have positive bias to comply with messaging have better understanding how the service works and be more likely to appreciate how they can benefit from the service Figure confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health matters government more so than NGO facilities It is interesting to note that even among control communities people have high levels of trust in information from automated text messages confirming that text messages are regarded as being reliable and of high quality Patterns of who people actually get information from Figure broadly reflect levels of trust although they emphasise the importance of government health workers Figure Trust in sources of health information Source Authors Percent who agree they would trust information from each source Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Sources of health information Source Authors The qualitative research identified number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with womens lifestyles text messages can be read repeatedly audio messages may be heard incorrectly as messages remain on the phon they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any time and text messages are private they remain on the phone which tends to be regarded as personal device audio messages can be overheard by others It should be noted that the SMS channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa and the country is united by the language of Swahili Customer relationships The aims of the customer elationship that Wazazi Nipendeni creates with users can be considered to be threefold Acquisition Those who were assisted with registration have quite different relationship with the service to those who self registered Registration data confirm the importance of field partners up to of users were signed up by partners see Section Retention Several features of the system minimise pain points that might promp users to leave system The service is free of charge The system only requires users pregnancy or maternal status to be gathered at registration Content is regarded as relevant and of value Retention levels are high registration data indicate tha the number of people opting out of the service is equivalent to roughly of new users in month The adult literacy rate in Tanzania is compared to an average for sub Saharan Africa of data from Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Compliance with improved health practices High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Nearly of those who self reported having ever received the content read all messages received and over self reported implementing at least one tip Wazazi Nipendeni has strong brand which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the service and users tend to view it as MoHCDGEC service as the Government pushed it through the media Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP comes from CDC it can be argued that the most important relationship is that with CDC Providing evidence that the service is delivering improved health outcomes is important Revenue streams and indirect enefits Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge users so there is no direct revenue stream The service has also been made available free of charge to field partner institutions In the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be permitte to charge for these information services In the end the Government insisted that health information should be made available to citizens free of charge which constrained opportunities for developing commercially sustainable business models This is national policy issue The mHealth Tanzania PPP is currently funded by CDC although the successful functioning of the service depends on contributions by various partner organisations The service is therefore vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding fr om CDC Current funding is planned to The service also depends on the zero rating of text messages by partner MNOs There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni has resulted in lower churn The quantitative study found no difference in the length of ime that respondents reported having had their main SIM card there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone number as they had at baseline two year duration and there was no difference in the proportion who subscribed to the same operator as baseline ARPU was higher among users Control households spent an average of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment communities The qualitative study found this was due to women becoming more confident in using their phones The latest DHS data indicate that of people across the country had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni see Table TCRA data for October give the total number of subscribers on the four partner networks as million Therefore Wazazi Nipe ndeni users represent of the entire subscriber base Although MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not use the reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni in their promotional materials they are beginning to recognise the political value attached to their support for Wazazi Nipendeni By signing agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni directly with the Government rather than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution www tcragotzindexphpquarterly telecommunications statistics Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key resources Key resources are efined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition The primary assets employed by the mHealth Tanzania PPP in delivering the text messaging service are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages The current content comprises the pre existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource The text messaging service originally ran on the Vusion platform developed by TTCM in partnership with the Praekelt foundation In October Waza zi Nipendeni migrated to new platform created for MoHCDGEC by loc al software developer Rasello The new platform is able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track the number of users and messages being sent The text messaging service designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign so the field partner programmes and interventions are key resource required to deliver the full potential of the value proposition To date partners have assisted with registering users in the fiel see Section The key resource in convening these partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with TFNC and its linkages to both nation al nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country Early in the mHealth Tanzania PPP appointed new team leader While the previous country manag er came from mobile technology background the new team leader is medical professional This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP as Government agencies take greater ownership of the platform along with associated technical responsibilities Key activities In order to make the business model work perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be undertaken is networking Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP clearly have good personal contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs and to enlist the support of MNOs The Global Content Partnership was mandated to create higher level generic content and little provision was made for creating specific locally relevant messages Under the original vision it was expected that participating organisations would tailor global content to their own needs When this idea was abandoned additional funding was made available for EveryMobile and COUNSENUTH to localise content TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content generat ion process However TFNC adopted much more proactive role and its involvement has continued to deepen throughout the project When the content generation process was changed to facilitate the production of more detailed localised content TFNC got mo re involved TFNCs engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that signing off procedures went smoothly knowledge bank Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Monitoring and evaluation is key activity as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni makes tow ards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with forthcoming health interventions Providing face toface presence when work ing with women is important for achieving positive behaviour change The qualitative study foun that messages acted as reminders to reinforce information provided by health workers and to reinforce mothers existing knowledge Registration scheduling and the dispatch of messages to users is handled by the technical platform This is sub contrac ted to Rasello as the platform provider and management is being gradually transferred from the mHealth Tanzania PPP to MoHCDGEC Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant eg new drugs and products will be introduced and recommende practice will be modified People will quickly lose trust in information that is not immediately useful or even worse wrong One of the partners needs to be given the responsibility and funding for ongoing maintenance of content Key partnerships The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC is defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Wazaz Nipendeni was riginally conceived as prevention of malaria in pregnancy campaign following an analysis by JHCCP of the Tanzania DHS data The mHealth Tanzania PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put together by JHCCP and MOHSW Content Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by MOHSW to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Organization WHO Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action Content on family planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproducti ve Health mRH Content for Prevention of Mother toChild Transmission was designed by EGPAF TFNC was instrumental in securing the support of the SBCC TWG for nutrition in approving content Technology platform The service was originally run on the usion open source platform developed by TTCM The system architecture led to problems with reliability latency and cost The service was migrated to new platform in October It was hosted locally by Rasello and was commissioned and paid for by MoH CDGEC with CDC funding Telecoms operators The mHealth Tanzania PPP had identified MNOs as key partners at the start However MNOs needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched wit hout explicit support from MNOs but after the service achieved users within weeks the MNOs entered into agreements Field partners The programme launched in November with twomonth nationwide media campaign radio and TV follow up campaign ran from July to February during which field partners promoted the service and assisted with registrations In addition to the field partners see Table that have formal agreements with the mHea lth Tanzania PPP launched in May by USAID and Johnson Joh nson with supporting partners the United Nations Foundation the mHealth Alliance and BabyCenter pilot project ed by Family Health International with MOHSW and funded by USAID Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact PPP and have source ode allocated on the system other agencies have simply incorporated registering women onto Wazazi Nipendeni into their field processes Analysis of registration data suggests that field partners may have assisted up to of users to register Governmen agencies The Government of Tanzania is committed to number of relevant health policies on nutrition sexual and reproductive health and maternal mortality and to number of information and ICT policies including open and accountable government and electronic access to health services Costs and investment The baseline report presented set up and ongoing costs covering two year period mainly derived from costs reported by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and GSMA Now that more detail has been provided these costs have been superseded by more comprehensive and rigorous analysis which is presented in Section In ad dition to those costs directly associated with the mHealth Tanzania PPP both operating and capital FCDO and GSMA have invested in wider programmatic costs that stimulated and supported this action It is worth noting that the mHealth Tanzania PPP has history of donations and in kind contributions made over the years by the CDC and programme partners The business odel It is proposed that Wazazi Nipendeni is based on multi sided platform business model which is commonly associated with IT businesses This provides means of making product free to one group of customers while another group pays Wazazi Nipendeni brings together two groups providing link between funders who pay for the service and users who receive the service for free see Figure Funders with health mandate benefit from improved health outcomes achieved by users Field level partners cannot really be considered third side to the platform because they already have their own link to users through their field presence The relationship with Wazazi Nipendeni can be considered as simple business tobusiness transactional arrangement as described Wazazi Nipendeni provides valuable service and partners drive users to the system Figure Key partnerships business model Sources Authors Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact The trengths and weakness of the business model can be summarised as follows Partnerships are key feature of the mHealth Tanzania PPPs way of working and have been instrumental in securing resources that have made the service success The PPP core team have continued to forge new alliances with ield partners as they implement new health interventions Links with the overnment of Tanzania have been strengthened over the duration of the evaluation study as MoHCDGEC has assumed greater responsibility for the technical platform in particular The iability of the model is vulnerable to discontinuity in revenue ie it depends on CDC funding On the one hand five year fixed term agreements provide security but on the other hand the mHealth Tanzania PPP is facing uncertainty now the agreement is shortly to expire Nutrition content may not be continuing priority for CDC which focuses on HIV tuberculosis and malaria in Tanzania Now that it has been shown that the VAS generates substantial incre ases in ARPU it may be possible to argue case for some kind of revenue sharing agreement with MNOs further research is required to explore viable mechanisms for this The reach and brand of the service is attractive to field partners DHS data showed that over half of adults were aware of Wazazi Nipendeni in and the quantitative study found that of people in the control sample had received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni Wazazi Nipendeni offers strong value proposition Not only are qual ity metric for the messages high eg levels of trust frequency of reading messages customer satisfaction ratings but users also report changing their behaviour so the service is valued by users The quantitative study has shown that the service is linked to improved nutritional outcomes notably an increase in dietary diversity among infants demonstrating value to partner health agencies such as TFNC and to donors such as CDC Indirect benefits in terms of increased ARPU provide strong commer cial basis to justify the in kind contribution made by MNOs to the service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Analysis of users Overview The mHealth Tanzania PPP submitted Wazazi Nipendeni registration data from the Rasello platform to the authors The query was performed on March working

suggesting that many could well have been registered with the assistance of field partner It is not therefore possible to determine precisely how many users truly self registered ie without any ssistance Up to of all users could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of partner if API and USSD registrations are included Figure Registrations by partner Source Authors

month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Users who were supporting pregnant women lso tended to sign up at the end of the first trimester Users who registered as mothers and supporters of mothers mostly signed up within the first month after giving birth Most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women and left before giving birth The relatively low number of women in the PWMC category leaving suggests that women who used the system throughout their pregnancy liked it and then continued to use it in motherhood The subset of data that represents users who have egistered and then left the service is relatively small TFNC hypothesised that women who were assisted with registration might have stronger commitment to the service stay on the service for longer be more likely to read the messages and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours Table sheds some light on the users leaving the service While of those registered by partners using USSD subsequently dropped out only of API registrations opted out Only the general public continued to register using the short code so only of those with no partner can be classified as self registered

report Batchelor et al it was proposed that the relationships between key stakeholders could be regarded as multi sided platform business model This provides means of making product free to one roup of customers while another group pays When considering financial viability the principal cost components are as follows Operating costs mHealth Tanzania PPP offices staff servers Government agencies staff costs SMS and USSD costs MNOs and field partner agencies staff costs and expenses Fixed costs developing content Global Content Partnership and localising of content mNutrition programme support eg GSMA business intelligence and developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service mHealth Tanzania PPP It is difficult to argue case for the financial viability of the mHealth Tanzania PPP because none of the partners generate revenue directly from providing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Indeed all parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the Government of Tanzania has ruled that all health services should be free to consumers However the quantitative research has found that the ARPU increased among users so it is possible to develop business case for MNOs to provide an mHealth service on the basis of indirect benefits these are discussed in Section If there is commercial case for MNOs to provide an Health service then there is case for third party to provide content on revenue share basis as with conventional VAS Under the current business model MNOs made no investment in developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service but they have donated the MS messages and USSD sessions that the service depends on Without any investment standard financial metrics such as IRR or payback period are not relevant In this case the contribution margin gives an indication of financial performance or the contri bution that the product makes to group profit This analysis goes on to consider the financial viability of two scenarios An independent but commercial content provider The provider invests in localising content assuming nutrition and maternal health ontent is in the public domain and manages both the technical systems and arrangements with national health programmes in the same way as the mHealth Tanzania PPP It provides information services as VAS to MNOs on revenue sharing basis An in hous MNO service The MNO invests in localising content assuming nutrition and maternal health content is in the public domain and sets up an internal product development Per unit revenue indirect benefit variable costs Contribution margin is often expressed as percentage when divided by the per unit revenue Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact group to manage technical systems and to make alliances with national health programme in the same way as the mHealth Tanzania PPP financial model has been created to explore each of these options based on cost data submitted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP Cardno CABI and GSMA The financial odel The model is based on operating cos structure and cost data provided by Cardno supplemented by data gathered through interviews These cost data include quantification of in kind contributions made by MNOs donating SMS and USSD sessions and partner NGOs mainly time Key to the mode is an estimated profile of user numbers which is the basis of calculating revenues from indirect benefits and variable costs The profile of active users in Figure suggests numbers are continuing to rise given roughly constant rates of new subscriptions and relatively low rates of opt outs This is likely to be the case for at least five years at which time early users will start to leave the system as their chi ldren reach five years of age It is estimated that there were over active users on the system at the beginning of the period for which reliable data are available which were used to calculate the trends in Figure described in Section The financial analysis is based on four year period during which the number of active users can be expected to continue to rise as illustrated in Figure Figure Estimated user numbers profile for fouryear period Source Authors Cash flow is calculated from estimates of revenues and variable costs which depend on the customer numbers profile as well as fixed costs Details of cost components and estimates are presented in Annex Cash flow operating profit revenue cost of sales fixed costs Given the concerns over the quality of the early data the number of active users as at November has been rounded down from to Mobile phones nutrition

disaggregated by MNO Cost of USSD sessions Fixed costs Administration expenses mHealth Tanzania PPP project management staff costs platform travel Government institutions inkind staff costs NGO partners inkind staff costs Product development content curation The analysis considers the viability of the service from various perspectives including the MNOs under the current arrangements but also possible commercial scenarios Therefore it considers investment costs incurre in developing the product for roll out in specific country The following investment costs have been included in the model see Annex global content developme nt localisation of content eg developing appropriate messages seeking necessary approvals and support service provided by the mNutrition programme formative evaluation UX consultants Note that no direct grant payments were made to the mHealth Tanzania PPP under the mNutrition programme Public good odel Under the current arrangement the mHealth Tanzania PPP is funded by public money from international donors and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by the MNOs Given the governments position that the service cannot be charged for and the increasing role of the MoHCDGEC in the delivery of the service it is not likely that any shift towards more commercial business model will take place in the foreseeable futu re The osts of developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service have been covered by CDC as part of its public health programmes The osts of developing the additional nutrition content have been covered by the mNutrition programme The service is funded and egarded as providing public good which it undeniably is However the quantitative study has shown that the MNOs are reaping tangible if indirect financial benefit from the service This section considers the value of this benefit to partner MNOs unde the current arrangement Financial reporting by the mHealth Tanzania PPP quantifies the financial contribution made to Wazazi Nipendeni by each of the supporting MNOs It does this by estimating the number of SMS messages donated by each MNO and then mu ltiplying that by the consumer retail price of SMS messages In the absence of any payment to Wazazi Nipendeni for the content the cost of Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact messages is the only variable cost but it varies between MNOs according to the different SMS retail prices The quantitative research found that ARPU be TZS higher among people who used Wazazi Nipendeni compared with those who did not use the servi ce Given an ARPU of TZS per month month among the control sample this indicates that the VAS stimulates increase in ARPU This is supported by the finding from the qualitative research that women became more comfortable and confiden in using their phone when they received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni implying that they then used their phone more using more airtime Given the user growth profile in Figure the contribution margin flattens out at see Figure The cost of SMS messages is directly proportional to the number of active users However the cost of USSD sessions relates to the number of new users which is assumed to be constant despite monthly fluctuations At high user numbers this cost component becomes much smaller proportion of variable costs dropping from of variable costs in Year quarter to of variable costs in Year quarter This explains why the contribution margin is lower at lower user numbers Note that the variable costs in Figure are based on the aggregated costs across all four MNOs each of which has been allocated different charge rates for SMS messages according to their retail prices at baseline Table shows the sensitivity of contribution margin to SMS price at high user numbers Figure Contribution margin Source Authors Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Table Contribution margin for each operator asymptotic MNO partner SMS price TZSSMS Contribution margin Year Vodacom Airtel Tigo Halotel Source Authors own The price attributed to sending SMS messages is clearly highly influential in determining how attractive their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni appears to operators So hat is the cost to an operator of sending an SMS In study on the impact of consumer consumption of network services voice SMS and data on network profitability Blackburn et al highlight trend towards flatrate pricing as opposed to pay as you go They point out that one feature that makes this attractive to operators is that the cost of delivery is small fraction of the retail price Keshav concluded that the cost of sending an SMS message was likely to be less than SMS or of the per unit price charged to pay as you go customers in the USA Lack of clarity on the true cost of sending SMS message continues to plague development cost modelling For example in study of an mHealth intervention in Tanzania Mangaone et al modelled scenarios using standard SMS charge rates SMS along ith reduced rates SMS and SMS representing negotiated bulk purchasing agreements The analysis up to this point has been based on the retail prices given in Table which can be interpreted as representing an opportunity cost to the MNO However given that MNO are sending out messages to thousands of users it could be argued that bulk SMS price would be more realistic price of TZS SMS for example would give contribution margin of If on the other hand there is no real cost to the MNO of sending SMS messages then the contribution margin tends towards The contribution margin is measure of how much product contrib utes to fixed costs and thereby to profit once fixed costs are covered However it takes no account of any investment made in developing product so it cannot be used as predictive measure of the likely financial viability of developing product IRR is widely used for this purpose The model indicates that over four year period mobile operators donate texts and USSD sessions totalling nominal value of million However over the same time period the indirect benefit of ARPU sums to total of million which represents real financial gain The other indirect benefit often credited to VAS is reduction in churn Tricarico However the quantitative research did not find any evidence that people using the Wazazi Nipendeni service had owned their SIMs for longer Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because consumers are not tied in to contracts the Tanzanian market is predomi nantly prepaid so high churn rates might be expected However in rural or underserved markets where signal coverage is poor consumers often find themselves effectively tied in to single operator by virtue of being able to access only one network in the ir geographical location Therefore churn tends to be lower in rural areas The quantitative study was carried out in Iringa which is largely rural district so it is not surprising to find low rates of churn making it difficult to measure any differe nces in churn From mHealth Tanzania PPP financial report Halotel was not part ner in so was not included in the financial report This is the price given on the website accessed September Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Commercial content rovider The previous section highlighted the financial benefits to MNOs of offering the Wazazi Nipendeni service This opens up possibilities for the content provider to generate revenue through some kind of revenue share agreement with MNOs which in turn opens up possibilities for spinning off the content provider as commercially viable venture This section considers the financial viability of such venture as hypothetical case based on cost data from the mHealth Tanzania PPP It is intended to represent the opportunity for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs Nutrition content deve loped under the GSMA mNutrition programme is publicly available and open source so the raw content can be accessed and adapted at no cost There is real cost associated with localising content This includes framing the content in messages that are elevant and readily understandable by users as well as translating content into local languages In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni messages are all in written format for disseminating as SMS messages which avoids the considerable expense of making voice recordings that are needed for outbound dialling and other voice based systems Securing government approval of messages is major cost Health services tend to be highly regulated and the experience of Wazazi Nipendeni is that the health ministry was diligent in ensuring that messages be consistent with Government of Tanzania health policies good deal of time was spent negotiating the balance between making messages factually accurate yet at the same time informal and easy to understand An agency ould need to invest in product development as was the case with Wazazi Nipendeni which benefited from UX research and formative evaluation throughout the duration of the mNutrition programme both of which were funded through the GSMA mNutrition programm These costs sum to an investment of see Annex The following assumptions have been applied regarding operating costs the fixed operating costs associated with running the mHealth Tanzania PPP will not change the content will need to be continually reviewed and revised in order to keep it consistent with development in government health policy and practice and the agency would need to bulk purchase SMS messages from each client operator price of TZS SMS has been assumed It is assumed that the hypothetical agency would start from scratch with no pre existing users so the model is based on the profile of active users presented in Figure Note that no account has been taken of the in kind contributions made by government agencies and partner NGOs both of whom are critical to the success of service It can be argued that any government has vested interest in setting up service that has material benefit for health outcomes and so should forego any potential claims on the cost of the time they invest in mediating on behalf of the service provider Similarly it can be argued that the cost of the time Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact invested by partner NGOs including marketing and registering users is outweighed by the benefits that the service adds to their field programmes At revenue share with MNOs ie all TZS usermonth in increased ARPU goes to the content provider Figure suggests the service would break even at the beginning of year However the rate of return on investment over four year time horizon would be negative Given the assumed trajectory of rowth in user numbers much greater revenues are generated if the timescales can be extended Therefore at revenue share the service could generate positive IRR of over sixyear period However rate of return is highly sensitive to revenue share at revenue share ie the MNO retains only of the increase in ARPU the IRR turns negative Figure Profits commercial content provider Source Authors Projecting the user growth profile in Figure over further two years would result in total of million active users The population of Tanzania is million National Bureau of Statistics NBS and the average household size is MoHCDGEC so the number of households across the country is around million of the population is under five years of age NBS equating to million children under five If households with children under five had an average of two children both aged under five then the total number of households with at least one child under five would be million of all households This rough calculation su ggests that user target of million Wazazi Nipendeni users may be ambitious but is not impossible As revenue is generated solely from increases in ARPU the financial viability of such VAS is highly sensitive to that increase Up to this point th analysis has been based on the TZS month increase in ARPU found by the quantitative study on baseline level of ARPU of TZS among the control sample This is based on the effect of the random offer of access to the service in the quantitative study ie comparing ARPU between the treatment and control samples The study found that of the treatment sample and of the control sample reported having received nutrition messages by SMS in the last two years The study points out that this method of calculation was likely to underestimate effects but the authors were unable to calculate more specific effects with an reliability because of inconsistencies in the self reported access to the Wazazi Nipendeni messages They concluded that this was because respondents may not have been able to correctly identify the source of nutrition text messages received Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure shows how sensitive the financial viability of service is to this effect size and it shows that if the effect size was then service could be financially attractive over fouryear period Based on the proportions of both samples that reported receiving nutrition message by SMS the effect size could be double in which case the return on investment would be highly attractive Figure Sensitivity of IRR to increase in ARPU content provider Source Authors The large number of active users means that financial indicators are highly

Vodacom and Airtel has publish ed consolidated data covering five East African countries Airtel Africa quoting an ARPU of December TZS The quantitative study was conducted in Iringa rural district so measured ARPU levels would be expected to be below that national average Figure shows that if all other assumpt ions are held constant service would need to reach user base with an ARPU over TZS month

to increase in ARPU This raises the possibility that an MNO could justify creating an mHealth VAS on the basis of this increased revenue This section considers hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO in another country sets up an mHealth service in house The key differences from the commercial content provider scenario considered above is that the MNO would retain all of the additional revenue generated and there would be no real costs associated with the SMS messages sent The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs Nutrition content developed

categories see Annex Targeted client communication Untargeted client communication Client to client communication Personal healt tracking Ondemand information services provided to clients Client financial transactions The classification makes clear distinction between services providing unidirectional information dissemination to clients targeted and untargeted and client initiated services peer group citizen reporting and health information seeking Wazazi Nipendeni is an example of the first of these and is push service The Viamo service offered by Vodacom on the other hand is an example of clien tinitiated service and is pull service as it relies on the user to dial short code to access information In principle service could combine both aspects of communication as each has its advantages and drawbacks It is interesting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile phones This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions as they tend to use platform that manages payments between healthcare providers but the interaction with th client is done by SMS This reliance on SMS tells us two things Firstly SMS is good enough means of communicating with clients ie constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not rendered the services unfeasible Secondly SMS is regarded as the most cost effective medium for communicating with clients This is closely linked to the first point as voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraints but come at much igher cost The classification was drafted in so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet

the new platform makin agreements with MoHCDGEC to support Wazazi Nipendeni has been of value to MNOs in the political economy of the industry the overnment is regarded as trusted provider of

assessed IYCF practices and dietary diversity Wazazi Nipendeni resulted in improved childrens dietary diversity scores the likelihood that children satisfied the minimum dietary diversity hreshold and the likelihood that they achieved minimum acceptable diet Women were more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity threshold despite no evidence of changes in household level food consumption patterns Nutrition service impact Wazazi Nipendeni had no impact on child nutrition as measured by anthropometry The Wazazi Nipendeni service improved range of nutritional outco mes most notably multiple indicators associated with diets among young children Direct revenue TFNC stipulated that the Wazazi Nipendeni service was to be provided free of charge to users Indirect commercial value The Wazazi Nipendeni service increased ARPU by at least likely to be higher Wazazi Nipendeni did not reduce churn churn tends to be low and difficult to reduce in underserved rural areas running costs The theory of change implies that running costs are incurred by the same entity that receives revenue This is not the case with Wazazi Nipendeni where MNOs receive increased revenue but the mHeal th Tanzania PPP incurs costs At an SMS price of TZS revenue would exceed co sts at over users Commercial viability The theory of change implies that service would be viable if revenue exceeds running costs but this takes no account of return on investment Wazazi Nipendeni can trace its roots back through donor funded programmes to scenario for setting up hypothetical in house MNO service indicates it could provide positive IRR over four years but this has not been proven Setting up hypothetical independent content provider like the mHealth Tanza niaPPP would be less attractive providing positive return over six years Crowding in of the mHealth sector Having demonstrated the viability of the PPP and the reach of mobile services the mHealth Tanzania PPP has entered into agreements wit other field partners for Wazazi Nipendeni and has developed additional mobile services It is too early to say whether this has increased demand and funding for mobile services and it is too early to expect the private sector to move into the marke Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key Step fully realised Step partially realised Step not realised Insufficient information Source Authors own The Theory of Change in Figure reflects an emphasis on commercial sustainability that is consistent with the original Business Case which refers to the value of demonstrating sustainable business models in reducing risk for commercial investors The role of donor funded business models in the mHealth sector at the time was well recognised the nitial GSMA scoping study presented three services all of which were classified as having donor funded business models GSMA The original mNutrition documentation emphasised the role of private sector investment in taking mobile services to scale However he experience of Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also possible for donor funded mHealth services to reach scale In fact Wazazi Nipendeni reached substantially more users than any of the other mHealth projects supported through the mNutrition programme GSMA Although negotiations have yet to be concluded evidence to date suggests that the donor funded busine ss model can be effective in attracting further investment albeit from donors rather than the private sector Although not explicit in Figure one of the features the mNutrition programme is the potential for mobile services to achieve positive outcomes Nutrition service impact in Figure among poor and disadvantaged groups It has been pointed out that Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as national service available through multiple networks and does not therefore have particular poverty focus There are however implications for the ext reme poor arising from the different business models considered Two hypothetical models are considered in Section third party content provider and an in house MNO driven model An independent content provider would typically enter into agreements with organisations providing health services on the ground BB model whereas an MNO would offer service directly to their customers BC model Wazazi Nipenden is an interesting hybrid as the service is made available to MNO customers and at the same time the mHealth Tanzania PPP has entered into agreements with agencies implementing health programmes on the ground Cost of sales is key factor in any MNO dri ven model and must be balanced with any increase indirect benefits especially if the service is to be freely available as in Tanzania Literacy clearly presents barrier to accessing SMS based services Voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraints but are prohibitively expensive Third party models have the flexibility to buy bulk SMSs from multiple MNOs The partnership agreements that the mHealth Tanzania PPP has forged with MNOs are key feature of the service meaning that it is accessible to customers on all of the major networks This increases reach among the extreme poor who tend to live in underserved areas where signal coverage is poor and consumers have no choice of operator they can access only one network in their geographical location The agreements they have made with implementing agencies also increases reach among the extreme poor as field partners programmes tend to focus on vulnerable communities in rural areas Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact An mhealth service provider will tend to have focus on the health sector whereas MNOs have focus on upselling to maximise revenue from customer segment The lower spending power of the extreme poor makes it difficult for an MNO to justify investing developing services targeted at this group Emerging ata based services will be instrumental in overcoming literacy barriers eg using audio and video but not in the foreseeable future while data rich services emerging eg integrating financial se rvices will exclude the extreme poor who do not have the digital literacy skills needed MNOs The merged entity of Tigo and Zantel has market share close to that of the market leader Vodacom se Figure This threat to Vodacoms dominant position is likely to result in increased competition As operators look for innovations and opportunities to attract and keep customers they may well prioritise exploring commercial opportunities to capitalise on thei support for Wazazi Nipendeni Not only Wazazi Nipendeni but the operators will also be keeping an eye on competing and alternative mobile health solutions to spot opportunities The mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC will need to liaise closely with supporti ng MNOs to ensure that they continue to be satisfied that Wazazi Nipendeni provides commercial benefits and to engage in ways such that the service can be adapted to meet the changing priorities of MNOs Possible echanisms for revenue generation Despite the best efforts of GSMA to prompt innovative thinking on ways of generating revenue the mHealth Tanzania PPP model remains essentially unchanged save for greater involvement of MoHCDGEC The model may be forced to change if donor funding through CDC is not renewed when the current agreement expires in Stakeholders commonly mentioned the idea to charge field partners Firstly the mHealth Tanzania PPP could charge for providing messages to clients registered by the partner and secondly the mHeal th Tanzania PPP could charge for the time and effort spent developing new bespoke content for the partner on consultancy basis The trouble is that the first of these is symbiotic relationship the mHealth Tanzania PPP provides messages while the ield partner assists women to register in the field so could partners then charge the mHealth Tanzania PPP for each user registered Another possibility being pursued is getting private sector partners to sponsor messages as means of advertising TFNC as pointed out that it has guidelines on the types of goods that it would permit to be associated with Government endorsed health messaging eg food products would not be permitted The mHealth Tanzania PPP has also looked at bringing on insurance partn ers which is an interesting idea given the advent of new mHealth services using smartphone apps that use mobile money functionality This opens up possibilities not only for sponsorship but also for incorporating innovative payment features into the heal th messaging service eg discounts on insurance premiums for Wazazi Nipendeni users Trends in mHealth services Although mobile subscriber numbers continue to grow growth in internet subscribers is much greater The majority of mobile internet connect ions are and Tanzanias broadband coverage lags behind its neighbours martphone ownership stood at around of adults in well Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact below the median for sub Saharan Africa This all suggests that obile data use is set to grow and here is indeed an appetite among mobile operators to increase access to the internet and data use Further investment may be forthcoming now that disputes involving the major MNOs have been resolved The mobile money industry has grown rapidly in Tanzania and of the population had an account in Recent mHealth services are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet and smartphones in particular of data acquisition and analysis and of mobile money services Integrating mobile money mean that services can offer users the ability to pay subscriptions make purchases and access financial services such as credit and insurance For example Tigo partnered with micro insurance compan Milvik Tanzania to offer the BimaMkononi mobile insur ance service Customers can buy hospital insurance accident insurance and life insurance Premiums can be paid using Tigo Pesa or by cash at Tigo customer service centre The service takes advantage of the mobile money platform and provides an incen tive for users to join the mobile money service Financial viability and scenarios The commercial content provider scenario discussed in Section is based on the mHealth Tanzania PPP model but generating revenue through revenue share agreement with MNOs albeit indirect revenue One of the dilemmas facing VAS developers especially hose operating in the public goods space is whether to enter into an agreement with single MNO or to make their offering available across all networks Using multiple networks potentially increases the reach of VAS but it instantly eliminates one of the indirect benefits of VAS reduced churn There is no incentive for consumer to stick with given operator if service they like and want to use can also be accessed on other networks For this reason MNOs are generally only interested in enterin into exclusive agreements This means that the commercial content provider scenario considered in Section may be difficult to broker in practice The alternati ve of an in house MNO based service may therefore be more realistic option The financial modelling also suggests it is easier to make financial case for this model given that all of the increase in revenue would be retained by the MNO and the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal This is also closer to the majority of projects supported by the mNutrit ion programme which were led by MNOs although in most cases the MNO entered into partnership with VAS content provider Viamo was the VAS provide in four projects rather than setting up expertise in house see GSMA One of the potential drawbacks of this private sector led approach is that government may have reservations about lending its branding to corporate product The scenarios proposed above have been prompted by the increase in ARPU demonstrated by the quantitative study Reduced churn is further indirect benefit commonly associated with VAS when provided by an MNO yet the quantitative study found no evidence of reduced chur among Wazazi Nipendeni users Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because consumers are not tied in to contracts and the Tanzanian market is predominantly prepaid However in rural or underserved markets where signal coverage is poor cons umers often find themselves effectively tied in to single operator by virtue of being able to access only one network in their geographical location Therefore churn tends to be lower in rural areas mkononi insurance Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Looking back Looking back on the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP and the Wazazi Nipendeni service it is interesting to see how the strategy articulated at the baseline has largely come about with more partners entering into agreements with the mHealth Tanzania PPP to provide mobile based services and with the Government getting more involved and assuming more responsibility for the platform As part of this evolution the primary role of the mHealth Tanzania PPP appears to have shifted from technical to health The PPP was originally set up to dev elop the software and systems needed to deliver service but an understanding of public health now seems to be more important in dealing with MoHCDGEC and negotiating partnerships with health partners It is also interesting to note that the current mode closely resembles the original concept for the one stop shop articulated by GSMA at the beginning of the mNutrition programme The mHealth Tanzania PPP is the go to institution in Tanzania that can help programmes entering the country to set up mobil services more conveniently at lower cost and avoiding duplication rather than setting up independent services themselves The difference is that although the mHealth Tanzania PPP moderates complex partnership of public and private institutions it itself is effectively public body It is funded by public money through CDC and it has no desire to become for profit organisation The original GSMA vision was for private body to act as the aggregator or at least as form of cooperative that wou ld generate revenue to cover costs Looking to the future The mHealth Tanzania PPP and Wazazi Nipendeni are now approaching rucial point in time Firstly the agreement providing funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP is due to expire shortly and it is not yet clear whether CDC will continue to fund the PPP beyond this date Secondly advances in technology are leading to next generation of mHealth services that are smartphone based and delivered over the internet Increasing broadband coverage and fal ling smartphone prices mean that these services will be accessible to more of the population in the next few years Many new services incorporate financial services which can enable subscriptions purchases eg of pharmaceuticals and insurance These emerging services are attractive to MNOs as MNO led mobile money services are source of increasing revenue These services tend to be accessible only to people with higher levels of digital literacy so they carry risk of opening up further digital divide between better educated users and poorer users Thirdly recent changes in the structure of the telecommunications market may lead to increased competition and investment Disputes over the ownership of both Tigo and Airtel have been resolved These disputes prevented these companies from complying with the regulators requirement to float shares on the local stock market so they will also have impeded any plans for investment in the network or services Tigos takeover of Zantel has increased its market share so that it is closer to the leader Vodacom and this may result in increased competition between two close contenders for market leader Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Conclusions The product The Wazazi Nipendeni service offers trong value proposition to users In te rms of the value attributed to the service by users over of households read all the mNutrition content they received and over of users either always or very often found the messages useful Users also expressed high levels of satisfaction with th service as over of users would recommend the service likely or highly likely to recommend it to others There is evidence that users translated information from the messages int action Over self reported implementing at least one tip most commonly on complementary feeding Evidence of behaviour change was confirmed by the quantitative study which found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range of nutritional outcome most notably multiple indicators associated with iets among young children The success of the early nationwide awareness campaigns was still evident in the high levels of awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni found by the DHS surveys conducted in early Most respondents to the DHS su rvey had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni through the radio The quantitative study found that of respondents from the control sample had received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni Awareness levels among the public as whole would be much higher sugg esting that awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni remains high Initial users were encouraged through media campaigns to self register but more recently users have been assisted with registration by partners and health workers The relatively limited data on opt outs from the service indicate that users who self registered were much more likely to opt out compared with of users registered by partner using the API This confirms the value of face toface contact in the registration process and appea rs to confirm the hypothesis that adherence is likely to be higher among users who have been assisted with registration SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women Notwithstanding limitations associated with literacy and local languages the service was highly valued by users and messages were commonly read Having said that it is noted that SMS may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa an the country is united by the language of Swahili It is important to target men with awareness raising so that they are more likely to permit partners to access phones However it is less important to enrol men on the system as womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as men often did not share the phone with their partners Men would also not share information with their partners if they disagreed with the content eg information on family planni ng Men were registered on the system as supporters among others and made up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users less than Telecoms markets across Africa are shifting from voice to data as broadband coverage increases and data accou nts for greater share of operator revenues Smartphones are becoming more common as handset prices continue to fall and social media such as Facebook WhatsApp and Twitter are becoming popular among the young Although SMS currently remains the most appropriate channel for reaching the majority of the population at present users tastes are changing and the mHealth Tanzania PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for reaching the next generation of users Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Partnerships The Wazazi Nipendeni service and the mHealth Tanzania PPP can trace its roots back to one of the earliest ICT for development pilot projects Voxiva This illustrates the importance of long history of investment partnerships and political commitment in nurturing facil ity to the point where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service and other services at national scale This does not necessarily mean that start up could not achieve something similar but brokering the complexity and diversity of the partnerships involved is not trivial achievement The ability to broker complex set of partnerships has been crucial in the success of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been forged with diverse range of stakeholder groups including Government ministries multiple programme funders eg CDC JHCCP content providers eg GAIN field partners technology providers and partner MNOs These partnerships have been successful due at least partly to the personal skills of he mHealth Tanzania PPP team Business model MNOs have an opportunity to capitalise on the positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni by using it in promotional materials To date it appears that operators promotion of Wazazi Nipendeni has been weak Airtel re leased press statement following the publication of the GS MA case study that acknowledged the contribution of MNOs Tigo mention Wazazi Nipendeni as part of its CSR activities under the Tanzania page of its website and Vodacom Tanzania Foundation has web page that describes Wazazi Nipendeni There are additional possibilities for further engagement with Wazazi Nipendeni such as training freelancers on registering users and increasing or abolishing any caps on the number of messages sent Further eng agement can be justified based on the increases in ARPU found in the quantitative study The quantitative study has shown that the Wazazi Nipendeni service yields substantial indirect benefits to mobile operators in terms of increased ARPU The effect size in the quantitative study area was at least increase in ARPU TZS month and is likely to be higher still nationally This is as resu lt of women becoming more confident in their use of phones They make and receive more calls and SMS messages This represents real financial benefit to MNOs as result of their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni As the real cost to an operator of sendin SMS messages is low tending to zero there is no cost of sale associated with this increase in revenue The study found no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni users held on to their SIM cards for longer reduced churn This may be at least in part due to he rural nature of the Iringa district given that churn tends to be lower in rural areas making it difficult to achieve any differences in churn Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni generates real revenue for operators opens up possibilities for alternat ive commercial business models Analysis has focused on two hypothetical cases representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country An in house mHealth service developed by an MNO appears to be the most attractive proposition for two key reasons Firstly all of the increase in revenue is retained by the MNO and secondly the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal Based on an initial investment of to cover the cost of product development UX research monitoring and evaluation content localisation scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU indicates that service could provide an IRR approximately over fouryear period Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Less attractive although possibly still viable is an independent content provider model similar to GSMAs original vision In this case the same investment costs have been assumed but the provider would nee to pay bulk SMS price for all messages sent TZS SMS and it would need to enter into some kind of revenue share agreement with each participating operator scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU the effect size increase in ARPU and revenue share indicates that service could only provide positive IRR over sixyear period The business model continues to be multi sided platform business model that provides value to funders with health mandate MoHCDGEC and CDC who pay for the service thereby enabling users to access it free of charge One of the principal funders was MoHCDGEC but as it assume responsibility for more of the activities conducted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP inc luding the Wazazi Nipendeni service the business model will tend towards hybrid of government to citizen model and the multi sided platform as the field partners will still support both Wazazi Nipendeni and users and the MNOs will still provide in kind funding for messages Although the original vision for mNutrition articulated the role of private sector investment in taking mobile services to scale Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also possible for donor funded business model to reach scale and to attract further investment albeit from donors rather than the private sector Telecoms industry Rapid staff turnover within the MNOs continues to pose challenge for the work of the mHealth Tanzania PPP When support was given as part of CSR activit ies it depended on personal relationships so effort was constantly required to establish relationships with new staff As support for Wazazi Nipendeni becomes integrated as part of commercial operations which is increasingly the case given developments in the political economy of the telecoms industry the importance of personal relationships may diminish Telecommunications companies have come under increasing pressure from the Government as it continues to exert pressure as part of its anti corruption campaign Companies have been required to make shares available to the Tanzanian public and several mobile companies have been charged with range of charges including Vodacom which was convicted of tax evasion Support for Wazazi Nipendeni has politi cal capital in this context and operators have now signed agreements directly with MoHCDGEC rather than indirectly with the mHealth Tanzania PPP The principal vulnerabilities of the current business model are funding from CDC and the free SMS messages provided by MNOs Through not yet secure policy documents propose further funding for the services provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP eg the PEPFAR country operation plan says it will expand the mHealth Tanzania PPP acknowledging its ability to leverage support from the MNOs scaling up the Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system is part of the Digital Health Investment road map The mHealth Tanzania PPP continues to enter into agreem ents with new public health programmes eg PATH Both the mHealth Tanzania PPP and GSMA have petitioned partner MNOs to analyse user records to demonstrate indirect benefits increased ARPU and reduced churn but unsuccessfully to date The quantitativ study provides robust evidence of substantial increase in ARPU but no reduction in churn It is hoped that this will be of value to the mHealth Tanzania PPP as it negotiate continued and increased support from MNOs in the future Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact References Airtel Africa Quarterly report on the results for the fourth quarter and year ended March

External evaluation of mobile phone technology based nutrition and agriculture advisory services in Africa and South Asia Introduction DFID Research and Evidence Division wishes to commission an external impact evaluation of mNutrition mobile phone technology based nutrition and agricultural advisory service for Africa and South Asia mNutrition is programme supported by DFID that through business and science partnerships aims to build sustainable business models for the delivery of mobile phone technology based advisory services that are effectiv in improving nutrition and agricultural outcomes mNutrition is primarily designed to use mobile phone based technologies to increase the access of rural communities to nutrition and agriculture related information The initiative aims to improve knowledge among rural farming communities especially women and support beneficial behaviour change as well as increas ing demand for nutrition and agriculture extension services The mNutrition initiative launched in September will work in countries in Africa Cote dIvoire Ghana Malawi Mozambique Nigeria Tanzania Kenya Rwanda Uganda Zambia and four coun tries in South Asia Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka The desired impact of mNutrition will be improved nutrition food security and livelihoods of the poor Mobile phone based services have been endorsed by WHO as an effective strategy for beha viour change and for driving adherence to anti retroviral treatment protocols Horvath Azman Kennedy and Rutherford There is currently scant evidence on the impact and cost effectiveness of mobile phone technology based services for nutrition and agriculture and on the sustainability of different business models for their provision rigorous evaluation of mobile phone technology based nutrition services would add significantly to the current evidence base An external evaluation team managed by the Evaluator independent of the programme delivery mechanism will conduct an assessment of the impact cost effectiveness and sustainability of mobile phone technology based information and behaviour change messages for nutrition and agriculture Backgro und to mNutrition Introduction Undernutrition is major challenge to human and economic development globally It is estimated that almost one billion people face hunger and are unable to get enough food to meet their dietary needs Agriculture is major source of livelihood in many poor countries and the sector has potentially critical role in enhancing health specifically maternal and child health and nutritional status well developed agriculture sector will deliver increased and diversified farm outputs crops livestock non food products and this may enhance food and nutrition security directly through increased access to and consumption of diverse food or indirectly through greater profits to farmers and national wealth Better nutrition and health of farmers fosters their agricultural and economic productivity Current agricultural and health systems and policies are not meeting current and projected future global food nutrition and health needs Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Despite major investmen in agricultural and nutrition research and its uptake and application there is significant social and geographic inequality in who benefits from these investments Furthermore in many developing countries public extension systems for agriculture heal th and nutrition are inefficient have limited capacity and have poor track record of delivery especially in terms of supporting women and girls and the most marginalised populations Alston Wyatt Pardey Marra and Chan Kang Anderson IFPRI Van den Berg and Jiggins Several research and mobile network operators MNOs are testing range of information and communication technology ICT solutions for improving access to wide range of information and advisory services Mobile ph one based technologies are among the most promising ICT strategies although current initiatives in nutrition are relatively small and fragmented What is mNutrition Enhancing access to the results of nutrition and agricultural research and development is potentially critical for improving the nutrition health and livelihoods of smallholders and rural communities mNutrition will harness the power of mobile phone based technologies and the private sector to improve access to information on nutrition heal th and agricultural practices especially for women and farmers both male and female Specifically mNutrition will initiate new partnerships with business and science to deliver range of services including An open access database of nutrition and agri culture messages for use in mobile phone based communication for example information and behaviour change messages on practices and interventions that are known to have direct impact on nutrition or an indirect impact via for example agriculture suite of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture information extension and registration services designed to improve knowledge and generate beneficial behaviour change in nutrition and agriculture increase demand for nutrition health and agriculture goods and services register and identify target populations for support and using real time monitoring support the conduct of nutrition risk assessments by community health workers The impacts of mNutrition are expected to include improved nutrition food security and livelihoods of the poor especially women in countries in Africa Cote dIvoire Ghana Kenya Malawi Mozambique Nigeria Rwanda Tanzania Uganda and Zambia and countries in South Asia Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka This impact will result from the increased scale and sustainability of mobile phone based nutrition and agricultural based information services delivered through robust public private partnerships in each country mNutrition has two major outcomes One outcome will be cost effective sustainable business models for mobile phone enabled nutrition and agriculture services to million households in countries in Africa and countries in South Asia that can be replicated in other countries Linked to this outcome the second outcome will expect these services to result in new knowledge behaviour change and adoption of new practices in the area of agriculture and nutrition practices among the users of these mobile phone based services These outcomes wi ll be achieved through four outputs Improved access to relevant mobile based health nutrition and agricultural advisory services for million poor people and community health workers across SSA and Asian countries Launch and scaling of mobile pho ne based health nutrition and agricultural advisory services targeted to poor people and community health workers Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Generation and dissemination

locally relevant content for mobile phone technology based agriculture and nutrition services meeting demands from users and community health workers In terms of promoting behaviour change andor adoption of new practices mNutrition will seek to achieve changes in one or more of the following areas Adoption new agricultural practices that are nutrition sensitive improve agricultural productivity and utilise post harvest technologies Changes in nutrition practices in either one or several knowledge domains including improved maternal nutrition practices dur ing pregnancies infant and young child feeding practice and micro nutrient supplementation to children at risk ie Vitamin Zinc and Oral Rehydration Solution ORS mNutrition has started implementation from September For the countries sele cted for the impact evaluation Tanzania and Ghana mobile network operators and content providers have been identified through competitive process during the first half of The MNOs and content providers started developing and launching their serv ices during the th quarter of and early The mobile phone based advisory services are expected to run at least till rd quarter of

the interests of over mobile operators GSMA already works with the major mobile operators across Africa including Airtel MTN SafariComVodaCom with collective mobile footprint of more than of total African connections GSMA has number of existing development initiatives including mHealth and mFarmer that are part of GSMAs Mobile for Development which brings together mobile operator members the wider mobile industry and the development community to drive commercial mobile services for underserved people in emerging markets GSMA will provide technical assistance to mobile phone operators and support new partnerships with content providers develop and scale up new nutrition and agriculture message services GSMA will ensure sharing of best practices and promote wider replication and uptake of effective business models Objective and Main Questions The objective of this work is to conduct an external evaluation of the impacts and cost effectiveness of the nutrition and agriculture advisory services provided by mNutrition compared to alternative advisory services available in the two selected countries Ghana and Tanzania with particular ttention paid to gender and poverty issues The impact assessment is required to answer the following questions that relate to impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability What are the impacts and cost effectiveness of mobile phone based

way to register and identify at risk populations to target with nutrition support Are mobile phone based services cost effective way or community health workers to improve the quality and timeliness of data surveillance core set of nutrition related indicators The content for the mobile phone based advisory services will be based on international best practices and widely endorsed protocols ie by the World Health Organisation and evidence based nutrition sensitive agricultural practices identified by international experts Through an iterative multi stakeholder process international and country experts will localise and adapt he content to make it relevant to the specific target audience in the countries The adapted content and nature of messages is expected to vary across specific target audiences within and across countries The main purpose of assessing the relevance of the content is not to evaluate the overall health and nutrition content but on how this content has been localised and adapted and to what extent the needs of the specific target groups within their particular context have been met In assessing the comme rcial viability it is recognised that evaluating the sustainabilitylong term financial viability of the mobile phone based advisory services will be difficult as mobile network operators may not be willing to provide this potentially commercially sensiti ve information Therefore GSMA will provide support through its access to aggregated confidential financial results of the mobile network operators providing the service GSMA will provide financial summary report on the commercial viability of the busi ness models without compromising the commercial sensitivity of the data for the mobile network operators The evaluator will assess and validate commercial sustainability through an analysis of the aggregated information provided by GSMA and additional qua litative business analysis approaches The Evaluator has the option of proposing refinements of the existing evaluation questions during the inception phase as part of developing the research protocol These suggestions will be considered by the Steering ommittee and an independent peer review during the review of the research protocol as part of the inception phase Output The output of this work will be new and robust evidence on the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of mobile phone based advisory services focusing on nutrition and agriculture delivered by public and private partners and including the development of robust methodological approaches to impact assessment of phone based advisory services Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Recipient The primary ecipient of this work will be DFID with the beneficiaries being GSMA governments international agencies foundations MNOs and other private companies and civil society involved in policies and programmes in nutrition and agriculture that are aimed at mproving nutritional health and agricultural outcomes The findings of this impact evaluation are intended as global public goods Scope and timeline The scope of this work is to Develop research protocol for the external evaluation of mNutrition Design and undertake an external evaluation of mNutrition in two countries Ghana and Tanzania Contribute to the communication of the learning agenda evaluation strategy and evaluation results The evaluation will be in two of the mNutrition target coun tries Ghana and Tanzania These countries have been selected based on the phased start up of mNutrition programme activities The focus and approach in the two respective countries will be different allowing for comparison of the effectiveness of approa ches applied In Tanzania mNutrition will focus on mobile phone technology based nutrition and health services and registration and identification of target population In Ghana the mobile phone technology will focus on nutrition and agriculture sensitiv services In terms of coverage in number of people being targeted for these services in total million people will be reached through mNutrition including million for nutrition sensitive agriculture advisory messages in Asian and at least Afric an countries and about million beneficiaries for mobile phone based nutrition services in countries in SSA The evaluation contract period will be September to st December The development of the research protocol must be completed by mon th for review and approval by DFID Full details on tasks and deliverables are provided in sections below Statement on the design of the mNutrition evaluation The evaluation design is expected to measure the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of mNutrition using mixed methods evaluation design and drawing on evidence from two case study countries and the ME system of the programme Overall the proposed design should ensure that the evidence from the two case study countries has high internal validity and addresses the priority evidence gaps identified in the Business Case Being able to judge the generalisabilityreplicability of lessons learned from the programme is of equal importance and so credible approach to generalization an external validity will be an important component of the overall evaluation design The final evaluation design and methodology to generate robust evidence will be discussed in detail with DFID and GSMA before implementation For assessing cost effectiven ess the Evaluator will further fine tune their proposed evaluation approach and outline their expectations in terms of data they will require from implementers theory based evaluation design using mixed methods for evaluating the impact has been propo sed During the inception phase the Evaluator will put forward robust evaluation design for the quantitative work either an experimental or quasi experimental method with clear outline Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact of the strengths and limitations of the proposed method relati ve to alternatives During the inception phase the Evaluator is also expected to identify clearly what will be the implications of the design for implementers in terms of how the overall programme would be designed and implemented and for evidence to be ollected in the programmes monitoring system The Evaluator will also assess the degree to which it is realistic to assess impacts by early for programme where implementation started mid and if there are challenges how these would be managed The Evaluator in its monthly reports will be required to provide information to feed into the DFID Annual Review and Project Completion Report of mNutrition Gender and inclusiveness The impact evaluation will pay particular attention to gender and other forms of social differentiation and poverty issues From current experiences it is clear that access to and use of mobile services is differentiated along range of factors includin gender poverty geographic marginalisation education and illiteracy levels Therefore the impact evaluation will look at and analyse differentiated access to and potential utilisation of mobile phone based services for improved nutrition and agricultu ral production Based on the findings it will identify opportunities and challenges in having an impact on women in general and more specifically the poor and the marginalised Tasks The Evaluator will perform the following tasks Finalise coherent and robust evaluation approach and methodology based on their proposal inception phase Conduct landscape analysis of existing experiences in mobile phone based services for nutrition and agriculture based on available publications and grey project docum ents to identify additional critical lessons and priorities for evidence gathering and programme design and implementation Ensure that gender issues and poverty

around the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas building blocks summarising the key observations made in the baseline report and then supplementing the narrative with additional findings from the intervening period as well as finding from both the qualitative and quantitative studies The Osterwalder and Pigneur framework The OP framework is commonly used as framework or canvas for describing business model Businesses rarely have simple model of selling product and gaini ng revenue from that product simple income vs expenditure model rarely describes the business Instead product might enhance the brand of company or enhance the overall experience of the consumer causing them to buy other associated goods or se rvices This idea was at the very heart of the submission of GSMA to FCDO The logical framework of the GSMA grant application described in the next section discusses indirect benefits or imputed benefits In order to map the various components of th business model and to capture these indirect or imputed effects beneficial or otherwise we use the OP canvas The nine elements or building blocks of the canvas form the basis of our analysis below see Figure Note that we propose amending the framework slightly by splitting the Revenue building block into two components considering cash generated and imputed benefits separately and splitting Costs into wo considering operating costs and previous investments separately This has been proposed because of the importance of indirect costs to VAS business models and because some of the key resources brought to partnerships have benefited from prior investme nts Table presents generic overview of the framework ie the descriptions and example questions illustrate how the framework is applied to busi ness models in general so not all are directly relevant or applicable to the Wazazi Nipendeni service Figure Building blocks in the canvas derived from Osterwalder and Pigneur Source Authors Customer RelationshipsValue PropositionKey Activities KeyPartners InvestmentChannels Imputed BenefitsCustomers KeyResources Costs Product Revenue Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Table Description of Building blocks in the canvas Canvas building block Description Example Questions Customers Customer Segments The business model should define different groups of people or organisations to reach and serve Distinct segments will have common needs behaviours or other attributes The business model should be designed around strong understanding of customer need For who are we creating value Who are our most important customers Channels How company communicates with customer segments Channels are customer touch points that shape the customer experience eg communication distribution sales How are we reaching customer segments How do they want to be reached Which ones work best and are most cost efficient Customer Relationships The types of relationships company establishes with specific custo mer segments Relationships may be driven by various motivations eg customer acquisition customer retention boosting sales What type of relationship does each of our Customer Segments expect us to establish with them How costly are they How are the integrated with the rest of our business model Offering Value Propositions The bundle of products and services that create value for specific Customer Segment by satisfying need helping solve problem Value propositions may be innovative di sruptive or similar to others but with added features What value do we deliver to the customer Which of our customers problems are we helping to solve Which needs are we satisfying Business Operations Key resources Those assets required to make the business model work Resources that allow and enterprise to create and offer the value proposition to reach markets to maintain relationships and to generate revenues They can be physical financial intellectual or human What key resources do value propositions require Key activities Things company must do to make it business model work Activities required to create and offer the value proposition to reach markets to maintain relationships and to generate revenues What activities do value propositions require Key partnerships The network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work Companies forge partnerships for many reasons eg reduce risk acquire resources Who are our key partners Who are our key suppliers Which key resources are we acquiring from partners Which key activities do partners perform Finances Revenue strea ms The cash generated from each Customer Segment Revenue streams will depend on what customers are willing to pay Revenue streams can be either one off payments or recurring revenues Each revenue stream may have different pricing mechanisms For what value are customers willing to pay How are they currently paying How would they prefer to pay How much does each revenue stream contribute to overall revenues Cost structure Costs incurred to operate the business model Creating and delivering value maintaining customer relationships and generating revenue all incur costs What are the most important costs inherent in our business model Authors table generated from Osterwalder and Pigneur Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Canvas building block Description Example Questions Which key resources are most expensive Which key activities ar most expensive Investment Number of investors type of investors and commitments made to investors These will influence acceptable profit margins and may affect cash flow Who has invested in the company What kind of returns are expected And ove what timescales Indirect benefits Ways in which the service can benefit the company other than by direct revenue generation How does service increase acquisition and loyalty Does service boost other sales How does service improve brand image Customer segments At registration use rs are allocated to one of four categories pregnant women mothers with newborns supporters of pregnant women or young mothers and general interest The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP overs users registered onto the system during two year period from November to November During this time many women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth and were then re categorised on the system as mothers with ewborns Figure shows that these women make up the vast majority of active users Figure Mix of active users as at November Source Authors Phone ownership and access are key to accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Having at least one household member that owned phone was part of the screening criteria for the quantitative study so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service and phone ownership The qualitative study found that many women did not own mobile phone but across Tanzania as Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact whole of women own phone compared with of men giving only an gender gap Rowntree although this GSMA report shows that the gap is higher in rural communities In terms of access men were reluctant to let their wives have phones fearing they would be used to facilitate affairs and women themselves recognised that phone ownership can cause problems in the family because of trust issues Among young married women who are the primary customer segment it tends to be husbands who control their access to phones either through consent to ownership by buying handset SIM for their wives or by sharing their own phones with their wives Given this understanding of household gender dynamics men are recognised as key customer segment and were targeted in the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign materials which focus on the role of couples in bringing up children However Figure indicates that supporters the category that includes husbands among others such as mothers inlaw make up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users The quantitative research specifically addresses these gender issues and was designed to explore the impact of actively engaging men in health messaging on health outcomes It included econd stage of randomisation in which households where both pregnant women and their partner own distinct mobile phones were split into two groups in one group only the woman received the messages and in the other group both men and women received messa ges The study found that estimates for the households that received the content on both mobile phones the FM group are in general not distinguishable from zero and occasionally suggest that these households perform worse than those assigned to jus receive the content on the primary females mobile phone the group Gilligan et al forthcoming This is particularly interesting finding as it appears counterintuitive Notwithstanding the characteristics of the sub sample used for thi experiment households in which both the mother and father owned mobile phone tended to be better off it suggests that women were not substantially constrained by their partners in their ability to take action based on messages Note that this findin does not contradict findings from the qualitative study on the importance of enlisting mens support for if not participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni service as means of facilitating womens access to content For example the quantitative study foun that womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as they often did not share them with their partners They also found that men often disagreed with some content particularly that on family planning in which case they would withhold access to the messages and would not share information with their partners As national service that is available through multiple networks Wazazi Nipendeni is available all across the country wherever there is networ coverage It does not therefore have particular poverty focus it is not specifically targeted at poor or rural families GSMA found that the service was reaching people with less education primarily due to assisted registrations Registrations wer assisted by field partners who were running programmes that tended to focus on more rural areas These users therefore tended to have lower income and education levels Interestingly the quantitative study found some evidence that the effect on child diets was larger among better off households in the study sample There are many characteristics of better off households that could account for this they are more likely to have access to other sources of nutrition information such as government health workers health facilities or more knowledgeable peers individuals in wealthier households may have higher rates of literacy and education making them better able to understand messages Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact they have more cash to implement recommendations in messages eg purchasing animal sourced foods The fact that the service is text based in Swahili will mean that it is likely to be of limited value to illiterate sections of the population The qualitative study found examples of literate men sharing messages with their illiterate partners Having at least one household member who was literate in Swahili was one of the screening criteria for the quantitative surve so it was not able to explore linkages with literacy Value proposition The original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign directed women to health services and to the text messaging service provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP The aim of the SMS cont ent was to encourage women to avail themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health outcomes This content covered range of pregnancy and motherhood topics and included number of nutrition related messages The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by contributing substantial additional nutrition content first set of messages were added that coincided with the scope of the Wazazi Nipendeni existing messages covering pregnancy and up to weeks post partum and further messages were added later covering life stages up to five years The mHealth Tanzania PPP brought to the GSMA mNutrition partnerships pre existing database of messages targeting pregnant women and new mothers which had been dev eloped over number of previous partnerships each of which had slightly different thematic focus Messages cover ed several pregnancy and motherhood related topics not just nutrition The list of topics includes prevention of mother tochild transmiss ion of HIV Aids antenatal care family planning malaria prevention nutrition for mother and baby danger signs having an individual birth plan and postpartum care key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was its mphasis on quality of information The global content partnership was responsible for identifying relevant content and specifying content validation and quality control processes After the original one stop shop concept was abandoned EveryMobile UK based and COUNSENUTH Tanzanian NGO working in nutrition worked together to localise the content to make it relevant and accessible to Tanzanian users TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content was accessible and consistent with national nutr ition strategies TFNC shared its responsibilities with other members of the National Nutrition Social and Behaviour Change Communication Technical Working group SBCC TWG UX research was conducted early on in the project to ensure that messages were ap propriate GeoPoll tested small sub sample of messages for comprehension and relevance It sent SMS CABI GAIN Oxfam the International Livestock Research Institute and the British Medical Journal Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact messages to two groups of women followed by series of evaluation questions also sent by SMS ThinkPlace conducted user focused research using human centred design principles The research was based on semi structured individual interviews and user profiling They then generated set of four personas intended to assist with the design of the messages Frog later conducted further UX research based on in depth inte rviews with participants which added an additional three personas These research activities funded through the mNutrition programme helped with two aspects of product development the Geo Poll and Think Place activities looked at the messages and how they might fit with different types of consumers the archetypes while the Frog research considered how to improve the customers experience of the service Evidence from the quantitative study appears to confirm the quality of mess ages Household members in treatment households were overwhelmingly likely to read the mNutrition content they received on their phone Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received Not reading any of the received mNu trition messages was extremely uncommon only between and of households This indicates that the messages are highly valued and this is confirmed by the finding that over of users either always or very often found the messages useful see Figure Figure shows that information on maternal nutrition was regarded as most useful but not by large margin The quantitative study also found that over of users of females and of males would recommend the service likely or highly likely Conversely only of users would not recommend the service Th ese data suggest high level of satisfaction with the content in the mNutrition service Figure How often was the mNutrition content deemed to be useful Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Most and least useful mNutrition message topics by gender Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Perhaps more importantly most users reported having taken action based on the messages received of females and of males self reported implementing at least one tip The types of information that users were able to implement are presented in Figure Interestingly maternal nutrition which was regarded as th most useful area of information was least likely to have been acted on There may be additional barriers to adopting these behaviours that information alone is not able to overcome Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their behaviours as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range of nutritional outcomes Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved as follows Dietary diversity for children aged mont hs The number of food categories consumed increased by value The likelihood that children aged months met the minimum dietary diversity Children in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to have consumed from four food groups value Children aged months in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet Note that households were included in the baseline sample if they had pregnant woman or child under the age of months so by the time of the endline survey children would have been aged between to months so this is the age group for which it might be expected to find the strongest effects Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Diets among women of reproductive age primary females had also improved The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women had increased by percentage points value Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices among men There was statistically significant impact on the combined household level measure of nutrition knowledge Figure Which tips from mNutrition content have respondents put in practice by gend er Source Gilligan et al forthcoming The text messages provide women with information that is consistent with advice given by health workers in the field Where women are in contact with heal th workers the text messaging service then has the additional benefit of reinforcing the advice that women receive

Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP printed materials were distributed to range of health facilities where women come into contact with health professionals eg hospitals health centres dispe nsaries The mHealth Tanzania PPP worked in partnership with the health sector providing training for health professionals who were then able to help women register on the system There are three ways of registering for the Wazazi Nipendeni text messagin service Assisted by health facility worker women can be signed up when they come for antenatal care visits etc Assisted by community health workers community workers can sign women up when they visit them in their homes or other local venue Multiple response respondents may have heard of Wazazi Nipendeni through multiple channels ie adds up to more than Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Selfregistration instructions were given in the multimedia campaign People dial the short code and then are guided through small number of profiling questions category of user and stage of pregnancy age of child Registration data show that of users were registered by partners In addition proportion of other users will also have been helped to register by government health workers Partners generally register users through the USSD service or the API It is not possible to determine exactly how many of the of other users actually registered by themselves but were registered using USSD suggesting that they were in fact registered or at least assisted with their registration by partner This means that up to of users were re gistered by partners This highlights the importance of partners in getting users onto the system Although mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign it is partners that are instrumental in converting peop le into users People may lack sufficiently detailed understanding of the product to convince them to register for themselves whereas some personal contact can help get them signed up TFNC also believes that people who register with health profession al will have positive bias to comply with messaging have better understanding of how the service works and be more likely to appreciate how they can benefit from the service It is likely to be known and trusted individuals who are most influential assisting with registrations eg community health workers and community and religious leaders Wazazi Nipendeni was one of five programmes supported by the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP see Section This was multi media behaviour change communications programme aimed at improving range of health issues with focus on HIV prevention The five year programme started in and fini shed in so it will have achieved nearly maximum reach towards the end of when the DHS survey referred to in Table was conducted USAID evaluation gives total budget for the programme of million USD Field Nguer et al The budge is not disaggregated by project but by health issue At the time Wazazi Nipendeni was addressing maternal and child health malaria PMTCT and family planning The total budget allocated to these issues was million USD so the amount allocated to Wa zazi Nipendeni would be some fraction of this In principle the user numbers achieved by Wazazi Nipendeni could be at least partly result of this investment Although awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni was high in this was not evident during the qualit ative studies carried out as part of the evaluation The issues were not raised during focus group discussion and only in the midline survey which specifically explored implementation issues was any reference made to the legacy of TCCP Both women live in towns in other regions during that time and had signed up themselves after seeing poster in the health clinic Barnett et al It has been shown above that the majority of users were registered by partners These figures suggest that regist ration is driven by face toface interactions with health workers Further research would be needed to specifically investigate the extent to which registrations continue to be influenced by any residual awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni from the TCCP activities Figure confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health matters government more so than NGO facil ities It is interesting to note that even among control communities people have high levels of trust in information from automated text messages They are more likely to trust an SMS than family members confirming that text messages are regarded as bei ng reliable and of high quality Patterns of who people actually get information from Figure Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact broadly reflect levels of trust although they emphasise the importance of government health workers Figure Trust in sources of health information Source Authors Figure Sources of health information Source Authors At baseline the qualitative research found evidence that communities were already familiar with the use of SMS text messages as means of disseminating information on health and nutrition topics Viamos service was contracted to provide access to IV recordings in order to cater Percent who agree they woul trust information from each source Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact for those customers that struggle with written messages The qualitative research identified number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with womens lifestyles text messages can be read repeatedly audio messages may be heard incorrectly as messages remain on the phone they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any time and text messages are private they remain on the phone which tends to be regarded as personal device audio messages can be overheard by others The quantitative study showed that household members in treatment households were overwhelmingly likely to rea the mNutrition content they received on their phone indicating that sending messages by SMS in Swahili is an effective channel It should be noted that the SMS channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa and the country is united by the language of Swahili In addition to these features the quantitative study also found that users had low attachment to their mobile phones or their SIM at least Among eople who were able to explain why they had not received messages in the previous month the largest single reason was that they had lost their SIM see Figure Figure Receipt of Nutrition messages in the last month

Business modelling endline report ePact Customer relationships The aims of the customer relationships that Wazazi Nipendeni creates with users can be considered to be threefold Acquisition Those who were assisted with registrat ion have quite different relationship with the service to those who self registered Their ongoing experience of the service depends not only on the content of messages but also on whatever ongoing support and interaction they may continue to enjoy from the field agency Registration data confirm the importance of field partners and the face toface interaction they provide in encouraging users to register for the service up to of users were signed up by partners see Section Retention Several features of the system minimise pain points that might prompt users to leave system The service is free of charge so there is no need for any billing or paymen processes both of which can be tricky and cause customers to drop out of the service Once users pregnancy or maternal status has been captured by the registration process there is no need for the system to gather further information from users Per haps the most important factor is the perceived relevance and value of the content itself Retention levels are high Registration data indicate that the number of people opting out of the service is equivalent to roughly of new users in month As the total number of active users grows the attrition rate becomes increasing ly small when expressed as percentage of the number active users eg at the end of fouryear period Compliance The service will achieve greatest impact if it can successf ully persuade people to constructively change their behaviours This depends on the perceived relevance and value of the content and on the motivation of customers to comply with the messages they receive which depends on the perceived trustworthiness of the content High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Nearly of those who self reported having ever received the content read all messages received and over self reported implementing at least one tip The study has not been able to generate any insights into the nature of the ongoing support provided by partners because locations for both quantitative and qualitative studies were selected on the basis of low registration levels and no partner presence Wazazi Nipendeni has strong brand which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the service and users tend to view it as MoHCDGEC service as the Government pushed it through the media Originally Wazazi Nipendeni was branded CDC action ut it is increasingly MoHCDGEC branded as MoHCDGEC adopt more of the service Users do not necessarily appreciate that the MNOs are paying for the messages Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP comes from CDC it can be argued that the most important relationship is that with CDC Providing evidence that the service is delivering improved health outcomes is important Although commercial viability was priority for FCDO in their original concept for the mNutrition programme it is not clear that this is similar priority for other donors and organisations that have supported the service over the years Revenue streams and indirect benefits Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge to users so there is no direct revenue stream The original mNut rition project design was based on the assumption that users would pay for information eg via subscriptions and that this would provide opportunities for participating organisations to develop commercially sustainable business models even though nutrition information was to be Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact made available using freemium model However late in the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be permitted to charge for these information services In the end the Government insisted that health information should be made available to citizens free of charge The illingness of users to pay for health and nutrition information has yet to be tested However it is political pressure that is the main determinant of business models overnments across many African countries have insisted that health related information should be made available for free as national policies state that health services should be made available for free at the point of delivery key feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service is that it has also been made available free of charge to field pa rtner institutions running behaviour change interventions within Tanzania so no direct revenue is generated from partner organisations The mHealth Tanzania PPP is currently funded by CDC although the successful functioning of the service depends on con tributions by various partner organisations The service is therefore vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding from CDC Current funding is planned to The service also depends on the zero rating of text messages by partner MNOs Phone numbers are sed as the unique user identifier on the Rasello platform so users can only register one number although in principle they could self register as many numbers as they like Tanzania recently introduced mobile number portability Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority TCRA but it is unlikely that this is common practice For example even years after number portability was introduced in South Africa only of the subscriber base port their number in year Independent Comm unicatio ns Authority of South Africa Registration data from Rasello indicate that drop out rates are low which also suggests that use rs are not readily changing their mobile numbers The qualitative research found that most people use multiple SIMs swapp ing them into their phone depending on which network has signal and which offers the cheapest tariff eg time of day off net tariffs and bundle features In the baseline report it was proposed that the Wazazi Nipendeni VAS could offer MNOs indirect benefits associate with reduced churn However this has proven not to be the case The quantitative study found no difference in the length of time that respondents reported having had their main SIM card both groups had owned their primary SIM for just under three years and their second SIM for just over two years there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone number as they had at baseline two year duration and there was no difference in the proportion who subscri bed to the same operator as at baseline The baseline report also proposed that as VAS Wazazi Nipendeni could lead to an increase in ARPU among users and the quantitative study found that this has indeed been the case Control households spent an aver age of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment communities The qualitative study found that women using the Wazazi Nipendeni service became more confident in using their phones which explains the increase in ARPU They were more likely to make and receive calls more likely to have sent and received text messages more likely to have used mobile money services and more potential to have used their phone intensively The latest DHS data indicate that of people across the country had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni see Table TCRA data for October give the total number of subscribers on Annualised porting rate is taken as the total cumulative ports divided by the number of years since the service was launched Used their mobile on most days during the past days telecommunications statistics Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact the four partner networks as million Therefor Wazazi Nipendeni users represent of the entire subscriber base Given the reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni it is surprising that the MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not make greater use of their contribution and the Wazazi Nipendeni brand in their promotional materials It does appear that MNOs are beginning to recognise the political value attached to their support for Wazazi Nipendeni In an unpredictable political environment in which the Government can potentially impose regulatory constraints such as taxes there is political capital to be gained by supporting public good that plays part in implementing the Governments health policy By signing agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni directly with the Government ra ther than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution Key resources Key resources are defined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition The primary assets employed by the mHealth Tanzania PPP in delivering the text messaging service are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages The current content comprises the pre existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource The text mes saging service originally ran on the Vusion platform developed by TTCM in partnership with the Praekelt foundation In October Wazazi Nipendeni migrated to new platform created for MoHCDGEC by loc al software developer Rasello The new platform offers improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities For example the mHealth Tanzania PPP has been able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track the number of users and messages being sent The text messaging service is designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign so the field partner programmes and interventions are key resource required to deliver the full potential of the value proposition To date partners have assisted with registering users in the field see Section The key resource in convening these partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with TFNC nd its linkages to both national nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country TFNC also acts as the moderator of health and nutrition content bringing to the partnership its technical expertise in this area The content localisation and approval process was acknowledged by stakeholders as going particularly smoothly as result of having TFNC on board Early in the country manager at the mHealth Tanzania PPP handed over to new team leader The country mana ger had been intimately involved in the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP for nearly years The interesting feature of the new appointment was that while the previous country manager came from mobile technology background the new team leader is medical professional This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP as it continues to encourage Government agencies to take ownership of the platform itself along with associated technical responsibilities Strengthened health resources in the mHe alth Tanzania PPP leave it better able to engage with health policy issues and to broker partnerships with health sector actors datasetnutrition knowledge bank Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key activities In order to make the business model work perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be undertaken is networking Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP clearly have good personal contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs and to enlist the support of MNOs The strength of personalities is likely to become less important as MoHCDGEC assumes greater ownership of the technical platform and is able to integrate participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni system into processes required for health interventions to be implemented in country Under the original vision for the mHealth projects under the mNutrition programme it was expected that content delivered by the Global Content Partnership would simply be made available to all partners participating in the mHealth service and that each participating organisation would use their own resources to ad apt the key messages to specifically match their target audience and to suit their own objectives This was subject to an obligation or expectation that nutrition content would then be made available by participating organisations free of charge to users The Global Content Partnership was therefore mandated to create higher level generic content and little provision was made for creating specific locally relevant messages However when the original clearing house vision was abandoned there was hen need for new stream of work to create specific locally relevant messages in the local language ready to be integrated into the existing Wazazi Nipendeni database of content This was done by the partnership of EveryMobile and COUNSENUTH Detail ed testing of mHealth content was never part of the original concept as it was expected that local partners would do this for themselves so additional funding was made available to cover end user testing as part of the localisation process TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content generation process However TFNC adopted much more proactive role and its involvement has continued to deepen throughout the project When the content generation process wa changed to facilitate the production of more detailed localised content TFNC got more involved TFNCs engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that signing off procedures went smoothly Monitoring and evalua tion is key activity as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni makes towards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with forthcoming health interventions It is expected that the positive outcomes highlight ed by this evaluation study will be of value to the mHealth Tanzania PPP and to TFNC in this regard Providing face toface presence when working with women is important not only for assisting with registration onto the Wazazi Nipendeni system but also for achieving positive behaviour change The qualitative study confirmed that messages may play an important role in reinforcing and supporting the efforts of health workers The study found that messages acted as reminders to reinforce information provid ed by health workers and to reinforce mothers existing knowledge Note that even though people may trust information given by text messages Figure they are still most likely to get information from health workers Figure The core business of delivering content to beneficiaries depends on the technical infrastructure that eals with registration scheduling and the dispatch of messages to users This is sub contracted to Rasello as the platform provider and management is being gradually transferred from the mHealth Tanzania PPP to MoHCDGEC Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant eg new drugs and products will be introduced and recommended practice will be modified People will quickly lose trust in information Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact that is not immediately useful or even worse wrong Quality assurance processes for any revisions ought to be as rigorous as those adhered to during the mNutrition programme It is not clear that any of the partners has the mandate or the funding to undertake this type of ongoing maintenance Key partnership The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC is defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Wa zazi Nipendeni was riginally conceived as prevention of malaria in pregnancy campaign following an analysis by JHCCP of the Tanzania DHS data The mHealth Tanzania PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put together by JH CCP and MOHSW Content Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by MOHSW to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Org anization WHO Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action Content on family planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproductive Health mRH Content for Prevention of Mother toChild Transmission was designed by EG PAF TFNC was instrumental in securing the support of the SBCC TWG for nutrition in approving content Technology platform The service was originally run on the Vusion open source platform developed by TTCM The system architecture led to problems with re liability latency and cost The service was migrated to new platform in October It was hosted locally by Rasello and was commissioned and paid for by MoHCDGEC with CDC funding Telecoms operators The mHealth Tanzania PPP had identified MNOs key partners at the start However MNOs needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched without explicit support from MNOs but after the service achieved users within weeks the MNOs entered into agreements Field partners The programme launched in November with two month nationwide media campaign radio and TV follow up campaign ran from July to February during which field partners promoted the service and assisted with registrations In addition to the field partners see Table that have formal agreements with the mHealth Tanzania PPP and have source code allocated on the system other agencies have simply incorporated registering women onto Wazazi Nipendeni into their field processes Analysis of registration data suggests that field partners may have assisted up to of users to register

query was performed on March The dataset contains the following fields unique ID anonymised source me ans of registration eg short code API partner who registered the user category of user eg pregnant woman mother with child stage at registration months or weeks representing the stage of pregnancy or age of child registration date statu active or inactive and optout date for inactive accounts The data required considerable manipulation primarily because when pregnant women reach term and are assumed to give birth the original record is flagged as inactive and new record is created with new category of mother with child Given that most users are women who have given birth while registered as users there were large number of paired records that needed to be reconciled and collated The working dataset includes addition al categories to reflect these hybrid classifications eg PWMC represents woman who registered when pregnant but has since given birth and has continued using the service as mother with child Registration via USSD and API was introduced to make the registration process faster and easier Registration by API was initially introduced by NHIF in July then use of API as registration source was adopted by other partners from November onwards Registration by USSD appears to have been introduced on November and registrations were submitted by multiple partners However there is spike in registrations on this date records were submitted on this date by USSD and by API There appears to be further anomaly registrations completed by USSD in November There is spike in the number of registrations completed by USSD during the three week period form November to November Most of these have no associated partner There are no further regi strations by USSD after this date which seems unlikely working dataset has been restricted to all records covering two year period between November and November The following numbers of records have been omitted up to and includin November and November onwards The following steps were taken in the preparation of the dataset used in the analysis and summarised in Table Data were submitted in four files containing total of record With the exception of records submitted in the period August to eptember Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Paired duplicates were collated and ID errors were omitted from each file leaving total of records Files were then merged and paired duplicates across years were collated leaving total of records Records with various unresolvable data were omitted leaving total of records Omitted records included those with VALUE in the Registration date field NULL in the Source field outliers in the Stage field and records with an opt out date as well as an Active Status Migrated accounts from the Vusion system were omitted Staff at the mHealth Tanzania PPP reported that porting data from the old to the new system was fraught with difficulties resulting in inconsistencies in the data on the new platform For example of migrated data records contained single registration date November which corresponds roughly to the date the migration took place All migrated records have been omitted Anomalies in November and November cast doubt over the integrity of data before and after these dates so only data from the intervening two year period has been used Table Preparation of registration data for analysis Step Description Records reduction Data were submitted in four files na Pairing and errors omitted na

over records were marked as having opted out on April The majority of these had been registered using the short code Secondly there was one month gap in hich no opt outs were recorded mid February midMarch Therefore only opt out data from May onwards have been considered reliable and are presented in Figure Note that the rate at which users opted out of the system was an order of magni tude lower than the rate at which they were being registered so missing opt out data has minimal effect on the trend of calculated active users presented in Figure Mobile phones nutrition and health in

service The total number of users may be up to higher than these figures indicate because many of the original users that were migrated onto the new sy stem have not been included in these numbers step to step in Table Nevertheless the patterns of growth and opt outs remain accurate In November the mHealth Tanzania PPP estimated the number of active users to be This is consisten with the active user numbers in Figure as adding to the November estimate of from the chart gives total of which is close to the mHealth Tanzania PPP estimate Making an assumption of straight line growth in active user numbers and assuming starting base of active users rounded down the number of active users after two year period December to November is estimated at This figure was validated by the mHealth Tanzania PPP In their study of all eight health services in the mNut rition programme GSMA GSMA presents chart of the total number of users reached from October to December In this chart Wazazi Nipendeni users start from base of zero in January rising to in December However thes figures cannot be compared with the figures above because they represent the cumulative number of users reached Understanding users The NHIF has brought the largest number of users onto the system Figure This figure also shows that to date other partners have assisted few users to register relative to the number who appear to have self registered no partner Among the partners that registered more than users all apart from UNICEF used either API or USSD exclusively almost see Table None used the short code When the USSD system was introduced SMS remained the channel the general public could use to register but healthcare partners moved using USSD The USSD facility makes the registration process smoother because it can validate healthcare registration numbers in real time so it can check if people enter incorrect registration data When looking at users registered with no partner were registered using an API or USSD Figure suggesting that many could well have been Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact registered with the assistance of field partner It was reported that many women would have been signed up with the assistance of health workers when they visite clinics It is not therefore possible to determine how many users truly self registered ie without any assistance It is possible that up to of all users could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of partner official partner health workers if API and USSD registrations were included An inherent difficulty with USSD sessions was that in areas with poor network coverage the connection would be dropped before the registration process could be completed It was reported that some partners resorted to using short codes although this is not evident in the data from the period represented in Table The USSD protocol was subsequently changed so that it was able to resume the session automatically This was concern as most the marketing materials for Wazazi Nipendeni were based on the USSD functionality Figure Registrations by partner Source Authors Table

registration process users were asked what stage of the pregnancy women was at in months or weeks For mothers and supporters they were asked for the age of the child Figure shows that there was peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Note the small number of women registering in the th month of their pregnancy this mostly likely represents women who were registered at or around the time they gave birth Users who were supporting pregnant women also tended to sign up at the end of the first trimester see Figure Users have been separated out into those who were registered by one of the partners listed in Table and those who apparently self registered Section analyses those users with no partner and suggests that in fact it is likely that most of them were ssisted by some kind of health worker The spike in registrations at the three month point is most acute among these users see Figure This figure also

of data that represents users who have registered and then left the service is relatively small Remember that the addition of nutrition messages means that users remain registered until the child reaches the age of five years so even children registered early in have not yet reached the age at which they will be automatically removed from the system In principle users can opt out of the service by Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact sending he word Simama to the same number used for self registrations In practice many users may not be aware of this Figure shows that most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women and that they left before giving birth The relatively low number of women in the PWMC category

partner were registered using an API and using the USSD number While of those registered by USSD subsequently dropped out only of API registrations opted out Among those users with no partner were registered by USSD and may have been genuinely self registere or they may have been assisted by health worker However only the general public continued to register using the short code so of those

TCRA data suggest the proportion of internet users may be higher although it does not attempt to identify unique users This indicates that people find alternative means of accessing the internet eg free Wi Fi hotspots and some feature phones can support internet enabled services Nevertheless the falling price of smartphones will continue to strengthen access to data services for example MTN ha ambitious plans to sell smart feature phone that uses the KaiOS operating system to create smartphone user experience providing access to Google and social media apps Data services will be

service and is pull service as it relies on the user to dial short code to access information In principle service could combine both aspects of communication as each has its advantages and drawbacks Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact It is in teresting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile phones This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions as they tend to use platform that manages payments between healthcare providers but the interaction with the client is done by SMS This reliance on SMS tells us two things Firstly SMS is good enough means of communicating with clients ie constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not rendered the services unfeas ible Secondly SMS is regarded as the most cost effective medium for communicating with clients This is closely linked to the first point as voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraint but come at much higher cost The classification was drafted in so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet and smartphones in particular of data acquisition an analysis and of mobile money services Some examples are summarised below Babyl Rwanda is diagnostic

['Medic Mobile Case study by UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Name Location Year launchedReachImplementing organizationMedic Mobile Medic MobileNepal and twentytwo other countries Focus of intervention Provide an integrated mobile system for improving maternal and neonatal healthIn Nepal community health workers serving nearly people of the Himalayas Medic MobileLewis Feuer UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Summary Nepal has sustained continued reduction in maternal and under mortality rates but there are still severe disparities between those of different socioeconomic status Nepal In under mortality rates per live births were times greater for rural than for urban areas times greater for mothers with low levels of education than for mothers with higher education and times greater for the poorest than for the wealthiest Nepali households Nepal Following this trend in disparity in the chance of receiving full cycle of antenatal care ANC was twice as high among the wealthiest households and highest educated mothers than for the poorest and least educated mothers Nepal Also the ratio of institutional delivery or delivery by skilled attendant for highly educated mothers was over twice that for mothers with no formal education and for the wealthiest households it was over three times greater than for the poorest Nepal Fewer than per cent of all new mothers successfully complete the full cycle of three postnatal checkups after giving birth Nepal To address this shortfall Medic Mobile was launched in Nepal in as mobile phonebased health monitoring solution using simple data capture interface appropriate for community health workers CHWs with low levels of literacy and technical skills CHWs conduct home visits and register maternal health information directly to their mobile devices to provide increased coverage of ANC among rural women from poor households and with little formal education webbased digital dashboard allows CHW supervisors to monitor CHW activity and schedule followup services for those with highrisk pregnancies Since its launch the programme has been scaled up in Nepal to over CHWs and has been launched in twentytwo other countries supporting almost CHWs worldwide The focus of this case study is the Medic Mobile implementation in Nepal Through the UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World this case study is part of series highlighting how inclusive digital solutions can help people with low skills or low literacy levels use technology in ways that support skills development and ultimately improve livelihoods in contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on education For more information go to enunescoorgthemesliteracyallpearsoninitiativeABOUT THIS CASE STUDYCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile By traditional literacy is meant the ability to read and write Why selected To ensure that the digital solution is as appropriate as possible Medic Mobile has continually focused on usercentred design approach undertaking range of activities such as user interviews and field visits focus group discussions and roleplaying with supervisors and CHWs stakeholder and process mapping of current activities paperprototyping usability tests and pre and posttests for education and digital skills The process followed offers an instructive example of good practice when designing with users Key takeaways Medic Mobile offers an accessible mobile health mHealth approach to support more connected and coordinated healthcare systems Medic Mobile recognizes that the process of usercentered design requires extensive collaboration with all types of users and key stakeholders The Medic Mobile digital solution provides evidence of effective mHealth implementation among communities with low traditional and technical literacyUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Context and project origins In the government of Nepal instituted the national Safe Motherhood Programme with primary goal of reducing maternal and neonatal mortality of newborns up to one month while improving overall health through preventive practices for antenatal care delivery and the postnatal period Nepal While overall maternal and child mortality rates have steadily declined over the past fifteen years limitations in knowledge about services among expectant mothers institutional coverage and service delivery have created disparities between mothers experiences along the lines of education wealth and rural or urban location In addition to the Prophylactic Motherhood Programme the government added policy in underscoring the importance of skilled birth attendance SBA at all deliveries through the national deployment of trained professionals As part of its ongoing commitment to maternal and neonatal health MNH Nepal has goal of per cent of deliveries by institution or SBA by Nepal Some constraints that make achieving this goal difficult include inadequate referral mechanisms for receiving care low coverage of ANC consultations and lack of access to hospitals and health centres Nepal Medic Mobile was developed with these specific constraints in mind In Medic Mobile partnered with the Ministry of Health in Nepal and Ace Heart World Wide to equip CHWs who conduct routine house visits for expectant mothers with basic mobile phones The health workers receive reminders to follow up with mothers for ANC consultations delivery procedures and postnatal care PNC visits The primary objective of the programme was to increase rates of full ANC visits and institutional deliveries among expectant mothers Medic Mobiles target audience is the network of almost CHWs in Nepal One Heart World Wide is an international nongovernmental organization NGO working to strengthen public health services for mothers and children Medic MobileLewis FeuerCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Figure Distribution of CHW pilot sample by educational attainment Designing with the user Medic MobileLewis FeuerCentral to Medic Mobiles philosophy and practice is following usercentred design approach or what it calls humancentred design in partnership with CHWs Prior to pilot implementation the Medic Mobile team ran two rounds of field tests creating opportunities for local stakeholders to influence system design features Over percent of registered CHWs have no formal schooling JSI Therefore the Medic Mobile team consciously included key stakeholder feedback from communities with low traditional and digital literacy as an added measure for ensuring an appropriate mobile health design solution Initial design activities included mapping current healthcare system activities with CHWs and their supervisors to identify constraints and opportunities and validating sketches of the proposed platform interface before developing prototype for fieldtesting This process also involved individual interviews with staff at the government agency responsible for all public health programmes in the district Preliminary design activities led to pilot implementation among seventyseven CHWs and twentyone supervisors in the Baglung District of Nepal The purpose of the pilot was to test the feasibility of the platform among the sample of CHWs and to solicit feedback for improving its overall usability design The pilot CHWs ranged in age from to with an average age of about The sample for the pilot reflected the educational and ethnic distribution in the district Figure Almost third of the sample had no formal education and limited reading and writing proficiency while per cent of the sample had higher secondary education or above The CHWs had between none and twentyone years experience of community health work with an average of years The pilot implementation stage resulted in critical shifts in the programme objectives and strategies concerning the systems core technologies UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Prior to fieldtesting stakeholder groups were divided about the type of content to include in the CHW reporting system Given that the tool was developed to improve ANC coverage the fieldtesting revealed some clear areas that could be cut Protocol items specific to health facility services that could not accurately be substantiated by selfreports at home such as iron tablets given and tetanus and diphtheria TD vaccination administered were removed from the updated version The resulting protocol was not only easier for CHWs to administer but more focused on the intended purpose of the design solutionLESSON Focus on the content the digital tool was designed to addressHealth worker motivation major insight from the focus group sessions was that there was low motivation among CHWs because of perceived sense of isolation from supervisors and lack of support for their work Sharma and Holeman The group solicited for feedback indicated that the idea of linking their efforts to larger system and receiving confirmation was appealing Medic Mobile used this feedback to incorporate personalized and automated SMS confirmation each time report was submitted as means of increasing the visibility of and acknowledging the CHWs in the health system The pilot validated the fact that the automated response including warm greeting and salutation using the CHWs name was better received than generic confirmation Therefore Medic Mobile carried this feature over into subsequent iterations of the platform Continuous adaptation An early design of the Medic Mobile system included reporting feature for flagging highrisk pregnancies in birthing centres The pilot revealed that CHWs preferred making phone calls to ask for assistance with emergency issues while they preferred the SMS system for nonemergencies and as useful backup in lownetworkcoverage areas Sharma and Holeman Medic Mobile used this insight to redesign the workflow to allow CHWs to submit the reports after making an initial phone call This underscores the importance of continuous feedback for sustained userdesign processValidation and shifts in programme objectives Figure CHW submitting data to the Medic Mobile reporting system using SMSWe receive Thank You as soon as we submit anything using Medic Mobile We are the happiest when we are thanked CHW in Baglung Medic MobileRanju SharmaCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Rightsizing the reporting system During the initial fieldtesting process stakeholder groups debated how much information the CHWs should submit through the reporting system with some groups pushing for more comprehensive reporting protocol The pilot revealed important insights into what it was feasible for CHWs to achieve on the ground Informed by the pilot outcomes stakeholder groups were able to agree on more limited set of essential data and prioritize the primary objectives of the reporting system Sharma and Holeman Expanding the role of the target group The pilot implementation revealed need to expand the target group of end users The original design included web based dashboard system for displaying reports and CHW activity but many CHW supervisors did not have computers and relied on SMS alerts from CHWs The pilot showed the importance of their role for scaling up and made it clear that the community supervisors needed more information to support CHWs This insight has led to modifications in the roles of the CHW supervisors and their information needs Medic MobileRanju SharmaUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Feature phones and SIM card apps The initial design of the Medic Mobile approach incorporated lowcost feature phones and SIM card apps Compared with smartphone devices feature phones were both more costeffective to the programme and more familiar to CHWs Also CHWs often used SMS for communication in their daily lives and feature phones were more reliable in environments with low internet connectivity Prepilot stakeholder interviews called for comprehensive digitization of the entire MNH protocol Therefore the team developed SIMbased app for data collection and storage of report protocol The app resided on the SIM card and ran on the phone As comprehensive reporting system SIM app technology was attractive for its ability to support menudriven forms to help mediate responses and ensure accurate data entry The pilot experience led to three important findings regarding the initial design solution There was need to validate CHWs ability to use the feature phone comfortably and adopt the SMS design approach However the menudriven platform of the prototype presented challenge because of its more technically complicated multistep interface It was necessary to expand the training module to include comprehensive digital literacy component covering the basic alphabets on the keypad and general operation of the feature phones This needed to be offered prior to orienting the CHWs to the more advanced features of the Medic Mobile platform There was also need to arrive at consensus for streamlining the data capture process as described above Through this pilot experience Medic Mobile began to explore other SMSbased tools that did not involve menudriven platform and simplified the data collection protocol Improving the efficiency of the technology Figure SIM card for running Medic Mobile natively on any feature phone Text forms collect small amounts of structured data using ordinary SMS To submit text form CHW sends an ordinary SMS message with values delineated by spaces CHW might send text message with content such as Pabitra where indicates registering new pregnancy the number of weeks pregnant followed by the patients name In Nepal text forms came to be seen as viable option after insight was gained from SIMbased pilot trialINSIGHT Codesigning for improved usabilityData entry with text forms Medic Mobile decided to test the use of webbased text forms that allowed CHWs to enter spacedelineated lines of text to register data instead of the multistep menu approach of the SIM app used during the pilot This switch reduced the number of key strokes needed to send an updated report While SMSbased text forms essentially structured SMS messages have proved effective in similar studies for maternal health in Rwanda Ngabo et al and family planning in Malawi Vollmer Lemay et al stakeholders at prepilot design workshops were sceptical of this approach based on concerns related to data entry Medic MobileCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile and poor adoption among CHWs used to the traditional paperbased system Prioritizing the reporting items captured and streamlining the protocol allowed the team to revisit the topic of alternative to SIM card apps Further research revealed that text forms have two key usability advantages over SIM card apps They reduce hardware procurement costs and improve routine software updates as an alternative to convening CHWs and updating cards one at time CHWs also reported that communicating through SMS offered more comfortable reporting technique and reduced overall reporting time as opposed to navigating through the menudriven interface of SIM app Enhanced information for CHW supervisors Medic Mobile discovered that if it was to promote the use of the system by CHW supervisors for monitoring and supporting CHW engagement the supervisors needed access to more information right on their phones Focus group sessions with supervisors revealed that their priority data need was to verify that all expectant mothers were being registered Therefore Medic Mobile updated the automated SMS schedules to alert CHW supervisors each time new pregnancy was registered The alert was accompanied by comprehensive report of delivery information related to the expectant mother including anticipated delivery date the assigned CHW and upcoming ANC consultations The supervisor could then integrate the Medic Mobile Unique ID with the mothers official MNH register at the local clinic and easily account for any discrepancies between the two systems Design challenge Typing text even in the native language Nepali is difficult CHWs were much more comfortable with structured alphanumeric digits Responses All Medic Mobile text forms are structured and require as little text as possible Some examples of forms are Rita The date field was also replaced with number of days since last menstrual period LMP This change allowed CHWs to type one or twodigit entries instead of the full date format Example Weeks since LMP instead of Date of LMP Design challenge Remembering simple form syntax can be challenge Responses All text forms are very short and simple with maximum number of four fields required pregnancy status number of weeks pregnant mothers first name additional data point Medic Mobile form codes are relatable to the action being performed so that they are easy to remember All error responses and reminders contain the exact syntax of the text form that needs to be sent so that CHWs only need to refer to these messages to know what to send and when INSIGHT Design challenges created by lowskilled CHWs and Medic Mobile responses Figure Medic Mobile Unique ID linked to official MNH register Medic MobileLester Ng UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World The digital solution Remote registration Once an expectant mother is identified the CHW registers her information via SMS text form Medic Mobiles web application then registers the pregnancy creates unique patient ID calculates the expected date of delivery and schedules series of automated reminder messages to the CHW related to ANC and anticipated delivery date Antenatal care reminders and advice The reminders system is scheduled based on the Nepali Ministry of Healths protocol for recommended ANC visits SMS alerts are automatically sent to CHWs for followup with the expectant mother throughout her pregnancy During the consultation the CHW provides counselling and antenatal education following the adapted government protocols and reminds the pregnant woman to attend the nearest health facility for an ANC visit CHWs follow up few days later to confirm whether the pregnant woman completed her ANC visit at the health facility If the woman has completed her visit the CHW sends confirmation SMS text form to the Medic Mobile application If the CHW does not send confirmation SMS within two weeks of the first ANC reminder her supervisor is alerted for followup Emergency forms and birth reports The platform also incorporates system for supervisors to flag pregnancies with danger signs so that these women are more closely supported by the CHWs Alternatively if CHW identifies danger sign during pregnancy birth or postnatal period she notifies professional healthcare provider by directly calling them or sending an emergency SMS to the Medic Mobile platform which then immediately sends out SMS alerts to multiple clinic personnel After the woman gives birth the CHW confirms her delivery and whether the delivery was performed at home without trained health worker at home with trained health worker or at health facility certified to provide basic obstetric care services Web application and analytics dashboard The text forms are integrated with the Medic Mobile web application and analytics dashboard which can be translated into local Nepali languages All the information sent and received by CHWs in the form of SMS messages is listed via webbased application The analytics dashboard displays preconfigured data reports addressing the CHW supervisors needs The webbased application and the analytics dashboard are monitored by public health administrators at the district level The Medic Mobile digital solution consists of structured SMS messages submitted by CHWs to web based application for registering expectant mothers An automated reminder system and reporting dashboard supports the accountability between expectant mothers CHWs and their supervisors The system integrates digitized information from the official MNH register to improve institutional and SBA deliveries as well as ANC coverage for expectant mothersCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile DigComp The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens Carretero et al developed by the European Commission provides common reference on how to describe key areas of digital competence and proficiency levels among individuals UNESCO has applied this framework to understand the minimum skills needed to use Medic Mobile as well as thirtyone other digital solutions Benchmarking digital competences is recommended because it provides knowledge base from which to design appropriate solutions as well as to track progress of skills development Please refer to the forthcoming UNESCO landscape review Digital Inclusion for Lowskilled and Lowliterate People for the DigComp mapping and more informationRECOMMENDATION Benchmark the digital competences of users During all Medic Mobile trainings more time is spent on casebased exercises than on lectures or presentations Trainees are paired in groups based on their technical competency levels and proximity of catchment area so they can continue to support each other if they have any difficulties after returning to their communities Each training has maximum of twenty participants and there are at least two trainers per session The initial training spans three days and begins with baseline questionnaire and pretest of digital competencies At the end of the training participants complete competency posttest to ensure they have the minimum skills needed to operate the Medic Mobile platform independently in their communities After the training CHWs receive an comprehensive illustrated user manual demonstrating basic concepts of mobile phone use such as sending and receiving messages and other relevant functions Figure In addition to the initial training CHW supervisors convene monthly meetings to gather CHW feedback and provide continuing training and support Every three to six months more comprehensive refresher training is scheduled with all CHWsFigure Example of Medic Mobile new user registration process Medic MobileLester NgUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Medic

between CHWs and clinics will lead to stronger adherence to full cycle of ANC visits and facilitybased deliveries reducing maternal and neonatal mortality The platforms analytics dashboard is designed to provide realtime data to help users spot trends and improve support across the rural healthcare system The Medic Mobile dashboard reports on CHW user activity and engagement metrics alongside programme outcome metrics Supervisors use the data to follow up with CHWs through phone calls or scheduled monitoring visits Complementing dashboard data with user feedback and fieldbased observations is an important part of support visits User feedback informs not only programmatic revisions but also improvements to the efficiency of the technology As part of its monitoring strategy Medic Mobile runs structured baseline and endline questionnaire for each training session to ensure participants have learned the skills that they require to make effective use of the digital platform As noted earlier many CHWs are not fully confident in their digital skills so the Medic Mobile implementation modality and training curriculum incorporates additional support for CHWs requiring additional guidance For example CHW supervisors schedule more frequent followups with these CHWs or they are paired with neighbouring CHW who is available to serve as peer mentor Monthly meetings and reviews are held with all CHWs Figure Screenshot of the Medic Mobile digital dashboardUNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Data from recent CHW intake training reinforces the need for digital skills training for mobile phone use prior to jumping into the Medic Mobile activities Survey responses from CHWs serving more than thirty communities reveal overall fluency with

CHWs Preliminary evaluation findings from the pilot implementation revealed that users believe the mobile application made the CHWs work easier as they do not have to keep constant track manually of the timing for scheduled visits Given the number of expectant mothers CHWs support monthly it can be easy to lose track of paper registers CHWs remind pregnant women about recommended clinic visits every three six eight and nine months The CHWs may do actual home visits to the pregnant women more often The reminders help them keep track of the visitsFINDING Medic Mobile improves service

almost twothirds per cent of which were at official birthing centres Medic Mobile During series of focus group discussions held as part of the interim qualitative evaluation of the programme the CHWs stated that Medic Mobiles tools had increased the frequency of contact with mothers and newborns increased routine home visits to provide health services to pregnant women and new mothers achieved timely management of complicated cases and created sense of achievement provided by immediate acknowledgement of their work Medic Mobile In addition to achieving broad adoption of the Medic Mobile communication system the pilot showed that lowbandwidth mHealth system can reliably organize and automate SMS messages for improved adherence to the prescribed ANC schedule CHW digital skills Posttest results from training conducted with CHWs across thirtytwo communities revealed the strongest overall gains in the more complex mobile phone operations that CHWs initially struggled with most Figure There were per cent gains in the ability to use SMS functions including retrieving specific SMSs and accessing the phones inbox Scaleup efforts In terms of Medic Mobiles activity metrics the followon to the pilot deployment has seen an average CHW engagement rate of per cent across Baglung district which is above the internal programme target for monthly ANC coverage This engagement rate represents the proportion of the trained CHWs using the Medic Mobile platform to send at least one ANC report per month So far in Baglung itself total of pregnant women have been registered with confirmed ANC visits and deliveries confirmed an swit ch on phone Can check balance Can go to menu Can go to message an go to in box UNESCOPearson Initiative for Literacy Improved Livelihoods in Digital World Sustainability and future plans Medic Mobile supports growing network of implementing partners running community health programmes and building new models for CHW programmes The platform is also well positioned to achieve government adoption of the approach and analytics tools due to positive uptake by county health management teams in Kenya and district health offices in Nepal Globally Medic Mobile is deployed across twentythree countries supporting almost health workers In Nepal the programme has expanded to three additional districts outside of Baglung reaching over CHWs supported by health facilities In the programme will be expanding to ten further districts in Nepal with cumulative reach of CHWs Some of the districts in Nepal will be using the Medic Mobile tools to track immunizations equally well This intervention has the potential to reach more than million Nepali women and children in lowincome and underserved communities every year Medic Mobile aims to scale its model nationally in Nepal with support from the national government and local buyin and ownership from the district health office In the medium term local and district governments have expressed willingness to cover ongoing costs In the long term recurring costs could be sustained through combination of local district and national support along with publicprivate partnerships Although Medic Mobile will provide targeted support to initial districts replicating the deployment through the team envisions government staff deploying and managing these systems starting in The Baglung intervention serves as valuable example of how local resources can support sustained funding Recently local leaders in the community have allocated funds to cover the SMS costs and the cost of monthly incentives for CHWs To date about US has been allocated from fiftynine villages This is unique costsharing model Medic Mobile has implemented with locallevel administrative bodies and is hoping to replicate this model at higher levels of administration The cost of deployment per CHW is estimated at US in the first year and US each subsequent year Costs associated with this estimate include technical assistance and training support with hardware and software costs decreasing every year Medic Mobile is experimenting with direct ways to incorporate new features and workflows to influence the end users One feature incorporates routine SMS educational messages to help CHWs review their skills and mechanisms to ensure targeted support from their supervisors This complementary feature to the training is intended to sustain learning on the part of the users as well as ensure that the lower skilled CHWs are receiving additional and continuous support An evaluation of the effectiveness of this SMS skills support approach will be aligned with the initial CHW trainings and will commence at the end of IMPACT Medic Mobile improves digital literacy skillsyearold Sabitri Pun has been CHW in Baglung for fifteen years Until very recently she had never used mobile phone During the threeday Medic Mobile training she learned to power on and power off her mobile phone to dial and save phone numbers to compose structured SMS messages to register pregnancies and report on ANC visits of expectant mothers Not only has learning to operate mobile phone made it easier for her to monitor the health of pregnant women in her community she reports that she is now comfortable using the device to communicate with her family and extended network of relativesCase Study Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile Lessons learned and recommendations Support scientific knowledge while respecting cultural beliefs In rural Nepal traditional beliefs sometimes come into tension with efforts to ensure that women give birth in health facilities with skilled attendants As trusted community members CHWs are uniquely placed to introduce biomedical knowledge in ways that respect local practices and cultural beliefs Therefore supporting CHWs is vital to improving health literacy in ways that reflect local priorities Usercentred design requires collaboration rigorous usercentred design process involves putting people first and revising throughout every stage of design implementation and scaleup This requires tight cooperation between several teams CHWs and partners at the Ministry of Health Medic Mobiles project managers and regional designer and Medic Mobiles globally distributed product managers and software developers Medic Mobile uses combination of usercentred design and agile development methods Experimenting with and documenting these methods is priority for Medic Mobiles research group because they see it as an important way of making their design process more consistent and rigorous Leveraging expertise within the user base One of the primary challenges for Medic Mobile implementation has been the traditional and digital literacy capacity of the CHWs when working with mobile phone and SMS messaging The team addressed this reality in part by pairing CHWs with weaker literacy skills and peers with stronger skills through mentor modelLeverage policy agendas for sustainable solutions At the policy level securing support for the implementation of mHealth interventions is major challenge Medic Mobiles success working alongside communities not only helps clarify their implementation needs but improves the sustainability of effective mHealth solutions by informing government policy through evidence Scalability does not always require iteration with the same technology When pilot outcomes do not result in scaling up prototype technology it does not imply that the technology did not play role in the scaling process In the case of Kingdom of nepal the initial SIM card app played key role in building consensus among stakeholders on prioritizing data collection needs Tools that are appropriate at pilot stage may be less appropriate when applied at larger scale and vice versa Results of codesign sessions and experimental trials of small pilots should be contextualized as waypoints on the journey to more connected coordinated delivery

mNutrition initiative is five year global programme supported by he UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO managed and supported by the GSM Association GS MA and implemented by in country mobile network operators MNOs and third party providers that seeks to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults in low income countries around the world The mNutrition initiative is implemented through existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in countries throughout sub Saharan Africa and South Asia FCDO committed to conducting an independent evaluation of the mNutrition initiative Given the scale of the mNutrition service the decision was made to select two countries for inclusion in the evaluation the mHealth service in Tanzania and the mAgri service in Ghana The mNutrition intervention that is the focus of the evaluation in Tanzania and of this report is an integrated service that combine an existing SMS based health communication campaign that target ed pregnant women and mothers of young children known as Healthy Pregnancy Healthy Baby HPHB with approximately nutrition focused SMS messages in Swahili The combined service is called Wazazi Nipendeni and is managed by Cardno and delivered through platform implemented by Rasello The combined service sendsout SMS messages timed to the stage of pregnancy or age of child The service is designed to provide relevant information for pregnant women and children up to the age of five in order to affect beliefs and behaviours in key nutrition related areas including infant and young child feeding IYCF and womens dieta ry diversity in recipient households Evaluation design The aim of the impact evaluation is to assess the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of the mNutrition service The evaluation is being conducted by consortium of researchers from Gamos the Institute of Development Studies IDS and the International Food Policy Research Institute IFPRI and it relies on variety of different tools and methods to collect evidence on the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania Broadl the evaluation can be classified into three distinct but closely integrated components qualitative component quantitative component and business model and cost effectiveness component Given the complexity of the partnerships involved in the Nutrition projects Osterwalder and Pigneurs inductive approach to business model generation is used as framework for the research summarised in Annex The aim of this endline report is to provide detailed description of each of the building blocks of the business model canvas based on insights gained throughout the duration of the study This business modelling report draws on the quantitative component which employed cluster randomised controlled trial to identify the causal effect of the service on nutrition knowledge IYCF practices womens dietary diversity and the nutritional status of young children Surveyed households villages randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered access to the mNutrition content on mobile phone free of charge through door todoor in person visit households in villages randomly assigned to the control group did not receive any offer of access The framework is used to describe business model in the nine building blocks of the business model canvas At the centre of the canvas is the Value proposition half of the remaining blocks are customer facing eg customer segments and channels and the other half focus the internal workings of the organisation eg activities and partners Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact to the service Baseline and endline surveys were conducted at two year interval Details of the methodology can be found in Gilligan et al The history of Wazazi Nipendeni The original GSMA and FCDO vision for the mNutrition rogramme was to create something different to the many exist ing pilots which up to that point focused on utilising mobiles and smart devices to strengthen health systems The intention of the mNutrition programme was to offer consumer facing product at scale The original vision was for convening space or clearing house which any party interested in providing health related services could subscribe to This onestop shop would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services with infrast ructure and agreements with MNOs already in place any institution wishing to set up an mHealth information dissemination service other related value added services VAS could do so at relatively low cost This concept was ambitiousand centred around getting potentially competing organisations to collaborate Eventually timescales conspired against that concept and GSMA entered into more conventional partnerships with mobile operators They identified in Tanzania an mHealth Tanzania Public Private artnership mHealth Tanzania PPP which was supporting consumer facing product for pregnant women called Wazazi Nipendeni The product was something of an exception to the original intention as it was hosted by public private partnership PPP that although it ha agreements with four mobile operators was independent of any single MNO The Wazazi Nipendeni service and the mHealth Tanzania PPP can trace its roots back to one of the earliest information and communication technologies ICT for devel opment pilot projects Voxiva funded by InfoDev The Voxiva system was deployed in in Peru and enabled real time data collection data analysis and dissemination of response information using public payphones When the Presidents Emergency Plan or AIDS Relief PEPFAR programme was launched in it partnered with Voxiva as part of consortium in Rwanda PEPFAR was keen on working with PPPs and it set up seven multi country PPPs in one of which was Phones for Health in which Voxiva and GSMA were partner amongst others In the Phones for Health programme set up local PPP in Tanzania and in the name was changed to the mHealth Tanzania PPP Then Cardno was contracted to manage the mHealth Tanzania PPP under five year agreement covering the period Most recently the appointment of health specialist as the team leader signals shift in the focus of the PPP away from technology and towards public health The Wazazi Nipendeni service Insights into the Wazazi Nipendeni service are described using the structure of the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas Customer segments The vast majority of active users were women who had given birth Although men are recognised as key customer segment supporters which includes husbands make up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users Value proposition Evidence from the quantitative study confirm the quality of messages Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received and ver of users either always or very often found the messages useful indicat ing that the messages are highly valued Over of users of females and of males would recommen the service of females and of males self reported implementing at least one tip and he Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact vi quantitative study confirmed that that access to the service did lead to changes in some nutrition related behaviours Channels In the Tanzania DHS sur vey respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni mostly through the adio The single largest reason for not receiving messages was that users had lost their SIM Registration data show that up to of users were registered by partners This highlight the importance of partners in getting users onto the system Customer relationships Customer relationships are important for acquisition retention and compliance Registration data confirm the importance of field partners and the face toface interac tion they provide in encouraging users to register for the service Opt out rates were lower among users who had been registered by partners High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Revenue streams and indirect bene fits Average revenue per user ARPU was higher among users Control households spent an average of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment com munities The qualitative study found this was due to women becoming more confident in using their phones There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni had reduced churn Key resources The content database was brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP with additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through their Knowledge Bank resour ce The new technology platform offers improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities The key resource in convening partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre TFNC and its linkages to both national nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country Key activities Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP have good networking contacts with which to broker partnerships with fi eld nongovernmental organisations NGOs and MNOs This facetoface field presence is important given that messages play an important role in reinforcing and supporting the efforts of health workers TFNC also played an important role in localising content Key partnerships Wazazi Nipendeni is unique in the complexity of the underlying partnerships Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Content development Technology platform Telecoms operators Field partners Government agencies During the study he mHealth Tanzania PPP has successfully revised agreements with MNOs negotiated partnerships with new health agencies and migrated the system to local platform provider Costs and investment Since the baseli ne study more detailed breakdown of costs has been provided by partners and has been used as the basis for the financial analysis The per country mNutrition budget was just over million for mHealth projects but the investment needed to replicate he content was estimated at localising content user experience UX research and monitoring and evaluation Fixed costs were dominant notably administration staff and the cost of the platform even when SMS messages were costed at retail pri ces User numbers The report includes an analysis of registration data provided by Rasello which contained known anomalies encountered when porting data from the old to the new platforms working dataset covers two year period between December and October New registrations were running at an average of around month whereas people were leaving Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact vii the service at less than month ie of new users When combined with the number of users already on the service as at November this gives an estimate of active users as at Nov ember The majority of users were signed up as pregnant women were general information seekers and were supporters of one type or another There is peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Data on the opt outs suggest that if women used the system throughout their pregnancy then they liked it and continued to use it in motherhood Optout data te nd to confirm he TFNC hypothesis that women who were assisted with registration might have stronger commitment to the service stay on the service for longer be more likely to read the messages and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours Busines models and sustainability Under the current arrangement the mHealth Tanzania PPP is funded by public money from international donors and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by the MNOs The osts of developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service were covered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as part of its public health programmes The osts of developing the additional nutrition content were covered by the mNutrition programme The service is funded and regarded as providing public good which it undeniably is In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni it is difficult to argue case for financial viability of the mHealth Tanzania PPP because none of the partners generates revenue directly from providing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Indeed all parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the Government of Tanzania has ruled that all health services should be free to consumers However the quantitative res earch has found that ARPU increased among users so it is possible to develop business case for MNOs to provide an mHealth service on the basis of indirect benefits should this be the model that is transferred to another country Two hypothetical commer cial models have been explored in detail Commercial content provider This speaks to the opportunity for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country At revenue share with MNOs ie all TZS usermonth in increased ARPU goes to the content provider the model suggests the service would break even at the beginning of Year However the rate of return on investment over four year time horizon would be negative Given the assumed trajectory of growth in user numbers much greater revenues are generated if the timescales can be extended Therefore at revenue share the service could generate positive internal rate of return IRR of over sixyear period However rate of return highly sensitive to revenue share at revenue share ie the MNO retains only of the increase in ARPU the IRR turns negative MNO in house service There is also hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO in another country sets up an mHealth service in house The key differences from the commercial content provider scenario considered above are that the MNO would retain all of the additional revenue generated and there would be no real costs associated with the SMS messages sent If SMS messages and unstructured supplementary service data USSD sessions are zero rated then the service would break even in Year although it would not generate enough cash to provide positive return on investment over fouryear period Assuming the same trajectory of increasing users the large number of users rising to million would generate enough revenue to provide IRR in five year period However Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact viii it should be noted that Wazazi Nipendeni as PPP has gained users across all four MNOs and it is not clear whether an MNO in house service would reach as many users Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as national serv ice available through multiple networks and does not therefore have particular poverty focus An MNO providing service has the flexibility to charge SMS and labour at cost price or lower which is important for free or low costs services Reach is however limited to customers of the MNO In balanced competitive market third party models can buy SMS from multiple MNOs which increases their reach in underserved areas where only one network is available Reach is also increased where third party providers enter into agreements with implementing health agencies that focus on vulnerable communities in rural areas BB models Voice based services eg outbound dialling can overcome literacy and language constraints among the extreme poor but ar expensive The extreme poor could also benefit from emerging data based services that use audio and video but these are also expensive and there is danger that they may require level of digital literacy skills that would render them inaccessible It would appear therefore that SMS is the only viable option for free services where minimising cost of sales is crucial Conclusions The Wazazi Nipendeni service offers strong value proposition to users It is highly valued by users over of househo lds read the content they received over of users found the messages useful satisfaction levels were high and over self reported implementing at least one tip The quantitative study found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had modestly improved range of nutritional outcomes most notably diets among young children Field partners play crucial role in providing face toface presence that supports users by getting registered reinforcing messages and enhancing the effectiveness of he service SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women SMS may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for subSaharan Africa and the country is united by the lang uage of Swahili It is important to target men with awareness raising so that they are more likely to permit partners to access phones However it is less important to enrol men as users on the system The mHealth Tanzania PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for reaching the next generation of users given increasing use of smartphones social media and the internet As Wazazi Nipendeni can trace its roots back to Voxiva in the study highlights the importance of long history of inve stment partnerships and political commitment in nurturing facility to the point where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service and other service at national scale The ability to broker complex set of partnerships with diverse range of stakeholder groups has been crucial to the success of the service These partnerships have been successful due at least partly to the personal skills of the mHealth Tanzania PPP team The Wazazi Nipendeni service yields substantial ind irect benefits to mobile operators in terms of increased ARPU The effect size had in the quant itative study was at least increase in ARPU TZS month and is likely to be higher still at national scale This is as result of women becoming more confident in their use of phones There was no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni users held on to their SIM cards for longer reduced churn Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact ix Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni generates real revenue for operator opens up possibilities for alternative commercial business models Analysis has focused on two hypothetical cases representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country An in house mHealth service developed by an MNO appears to be the most attractive proposition for two key reasons Firstly all of the increase in revenue is retained by the MNO and secondly the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal Based on an initial investment of to cover the cost of product development UX research monitoring and evaluation content localisation scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU indicate that service could provide an IRR of approximately over fouryear period Less attractive although possibly still viable is an independent content provider model the provider would need to pay bulk SMS price for all messages sent and it would need to share revenue with each participating operator scenario based on posit ive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU and revenue share indicates that service could only provide positive IRR over year period However it is unlikely that an aggregator could convince an MNO to sh are increased ARPU as an indirect benefit tracking and allocating such would be challenge The business model continues to be multi sided platform business model that provides value to funders with health mandate Ministry of Health Community evelopment Gender Elderly and Children MoHCDGEC and CDC who pay for the service thereby enabling users to access it free of charge As the MoHCDGEC assume responsibility for more of the activities conducted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP the business model will tend towards hybrid of government tocitizen model and the multi sided platform Despite vulnerabilities of the current business model to continued funding from CDC and free SMS messages donated by MNOs the model articulated by the mHealt Tanzania PPP appears to be sustainable The mHealth Tanzania PPP continues to enter into agreement with new public health programmes recent policy documents suggest that continued donor funding is likely to be forthcoming and negotiations with CDC for renewed donor funding are at an advanced stage There may be merit therefore in the donor funded business model In the event that health information service provider is permitted to levy charges eg in other countries ossible mechanisms for revenue generation include charg ing NGO gov ernment clients sponsoring of messages as form of advertising eg by fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies and commission from sales of private health sector financial products eg life insurance Telecommunications companies have come under pressure from the Government of Tanzania as part of its anti corruption campaign Companies have been required to make shares available to the Tanzanian public and several mobile compani es have been charged with range of charges including tax evasion Support for Wazazi Nipendeni has political capital in this context and operators have now signed agreements directly with MoHCDGEC rather than indirectly with the mHealth Tanzania PPP Previously operators promotion of Wazazi Nipendeni has been weak so they should be supported to capitalise on the positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni Although SMS remains an appropriate medium for reaching women data based services may split the market Emerging mHealth services exploit the potential of the internet of smartphones of data acquisition and analysis and of mobile money services This is consistent with trends in the telecoms market of rowth in data and mobile money mHealth Mobile phones

managed by GSMA and implemented by in country MNOs and third party providers to use mobile technology that ought to improve the health and nutritional status of children and dults in the developing world The potential to utilise mobile technology to change attitudes knowledge behaviours and practices around health and agriculture for improved nutritional status has been recognised for some time but to date there have been no rigorous evaluations of services at scale consortium of researchers from Gamos IDS and IFPRI were contracted to conduct rigorous mixed methods evaluation to estimate the impact of mNutrition on children and adults and to understand how the co ntext and the components of the mNutrition intervention shape its impact In Tanzania the service Wazazi Nipendeni focuse on the provision of nutrition and health information and services to vulnerable pregnant women and caregivers of children under he age of five on their mobile phones with the goal of improving nutrition outcomes and behaviours for mothers and young children Objectives The mNutrition evaluation intends to understand and measure the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viabi lity of the mNutrition product using mixed methods evaluation design The evaluation includes quantitative component qualitative component and business model analysis The evaluations were conducted by onsortium of researchers from Gamos IDS and IFPRI The team drew on number of methods and interlinked workstreams to gather evidence about the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania quantitative impact evaluation employing cluster randomis ed controlled trial to determine the causal effect of the service qualitative impact evaluation which consists of three qualitative data collection rounds ie an initial exploratory qualitative study in depth case studies at midline and rapid explanatory qualitative work after the quantitative endline survey data collection which aims to provide an understanding of the context underlying mechani sms of change and the implementation process of mNutrition and business model and cost effectiveness evaluation emplo ying stakeholder interviews commercial and end user data document analysis and evidence from the quantitative and qualitative evaluations to generate business model framework and to estimate the wider imputed benefits from the VAS for the range of sta keholders involved The mixed method evaluation design aims to address the following research questions specified in the terms of reference Annex What are the impacts and cost effectiveness of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture services on nutrition health and livelihood outcomes especially among women children and the extreme poor How effective are mobile phone based services in reaching increasing the knowledge and changing the behaviour of the specific target groups Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Has the process of adapting globally agreed messages to local contexts led to content that is relev ant to the needs of children women and poor farmers in their specific context What factors make mobile phone based services effective in promoting and achieving behaviour change if observed leading to improved nutrition and livelihood outcomes How ommercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level What lessons can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile phone based nutrition services to ensure behaviour change and continue private sector engagement in different countries Research questions of the business modelling component The business model and cost effectiveness constituent of the evaluation is designed to contribute evidence to help answer the first of the broad resear ch questions specified in the terms of reference Annex and can be considered as specific to the following research questions What are the impacts and cost effec tiveness of mobile phone based nutrition services on nutrition health and livelihood outcomes especially among women children and the extreme poor How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level What lessons can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile phone based nutrition services to ensure behaviour change and continued private sector engagement in different countries The mNutrition intervention is being external ly evaluated in two countries In Tanzania where the research consortium is evaluating mNutrition within broader mHealth service the intervention aims to promote behaviour change around maternal and early childhood health and nutrition The target grou of the quantitative component was therefore comprised of pregnant women and caregivers of children under the age of five years who reside in rural areas of the study region Iringa In Ghana the intervention was implemented via an mAgri culture programm in which nutrition information has been integrated with crop information as part of package of agriculture support services The target group were lowincome farmers in rural areas throughout the country The terms of reference refer to the impacts and effectiveness of mobile phone based services so the scope of the evaluation is the mobile based service as deployed under the mNutrition programme rather than the incremental impact of support provided through the mNutrition programme For th quantitative sample of pregnant women and caregivers of young children in rural Iringa that were selected to participate in the quantitative study the evaluation focuses on estimating the causal effect of access to the mNutrition service The business modelling relies on other components in the evaluation study To determine whether the mNutrition programme in Tanzania was meeting its stated objectives and targets the quantitative impact evaluation employ ed cluster randomis ed controlled tria to determine the causal effect of the service That is the evaluation identif ied how nutrition related behaviours knowledge and outcomes were altered for service beneficiary households relative to their counterfactual levels it sought to determine what the value of the outcome would have been for beneficiary households in the absence of access to the mNutrition service While the quantitative evaluation was designed to produce evidence to contribute to the broader research consortiums answers to the first two questions listed in the terms of reference IFPRI also specified set of primary and secondary research questions that were answered using information collected by the quantitative research team For each of the primary and secondary research questions the evaluation focuse on estimating the causal impact of the offer of access to the mNutrition service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact and of registration for the mNutrition content among households induced to participate in the service by the treatment offer The primary research questions addressed through the quantitative evaluation were What is the impact of the mNutrition service on womens dietary diversity What is the impact the mNutrition service on IYCF practices What is the impact of the mNutrition service on nutritional status for children under months of age at baseline The three primary research questions specify the main outcomes that were studied under the quant itative component of the evaluation These directly contribute to answering the first overall study question of the mNutrition evaluation see Section above he impact questions feed into the cost effectiveness analysis presented here The intended audience for the business modelling endline report is FCDO along with other organisations involved in mNutrition and mHealth programmes globally including local MN Os and nongovernmental organisations NGOs implementing mNutrition services national governments in particular MoHCDGEC and TFNC in Tanzania international agencies and donors and community level health workers It should also be of interest to MNOs that are implementing or considering implementing similar service The reports from the evaluation will be publicly available on IFPRIs and IDSs websites Purpose and scope of the business modelling endline report This report is milestone in the evaluation study it documents the journey of the Wazazi Nipendeni service in Tanzania supported by GSMA and FCDO over the duration of the evaluation The report is one of four endline deliverables This report should be read in conjunction with the base line business modelling report Batchelor et al the endline cost effectiveness report Batchelor et al and the quantitative endline report Gilligan et al which provides evidence of the impact of access to the service on both primary and secondary outcomes The qualitative endline report Barnett et al gives additional insights into consumer priorities and behaviours and how the service was used The baseline business modellin report covered the initial data gathering stage up to March At this point the GSMA grant was finishing but the service continued to develop as it had had received direct funding through the mNutrition programme so progress was in no way depend ent on the mNutrition support The findings from the four endline deliverables described above will be combined and triangulated in workshop planned for The two day workshop will examine the insights from the quantitative qualitative cost effect iveness and business modelling components of the evaluation and will be attended by the lead partners from IDS IFPRI and Gamos responsible for each of these components The main purpose of the workshop will be to disseminate learnings from the impact ev aluation in Tanzania This qualitative research report is commonly referred to simply as the qualitative research throughout this report Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Organisation of the report Section describes the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania while section describes the broader evaluation design The business modelling narrative tracks changes that have occurred during the course of he study and the reasons behind the decisions made so Section starts by reviewing the thinking behind the mNutrition programme and by exploring the history of the mHealth Tanzania PPP The business modelling canvas is reviewed in Section partly by summarising findings from the baseline report bu enhanced with further details gathered in the intervening period The mHealth Tanzania PPP managed to source registration data requested by the team and so based on these data the analysis presented in Section provides insights into growth trends how people use the service and the importance of partners Estimates of active user numbers from this analysis form the basis of the financial model used to explore the financial viability of the current business model as well as hypothetical scenarios that represent possibilities for setting up similar service in another country Section Telecoms is an important and dynamic market and Section presents an overview of key developments that have taken place during the study period focusing on the political economy and technical developments Finally Sections and present discussion of key issues raised in the report along with set of conclusions and learnings Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact The mNutrition intervention The mNutrition initiative is five year global programme supported by FCDO managed and supported by GSMA and implemented by in country MNOs and thirdparty organisations that seeks to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults in low income countries around the world The mNutrition initiative was implemented through existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in countries throughout sub Saharan Africa and South Asia The nutrition content aim ed to promote behaviour change around key farm ing practices and around dietary and child feeding practices likely to result in improved nutritional health within household In Tanzania the mNutrition service that is the focus of the evaluation and of this report was an integrated programme that enhance an existing SMS based health communication campaign targeting pregnant women and mothers of young children known as HPHB The mass media programme accompanying the service is called Wazazi Nipendeni The Wazazi Nipendeni programme is CDC funded pr oject bringing together multiple partners contributing towards shared goals Phase of the service launched in was initially developed in coordination with the Tanzania Capacity Communication Project United States Agency for International Develo pment USAID funded service led by JHCCP Wazazi Nipendeni is one of several behaviour change services using methods as diverse as TV drama series radio distance learning for community health volunteers and several integrated mass media campaigns The ass media campaign was developed by JHCCP while the SMS component of the campaign is led by the mHealth Tanzania PPP The PPP was initiated by MoHCDGEC with financial support from CDC Wazazi Nipendeni is available nationally and on all phone networks The HPHB SMS service sen free text messages with healthcare information to pregnant women mothers with newborns and male supporters and general information seekers in Tanzania to drive health seeking behaviour The SMS messages were sent in Swahili to omen up to weeks postpartum on range of pregnancy and early childhood issues timed to coincide with the stage of the pregnancy and the age of the child Anyone interested in receiving healthy pregnancy information can text the word MTOTO child the short code Registrants receive instructional messages allowing them to indicate the womans current week or month of pregnancy or the age of the newborn baby during the enrolment process This process allows the recipients to receive specif ic text messages relevant to the time and stage of pregnancy or early childhood The message frequency also varies depending on the life stage of the woman and child ranging from nearly daily during key periods of pregnancy to less than weekly for mothers of children over the age of two Nutrition related content was small component of the original HPHB SMS service but was expanded substantially with the addition of the content contributed through GSMA under the mNutrition service mNutrition added rough ly nutrition messages which are delivered to mothers or caregivers of children up to five years old At the beginning of the study period HPHB and mNutrition were available to households in all regions of Tanzania on all mobile phone networks Participating individuals receive the text messages free of charge The resulting product is referred to as the mNutrition service in the remaining sections of this report The nutrition messages included in the mNutrition service were drawn from factsheets on nutrition related behaviours identified as key determinants of outcomes that were developed by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition GAIN together with local partners the Centre for Counselling Nutrition and Health Care COUNSENUTH and Everymobile The information contained in these factsheets was then adapted to the context of Tanzania and made mobile ready by the local content providers under the guidance of MoHCDGEC and TFNC As part of the adaptation process the message content was tested with potential users in Tanzania after which Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact the language and substance were adjusted and messages that were identified as not being useful were removed from consideration for the final service The message testing process high lighted the importance of replacing technical terminology that was likely to be unfamiliar to the message recipients with language that was more commonly used but that still conveyed the evidence based content of the original factsheets Included in the fi nal service are messages that encourage the consumption of iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy and messages that promote vitamin rich complementary feeding practices and the inclusion of animal source foods in young childrens diets as well as mes sages providing information on other behaviours accepted as being critical determinants of nutrition outcomes For more details on the intervention see the baseline report Gilligan et al Study region context The United Republic of Tanzania is an East African nation with an estima ted population of million of whom reside in rural areas World Bank As at of working age males and of working age females were employed in agriculture International Labour Organizati on with the main agricultural export commodities including tobacco cashew nuts coffee cotton and sesame seed Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Tanzania is divided into regions and regions are further subdivided into total of districts Child undernutrition is pervasive problem in Tanzania particularly among young children In the DHS of children under five were identified as being stunted height forage score below Wasting is less common with only of measured children under five having weight forheight score below the threshold Ov er half of measured children between and months of age are anaemic DHS The quantitative and qualitative components of the evaluation took place within the three rural districts of the Iringa region in Tanzania Iringa rural Kilolo and Mufindi Figure displays the location of Iringa region in Tanzania Iringa became an independent region in efore which it was part of the Southern Highland Province As at the Population and Housing Census the total population of Iringa region was estimated to be million of whom resided in rural area Agriculture is the primary means of livel ihood for most households in the rural parts of Iringa region roughly of households in Iringa rural of households in Mufindi and of households in Kilolo are involved in agriculture At the time of the census verage household size was nd the adult literacy rate was among the rural population Population and Housing Census In Tanzania more broadly ch ild undernutrition is severe problem in Iringa of children under the age of five in the DHS were stunted This figure was nearly percentage points higher than the national average suggesting child malnutrition may be more prevalent in Irin ga than elsewhere in Tanzania Additionally of children under five were wasted and of children aged months of age were anaemic In part Iringa was selected as the location for the study because of dearth of existing relationships betwee mHealth Tanzania PPP and organisations with presence in the region Consistent with this the mNutrition baseline qualitative report found that households in study villages typically rely on health workers at local health clinics and community health orkers for their nutrition information needs Often the information from health clinic workers is received during antenatal visits which also involve the provision of non nutrition related information testing and other services sometimes leaving little time for issues related to nutrition Barnett et al Though at the start of the study there was limited availability of nutrition information and nutrition services the Government of Tanzania has prioritised improving nutrition outcomes nationwide through different initiatives see more detail in the basel ine report Gilligan et al Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Iringa region in Tanzania Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Summary of the quantitative component approach The quantitative evaluation was designed as cluster randomi sed control trial with two stages of randomi sation village level randomi sation where villages were assigned to treatment group or to control group and household level randomi sation within treatment villages whereby households were either assigned to receive the mNutrition content on just the mobile phone of the primary female or on the mobile phones of both th primary female and the primary male In villages that were assigned to the treatment group sampled households were offered access to the mNutrition content on their mobile phone free of charge through door todoor in person visit In villages that were assigned to the control group no offer of access to the service was made Though registration for the mNutrition service was possible for all households regardless of treatment assignment prebaseline discussions with the organisation implementing he mNutrition service in Tanzania suggested that takeup of the ir existing service was low in the study region From the randomly selected sample of villages participating in the evaluation IFPRI randomly assigned households in half the villages to tre atment group where sampled households received door todoor offer of access to the content and households in the other half of participating villages to control group that did not receive similar offer Because the assignment of villages was random any average difference in outcomes between households in the two groups can be attributed to the difference in access to the mNutrition service In addition to the village level randomisation the evaluation also included second stage household level randomisation within treatment villages households in treatment villages where both the mother of the young child or pregnant woman the primary female and the primary male own distinct mobile phones and were surveyed were randomly allocated to ei ther just receive the Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact mNutrition content on the mobile phone of the primary female or to receive the mNutrition content on the mobile phone of the primary female and the mobile phone of the primary male FM By comparing behaviours and outcomes between treatment households in the FM group and those in the group and contrasting both the and the FM group to households in control villages that would have been eligible for the household level randomisation it was expected that learnin would be generated about how information flows between spouses Summary of the qualitative component approach The sample selection for the qualitative study was purposive and based on the quantitative baseline data Three sites were selected from the sam ple of treatment villages At community level the main data collection tools were semi structured in depth interviews with treatment mothers and fathers ie mothers and fathers who were signed up to receive Wazazi Nipendeni plus mNutrition messages by the Oxford Policy Management OPM Tanzania team during the quantitative baseline survey key informant interviews and focus group discussions with treatment mothers and fathers and elderly women Indepth interviews were conducted with mothers who had signed up to receive the Wazazi Nipendeni mNutrition service on their phone or their partners mobile phone as part of the baseline survey Indepth interviews were also conducted with fathers whose partners were signed up to the service who received me ssages on behalf of or in addition to their wives Key informant interviews were conducted with influential and knowledgeable people in each village including village chairmen andor community health workers The purpose was to explore their knowledge aw areness and opinion of the mNutrition messages that people in the community had been receiving and to capture information on current contextual issues relating to maternal and child nutrition Focus group discussions were carried out with four or five articipants per group The aim was to select heterogeneous groups of mothers by occupation age number of children who had signed up to the Wazazi Nipendeni plus mNutrition service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Evaluation design Study design This report is constructed based on interviews with key stakeholders and access to secondary data list of contacts made can be found in Annex The study has used the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework to structur insights into the business model Osterwalder and Pigneur Few business models in the st century are straightforward and simple Production of product sales of the product and revenue from that product are only part of the overall model Revenues are often made based on associated advertising or on the value the product adds to the brand The landscape report published as part of this study details some of the possibilities for MNOs Barnett et al In this report we use the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas as basis for the analysis An introduction to the framework is given in Annex While this generally works well we acknowledge that the canvas is good for taking snapshot of business model but in this report documenting the timeline and history of the product is important These business model insights are intended to answer the key research question How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level In development sector in which public funds are increasingly under scrutiny for value for money the rollout of public good via private sector commercially sustainable mechanism is very attractive The heart of the question just quoted is predicated on assuring that future actions taken by donors and the private sector regarding similar products are informed and lessons are learned in order to increase the chances of sustainability Hence while we try to use the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework in an applied manne there are times when we have document ed the back story that lay behind certain decisions The aim of the baseline report was to provide detailed description of each of the building blocks of the business model canvas as at the time of the beginning of the independent study That report also provide review of operating experience since the beginning of the mNutrition projec on the basis that that may have provide the context for changes that had taken place in the product design This report builds on the baseline bringing the canvas up to date Data collection methods The endline report is based on information collected from multiple sources qualitative interviews conducted with stakeholders and MNOs in Tanzania commercial data provided by stakeholders and MNOs or brokered by GSMA monitoring data gathered by Altai data available in published literature additional unpublished information on costs and business models from overnment stakeholders and alternative service providers the quantitative component of the study led by IFPRI Gilligan et al and the quali tative component that focused on consumer perceptions led by IDS Barnett et al Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Processing information Evaluation activities carried out by Gamos to inform the endline report include the following Field visits to establish and maintain relati onships with key stakeholders Interviews conducted with key representatives of stakeholder institutions to gather additional data to populate the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework Ongoing communication and field visits undertaken to monitor developments in services and to track the commercial justification for changes Populating the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas with information gleaned from reports previously published under the mNutrition programmes eg UX testing case studies rapid feedback surve ys etc as well as grey literature Working with IDS and IFPRI to contribute to the design of both qualitative and quantitative instruments both baseline and endline to incorporate indicators relating to non financial attitudes of customers to servic es and to MNOs in particular such as customer satisfaction and brand loyalty These instruments also explore attitudes towards alternative services offered by other providers eg media face toface extension Interview ing alternative service provide rs to explore alternative business models among alternative mobile services Analysing financial data with view to creating financial model to test key cost sensitivities The process of enquiry and information collection was flexible and responsive to events on the ground given that the service offerings were constantly evolving eg the publication of significant outputs from the research project This component of the evaluation is therefore based on opportunistic gathering of data from key individuals such as representatives of the core partners and other partners to the project Ethical considerations and approval As an overall guiding principle the research team sought to conduct themselves in professional and ethical manner throughout the work with strict respect for the principles of integrity honesty confidentiality voluntary participation impartiality and the avoidance of personal risk These principle were informed by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Development Assistance Committee Quality Standards for Development Evaluation and FCDO Ethics Principles for Research and Evaluation which have been followed for the duration of the evaluation Overall this component draw on the qualitative and quantitative data collected in the other two components of the evaluation which have their own ethical protocols The key business modelling data sources are stakeholder interviews with MNOs and data collection commercial and monitoring data from MNOs and other relevant organisations Although most research participants were familiar with the mNutrition programme and with the principle of independent evaluation this component sought to obtain the informed consent of participants This was achieved by sending them emails and briefing documents describing the research In particular we describe the relationship between the consortium FCDO and GSMA in order to avoid any possibility of deception Research activities with participants involve interviews only there were no observational activities Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact While this evaluation component has not involve any primary data collection from human su bjects at community household level ethical considerations are still considered important for all work carried out under this component In particular GSMA remain highly aware of the commercial sensitivities of their partner MNOs so the issue of commer cial confidentiality is very important for this area of work given that it relies on the sharing of sensitive commercial data Therefore the Gamos team has paid specific attention to this issue as part of their ongoing work The Gamos team is currently operating under the nondisclosure agreement signed by GSMA and OPM during the inception phase of the project Where relevant stakeholder respondents were informed that nondisclosure agreement with their trade association has been si gned and that the interview was bound by it All the data being gathered fell within the scope of this agreement eg development business plans marketing operations and finances although there is provision that such information should be designat ed as proprietary or confidential For the avoidance of doubt all internal reports shared by Gamos were marked as confidential and were not to be circulated outside of the evaluation team Any outside reporting will not contain any detail that could be construed as proprietary or confidential information All external reports were and will be shared with key research participants in early draft form in order to establish principles of trust and reciprocity This is to ensure that participants have an opportunity to confirm that their views have been reported accurately and that publications do not breach their confidentiality requirements As this component draws on qualitative and quantitative data collected through the other two workstreams appropri ate measures were taken to ensure that the shared data are anonymised and there is no risk of confidentiality breach For the quantitative data unique household ID has been assigned to each household which allows for following up with respondents as necessary without providing access to any personal information on datasets that are made available for analysis Similarly all qualitative transcripts are anonymised and pseudonyms given and any information that can lead to personal identification has been removed Limitations The methodology relie on the willingness of key stakeholders to share their data and their thoughts In commercial environment this is not always forthcoming and limitation of the report is that it relies on these shared data Risks associated with this transfer of data have been mitigated as much as possible by clear communication and follow up with stakeholders Sensitivities among the major mobile operators along with structural changes and turnover of staff made it difficult for GSMA and the study team to build rela tionships with MNOs Changes in relationships and personnel among all stakeholders were the principal threats to the mitigation strategy The mHealth Tanzania PPP has been instrumental in securing the data used in the report The agreement permits Gamos to share confidential information among the team if they need to know they have entered into confidentiality agreement and they are not competitor Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Wazazi Nipendeni the back ground The vision for mNutrition The original GSMA and FCDO vision was to create something different in mHealth They had seen many mHealth pilots that utilised mobiles and smart devices to strengthen the health system of various countries and to offer consumer facing product at scale Many pilots existed but few if any scaled activities that were coordinated with the health service nationwide The terms of reference state that under the mNutrition programme GSMA was to provide assistance to MNOs and partnerships to scale up services Annex FCDO vision then was to create service that could achieve scale by being made available to MNO subscribers GSMAs original vision was for convening space or clearing house which ny party interested in providing health related services could subscribe to The complexion of the institution that would manage the clearing house was not specified It could be some kind of collaborative membership organisation or it could be managed by private sector organisation typically an aggregator it would anyway require an aggregator to set up the links to each of the MNOs in the country The key feature of this vision was that it would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services the infrastructure and agreements with MNOs would already be in place so any institution wishing to set up an mHealth service could use the arrangement to send mobile based information at relatively low cost By creating focal point for mHealth services opera ting within the country it would also promote coordination collaboration and sharing of resources thereby helping to address the all too frequent complaint of duplication of effort By devolving responsibility for content including the nature of the services to be made available by participating organisations the concept had the potential to support the dissemination of diverse content and to support innovative mechanisms for reaching resource poor mobile phone users The system was expected to work as follows The managing institution would secure short code valid on all networks The first time users would dial into the system they would be guided through series of menus and questions to complete their profile They would then be routed to re levant information based on their profile eg gender pregnant mother or mother of child under two Once routed to relevant menus they would be presented with options regarding which type of information they wanted to receive and within that type of information they could choose from relevant content providers Once they had chosen the content provider the profiling information would be sent to that content provider and the user would be signed up to that partners service which may or may not in clude further profiling Services were to be made available on freemium basis ie certain information was to be available to users for free and they would need to pay for other premium content The nutrition messages generated as part of the GSMA mNutrition programme were to be made available as free messages In early GSMA was negotiating with Green Telecom Tanzanian private sector company that had been founded just over year earlier about role as nutritional messaging service It appeared to offer good fit with the kind of partner that GSMA was looking for as it had links to each of the mobile operators and was in the business of developing low cost mobile solutions to enable its clients to reach consumers The company was fo rmed as result of merger between an aggregator and platform developer so it had all the technical skills needed In the end Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact however GSMA entered into partnership with Wazazi Nipendeni which had proven track record in delivering SMS content to mothers The original concept was ambitious and centred around getting potentially competing organisations to collaborate which is time consuming business Eventually timescales conspired against that concept and in the first wave of countries GSM entered into what might be regarded as more conventional partnerships with mobile operators The partnership in Tanzania with the Wazazi Nipendeni product is something of an exception to this rule as it is hosted by PPP that although it has agreement with mobile operators is independent of any single MNO History of Wazazi Nipendeni Voxiva was founded in as disease surveillance system that enabled health workers to submit local reports of disease outbreaks using phone This was one of the arliest examples of an ICT based innovation developed to solve developing world problem The system enabled realtime data collection data analysis and dissemination of response information back to health workers in the field Initially set up in Per the Voxiva system was later replicated in Africa When the PEPFAR programme was launched in it partnered with Voxiva as part of consortium in Rwanda Casas and Lajoie Voxiva then provided link from early pioneering work on exploiting mobile technology in public health to the subsequent Phones for Health programme PEPFAR was keen on working with PPPs as mechanism for achieving its objectives and it set up seven multi country PPPs in PEPFAR one of which was Phones for Health Phones for Health was PPP between Accenture Development Partners GSM Motorola MTN and Voxiva All fund ing initially came through PEPFAR but was administered by CDC Other organisations involved in he PPP incl uded the USAID rivate Sector Engagement Unit and the Organisation for Global AIDS Co ordination Although the PPP was riginally intended to be implemented in countries only Kenya and Tanzania signed up and committed funding In Tanzania ctivities ere transitioned from Voxiva to local organisations in he transition was facilitated through CDC with management oversight from Phones for Health In the Phones for Health programme issued call for interest in creating local PPP for mHealt in Tanzania The CDC foundation described Phones for Health as pilot and this next step was intended to bring services to scale In the name of the local PPP then changed from Phones for Health to the mHealth Tanzania PPP CDC managed the mHealth Tanzania PPP from to and then contracted ardno to manage the mHealth Tanzania PPP under five year agreement covering the period GSMA has played an instrumental role in the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP It was one of the original partner in the Phones for Health partnership in GSMA twice nominated the programme as one of the five most successful mobile health interventions and it was selected for an award This was important as the profile helped to secure the support of mobile operators for the service CDC view the mHealth Tanzania PPP as success story as it is rare to see successful transition from centrally held programme to country held PPP and especially one in which there is true partnership with the national ministry of health Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Partnerships The mHealth Tanzania PPP evolved as group with expertise in brokering partnerships which are defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partners fall into range of categories represented in Figure MoHCDGEC Multiple departments within the ministry have convened various initiatives supported by Wazazi Nipendeni throughou its evolution TFNC is currently operating as core partner in the mHealth Tanzania PPP which provides synergy with the expanded nutrition content provided by the mNutrition programme Wazazi Nipendeni as an mHealth service offers good fit with MoH CDGECs eHealth Strategy and supports the Government of Tanzanias commitments under the Open Government Partnership Content providers Over the course of multiple initiatives various organisations mostly NGOs have assisted with the development of content to augment the Wazazi Nipendeni database this includes number of MoHCDGEC departments Mass media organisations These have worked with content partners to generate multimedia outputs this was largely funded by JHCCP under the Tanzania Capacity and Communications Project Telecoms partners Airtel Tigo Vodacom and Zantel These provide zero rated SMS messages at the heart of the system This represents the largest single cost item of the service if valued at market rates for SMS messages The four largest MNOs in the country have partnered with Wazazi Nipendeni messages are funded through their corporate social responsibility CSR departments and the Vodafone Foundation Technology platform The service was origi nally facilitated by the open source Vusion platform provided by TTCM originally non profit However this system had number of shortcomings

Figure Organisations involved in Wazazi Nipendeni Source Authors The original Wazazi Nipendeni text messaging service did not have the capability to deal with voice messages but voice messages were developed as part of the local content development process in Tanzania Under separate agreement GSMA subsequently commissioned HNI now Viamo to incorporate the mNutrition content into its service provided in partnership with Vodacom Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Tanzania In contrast to Wazazi Nipendeni the service is pull type of service whereby users dial short code and navigate through interactive menus to find the information they are seeking The system mostly plays audio clips to users rather than sending SMS text messages interactive voice response IVR scripts were selected to be integrated into the health service and were recorded Developments in Tanzania The revise Wazazi Nipendeni service including the additional nutrition messages incorporated under the mNutrition programme was officially launched by the Minister of Health Community Development Gender Elderly and Children during World Breastfeeding Week in ugust In line with the strategy articulated at the baseline MoHCDGEC continue to assume greater responsibility for functions previously carried out by the mHealth Tanzania PPP especially the technical operations The mHealth Tanzania PPP continu es to work closely with MoHCDGEC staff in the field and estimate that there are roughly health workers currently active in promoting and registering women onto the system The Rasello platform is tool that is paid for and used by MoHCDGEC The mH ealth Tanzania PPP continue to be responsible for the technical management of the platform The ICT Unit in MoHCDGEC have responsibility for wide range of digital tools used in different aspects of health services not only those that use mobiles to disseminate information to clients MoHCDGEC programmes that

diagnosis system HIV The mHealth Tanzania PPPs relationships with MNOs has changed Originally the mHealth Tanzania PPP signed agreements on behalf of MoHCDGEC but now MNOs are changing to sign agreements directly with MoHCDGEC For example Tigo and Halotel have signed new agreements to provid zerorating of messages with the ministry rather than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP Funding from Vodacom is transitioning from the Vodacom Foundation to the commercial Vodacom company which will also be entering into an agreement with the ministry This reflects growing awareness among MNOs of the value of their support for Wazazi Nipendeni which is important to them given the current political climate see Section This shift is consistent with the sustainability plan of the mHealth Tanzania PPP to transfer responsibilities to government agencies Rapid staff turnover within the telecoms industry continues to pose challenge for the work of the mHealth Tanzania PPP For example here was change in leadership at Tigo and responsibility for Wazazi Nipendeni was transferred to completely new team which changed the CSR priorities to education and financial inclusion so that Tigo wanted to discontinue support for Wazazi Nipendeni It is likely that this was linked to changes in the company structure following the acquisition by Tigo of majority stake in Zantel see Section The mHealth Tanzania PPP with the support of nutrition officer from MoHCDGEC had to put lot of effort into convincing the new Tigo team of the value of Wazazi Nipendeni and eventually secured an ag reement to continue their support Similarly after time and effort had been invested in building relationships with the CSR contact at Airtel that tangency then moved on The mHealth Tanzania PPP continue to run public awareness campaigns from time to ti me When it runs particular campaign that is sponsored by particular MNO it has to make sure the promotional materials only have the sponsoring MNO branding Some MNOs put limit on the number of messages that they will donate in year This will cau se increasing difficulties given the current registration growth trend evident in Figure Under the arrangement with Rasello MoHCDGEC departments and MNOs have been given their own dashboards so they can access up todate predefined metrics on registrations However even the dashboard furnished to the mHealth Tanzania PPP only gives access to predefined metrics meaning it does not have direct access to the back end database Any request for nonstandard reports requires specific request to be made to Rasello to construct query there is no additional cost for these requests The PEPFAR country operation plan acknowledges the mportance of the role that the mHealth Tanzania PPP plays in leveraging the support of MNOs The plan pledges to further expand its activities with the mHealth Tanzania PPP and emphasises the leadership role of government agencies Expand mHealth PPP and support implementation and expansion of Fast Track ARV refills FASTA initiatives under NACP and MOH leadership PEPFAR Although the current management contract with Cardno is due to expire in negotiations between the mHealth

three main partners Ministry of Health Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Management Development for Hea lth MDH Tanzanian NGO providing research

the se management programmes It is expected that new management contract will go out to tender possibly for further years as is typical for CDC funded programmes Looking to the future there is growing recognition of the role of nutrition in HIV programming Good nutrition is important for people who are HIV positive and good nutrition is required for ARV therapies to be successful Therefore nutrition is becoming larger part of ov erall HIV support packages In terms of technology GSMA and the mHealth Tanzania PPP were keen to develop the service to include IVR which it was thought would improve reach into poorer communities with lower levels of literacy and would enable users to actively seek information rather than passively receive SMS messages However this proved not to be popular when they trialled it and MNO partners remain reluctant to zero rate IVR calls Nevertheless they would like to try again with the technology An other idea for providing two way communication is to work with partners who can provide call centre facility The mHealth Tanzania PPP is considering ways of exploiting the reach and power of social media which is becoming increasingly popular among you

Pigneur canvas building blocks This section summarises key observations made in the baseline report supplemented with additional findings from the intervening period as well as finding from both the qualitative and quantitative studies An introduction to the canvas and more detailed description of Wazazi Nipendeni as it relates to the framework are provided in Annex Customer segments At registration use rs are allocated to one of four categories pregnant women mothers with newborns supporters of pregnant women or young mothers and general interest The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP covers users registered onto the system during two year period from November to November During this time many women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth and were then re categorised on the system as mothers with newborns Figure shows that these women make up the vast majority of active users Figure Mix of active users as at November Source Authors Phone ownership and access are key to ccessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Having at least one household member that owned phone was part of the screening criteria for the quantitative study so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service and phone ownership In terms of access men were reluctant to let their wives have phones fearing they would be used to facilitate affairs and women themselves recognised that phone ownership can cause problems in the family because of trust issues Among young married women who Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact are the primary customer egment it tends to be husbands who control their access to phones either through consent to ownership by buying handset SIM for their wives or by sharing their own phones with their wives The qualitative study highlighted the importance of enlisting mens support for if not participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni service as means of facilitating womens access to content For example the quantitative study found that womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as they often did not share them with their partners They also found that men often disagreed with some content particularly that on family planning in which case they would withhold access to the messages and would not share information with their partners As national service that is available through multiple networks Wazazi Nipendeni is available all across the country wherever there is network coverage It does not therefore have particular poverty focus However the majority of users were signed up by field partners who tend to focus rogrammes on rural and low income communities Value proposition The aim of the original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign was to encourage women to avail themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health outcomes Content had been developed over number of previous partnerships each of which had slightly different thematic focus including prevention of mother tochild ransmission of HIV Aids antenatal care family planning malaria prevention nutrition for mother and baby danger signs having an individual birth plan and postpartum care The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by contributing substa ntial additional nutrition content Added content cover ed life stages up to five years key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was the procedures put in place to ensure quality of information TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content was accessible and consistent with national nutrition strategies UX research was conducted early on in the project to ensure that messages were appropriate how they might fit with different types of consumers the archetypes and how to improve the customers experience of the service GeoPoll tested small sub sample of messages for comprehension and relevance ThinkPlace conducted user focused research using human centred design principles Frog later conducted further UX research based on in depth inte rviews Evidence from the quantitativ study appears to confirm the quality of messages Value and satisfaction metrics among treatment household members were high Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received Over of users either always or very of ten found the messages useful see Figure Figure shows that information on maternal

endline report ePact Figure Most and least useful mNutrition message topics by gender Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their behaviours as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range nutritional outcomes Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved as follows Dietary diversity for children aged month The number of food categories consumed increased by value The likelihood that children aged months met the minimum dietary diversity Children in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to have consumed from four food groups value Children aged months in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet Diets among women of reproductive age primary females had also improved The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women had increased by perce ntage points value Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices among men There was statistically significant impact on the combined household level measure of nutrition knowledge Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Channels In the Tanzania DHS survey respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni Note that the five year TCCP programme started in and finished in so the DHS survey will have been conducted when the programme had achieved nearly maximum reach Radio was clearly the single channel that achieved greatest reach of people had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni from the radio Table About quarter of respondents had heard about the campaign on the

Authors own based on DHS dataset accessed September During the initial campaign as part of the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP printed materials were distributed to range of health facilities where women come into contact with health professionals eg hospitals health centres dispensaries The mHealth Tanzan iaPPP worked in partnership with the health sector providing training for health professionals who were then able to help women register on the system There are three ways of registering for the Wazazi Nipendeni text messaging service analysis can be found in Section Assisted by health facility worker women can be signed up when they come for antenatal care visits etc Assisted by community health workers community workers can sign women up when they visit them in their homes or other local venue Selfregistration instructions were given in the multimedia campaign People dial the short code and then are guided through small number of profiling qu estions category of user and stage of pregnancy age of child Registration data show that of users were registered by partners It is not possible to determine exactly how many of the other users actually registered by themselves but were re gistered using USSD suggesting that they were in fact registered or at least assisted by health worker This means that up to of users were registered by partners Although mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nip endeni Multiple response respondents may have heard of Wazazi Nipendeni through multiple channels ie adds up to more than Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact campaign it is facetoface contact through partners that is instrumental in signing people up TFNC also believes that people who register with health professional will have positive bias to comply with messaging have better understanding how the service works and be more likely to appreciate how they can benefit from the service Figure confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health matters government more so than NGO facilities It is interesting to note that even among control communities people have high levels of trust in information from automated text messages confirming that text messages are regarded as being reliable and of high quality Patterns of who people actually get information from Figure broadly reflect levels of trust although they emphasise the importance of government health workers Figure Trust in sources of health information Source Authors Percent who agree they would trust information from each source Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Sources of health information Source Authors The qualitative research identified number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with womens lifestyles text messages can be read repeatedly audio messages may be heard incorrectly as messages remain on the phon they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any time and text messages are private they remain on the phone which tends to be regarded as personal device audio messages can be overheard by others It should be noted that the SMS channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa and the country is united by the language of Swahili Customer relationships The aims of the customer elationship that Wazazi Nipendeni creates with users can be considered to be threefold Acquisition Those who were assisted with registration have quite different relationship with the service to those who self registered Registration data confirm the importance of field partners up to of users were signed up by partners see Section Retention Several features of the system minimise pain points that might promp users to leave system The service is free of charge The system only requires users pregnancy or maternal status to be gathered at registration Content is regarded as relevant and of value Retention levels are high registration data indicate tha the number of people opting out of the service is equivalent to roughly of new users in month The adult literacy rate in Tanzania is compared to an average for sub Saharan Africa of data from Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Compliance with improved health practices High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Nearly of those who self reported having ever received the content read all messages received and over self reported implementing at least one tip Wazazi Nipendeni has strong brand which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the service and users tend to view it as MoHCDGEC service as the Government pushed it through the media Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP comes from CDC it can be argued that the most important relationship is that with CDC Providing evidence that the service is delivering improved health outcomes is important Revenue streams and indirect enefits Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge users so there is no direct revenue stream The service has also been made available free of charge to field partner institutions In the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be permitte to charge for these information services In the end the Government insisted that health information should be made available to citizens free of charge which constrained opportunities for developing commercially sustainable business models This is national policy issue The mHealth Tanzania PPP is currently funded by CDC although the successful functioning of the service depends on contributions by various partner organisations The service is therefore vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding fr om CDC Current funding is planned to The service also depends on the zero rating of text messages by partner MNOs There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni has resulted in lower churn The quantitative study found no difference in the length of ime that respondents reported having had their main SIM card there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone number as they had at baseline two year duration and there was no difference in the proportion who subscribed to the same operator as baseline ARPU was higher among users Control households spent an average of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment communities The qualitative study found this was due to women becoming more confident in using their phones The latest DHS data indicate that of people across the country had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni see Table TCRA data for October give the total number of subscribers on the four partner networks as million Therefore Wazazi Nipe ndeni users represent of the entire subscriber base Although MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not use the reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni in their promotional materials they are beginning to recognise the political value attached to their support for Wazazi Nipendeni By signing agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni directly with the Government rather than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution www tcragotzindexphpquarterly telecommunications statistics Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key resources Key resources are efined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition The primary assets employed by the mHealth Tanzania PPP in delivering the text messaging service are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages The current content comprises the pre existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource The text messaging service originally ran on the Vusion platform developed by TTCM in partnership with the Praekelt foundation In October Waza zi Nipendeni migrated to new platform created for MoHCDGEC by loc al software developer Rasello The new platform is able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track the number of users and messages being sent The text messaging service designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign so the field partner programmes and interventions are key resource required to deliver the full potential of the value proposition To date partners have assisted with registering users in the fiel see Section The key resource in convening these partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with TFNC and its linkages to both nation al nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country Early in the mHealth Tanzania PPP appointed new team leader While the previous country manag er came from mobile technology background the new team leader is medical professional This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP as Government agencies take greater ownership of the platform along with associated technical responsibilities Key activities In order to make the business model work perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be undertaken is networking Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP clearly have good personal contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs and to enlist the support of MNOs The Global Content Partnership was mandated to create higher level generic content and little provision was made for creating specific locally relevant messages Under the original vision it was expected that participating organisations would tailor global content to their own needs When this idea was abandoned additional funding was made available for EveryMobile and COUNSENUTH to localise content TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content generat ion process However TFNC adopted much more proactive role and its involvement has continued to deepen throughout the project When the content generation process was changed to facilitate the production of more detailed localised content TFNC got mo re involved TFNCs engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that signing off procedures went smoothly knowledge bank Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Monitoring and evaluation is key activity as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni makes tow ards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with forthcoming health interventions Providing face toface presence when work ing with women is important for achieving positive behaviour change The qualitative study foun that messages acted as reminders to reinforce information provided by health workers and to reinforce mothers existing knowledge Registration scheduling and the dispatch of messages to users is handled by the technical platform This is sub contrac ted to Rasello as the platform provider and management is being gradually transferred from the mHealth Tanzania PPP to MoHCDGEC Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant eg new drugs and products will be introduced and recommende practice will be modified People will quickly lose trust in information that is not immediately useful or even worse wrong One of the partners needs to be given the responsibility and funding for ongoing maintenance of content Key partnerships The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC is defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Wazaz Nipendeni was riginally conceived as prevention of malaria in pregnancy campaign following an analysis by JHCCP of the Tanzania DHS data The mHealth Tanzania PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put together by JHCCP and MOHSW Content Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by MOHSW to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Organization WHO Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action Content on family planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproducti ve Health mRH Content for Prevention of Mother toChild Transmission was designed by EGPAF TFNC was instrumental in securing the support of the SBCC TWG for nutrition in approving content Technology platform The service was originally run on the usion open source platform developed by TTCM The system architecture led to problems with reliability latency and cost The service was migrated to new platform in October It was hosted locally by Rasello and was commissioned and paid for by MoH CDGEC with CDC funding Telecoms operators The mHealth Tanzania PPP had identified MNOs as key partners at the start However MNOs needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched wit hout explicit support from MNOs but after the service achieved users within weeks the MNOs entered into agreements Field partners The programme launched in November with twomonth nationwide media campaign radio and TV follow up campaign ran from July to February during which field partners promoted the service and assisted with registrations In addition to the field partners see Table that have formal agreements with the mHea lth Tanzania PPP launched in May by USAID and Johnson Joh nson with supporting partners the United Nations Foundation the mHealth Alliance and BabyCenter pilot project ed by Family Health International with MOHSW and funded by USAID Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact PPP and have source ode allocated on the system other agencies have simply incorporated registering women onto Wazazi Nipendeni into their field processes Analysis of registration data suggests that field partners may have assisted up to of users to register Governmen agencies The Government of Tanzania is committed to number of relevant health policies on nutrition sexual and reproductive health and maternal mortality and to number of information and ICT policies including open and accountable government and electronic access to health services Costs and investment The baseline report presented set up and ongoing costs covering two year period mainly derived from costs reported by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and GSMA Now that more detail has been provided these costs have been superseded by more comprehensive and rigorous analysis which is presented in Section In ad dition to those costs directly associated with the mHealth Tanzania PPP both operating and capital FCDO and GSMA have invested in wider programmatic costs that stimulated and supported this action It is worth noting that the mHealth Tanzania PPP has history of donations and in kind contributions made over the years by the CDC and programme partners The business odel It is proposed that Wazazi Nipendeni is based on multi sided platform business model which is commonly associated with IT businesses This provides means of making product free to one group of customers while another group pays Wazazi Nipendeni brings together two groups providing link between funders who pay for the service and users who receive the service for free see Figure Funders with health mandate benefit from improved health outcomes achieved by users Field level partners cannot really be considered third side to the platform because they already have their own link to users through their field presence The relationship with Wazazi Nipendeni can be considered as simple business tobusiness transactional arrangement as described Wazazi Nipendeni provides valuable service and partners drive users to the system Figure Key partnerships business model Sources Authors Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact The trengths and weakness of the business model can be summarised as follows Partnerships are key feature of the mHealth Tanzania PPPs way of working and have been instrumental in securing resources that have made the service success The PPP core team have continued to forge new alliances with ield partners as they implement new health interventions Links with the overnment of Tanzania have been strengthened over the duration of the evaluation study as MoHCDGEC has assumed greater responsibility for the technical platform in particular The iability of the model is vulnerable to discontinuity in revenue ie it depends on CDC funding On the one hand five year fixed term agreements provide security but on the other hand the mHealth Tanzania PPP is facing uncertainty now the agreement is shortly to expire Nutrition content may not be continuing priority for CDC which focuses on HIV tuberculosis and malaria in Tanzania Now that it has been shown that the VAS generates substantial incre ases in ARPU it may be possible to argue case for some kind of revenue sharing agreement with MNOs further research is required to explore viable mechanisms for this The reach and brand of the service is attractive to field partners DHS data showed that over half of adults were aware of Wazazi Nipendeni in and the quantitative study found that of people in the control sample had received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni Wazazi Nipendeni offers strong value proposition Not only are qual ity metric for the messages high eg levels of trust frequency of reading messages customer satisfaction ratings but users also report changing their behaviour so the service is valued by users The quantitative study has shown that the service is linked to improved nutritional outcomes notably an increase in dietary diversity among infants demonstrating value to partner health agencies such as TFNC and to donors such as CDC Indirect benefits in terms of increased ARPU provide strong commer cial basis to justify the in kind contribution made by MNOs to the service Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Analysis of users Overview The mHealth Tanzania PPP submitted Wazazi Nipendeni registration data from the Rasello platform to the authors The query was performed on March working dataset cover ing two year period November to November addresses number of data issues Creating an additional category that represents women who registered when pregnant but have since given birth and have continued us ing the service as mother with child Spikes in registrations On November the date when PI registrations were adopted by multiple partners and spike in USSD registrations over three week period in November Anomalies with opt out dates eg over records were marked as having opted out on April The analysis in this section is supported by more de tail given in Annex Growth in user numbers Both ew registrations and opt outs fluctuate monthly In the period May October new registrations were runn ing at an average of around month whereas people were leaving the service at much lower rate of less than month ie of new users Combining new users with people leaving the service gives the cumulative profile of active users presente in Figure Figure Growth in active users Source Authors In the absence of reliable data it is not possible to track patterns of growth in users from the introduction of the service The total number of users may be up to higher than suggested by Figure because many of the riginal users that were migrated onto the new system have not Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact been included in these numbers Nevertheless the patterns of growth and opt outs remain accurate In November he mHealth Tanzania PPP estimated the number of active users to be This is consistent with the active user numbers in Figure as dding to the November estimate of from the chart gives total of which close to the mHealth Tanzania PPP estimate Making an assumption of straight line growth in active user numbers and assuming starting base of active users rounded down the number of active users after two year period December to Nov ember is estimated at This figure was validated by the mHealth Tanzania PPP Understanding users and partners The majority of users were signed up as pregnant women sum of PW and PWMC categories in Figure were general information seekers and were supporters of one type or another The NHIF has brought the largest number of users onto the system Figure Among the partners that registered more than users all apart from UNICEF used either API or USSD exclusively almost None used he short code When the USSD system was introduced SMS remained the channel the general public could use to register Among users registered with no partner registered using an API or USSD Table suggesting that many could well have been registered with the assistance of field partner It is not therefore possible to determine precisely how many users truly self registered ie without any ssistance Up to of all users could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of partner if API and USSD registrations are included Figure Registrations by partner Source Authors Registration data provide some insights into the ways in which different programmes work For example the rate of registrations by NHIF was roughly constant whereas selfregistrations fluctuate widely as people respond to local and national campaigns Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact There is peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Users who were supporting pregnant women lso tended to sign up at the end of the first trimester Users who registered as mothers and supporters of mothers mostly signed up within the first month after giving birth Most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women and left before giving birth The relatively low number of women in the PWMC category leaving suggests that women who used the system throughout their pregnancy liked it and then continued to use it in motherhood The subset of data that represents users who have egistered and then left the service is relatively small TFNC hypothesised that women who were assisted with registration might have stronger commitment to the service stay on the service for longer be more likely to read the messages and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours Table sheds some light on the users leaving the service While of those registered by partners using USSD subsequently dropped out only of API registrations opted out Only the general public continued to register using the short code so only of those with no partner can be classified as self registered with some confidence of these users opted out which provides some evidence to support the TFNC hypothesis Table Registrations and opt outs assisted and self registrations Source for registration API Excel import Short code USSD Total No partner Number registered all of total regist rations Number opted out of total who have opted out of source who have opted out Registered by partner Number

report Batchelor et al it was proposed that the relationships between key stakeholders could be regarded as multi sided platform business model This provides means of making product free to one roup of customers while another group pays When considering financial viability the principal cost components are as follows Operating costs mHealth Tanzania PPP offices staff servers Government agencies staff costs SMS and USSD costs MNOs and field partner agencies staff costs and expenses Fixed costs developing content Global Content Partnership and localising of content mNutrition programme support eg GSMA business intelligence and developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service mHealth Tanzania PPP It is difficult to argue case for the financial viability of the mHealth Tanzania PPP because none of the partners generate revenue directly from providing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Indeed all parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the Government of Tanzania has ruled that all health services should be free to consumers However the quantitative research has found that the ARPU increased among users so it is possible to develop business case for MNOs to provide an mHealth service on the basis of indirect benefits these are discussed in Section If there is commercial case for MNOs to provide an Health service then there is case for third party to provide content on revenue share basis as with conventional VAS Under the current business model MNOs made no investment in developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service but they have donated the MS messages and USSD sessions that the service depends on Without any investment standard financial metrics such as IRR or payback period are not relevant In this case the contribution margin gives an indication of financial performance or the contri bution that the product makes to group profit This analysis goes on to consider the financial viability of two scenarios An independent but commercial content provider The provider invests in localising content assuming nutrition and maternal health ontent is in the public domain and manages both the technical systems and arrangements with national health programmes in the same way as the mHealth Tanzania PPP It provides information services as VAS to MNOs on revenue sharing basis An in hous MNO service The MNO invests in localising content assuming nutrition and maternal health content is in the public domain and sets up an internal product development Per unit revenue indirect benefit variable costs Contribution margin is often expressed as percentage when divided by the per unit revenue Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact group to manage technical systems and to make alliances with national health programme in the same way as the mHealth Tanzania PPP financial model has been created to explore each of these options based on cost data submitted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP Cardno CABI and GSMA The financial odel The model is based on operating cos structure and cost data provided by Cardno supplemented by data gathered through interviews These cost data include quantification of in kind contributions made by MNOs donating SMS and USSD sessions and partner NGOs mainly time Key to the mode is an estimated profile of user numbers which is the basis of calculating revenues from indirect benefits and variable costs The profile of active users in Figure suggests numbers are continuing to rise given roughly constant rates of new subscriptions and relatively low rates of opt outs This is likely to be the case for at least five years at which time early users will start to leave the system as their chi ldren reach five years of age It is estimated that there were over active users on the system at the beginning of the period for which reliable data are available which were used to calculate the trends in Figure described in Section The financial analysis is based on four year period during which the number of active users can be expected to continue to rise as illustrated in Figure Figure Estimated user numbers profile for fouryear period Source Authors Cash flow is

also possible commercial scenarios Therefore it considers investment costs incurre in developing the product for roll out in specific country The following investment costs have been included in the model see Annex global content developme nt localisation of content eg developing appropriate messages seeking necessary approvals and support service provided by the mNutrition programme formative evaluation UX consultants Note that no direct grant payments were made to the mHealth Tanzania PPP under the mNutrition programme Public good odel Under the current arrangement the mHealth Tanzania PPP is funded by public money from international donors and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by the MNOs Given the governments position that the service cannot be charged for and the increasing role of the MoHCDGEC in the delivery of the service it is not likely that any shift towards more commercial business model will take place in the foreseeable futu re The osts of developing the Wazazi Nipendeni service have been covered by CDC as part of its public health programmes The osts of developing the additional nutrition content have been covered by the mNutrition programme The service is funded and egarded as providing public good which it undeniably is However the quantitative study has shown that the MNOs are reaping tangible if indirect financial benefit from the service This section considers the value of this benefit to partner MNOs unde the current arrangement Financial reporting by the mHealth Tanzania PPP quantifies the financial contribution made to Wazazi Nipendeni by each of the supporting MNOs It does this by estimating the number of SMS messages donated by each MNO and then mu ltiplying that by the consumer retail price of SMS messages In the absence of any payment to Wazazi Nipendeni for the content the cost of Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact messages is the only variable cost but it varies between MNOs according to the different SMS retail prices The quantitative research found that ARPU be TZS higher among people who used Wazazi Nipendeni compared with those who did not use the servi ce Given an ARPU of TZS per month month among the control sample this indicates that the VAS stimulates increase in ARPU This is supported by the finding from the qualitative research that women became more comfortable and confiden in using their phone when they received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni implying that they then used their phone more using more airtime Given the user growth profile in Figure the contribution margin flattens out at see Figure The cost of SMS messages is directly proportional to the number of active users However the cost of USSD sessions relates to the number of new users which is assumed to be constant despite monthly fluctuations At high user numbers this cost component becomes much smaller proportion of variable costs dropping from of variable costs in Year quarter to of variable costs in Year quarter This explains why the contribution margin is lower at lower user numbers Note that the variable costs in Figure are based on the aggregated costs across all four MNOs each of which has been allocated different charge rates for SMS messages according to their retail prices at baseline Table shows the sensitivity of contribution margin to SMS price at high user numbers Figure Contribution margin Source Authors Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Table Contribution margin for each operator asymptotic MNO partner SMS price TZSSMS Contribution margin Year Vodacom Airtel Tigo Halotel Source Authors own The price attributed to sending SMS messages is clearly highly influential in determining how attractive their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni appears to operators So hat is the cost to an operator of sending an SMS In study on the impact of consumer consumption of network services voice SMS and data on network profitability Blackburn et al highlight trend towards flatrate pricing as opposed to pay as you go They point out that one feature that makes this attractive to operators is that the cost of delivery is small fraction of the retail price Keshav concluded that the cost of sending an SMS message was likely to be less than SMS or of the per unit price charged to pay as you go customers in the USA Lack of clarity on the true cost of sending SMS message continues to plague development cost modelling For example in study of an mHealth intervention in Tanzania Mangaone et al modelled scenarios using standard SMS charge rates SMS along ith reduced rates SMS and SMS representing negotiated bulk purchasing agreements The analysis up to this point has been based on the retail prices given in Table which can be interpreted as representing an opportunity cost to the MNO However given that MNO are sending out messages to thousands of users it could be argued that bulk SMS price would be more realistic price of TZS SMS for example would give contribution margin of If on the other hand there is no real cost to the MNO of sending SMS messages then the contribution margin tends towards The contribution margin is measure of how much product contrib utes to fixed costs and thereby to profit once fixed costs are covered However it takes no account of any investment made in developing product so it cannot be used as predictive measure of the likely financial viability of developing product IRR is widely used for this purpose The model indicates that over four year period mobile operators donate texts and USSD sessions totalling nominal value of million However over the same time period the indirect benefit of ARPU sums to total of million which represents real financial gain The other indirect benefit often credited to VAS is reduction in churn Tricarico However the quantitative research did not find any evidence that people using the Wazazi Nipendeni service had owned their SIMs for longer Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because consumers are not tied in to contracts the Tanzanian market is predomi nantly prepaid so high churn rates might be expected However in rural or underserved markets where signal coverage is poor consumers often find themselves effectively tied in to single operator by virtue of being able to access only one network in the ir geographical location Therefore churn tends to be lower in rural areas The quantitative study was carried out in Iringa which is largely rural district so it is not surprising to find low rates of churn making it difficult to measure any differe nces in churn From mHealth Tanzania PPP financial report Halotel was not

Commercial content rovider The previous section highlighted the financial benefits to MNOs of offering the Wazazi Nipendeni service This opens up possibilities for the content provider to generate revenue through some kind of revenue share agreement with MNOs which in turn opens up possibilities for spinning off the content provider as commercially viable venture This section considers the financial viability of such venture as hypothetical case based on cost data from the mHealth Tanzania PPP It is intended to represent the opportunity for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs Nutrition content deve loped under the GSMA mNutrition programme is publicly available and open source so the raw content can be accessed and adapted at no cost There is real cost associated with localising content This includes framing the content in messages that are elevant and readily understandable by users as well as translating content into local languages In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni messages are all in written format for disseminating as SMS messages which avoids the considerable expense of making voice recordings that are needed for outbound dialling and other voice based systems Securing government approval of messages is major cost Health services tend to be highly regulated and the experience of Wazazi Nipendeni is that the health ministry was diligent in ensuring that messages be consistent with Government of Tanzania health policies good deal of time was spent negotiating the balance between making messages factually accurate yet at the same time informal and easy to understand An agency ould need to invest in product development as was the case with Wazazi Nipendeni which benefited from UX research and formative evaluation throughout the duration of the mNutrition programme both of which were funded through the GSMA mNutrition programm These costs sum to an investment of see Annex The following assumptions have been applied regarding operating costs the fixed operating costs associated with running the mHealth

need to bulk purchase SMS messages from each client operator price of TZS SMS has been assumed It is assumed that the hypothetical agency would start from scratch with no pre existing users so the model is based on the profile of active users presented in Figure Note that no account has been taken of the in kind contributions made by government agencies and partner NGOs both of whom are critical to the success of service It can be argued that any government has vested interest in setting up service that has material benefit for health outcomes and so should forego any potential claims on the cost of the time they invest in mediating on behalf of the service provider Similarly it can be argued that the cost of the time Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact invested by partner NGOs including marketing and registering users is outweighed by the benefits that the service adds to their field programmes At revenue share with MNOs ie all TZS usermonth in increased ARPU goes to the content provider Figure suggests the service would break even at the beginning of year However the rate of return on investment over four year time horizon would be negative Given the assumed trajectory of rowth in user numbers much greater revenues are generated if the timescales can be extended Therefore at revenue share the service could generate positive IRR of over sixyear period However rate of return is highly sensitive to revenue share at revenue share ie the MNO retains only of the increase in ARPU the IRR turns negative Figure Profits commercial content provider Source Authors Projecting the user growth profile in Figure over further two years would result in total of million active users The population of Tanzania is million National Bureau of Statistics NBS and the average household size is MoHCDGEC so the number of households across the country is around million of the population is under five years of age NBS equating to million children under five If households with children under five had an average of two children both aged under five then the total number of households with at least one child under five would be million of all households This rough calculation su ggests that user target of million Wazazi Nipendeni users may be ambitious but is not impossible As revenue is generated solely from increases in ARPU the financial viability of such VAS is highly sensitive to that increase Up to this point th analysis has been based on the TZS month increase in ARPU found by the quantitative study on baseline level of ARPU of TZS among the control sample This is based on the effect of the random offer of access to the service in the quantitative study ie comparing ARPU between the treatment and control samples The study found that of the treatment sample and of the control sample reported having received nutrition messages by SMS in the last two years The study points out that this method of calculation was likely to underestimate effects but the authors were unable to calculate more specific effects with an reliability because of inconsistencies in the self reported access to the Wazazi Nipendeni messages They concluded that this was because respondents may not have been able to correctly identify the source of nutrition text messages received Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure shows how sensitive the financial viability of service is to this effect size and it shows that if the effect size was then service could be financially attractive over fouryear period Based on the proportions of both samples that reported receiving nutrition message by SMS the effect size could be double in which case the return on

Vodacom and Airtel has publish ed consolidated data covering five East African countries Airtel Africa quoting an ARPU of December TZS The quantitative study was conducted in Iringa rural district so measured ARPU levels would be expected to be below that national average Figure shows that if all other assumpt ions are held constant service would need to reach user base with an ARPU over TZS month

to increase in ARPU This raises the possibility that an MNO could justify creating an mHealth VAS on the basis of this increased revenue This section considers hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO in another country sets up an mHealth service in house The key differences from the commercial content provider scenario considered above is that the MNO would retain all of the additional revenue generated and there would be no real costs associated with the SMS messages sent The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs Nutrition content developed

after themselves and their infant so it falls into the broad category of client facing tools Within this category the Health Data Collaborative give examples of services hat fall into range of sub categories see Annex Targeted client communication Untargeted client communication Client to client communication Personal healt tracking Ondemand information services provided to clients Client financial transactions The classification makes clear distinction between services providing unidirectional information dissemination to clients targeted and untargeted and client initiated services peer group citizen reporting and health information seeking Wazazi Nipendeni is an example of the first of these and is push service The Viamo service offered by Vodacom on the other hand is an example of clien tinitiated service and is pull service as it relies on the user to dial short code to access information In principle service could combine both aspects of communication as each has its advantages and drawbacks It is interesting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile phones This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions as they tend to use platform that manages payments between healthcare providers but the interaction with th client is done by SMS This reliance on SMS tells us two things Firstly SMS is good enough means of communicating with clients ie constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not rendered the services unfeasible Secondly SMS is regarded as the most cost effective medium for communicating with clients This is closely linked to the first point as voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraints but come at much igher cost The classification was drafted in so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet and smartphones in particular of data acquisition and analysis and of mobi le money services some examples are given in Annex Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Discussion Role of gov ernment The case of Wazazi Nipendeni underlines the importance of working in partnership with government agencies The role of oHCDGEC and range of departments within the ministry is evident in variety of ways for example longterm commitment to the concept of using mobile phone to disseminate information to clients starting with the PEPFAR Phones for Health programme in TFNC involvement in designing locally relevant and accessible messages TFNC and its contacts was instrumental in securing approval for the content gove rnment health workers played an active role in promoting the service and assisting women with registering the overnment was influential in brokering partnerships with field NGO health programmes MoHCDGEC commissioned and paid for the new platform makin agreements with MoHCDGEC to support Wazazi Nipendeni has been of value to MNOs in the political economy of the industry the overnment is regarded as trusted provider of

multiple indicators associated with diets among young children Direct revenue TFNC stipulated that the Wazazi Nipendeni service was to be provided free of charge to users Indirect commercial value The Wazazi Nipendeni service increased ARPU by at least likely to be higher Wazazi Nipendeni did not reduce churn churn tends to be low and difficult to reduce in underserved rural areas running costs The theory of change implies that running costs are incurred by the same entity that receives revenue This is not the case with Wazazi Nipendeni where MNOs receive increased revenue but the mHeal th Tanzania PPP incurs costs At an SMS price of TZS revenue would exceed co sts at over users Commercial viability The theory of change implies that service would be viable if revenue exceeds running costs but this takes no account of return on investment Wazazi Nipendeni can trace its roots back through donor funded programmes to scenario for setting up hypothetical in house MNO service indicates it could provide positive IRR over four years but this has not been proven Setting up hypothetical independent content provider like the mHealth Tanza niaPPP would be less attractive providing positive return over six years Crowding in of the mHealth sector Having demonstrated the viability of the PPP and the reach of mobile services the mHealth Tanzania PPP has entered into agreements wit other field partners for Wazazi Nipendeni and has developed additional mobile services It is too early to say whether this has increased demand and funding for mobile services and it is too early to expect the private sector to move into the marke Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key Step fully realised Step partially realised Step not realised Insufficient information Source Authors own The Theory of Change in Figure reflects an emphasis on commercial sustainability that is consistent with the original Business Case which refers to the value of demonstrating sustainable business models in reducing risk for commercial investors The role of donor funded business models in the mHealth sector at the time was well recognised the nitial GSMA scoping study presented three services all of which were classified as having donor funded business models GSMA The original mNutrition documentation emphasised the role of private sector investment in taking mobile services to scale However he experience of Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also possible for donor funded mHealth services to reach scale In fact Wazazi Nipendeni reached substantially more users than any of the other mHealth projects supported through the mNutrition programme GSMA Although negotiations have yet to be concluded evidence to date suggests that the donor funded busine ss model can be effective in attracting further investment albeit from donors rather than the private sector Although not explicit in Figure one of the features the mNutrition programme is the potential for mobile services to achieve positive outcomes Nutrition service impact in Figure among poor and disadvantaged groups It has been pointed out that Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as national service available through multiple networks and does not therefore have particular poverty focus There are however implications for the ext reme poor arising from the different business models considered Two hypothetical models are considered in Section third party content provider and an in house MNO driven model An independent content provider would typically enter into agreements with organisations providing health services on the ground BB model whereas an MNO would offer service directly to their customers BC model Wazazi Nipenden is an interesting hybrid as the service is made available to MNO customers and at the same time the mHealth Tanzania PPP has entered into agreements with agencies implementing health programmes on the ground Cost of sales is key factor in any MNO dri ven model and must be balanced with any increase indirect benefits especially if the service is to be freely available as in Tanzania Literacy clearly presents barrier to accessing SMS based services Voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraints but are prohibitively expensive Third party models have the flexibility to buy bulk SMSs from multiple MNOs The partnership agreements that the mHealth Tanzania PPP has forged with MNOs are key feature of the service meaning that it is accessible to customers on all of the major networks This increases reach among the extreme poor who tend to live in underserved areas where signal coverage is poor and consumers have no choice of operator they can access only one network in their geographical location The agreements they have made with implementing agencies also increases reach among the extreme poor as field partners programmes tend to focus on vulnerable communities in rural areas Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact An mhealth service provider will tend to have focus on the health sector whereas MNOs have focus on upselling to maximise revenue from customer segment The lower spending power of the extreme poor makes it difficult for an MNO to justify investing developing services targeted at this group Emerging ata based services will be instrumental in overcoming literacy barriers eg using audio and video but not in the foreseeable future while data rich services emerging eg integrating financial se rvices will exclude the extreme poor who do not have the digital literacy skills needed MNOs The merged entity of Tigo and Zantel has market share close to that of the market leader Vodacom se Figure This threat to Vodacoms dominant position is likely to result in increased competition As operators look for innovations and opportunities to attract and keep customers they may well prioritise exploring commercial opportunities to capitalise on thei support for Wazazi Nipendeni Not only Wazazi Nipendeni but the operators will also be keeping an eye on competing and alternative mobile health solutions to spot opportunities The mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC will need to liaise closely with supporti ng MNOs to ensure that they continue to be satisfied that Wazazi Nipendeni provides commercial benefits and to engage in ways such that the service can be adapted to meet the changing priorities of MNOs Possible echanisms for revenue generation Despite the best efforts of GSMA to prompt innovative thinking on ways of generating revenue the mHealth Tanzania PPP model remains essentially unchanged save for greater involvement of MoHCDGEC The model may be forced to change if donor funding through CDC is not renewed when the current agreement expires in Stakeholders commonly mentioned the idea to charge field partners Firstly the mHealth Tanzania PPP could charge for providing messages to clients registered by the partner and secondly the mHeal th Tanzania PPP could charge for the time and effort spent developing new bespoke content for the partner on consultancy basis The trouble is that the first of these is symbiotic relationship the mHealth Tanzania PPP provides messages while the ield partner assists women to register in the field so could partners then charge the mHealth Tanzania PPP for each user registered Another possibility being pursued is getting private sector partners to sponsor messages as means of advertising TFNC as pointed out that it has guidelines on the types of goods that it would permit to be associated with Government endorsed health messaging eg food products would not be permitted The mHealth Tanzania PPP has also looked at bringing on insurance partn ers which is an interesting idea given the advent of new mHealth services using smartphone apps that use mobile money functionality This opens up possibilities not only for sponsorship but also for incorporating innovative payment features into the heal th messaging service eg discounts on insurance premiums for Wazazi Nipendeni users Trends in mHealth services Although mobile subscriber numbers continue to grow growth in internet subscribers is much greater The majority of mobile internet connect ions are and Tanzanias broadband coverage lags behind its neighbours martphone ownership stood at around of adults in well Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact below the median for sub Saharan Africa This all suggests that obile data use is set to grow and here is indeed an appetite among mobile operators to increase access to the internet and data use Further investment may be forthcoming now that disputes involving the major MNOs have been resolved The mobile money industry has grown rapidly in Tanzania and of the population had an account in Recent mHealth services are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet and smartphones in particular of data acquisition and analysis and of mobile money services Integrating mobile money mean that services can offer users the ability to pay subscriptions make purchases and access financial services such as credit and insurance For example Tigo partnered with micro insurance compan Milvik Tanzania to offer the BimaMkononi mobile insur ance service Customers can buy hospital insurance accident insurance and life insurance Premiums can be paid using Tigo Pesa or by cash at Tigo customer service centre The service takes advantage of the mobile money platform and provides an incen tive for users to join the mobile money service Financial viability and scenarios The commercial content provider scenario discussed in Section is based on the mHealth Tanzania PPP model but generating revenue through revenue share agreement with MNOs albeit indirect revenue One of the dilemmas facing VAS developers especially hose operating in the public goods space is whether to enter into an agreement with single MNO or to make their offering available across all networks Using multiple networks potentially increases the reach of VAS but it instantly eliminates one of the indirect benefits of VAS reduced churn There is no incentive for consumer to stick with given operator if service they like and want to use can also be accessed on other networks For this reason MNOs are generally only interested in enterin into exclusive agreements This means that the commercial content provider scenario considered in Section may be difficult to broker in practice The alternati ve of an in house MNO based service may therefore be more realistic option The financial modelling also suggests it is easier to make financial case for this model given that all of the increase in revenue would be retained by the MNO and the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal This is also closer to the majority of projects supported by the mNutrit ion programme which were led by MNOs although in most cases the MNO entered into partnership with VAS content provider Viamo was the VAS provide in four projects rather than setting up expertise in house see GSMA One of the potential drawbacks of this private sector led approach is that government may have reservations about lending its branding to corporate product The scenarios proposed above have been prompted by the increase in ARPU demonstrated by the quantitative study Reduced churn is further indirect benefit commonly associated with VAS when provided by an MNO yet the quantitative study found no evidence of reduced chur among Wazazi Nipendeni users Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because consumers are not tied in to contracts and the Tanzanian market is predominantly prepaid However in rural or underserved markets where signal coverage is poor cons umers often find themselves effectively tied in to single operator by virtue of being able to access only one network in their geographical location Therefore churn tends to be lower in rural areas mkononi insurance Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Looking back Looking back on the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP and the Wazazi Nipendeni service it is interesting to see how the strategy articulated at the baseline has largely come about with more partners entering into agreements with the mHealth Tanzania PPP to provide mobile based services and with the Government getting more involved and assuming more responsibility for the platform As part of this evolution the primary role of the mHealth Tanzania PPP appears to have shifted from technical to health The PPP was originally set up to dev elop the software and systems needed to deliver service but an understanding of public health now seems to be more important in dealing with MoHCDGEC and negotiating partnerships with health partners It is also interesting to note that the current mode closely resembles the original concept for the one stop shop articulated by GSMA at the beginning of the mNutrition programme The mHealth Tanzania PPP is the go to institution in Tanzania that can help programmes entering the country to set up mobil services more conveniently at lower cost and avoiding duplication rather than setting up independent services themselves The difference is that although the mHealth Tanzania PPP moderates complex partnership of public and private institutions it itself is effectively public body It is funded by public money through CDC and it has no desire to become for profit organisation The original GSMA vision was for private body to act as the aggregator or at least as form of cooperative that wou ld generate revenue to cover costs Looking to the future The mHealth Tanzania PPP and Wazazi Nipendeni are now approaching rucial point in time Firstly the agreement providing funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP is due to expire shortly and it is not yet clear whether CDC will continue to fund the PPP beyond this date Secondly advances in technology are leading to next generation of mHealth services that are smartphone based and delivered over the internet Increasing broadband coverage and fal ling smartphone prices mean that these services will be accessible to more of the population in the next few years Many new services incorporate financial services which can enable subscriptions purchases eg of pharmaceuticals and insurance These emerging services are attractive to MNOs as MNO led mobile money services are source of increasing revenue These services tend to be accessible only to people with higher levels of digital literacy so they carry risk of opening up further digital divide between better educated users and poorer users Thirdly recent changes in the structure of the telecommunications market may lead to increased competition and investment Disputes over the ownership of both Tigo and Airtel have been resolved These disputes prevented these companies from complying with the regulators requirement to float shares on the local stock market so they will also have impeded any plans for investment in the network or services Tigos takeover of Zantel has increased its market share so that it is closer to the leader Vodacom and this may result in increased competition between two close contenders for market leader Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Conclusions The product The Wazazi Nipendeni service offers trong value proposition to users In te rms of the value attributed to the service by users over of households read all the mNutrition content they received and over of users either always or very often found the messages useful Users also expressed high levels of satisfaction with th service as over of users would recommend the service likely or highly likely to recommend it to others There is evidence that users translated information from the messages int action Over self reported implementing at least one tip most commonly on complementary feeding Evidence of behaviour change was confirmed by the quantitative study which found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range of nutritional outcome most notably multiple indicators associated with iets among young children The success of the early nationwide awareness campaigns was still evident in the high levels of awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni found by the DHS surveys conducted in early Most respondents to the DHS su rvey had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni through the radio The quantitative study found that of respondents from the control sample had received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni Awareness levels among the public as whole would be much higher sugg esting that awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni remains high Initial users were encouraged through media campaigns to self register but more recently users have been assisted with registration by partners and health workers The relatively limited data on opt outs from the service indicate that users who self registered were much more likely to opt out compared with of users registered by partner using the API This confirms the value of face toface contact in the registration process and appea rs to confirm the hypothesis that adherence is likely to be higher among users who have been assisted with registration SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women Notwithstanding limitations associated with literacy and local languages the service was highly valued by users and messages were commonly read Having said that it is noted that SMS may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa an the country is united by the language of Swahili It is important to target men with awareness raising so that they are more likely to permit partners to access phones However it is less important to enrol men on the system as womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as men often did not share the phone with their partners Men would also not share information with their partners if they disagreed with the content eg information on family planni ng Men were registered on the system as supporters among others and made up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users less than Telecoms markets across Africa are shifting from voice to data as broadband coverage increases and data accou nts for greater share of operator revenues Smartphones are becoming more common as handset prices continue to fall and social media such as Facebook WhatsApp and Twitter are becoming popular among the young Although SMS currently remains the most appropriate channel for reaching the majority of the population at present users tastes are changing and the mHealth Tanzania PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for reaching the next generation of users Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Partnerships The Wazazi Nipendeni service and the mHealth Tanzania PPP can trace its roots back to one of the earliest ICT for development pilot projects Voxiva This illustrates the importance of long history of investment partnerships and political commitment in nurturing facil ity to the point where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service and other services at national scale This does not necessarily mean that start up could not achieve something similar but brokering the complexity and diversity of the partnerships involved is not trivial achievement The ability to broker complex set of partnerships has been crucial in the success of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been forged with diverse range of stakeholder groups including Government ministries multiple programme funders eg CDC JHCCP content providers eg GAIN field partners technology providers and partner MNOs These partnerships have been successful due at least partly to the personal skills of he mHealth Tanzania PPP team Business model MNOs have an opportunity to capitalise on the positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni by using it in promotional materials To date it appears that operators promotion of Wazazi Nipendeni has been weak Airtel re leased press statement following the publication of the GS MA case study that acknowledged the contribution of MNOs Tigo mention Wazazi Nipendeni as part of its CSR activities under the Tanzania page of its website and Vodacom Tanzania Foundation has web page that describes Wazazi Nipendeni There are additional possibilities for further engagement with Wazazi Nipendeni such as training freelancers on registering users and increasing or abolishing any caps on the number of messages sent Further eng agement can be justified based on the increases in ARPU found in the quantitative study The quantitative study has shown that the Wazazi Nipendeni service yields substantial indirect benefits to mobile operators in terms of increased ARPU The effect size in the quantitative study area was at least increase in ARPU TZS month and is likely to be higher still nationally This is as resu lt of women becoming more confident in their use of phones They make and receive more calls and SMS messages This represents real financial benefit to MNOs as result of their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni As the real cost to an operator of sendin SMS messages is low tending to zero there is no cost of sale associated with this increase in revenue The study found no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni users held on to their SIM cards for longer reduced churn This may be at least in part due to he rural nature of the Iringa district given that churn tends to be lower in rural areas making it difficult to achieve any differences in churn Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni generates real revenue for operators opens up possibilities for alternat ive commercial business models Analysis has focused on two hypothetical cases representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency delivering service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni in another country An in house mHealth service developed by an MNO appears to be the most attractive proposition for two key reasons Firstly all of the increase in revenue is retained by the MNO and secondly the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal Based on an initial investment of to cover the cost of product development UX research monitoring and evaluation content localisation scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU and the effect size increase in ARPU indicates that service could provide an IRR approximately over fouryear period Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Less attractive although possibly still viable is an independent content provider model similar to GSMAs original vision In this case the same investment costs have been assumed but the provider would nee to pay bulk SMS price for all messages sent TZS SMS and it would need to enter into some kind of revenue share agreement with each participating operator scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs ARPU the effect size increase in ARPU and revenue share indicates that service could only provide positive IRR over sixyear period The business model continues to be multi sided platform business model that provides value to funders with health mandate MoHCDGEC and CDC who pay for the service thereby enabling users to access it free of charge One of the principal funders was MoHCDGEC but as it assume responsibility for more of the activities conducted by the mHealth Tanzania PPP inc luding the Wazazi Nipendeni service the business model will tend towards hybrid of government to citizen model and the multi sided platform as the field partners will still support both Wazazi Nipendeni and users and the MNOs will still provide in kind funding for messages Although the original vision for mNutrition articulated the role of private sector investment in taking mobile services to scale Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also possible for donor funded business model to reach scale and to attract further investment albeit from donors rather than the private sector Telecoms industry Rapid staff turnover within the MNOs continues to pose challenge for the work of the mHealth Tanzania PPP When support was given as part of CSR activit ies it depended on personal relationships so effort was constantly required to establish relationships with new staff As support for Wazazi Nipendeni becomes integrated as part of commercial operations which is increasingly the case given developments in the political economy of the telecoms industry the importance of personal relationships may diminish Telecommunications companies have come under increasing pressure from the Government as it continues to exert pressure as part of its anti corruption campaign Companies have been required to make shares available to the Tanzanian public and several mobile companies have been charged with range of charges including Vodacom which was convicted of tax evasion Support for Wazazi Nipendeni has politi cal capital in this context and operators have now signed agreements directly with MoHCDGEC rather than indirectly with the mHealth Tanzania PPP The principal vulnerabilities of the current business model are funding from CDC and the free SMS messages provided by MNOs Through not yet secure policy documents propose further funding for the services provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP eg the PEPFAR country operation plan says it will expand the mHealth Tanzania PPP acknowledging its ability to leverage support from the MNOs scaling up the Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system is part of the Digital Health Investment road map The mHealth Tanzania PPP continues to enter into agreem ents with new public health programmes eg PATH Both the mHealth Tanzania PPP and GSMA have petitioned partner MNOs to analyse user records to demonstrate indirect benefits increased ARPU and reduced churn but unsuccessfully to date The quantitativ study provides robust evidence of substantial increase in ARPU but no reduction in churn It is hoped that this will be of value to the mHealth Tanzania PPP as it negotiate continued and increased support from MNOs in the future Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact References Airtel Africa Quarterly report on the results for the fourth quarter and year ended March

External evaluation of mobile phone technology based nutrition and agriculture advisory services in Africa and South Asia Introduction DFID Research and Evidence Division wishes to commission an external impact evaluation of mNutrition mobile phone technology based nutrition and agricultural advisory service for Africa and South Asia mNutrition is programme supported by DFID that through business and science partnerships aims to build sustainable business models for the delivery of mobile phone technology based advisory services that are effectiv in improving nutrition and agricultural outcomes mNutrition is primarily designed to use mobile phone based technologies to increase the access of rural communities to nutrition and agriculture related information The initiative aims to improve knowledge among rural farming communities especially women and support beneficial behaviour change as well as increas ing demand for nutrition and agriculture extension services The mNutrition initiative launched in September will work in countries in Africa Cote dIvoire Ghana Malawi Mozambique Nigeria Tanzania Kenya Rwanda Uganda Zambia and four coun tries in South Asia Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka The desired impact of mNutrition will be improved nutrition food security and livelihoods of the poor Mobile phone based services have been endorsed by WHO as an effective strategy for beha viour change and for driving adherence to anti retroviral treatment protocols Horvath Azman Kennedy and Rutherford There is currently scant evidence on the impact and cost effectiveness of mobile phone technology based services for nutrition and agriculture and on the sustainability of different business models for their provision rigorous evaluation of mobile phone technology based nutrition services would add significantly to the current evidence base An external evaluation team managed by the Evaluator independent of the programme delivery mechanism will conduct an assessment of the impact cost effectiveness and sustainability of mobile phone technology based information and behaviour change messages for nutrition and agriculture Backgro und to mNutrition Introduction Undernutrition is major challenge to human and economic development globally It is estimated that almost one billion people face hunger and are unable to get enough food to meet their dietary needs Agriculture is major source of livelihood in many poor countries and the sector has potentially critical role in enhancing health specifically maternal and child health and nutritional status well developed agriculture sector will deliver increased and diversified farm outputs crops livestock non food products and this may enhance food and nutrition security directly through increased access to and consumption of diverse food or indirectly through greater profits to farmers and national wealth Better nutrition and health of farmers fosters their agricultural and economic productivity Current agricultural and health systems and policies are not meeting current and projected future global food nutrition and health needs Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Despite major investmen in agricultural and nutrition research and its uptake and application there is significant social and geographic inequality in who benefits from these investments Furthermore in many developing countries public extension systems for agriculture heal th and nutrition are inefficient have limited capacity and have poor track record of delivery especially in terms of supporting women and girls and the most marginalised populations Alston Wyatt Pardey Marra and Chan Kang Anderson IFPRI Van den Berg and Jiggins Several research and mobile network operators MNOs are testing range of information and communication technology ICT solutions for improving access to wide range of information and advisory services Mobile ph one based technologies are among the most promising ICT strategies although current initiatives in nutrition are relatively small and fragmented What is mNutrition Enhancing access to the results of nutrition and agricultural research and development is potentially critical for improving the nutrition health and livelihoods of smallholders and rural communities mNutrition will harness the power of mobile phone based technologies and the private sector to improve access to information on nutrition heal th and agricultural practices especially for women and farmers both male and female Specifically mNutrition will initiate new partnerships with business and science to deliver range of services including An open access database of nutrition and agri culture messages for use in mobile phone based communication for example information and behaviour change messages on practices and interventions that are known to have direct impact on nutrition or an indirect impact via for example agriculture suite of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture information extension and registration services designed to improve knowledge and generate beneficial behaviour change in nutrition and agriculture increase demand for nutrition health and agriculture goods and services register and identify target populations for support and using real time monitoring support the conduct of nutrition risk assessments by community health workers The impacts of mNutrition are expected to include improved nutrition food security and livelihoods of the poor especially women in countries in Africa Cote dIvoire Ghana Kenya Malawi Mozambique Nigeria Rwanda Tanzania Uganda and Zambia and countries in South Asia Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka This impact will result from the increased scale and sustainability of mobile phone based nutrition and agricultural based information services delivered through robust public private partnerships in each country mNutrition has two major outcomes One outcome will be cost effective sustainable business models for mobile phone enabled nutrition and agriculture services to million households in countries in Africa and countries in South Asia that can be replicated in other countries Linked to this outcome the second outcome will expect these services to result in new knowledge behaviour change and adoption of new practices in the area of agriculture and nutrition practices among the users of these mobile phone based services These outcomes wi ll be achieved through four outputs Improved access to relevant mobile based health nutrition and agricultural advisory services for million poor people and community health workers across SSA and Asian countries Launch and scaling of mobile pho ne based health nutrition and agricultural advisory services targeted to poor people and community health workers Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Generation and dissemination of high quality research and evidence on the impact cost effectiveness and sustainability of mobile phone base advisory services in nutrition and agriculture in South Asia and SSA and Development of locally relevant content for mobile phone technology based agriculture and nutrition services meeting demands from users and community health workers In terms of promoting behaviour change andor adoption of new practices mNutrition will seek to achieve changes in one or more of the following areas Adoption new agricultural practices that are nutrition sensitive improve agricultural productivity and utilise post harvest technologies Changes in nutrition practices in either one or several knowledge domains including improved maternal nutrition practices dur ing pregnancies infant and young child feeding practice and micro nutrient supplementation to children at risk ie Vitamin Zinc and Oral Rehydration Solution ORS mNutrition has started implementation from September For the countries sele cted for the impact evaluation Tanzania and Ghana mobile network operators and content providers have been identified through competitive process during the first half of The MNOs and content providers started developing and launching their serv ices during the th quarter of and early The mobile phone based advisory services are expected to run at least till rd quarter of mNutrition Project Coordination DFID support to mNutrition will be channelled to GSMA as well as directly to this associated independent external impact evaluation GSMA is global body that represents the interests of over mobile operators GSMA already works with the major mobile operators across Africa including Airtel MTN SafariComVodaCom with collective mobile footprint of more than of total African connections GSMA has number of existing development initiatives including mHealth and mFarmer that are part of GSMAs Mobile for Development which brings together mobile operator members the wider mobile industry and the development community to drive commercial mobile services for underserved people in emerging markets GSMA will provide technical assistance to mobile phone operators and support new partnerships with content providers develop and scale up new nutrition and agriculture message services GSMA will ensure sharing of best practices and promote wider replication and uptake of effective business models Objective and Main Questions The objective of this work is to conduct an external evaluation of the impacts and cost effectiveness of the nutrition and agriculture advisory services provided by mNutrition compared to alternative advisory services available in the two selected countries Ghana and Tanzania with particular ttention paid to gender and poverty issues The impact assessment is required to answer the following questions that relate to impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability What are the impacts and cost effectiveness of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture services on nutrition health and livelihood outcomes especially among women children and the extreme poor How effective are mobile phone based services in reaching increasing the knowledge and changing the behaviour of the specific arget groups Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Has the process of adapting globally agreed messages to local contexts led to content which is relevant to the needs of children women and poor farmers in their specific context What factors make mobile phone based services effective in promoting and achieving behaviour change if observed leading to improved nutrition and livelihood outcomes How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level What lessons can be learned abo ut best practices in the design and implementation of mobile phone based nutrition services to ensure behaviour change and continued private sector engagement in different countries Further evaluation questions related to other aims of mNutrition wi ll be addressed in at least country either Ghana andor Tanzania Are mobile phone based services cost effective way to register and identify at risk populations to target with nutrition support Are mobile phone based services cost effective way or community health workers to improve the quality and timeliness of data surveillance core set of nutrition related indicators The content for the mobile phone based advisory services will be based on international best practices and widely endorsed protocols ie by the World Health Organisation and evidence based nutrition sensitive agricultural practices identified by international experts Through an iterative multi stakeholder process international and country experts will localise and adapt he content to make it relevant to the specific target audience in the countries The adapted content and nature of messages is expected to vary across specific target audiences within and across countries The main purpose of assessing the relevance of the content is not to evaluate the overall health and nutrition content but on how this content has been localised and adapted and to what extent the needs of the specific target groups within their particular context have been met In assessing the comme rcial viability it is recognised that evaluating the sustainabilitylong term financial viability of the mobile phone based advisory services will be difficult as mobile network operators may not be willing to provide this potentially commercially sensiti ve information Therefore GSMA will provide support through its access to aggregated confidential financial results of the mobile network operators providing the service GSMA will provide financial summary report on the commercial viability of the busi ness models without compromising the commercial sensitivity of the data for the mobile network operators The evaluator will assess and validate commercial sustainability through an analysis of the aggregated information provided by GSMA and additional qua litative business analysis approaches The Evaluator has the option of proposing refinements of the existing evaluation questions during the inception phase as part of developing the research protocol These suggestions will be considered by the Steering ommittee and an independent peer review during the review of the research protocol as part of the inception phase Output The output of this work will be new and robust evidence on the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of mobile phone based advisory services focusing on nutrition and agriculture delivered by public and private partners and including the development of robust methodological approaches to impact assessment of phone based advisory services Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Recipient The primary ecipient of this work will be DFID with the beneficiaries being GSMA governments international agencies foundations MNOs and other private companies and civil society involved in policies and programmes in nutrition and agriculture that are aimed at mproving nutritional health and agricultural outcomes The findings of this impact evaluation are intended as global public goods Scope and timeline The scope of this work is to Develop research protocol for the external evaluation of mNutrition Design and undertake an external evaluation of mNutrition in two countries Ghana and Tanzania Contribute to the communication of the learning agenda evaluation strategy and evaluation results The evaluation will be in two of the mNutrition target coun tries Ghana and Tanzania These countries have been selected based on the phased start up of mNutrition programme activities The focus and approach in the two respective countries will be different allowing for comparison of the effectiveness of approa ches applied In Tanzania mNutrition will focus on mobile phone technology based nutrition and health services and registration and identification of target population In Ghana the mobile phone technology will focus on nutrition and agriculture sensitiv services In terms of coverage in number of people being targeted for these services in total million people will be reached through mNutrition including million for nutrition sensitive agriculture advisory messages in Asian and at least Afric an countries and about million beneficiaries for mobile phone based nutrition services in countries in SSA The evaluation contract period will be September to st December The development of the research protocol must be completed by mon th for review and approval by DFID Full details on tasks and deliverables are provided in sections below Statement on the design of the mNutrition evaluation The evaluation design is expected to measure the impact cost effectiveness and commercial viability of mNutrition using mixed methods evaluation design and drawing on evidence from two case study countries and the ME system of the programme Overall the proposed design should ensure that the evidence from the two case study countries has high internal validity and addresses the priority evidence gaps identified in the Business Case Being able to judge the generalisabilityreplicability of lessons learned from the programme is of equal importance and so credible approach to generalization an external validity will be an important component of the overall evaluation design The final evaluation design and methodology to generate robust evidence will be discussed in detail with DFID and GSMA before implementation For assessing cost effectiven ess the Evaluator will further fine tune their proposed evaluation approach and outline their expectations in terms of data they will require from implementers theory based evaluation design using mixed methods for evaluating the impact has been propo sed During the inception phase the Evaluator will put forward robust evaluation design for the quantitative work either an experimental or quasi experimental method with clear outline Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact of the strengths and limitations of the proposed method relati ve to alternatives During the inception phase the Evaluator is also expected to identify clearly what will be the implications of the design for implementers in terms of how the overall programme would be designed and implemented and for evidence to be ollected in the programmes monitoring system The Evaluator will also assess the degree to which it is realistic to assess impacts by early for programme where implementation started mid and if there are challenges how these would be managed The Evaluator in its monthly reports will be required to provide information to feed into the DFID Annual Review and Project Completion Report of mNutrition Gender and inclusiveness The impact evaluation will pay particular attention to gender and other forms of social differentiation and poverty issues From current experiences it is clear that access to and use of mobile services is differentiated along range of factors includin gender poverty geographic marginalisation education and illiteracy levels Therefore the impact evaluation will look at and analyse differentiated access to and potential utilisation of mobile phone based services for improved nutrition and agricultu ral production Based on the findings it will identify opportunities and

around the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas building blocks summarising the key observations made in the baseline report and then supplementing the narrative with additional findings from the intervening period as well as finding from both the qualitative and quantitative studies The Osterwalder and Pigneur framework The OP framework is commonly used as framework or canvas for describing business model Businesses rarely have simple model of selling product and gaini ng revenue from that product simple income vs expenditure model rarely describes the business Instead product might enhance the brand of company or enhance the overall experience of the consumer causing them to buy other associated goods or se rvices This idea was at the very heart of the submission of GSMA to FCDO The logical framework of the GSMA grant application described in the next section discusses indirect benefits or imputed benefits In order to map the various components of th business model and to capture these indirect or imputed effects beneficial or otherwise we use the OP canvas The nine elements or building blocks of the canvas form the basis of our analysis below see Figure Note that we propose amending the framework slightly by splitting the Revenue building block into two components considering cash generated and imputed benefits separately and splitting Costs into wo considering operating costs and previous investments separately This has been proposed because of the importance of indirect costs to VAS business models and because some of the key resources brought to partnerships have benefited from prior investme nts Table presents generic overview of the framework ie the descriptions and example questions illustrate how the framework is applied to busi ness models in general so not all are directly relevant or applicable to the Wazazi Nipendeni service Figure Building blocks in the canvas derived from Osterwalder and Pigneur Source Authors Customer RelationshipsValue PropositionKey Activities KeyPartners InvestmentChannels Imputed BenefitsCustomers KeyResources Costs Product Revenue Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Table Description of Building blocks in the canvas Canvas building block Description Example Questions Customers Customer Segments The business model should define different groups of people or organisations to reach and serve Distinct segments will have common needs behaviours or other attributes The business model should be designed around strong understanding of customer need For who are we creating value Who are our most important customers Channels How company communicates with customer segments Channels are customer touch points that shape the customer experience eg communication distribution sales How are we reaching customer segments How do they want to be reached Which ones work best and are most cost efficient Customer Relationships The types of relationships company establishes with specific custo mer segments Relationships may be driven by various motivations eg customer acquisition customer retention boosting sales What type of relationship does each of our Customer Segments expect us to establish with them How costly are they How are the integrated with the rest of our business model Offering Value Propositions The bundle of products and services that create value for specific Customer Segment by satisfying need helping solve problem Value propositions may be innovative di sruptive or similar to others but with added features What value do we deliver to the customer Which of our customers problems are we helping to solve Which needs are we satisfying Business Operations Key resources Those assets required to make the business model work Resources that allow and enterprise to create and offer the value proposition to reach markets to maintain relationships and to generate revenues They can be physical financial intellectual or human What key resources do value propositions require Key activities Things company must do to make it business model work Activities required to create and offer the value proposition to reach markets to maintain relationships and to generate revenues What activities do value propositions require Key partnerships The network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work Companies forge partnerships for many reasons eg reduce risk acquire resources Who are our key partners Who are our key suppliers Which key resources are we acquiring from partners Which key activities do partners perform Finances Revenue strea ms The cash generated from each Customer Segment Revenue streams will depend on what customers are willing to pay Revenue streams can be either one off payments or recurring revenues Each revenue stream may have different pricing mechanisms For what value are customers willing to pay How are they currently paying How would they prefer to pay How much does each revenue stream contribute to overall revenues Cost structure Costs incurred to operate the business model Creating and delivering value maintaining customer relationships and generating revenue all incur costs What are the most important costs inherent in our business model Authors table generated from Osterwalder and Pigneur Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Canvas building block Description Example Questions Which key resources are most expensive Which key activities ar most expensive Investment Number of investors type of investors and commitments made to investors These will influence acceptable profit margins and may affect cash flow Who has invested in the company What kind of returns are expected And ove what timescales Indirect benefits Ways in which the service can benefit the company other than by direct revenue generation How does service increase acquisition and loyalty Does service boost other sales How does service improve brand image Customer segments At registration use rs are allocated to one of four categories pregnant women mothers with newborns supporters of pregnant women or young mothers and general interest The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP overs users registered onto the system during two year period from November to November During this time many women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth and were then re categorised on the system as mothers with ewborns Figure shows that these women make up the vast majority of active users Figure Mix of active users as at November Source Authors Phone ownership and access are key to accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service Having at least one household member that owned phone was part of the screening criteria for the quantitative study so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service and phone ownership The qualitative study found that many women did not own mobile phone but across Tanzania as Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact whole of women own phone compared with of men giving only an gender gap Rowntree although this GSMA report shows that the gap is higher in rural communities In terms of access men were reluctant to let their wives have phones fearing they would be used to facilitate affairs and women themselves recognised that phone ownership can cause problems in the family because of trust issues Among young married women who are the primary customer segment it tends to be husbands who control their access to phones either through consent to ownership by buying handset SIM for their wives or by sharing their own phones with their wives Given this understanding of household gender dynamics men are recognised as key customer segment and were targeted in the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign materials which focus on the role of couples in bringing up children However Figure indicates that supporters the category that includes husbands among others such as mothers inlaw make up only small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users The quantitative research specifically addresses these gender issues and was designed to explore the impact of actively engaging men in health messaging on health outcomes It included econd stage of randomisation in which households where both pregnant women and their partner own distinct mobile phones were split into two groups in one group only the woman received the messages and in the other group both men and women received messa ges The study found that estimates for the households that received the content on both mobile phones the FM group are in general not distinguishable from zero and occasionally suggest that these households perform worse than those assigned to jus receive the content on the primary females mobile phone the group Gilligan et al forthcoming This is particularly interesting finding as it appears counterintuitive Notwithstanding the characteristics of the sub sample used for thi experiment households in which both the mother and father owned mobile phone tended to be better off it suggests that women were not substantially constrained by their partners in their ability to take action based on messages Note that this findin does not contradict findings from the qualitative study on the importance of enlisting mens support for if not participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni service as means of facilitating womens access to content For example the quantitative study foun that womens access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages as they often did not share them with their partners They also found that men often disagreed with some content particularly that on family planning in which case they would withhold access to the messages and would not share information with their partners As national service that is available through multiple networks Wazazi Nipendeni is available all across the country wherever there is networ coverage It does not therefore have particular poverty focus it is not specifically targeted at poor or rural families GSMA found that the service was reaching people with less education primarily due to assisted registrations Registrations wer assisted by field partners who were running programmes that tended to focus on more rural areas These users therefore tended to have lower income and education levels Interestingly the quantitative study found some evidence that the effect on child diets was larger among better off households in the study sample There are many characteristics of better off households that could account for this they are more likely to have access to other sources of nutrition information such as government health workers health facilities or more knowledgeable peers individuals in wealthier households may have higher rates of literacy and education making them better able to understand messages Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact they have more cash to implement recommendations in messages eg purchasing animal sourced foods The fact that the service is text based in Swahili will mean that it is likely to be of limited value to illiterate sections of the population The qualitative study found examples of literate men sharing messages with their illiterate partners Having at least one household member who was literate in Swahili was one of the screening criteria for the quantitative surve so it was not able to explore linkages with literacy Value proposition The original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign directed women to health services and to the text messaging service provided by the mHealth Tanzania PPP The aim of the SMS cont ent was to encourage women to avail themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health outcomes This content covered range of pregnancy and motherhood topics and included number of nutrition related messages The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by contributing substantial additional nutrition content first set of messages were added that coincided with the scope of the Wazazi Nipendeni existing messages covering pregnancy and up to weeks post partum and further messages were added later covering life stages up to five years The mHealth Tanzania PPP brought to the GSMA mNutrition partnerships pre existing database of messages targeting pregnant women and new mothers which had been dev eloped over number of previous partnerships each of which had slightly different thematic focus Messages cover ed several pregnancy and motherhood related topics not just nutrition The list of topics includes prevention of mother tochild transmiss ion of HIV Aids antenatal care family planning malaria prevention nutrition for mother and baby danger signs having an individual birth plan and postpartum care key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was its mphasis on quality of information The global content partnership was responsible for identifying relevant content and specifying content validation and quality control processes After the original one stop shop concept was abandoned EveryMobile UK based and COUNSENUTH Tanzanian NGO working in nutrition worked together to localise the content to make it relevant and accessible to Tanzanian users TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content was accessible and consistent with national nutr ition strategies TFNC shared its responsibilities with other members of the National Nutrition Social and Behaviour Change Communication Technical Working group SBCC TWG UX research was conducted early on in the project to ensure that messages were ap propriate GeoPoll tested small sub sample of messages for comprehension and relevance It sent SMS CABI GAIN Oxfam the International Livestock Research Institute and the British Medical Journal Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact messages to two groups of women followed by series of evaluation questions also sent by SMS ThinkPlace conducted user focused research using human centred design principles The research was based on semi structured individual interviews and user profiling They then generated set of four personas intended to assist with the design of the messages Frog later conducted further UX research based on in depth inte rviews with participants which added an additional three personas These research activities funded through the mNutrition programme helped with two aspects of product development the Geo Poll and Think Place activities looked at the messages and how they might fit with different types of consumers the archetypes while the Frog research considered how to improve the customers experience of the service Evidence from the quantitative study appears to confirm the quality of mess ages Household members in treatment households were overwhelmingly likely to read the mNutrition content they received on their phone Between and of households read all the mNutrition content they received Not reading any of the received mNu trition messages was extremely uncommon only between and of households This indicates that the messages are highly valued and this is confirmed by the finding that over of users either always or very often found the messages useful see Figure Figure shows that information on maternal nutrition was regarded as most useful but not by large margin The quantitative study also found that over of users of females and of males would recommend the service likely or highly likely Conversely only of users would not recommend the service Th ese data suggest high level of satisfaction with the content in the mNutrition service Figure How often was the mNutrition content deemed to be useful Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Figure Most and least useful mNutrition message topics by gender Source Gilligan et al forthcoming Perhaps more importantly most users reported having taken action based on the messages received of females and of males self reported implementing at least one tip The types of information that users were able to implement are presented in Figure Interestingly maternal nutrition which was regarded as th most useful area of information was least likely to have been acted on There may be additional barriers to adopting these behaviours that information alone is not able to overcome Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their behaviours as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved range of nutritional outcomes Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved as follows Dietary diversity for children aged mont hs The number of food categories consumed increased by value The likelihood that children aged months met the minimum dietary diversity Children in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to have consumed from four food groups value Children aged months in the treatment communities were percentage points more likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet Note that households were included in the baseline sample if they had pregnant woman or child under the age of months so by the time of the endline survey children would have been aged between to months so this is the age group for which it might be expected to find the strongest effects Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Diets among women of reproductive age primary females had also improved The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women had increased by percentage points value Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices among men There was statistically significant impact on the combined household level measure of nutrition knowledge Figure Which tips from mNutrition content have respondents put in practice by gend er Source Gilligan et al forthcoming The text messages provide women with information that is consistent with advice given by health workers in the field Where women are in contact with heal th workers the text messaging service then has the additional benefit of reinforcing the advice that women receive

Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP printed materials were distributed to range of health facilities where women come into contact with health professionals eg hospitals health centres dispe nsaries The mHealth Tanzania PPP worked in partnership with the health sector providing training for health professionals who were then able to help women register on the system There are three ways of registering for the Wazazi Nipendeni text messagin service Assisted by health facility worker women can be signed up when they come for antenatal care visits etc Assisted by community health workers community workers can sign women up when they visit them in their homes or other local venue Multiple response respondents may have heard of Wazazi Nipendeni through multiple channels ie adds up to more than Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Selfregistration instructions were given in the multimedia campaign People dial the short code and then are guided through small number of profiling questions category of user and stage of pregnancy age of child Registration data show that of users were registered by partners In addition proportion of other users will also have been helped to register by government health workers Partners generally register users through the USSD service or the API It is not possible to determine exactly how many of the of other users actually registered by themselves but were registered using USSD suggesting that they were in fact registered or at least assisted with their registration by partner This means that up to of users were re gistered by partners This highlights the importance of partners in getting users onto the system Although mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign it is partners that are instrumental in converting peop le into users People may lack sufficiently detailed understanding of the product to convince them to register for themselves whereas some personal contact can help get them signed up TFNC also believes that people who register with health profession al will have positive bias to comply with messaging have better understanding of how the service works and be more likely to appreciate how they can benefit from the service It is likely to be known and trusted individuals who are most influential assisting with registrations eg community health workers and community and religious leaders Wazazi Nipendeni was one of five programmes supported by the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project TCCP see Section This was multi media behaviour change communications programme aimed at improving range of health issues with focus on HIV prevention The five year programme started in and fini shed in so it will have achieved nearly maximum reach towards the end of when the DHS survey referred to in Table was conducted USAID evaluation gives total budget for the programme of million USD Field Nguer et al The budge is not disaggregated by project but by health issue At the time Wazazi Nipendeni was addressing maternal and child health malaria PMTCT and family planning The total budget allocated to these issues was million USD so the amount allocated to Wa zazi Nipendeni would be some fraction of this In principle the user numbers achieved by Wazazi Nipendeni could be at least partly result of this investment Although awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni was high in this was not evident during the qualit ative studies carried out as part of the evaluation The issues were not raised during focus group discussion and only in the midline survey which specifically explored implementation issues was any reference made to the legacy of TCCP Both women live in towns in other regions during that time and had signed up themselves after seeing poster in the health clinic Barnett et al It has been shown above that the majority of users were registered by partners These figures suggest that regist ration is driven by face toface interactions with health workers Further research would be needed to specifically investigate the extent to which registrations continue to be influenced by any residual awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni from the TCCP activities Figure confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health matters government more so than NGO facil ities It is interesting to note that even among control communities people have high levels of trust in information from automated text messages They are more likely to trust an SMS than family members confirming that text messages are regarded as bei ng reliable and of high quality Patterns of who people actually get information from Figure Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact broadly reflect levels of trust although they emphasise the importance of government health workers Figure Trust in sources of health information Source Authors Figure Sources of health information Source Authors At baseline the qualitative research found evidence that communities were already familiar with the use of SMS text messages as means of disseminating information on health and nutrition topics Viamos service was contracted to provide access to IV recordings in order to cater Percent who agree they woul trust information from each source Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact for those customers that struggle with written messages The qualitative research identified number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with womens lifestyles text messages can be read repeatedly audio messages may be heard incorrectly as messages remain on the phone they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any time and text messages are private they remain on the phone which tends to be regarded as personal device audio messages can be overheard by others The quantitative study showed that household members in treatment households were overwhelmingly likely to rea the mNutrition content they received on their phone indicating that sending messages by SMS in Swahili is an effective channel It should be noted that the SMS channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context given that literacy levels are relatively high for sub Saharan Africa and the country is united by the language of Swahili In addition to these features the quantitative study also found that users had low attachment to their mobile phones or their SIM at least Among eople who were able to explain why they had not received messages in the previous month the largest single reason was that they had lost their SIM see Figure Figure Receipt of Nutrition messages in the last month treatment group only Source Gilligan et al forthcoming The adult literacy rate in Tanzania is compared to an average for sub Saharan Africa of data from Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Customer relationships The aims of the customer relationships that Wazazi Nipendeni creates with users can be considered to be threefold Acquisition Those who were assisted with registrat ion have quite different relationship with the service to those who self registered Their ongoing experience of the service depends not only on the content of messages but also on whatever ongoing support and interaction they may continue to enjoy from the field agency Registration data confirm the importance of field partners and the face toface interaction they provide in encouraging users to register for the service up to of users were signed up by partners see Section Retention Several features of the system minimise pain points that might prompt users to leave system The service is free of charge so there is no need for any billing or paymen processes both of which can be tricky and cause customers to drop out of the service Once users pregnancy or maternal status has been captured by the registration process there is no need for the system to gather further information from users Per haps the most important factor is the perceived relevance and value of the content itself Retention levels are high Registration data indicate that the number of people opting out of the service is equivalent to roughly of new users in month As the total number of active users grows the attrition rate becomes increasing ly small when expressed as percentage of the number active users eg at the end of fouryear period Compliance The service will achieve greatest impact if it can successf ully persuade people to constructively change their behaviours This depends on the perceived relevance and value of the content and on the motivation of customers to comply with the messages they receive which depends on the perceived trustworthiness of the content High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality support high retention levels Nearly of those who self reported having ever received the content read all messages received and over self reported implementing at least one tip The study has not been able to generate any insights into the nature of the ongoing support provided by partners because locations for both quantitative and qualitative studies were selected on the basis of low registration levels and no partner presence Wazazi Nipendeni has strong brand which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the service and users tend to view it as MoHCDGEC service as the Government pushed it through the media Originally Wazazi Nipendeni was branded CDC action ut it is increasingly MoHCDGEC branded as MoHCDGEC adopt more of the service Users do not necessarily appreciate that the MNOs are paying for the messages Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania PPP comes from CDC it can be argued that the most important relationship is that with CDC Providing evidence that the service is delivering improved health outcomes is important Although commercial viability was priority for FCDO in their original concept for the mNutrition programme it is not clear that this is similar priority for other donors and organisations that have supported the service over the years Revenue streams and indirect benefits Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge to users so there is no direct revenue stream The original mNut rition project design was based on the assumption that users would pay for information eg via subscriptions and that this would provide opportunities for participating organisations to develop commercially sustainable business models even though nutrition information was to be Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact made available using freemium model However late in the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be permitted to charge for these information services In the end the Government insisted that health information should be made available to citizens free of charge The illingness of users to pay for health and nutrition information has yet to be tested However it is political pressure that is the main determinant of business models overnments across many African countries have insisted that health related information should be made available for free as national policies state that health services should be made available for free at the point of delivery key feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service is that it has also been made available free of charge to field pa rtner institutions running behaviour change interventions within Tanzania so no direct revenue is generated from partner organisations The mHealth Tanzania PPP is currently funded by CDC although the successful functioning of the service depends on con tributions by various partner organisations The service is therefore vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding from CDC Current funding is planned to The service also depends on the zero rating of text messages by partner MNOs Phone numbers are sed as the unique user identifier on the Rasello platform so users can only register one number although in principle they could self register as many numbers as they like Tanzania recently introduced mobile number portability Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority TCRA but it is unlikely that this is common practice For example even years after number portability was introduced in South Africa only of the subscriber base port their number in year Independent Comm unicatio ns Authority of South Africa Registration data from Rasello indicate that drop out rates are low which also suggests that use rs are not readily changing their mobile numbers The qualitative research found that most people use multiple SIMs swapp ing them into their phone depending on which network has signal and which offers the cheapest tariff eg time of day off net tariffs and bundle features In the baseline report it was proposed that the Wazazi Nipendeni VAS could offer MNOs indirect benefits associate with reduced churn However this has proven not to be the case The quantitative study found no difference in the length of time that respondents reported having had their main SIM card both groups had owned their primary SIM for just under three years and their second SIM for just over two years there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone number as they had at baseline two year duration and there was no difference in the proportion who subscri bed to the same operator as at baseline The baseline report also proposed that as VAS Wazazi Nipendeni could lead to an increase in ARPU among users and the quantitative study found that this has indeed been the case Control households spent an aver age of TZS per month month on mobile phone airtime including any data bundles but spending was higher TZS month in treatment communities The qualitative study found that women using the Wazazi Nipendeni service became more confident in using their phones which explains the increase in ARPU They were more likely to make and receive calls more likely to have sent and received text messages more likely to have used mobile money services and more potential to have used their phone intensively The latest DHS data indicate that of people across the country had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni see Table TCRA data for October give the total number of subscribers on Annualised porting rate is taken as the total cumulative ports divided by the number of years since the service was

networks as million Therefor Wazazi Nipendeni users represent of the entire subscriber base Given the reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni it is surprising that the MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not make greater use of their contribution and the Wazazi Nipendeni brand in their promotional materials It does appear that MNOs are beginning to recognise the political value attached to their support for Wazazi Nipendeni In an unpredictable political environment in which the Government can potentially impose regulatory constraints such as taxes there is political capital to be gained by supporting public good that plays part in implementing the Governments health policy By signing agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni directly with the Government ra ther than with the mHealth Tanzania PPP MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution Key resources Key resources are defined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition The primary assets employed by the mHealth Tanzania PPP in delivering the text messaging service are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages The current content comprises the pre existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and additional content generated through the mNutrition programme This nutrition content is regarded as public good having been paid for by FCDO In March CABI made this content publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource The text mes saging service originally ran on the Vusion platform developed by TTCM in partnership with the Praekelt foundation In October Wazazi Nipendeni migrated to new platform created for MoHCDGEC by loc al software developer Rasello The new platform offers improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities For example the mHealth Tanzania PPP has been able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track the number of users and messages being sent The text messaging service is designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign so the field partner programmes and interventions are key resource required to deliver the full potential of the value proposition To date partners have assisted with registering users in the field see Section The key resource in convening these partn erships has been and will continue to be the partnership with TFNC nd its linkages to both national nutrition policymakers and health and nutrition interventions launching in the country TFNC also acts as the moderator of health and nutrition content bringing to the partnership its technical expertise in this area The content localisation and approval process was acknowledged by stakeholders as going particularly smoothly as result of having TFNC on board Early in the country manager at the mHealth Tanzania PPP handed over to new team leader The country mana ger had been intimately involved in the development of the mHealth Tanzania PPP for nearly years The interesting feature of the new appointment was that while the previous country manager came from mobile technology background the new team leader is medical professional This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP as it continues to encourage Government agencies to take ownership of the platform itself along with associated technical responsibilities Strengthened health resources in the mHe alth Tanzania PPP leave it better able to engage with health policy issues and to broker partnerships with health sector actors datasetnutrition knowledge bank Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Key activities In order to make the business model work perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be undertaken is networking Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania PPP clearly have good personal contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs and to enlist the support of MNOs The strength of personalities is likely to become less important as MoHCDGEC assumes greater ownership of the technical platform and is able to integrate participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni system into processes required for health interventions to be implemented in country Under the original vision for the mHealth projects under the mNutrition programme it was expected that content delivered by the Global Content Partnership would simply be made available to all partners participating in the mHealth service and that each participating organisation would use their own resources to ad apt the key messages to specifically match their target audience and to suit their own objectives This was subject to an obligation or expectation that nutrition content would then be made available by participating organisations free of charge to users The Global Content Partnership was therefore mandated to create higher level generic content and little provision was made for creating specific locally relevant messages However when the original clearing house vision was abandoned there was hen need for new stream of work to create specific locally relevant messages in the local language ready to be integrated into the existing Wazazi Nipendeni database of content This was done by the partnership of EveryMobile and COUNSENUTH Detail ed testing of mHealth content was never part of the original concept as it was expected that local partners would do this for themselves so additional funding was made available to cover end user testing as part of the localisation process TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content generation process However TFNC adopted much more proactive role and its involvement has continued to deepen throughout the project When the content generation process wa changed to facilitate the production of more detailed localised content TFNC got more involved TFNCs engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that signing off procedures went smoothly Monitoring and evalua tion is key activity as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni makes towards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with forthcoming health interventions It is expected that the positive outcomes highlight ed by this evaluation study will be of value to the mHealth Tanzania PPP and to TFNC in this regard Providing face toface presence when working with women is important not only for assisting with registration onto the Wazazi Nipendeni system but also for achieving positive behaviour change The qualitative study confirmed that messages may play an important role in reinforcing and supporting the efforts of health workers The study found that messages acted as reminders to reinforce information provid ed by health workers and to reinforce mothers existing knowledge Note that even though people may trust information given by text messages Figure they are still most likely to get information from health workers Figure The core business of delivering content to beneficiaries depends on the technical infrastructure that eals with registration scheduling and the dispatch of messages to users This is sub contracted to Rasello as the platform provider and management is being gradually transferred from the mHealth Tanzania PPP to MoHCDGEC Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant eg new drugs and products will be introduced and recommended practice will be modified People will quickly lose trust in information Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact that is not immediately useful or even worse wrong Quality assurance processes for any revisions ought to be as rigorous as those adhered to during the mNutrition programme It is not clear that any of the partners has the mandate or the funding to undertake this type of ongoing maintenance Key partnership The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania PPP and TFNC is defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service succeed Research and design Wa zazi Nipendeni was riginally conceived as prevention of malaria in pregnancy campaign following an analysis by JHCCP of the Tanzania DHS data The mHealth Tanzania PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put together by JH CCP and MOHSW Content Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by MOHSW to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Org anization WHO Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action Content on family planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproductive Health mRH Content for Prevention of Mother toChild Transmission was designed by EG PAF TFNC was instrumental in securing the support of the SBCC TWG for nutrition in approving content Technology platform The service was originally run on the Vusion open source platform developed by TTCM The system architecture led to problems with re liability latency and cost The service was migrated to new platform in October It was hosted locally by Rasello and was commissioned and paid for by MoHCDGEC with CDC funding Telecoms operators The mHealth Tanzania PPP had identified MNOs key partners at the start However MNOs needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched without explicit support from MNOs but after the service achieved users within weeks the MNOs entered into agreements Field partners The programme launched in November with two month nationwide media campaign radio and TV follow up campaign ran from July to February during which field partners promoted the service and assisted with registrations In addition to the field partners see Table that have formal agreements with the mHealth Tanzania PPP and have source code allocated on the system other agencies have

query was performed on March The dataset contains the following fields unique ID anonymised source me ans of registration eg short code API partner who registered the user category of user eg pregnant woman mother with child stage at registration months or weeks representing the stage of pregnancy or age of child registration date statu active or inactive and optout date for inactive accounts The data required considerable manipulation primarily because when pregnant women reach term and are assumed to give birth the original record is flagged as inactive and new record is created with new category of mother with child Given that most users are women who have given birth while registered as users there were large number of paired records that needed to be reconciled and collated The working dataset includes addition al categories to reflect these hybrid classifications eg PWMC represents woman who registered when pregnant but has since given birth and has continued using the service as mother with child Registration via USSD and API was introduced to make the registration process faster and easier Registration by API was initially introduced by NHIF in July then use of API as registration source was adopted by other partners from November onwards Registration by USSD appears to have been introduced on November and registrations were submitted by multiple partners However there is spike in registrations on this date records were submitted on this date by USSD and by API There appears to be further anomaly registrations completed by USSD in November There is spike in the number of registrations completed by USSD during the three week period form November to November Most of these have no associated partner There are no further regi strations by USSD after this date which seems unlikely working dataset has been restricted to all records covering two year period between November and November The following numbers of records have been omitted up to and includin November and November onwards The following steps were taken in the preparation of the dataset used in the analysis and summarised in Table Data were submitted in four files containing total of record With the exception of records submitted in the period August to eptember Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact Paired duplicates were collated and ID errors were omitted from each file leaving total of records Files were then merged and paired duplicates across years were collated leaving total of records Records with various unresolvable data were omitted leaving total of records Omitted records included those with VALUE in the Registration date field NULL in the Source field outliers in the Stage field and records with an opt out date as well as an Active Status Migrated accounts from the Vusion system were omitted Staff at the mHealth Tanzania PPP reported that porting data from the old to the new system was fraught with difficulties resulting in inconsistencies in the data on the new platform For example of migrated data records contained single registration date November which corresponds roughly to the date the migration took place All migrated records have been omitted Anomalies in November and November cast doubt over the integrity of data before and after these dates so only data from the intervening two year period has been used Table Preparation of registration data for analysis Step Description Records reduction Data were submitted in four files na Pairing and errors omitted na

midMarch Therefore only opt out data from May onwards have been considered reliable and are presented in Figure Note that the rate at which users opted out of the system was an order of magni tude lower than the rate at which they were being registered so missing opt out data has minimal effect on the trend of calculated active users presented in Figure Mobile phones nutrition and health in

Tanzania PPP In their study of all eight health services in the mNut rition programme GSMA GSMA presents chart of the total number of users reached from October to December In this chart Wazazi Nipendeni users start from base of zero in January rising to in December However thes figures cannot be compared with the figures above because they represent the cumulative number of users reached Understanding users The NHIF has brought the largest number of users onto the system Figure This figure also shows that to date other partners have assisted few users to register relative to the number who appear to have self registered no partner Among the partners that registered more than users all apart from UNICEF used either API or USSD exclusively almost see Table None used the short code When the USSD system was introduced SMS remained the channel the general public could use to register but healthcare partners moved using USSD The USSD facility makes the registration process smoother because it can validate healthcare registration numbers in real time so it can check if people enter incorrect registration data When looking at users registered with no partner were registered using an API or USSD Figure suggesting that many could well have been Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact registered with the assistance of field partner It was reported that many women would have been signed up with the assistance of health workers when they visite clinics It is not therefore possible to determine how many users truly self registered ie without any assistance It is possible that up to of all users could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of partner official partner health workers if API and USSD registrations were included An inherent difficulty with USSD sessions was that in areas with poor network coverage the connection would be dropped before the registration process could be completed It was reported that some partners resorted to using short codes although this is not evident in the data from the period represented in Table The USSD protocol was subsequently changed so that it was able to resume the session automatically This was concern as most the marketing materials for Wazazi Nipendeni were based on the USSD functionality Figure Registrations by partner Source Authors Table

registration process users were asked what stage of the pregnancy women was at in months or weeks For mothers and supporters they were asked for the age of the child Figure shows that there was peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three month mark which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy Note the small number of women registering in the th month of their pregnancy this mostly likely represents women who were registered at or around the time they gave birth Users who were supporting pregnant women also tended to sign up at the end of the first trimester see Figure Users have been separated out into those who were registered by one of the partners listed in Table and those who apparently self registered Section analyses those users with no partner and suggests that in fact it is likely that most of them were ssisted by some kind of health worker The spike in registrations at the three month point is most acute among these users see Figure This figure also

of data that represents users who have registered and then left the service is relatively small Remember that the addition of nutrition messages means that users remain registered until the child reaches the age of five years so even children registered early in have not yet reached the age at which they will be automatically removed from the system In principle users can opt out of the service by Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact sending he word Simama to the same number used for self registrations In practice many users may not be aware of this Figure shows that most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women and that they left before giving birth The relatively low number of women in the PWMC category suggests that women who used the system throughout their pregnancy liked it and then continued to use it in motherhood Note that this analysis omits large number of users who registered as general

partner were registered using an API and using the USSD number While of those registered by USSD subsequently dropped out only of API registrations opted out Among those users with no partner were registered by USSD and may have been genuinely self registere or they may have been assisted by health worker However only the general public continued to register using the short code so of those

peak occurs after around eight months use of the se rvice Given that most users register around three to six months into their pregnancy Figure this peak corresponds to when their child is aged around two to five months old The reason for this peak is less obvious but may represent mothers who found the service useful during their pregnancy but not useful for helping with their newborn so fter

sales are on the rise and GSMA estimate that the number of handsets will more than double from to Adoption of smartphones in remote rural areas is likely to be relatively slow not only because of poor dat network coverage but also because of the relatively poor battery life offered by cheap smartphones Pew research shows that although only of adults had smartphones were using the internet note that TCRA data suggest the proportion of internet users may be higher although it does not attempt to identify unique users This indicates that people find alternative means of accessing the internet eg free Wi Fi hotspots and some feature phones can support internet enabled services Nevertheless the falling price of smartphones will continue to strengthen access to data services for example MTN ha ambitious plans to sell smart feature phone that uses the KaiOS operating system to create smartphone user experience providing access to Google and social media apps Data services will be instrumental in overcoming literacy barriers as well as providing richer information dissemination experience eg audio and video It is likely therefore that the reach and efficacy of mobile ealth services targeting the poorest will improve once they can be delivered via smartphones However oor network coverage means that this is unlikely to be the case within the medium term future and in the meantime voice based features eg IVR outbound dialling call centre are likely to be the most effective media for engaging with remote and low income communities In mature market in which almost all

Mobile phones nutrition and health in Tanzania Business modelling endline report ePact It is in teresting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile phones This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions as they tend to use platform that manages payments between healthcare providers but the interaction with the client is done by SMS This reliance on SMS tells us two things Firstly SMS is good enough means of communicating with clients ie constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not rendered the services unfeas ible Secondly SMS is regarded as the most cost effective medium for communicating with clients This is closely linked to the first point as voice based services such as outbound dialling and call centres can overcome literacy and language constraint but come at much higher cost The classification was drafted in so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet and smartphones in particular of data acquisition an analysis and of mobile money services Some examples are summarised below Babyl Rwanda is diagnostic

financial transfers and tools to support health care providers in vaccination delivery The feasibility successful implementation and scaleup of these digital health strate gies depends on the availability of mobilecellular infrastructure and patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in target populations Mobilecellular infrastructure and patterns of mobile use also provide insights about the feasibility and potential success of nextgeneration interv entions and technologies eg smartphone apps wearables The government of Tanzania has developed detailed investment road map for the use of digital health interv entions to strengthen the performance of the national health system Despite ranking rd among countries in its Netw ork Readiness Index measure summarizing the extent that countries benef it from the opportunities provided by information and communication technologies Tanzania currently has the third highest mobile cellular subscription rate in East Africa at per people In addition several large text messaging programs have been successfully implemented to deliver health information to target populations via mobile phones Examples of such text messaging programs include the Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign and the mobile for reproductive health educational messages for reproducti ve health Yet there is little subnational data on mobile phone ownership and use that are publicly available to inform the design and feasibility of digital health interv entions In support of diverse research and interv ention studies in urban and rural areas in Tanzania we sought to develop mobile phoneassisted reminder and incentive system mPARIS digital health system capable of among other things sending reminders and conditional financial transfers to mothers of newborn children as means of promoting timely uptak of childhood vaccines To inform the feasibility and design of digital health interv entions using mPARIS we used structured survey to assess pregnant women mobile phone ownership and use in the Mtw ara region in southern Tanzania The findings of the survey are reported below Methods Mobile phone ownership and use were evaluated to inform

Mtw ara ranked th in the Human Development Index among Tanzania regions Between August and November pregnant women were recruited from urban and rural health facilities and their surrounding communities Eligibility was limited to health facilities that regularly provide childhood vaccinations To participate in the study women had to meet the following inclusion criteria be years or older be in the third trimester of pregnanc have access to mobile phone and provide informed consent Eligible women recei ving antenatal care at participating facilities were approached by trained study personnel and offered enrollment in the study Participating women and local community leaders were asked to identify other pregnant women in their community who if eligible were also offered

corresponded to approximately TSH at the time of the study per week on phonerelated charges Discussion Study findings suggest high mobile phone access among pregnant women in the Mtw ara region Our data suggests the feasibility of text or voicebased interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southern Tanzania but there was less readiness for smartphonebased interv entions or strate gies relying on the use of social media or the internet High rates of mobile phone use for financial transactions sending or recei ving mone and the widespread use of bundles both of which require menubased interactions with phones suggest that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data USSD assessments or interv entions may be feasible Potential applications could include short questionnaires for data collection or monitoring Due to observ ed variations in phone access and ownership it is likely that any mobile phonebased interv entions will be delivered to shared phones for some participants This findingmay be of relevance to studies involving sensiti ve health topics eg HIVAIDS and other infectious diseases intimate partner violence According to our data the population in the Mtw ara region are relati vely smartphonenai ve compared to some other Tanzanian cities like DaresSalaam and Arusha where netw ork infrastructure has been previously reported Smartphonebased interv entions may be possible in Mtw ara but may require larger financial investments for the provision of smartphones to participants as well as higher training needs to facilitate their use We did not formally assess whether mobile netw orks in the Mtw ara region would be able to support broad use of smartphones This study is subject to several limitations First only women who had access to mobile phone were enrolled for the survey Our study therefore excludes women from families that do not have access to mobile phone Literature suggests that women from socioeconomically disadv antaged families are more likely to lack mobile phone access Such women may be more vulnerable and could potentially benef it more from interv entions promoting health information and health service use Second the selected facilities were within kilometers of Mtw ara the urban regional capital and commercial center Generalizability of the study findings is limited to the specif ic study area in late as mobile phone use and ownership characteristics may vary in other regions and is likely to increase over time Third the study provides only conte xtual information for the design of interv entions qualitati ve work concerning end user perceptions on feasibility and acceptability should complement the design and implementation of specif ic digital health interv entions In conclusion study findings suggest high feasibility of text voice or USSDbased interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southerly Tanzania The use of social media and internet among pregnant women is limited Future studies may use this study findings to track growth in mobile phone ownership and changes in use patterns among

Other Literature Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Preface This paper was prepared as background paper for the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA initiative in which digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars and which was launched in January Presenting digital skills framework was considered the first step in preparing the digital skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool to be used by the World Banks country teams to present strategies to foster and leverage digital skills for the emerging digital economy and DEA Score card which is being used by the World Bank to monitor progress towards achieving the DEA targets for the African continent to be achieved before These targets are aligned with the strategic orientations of the World Bank Group as well as the global development agenda ie SDG Earlier working drafts of this paper have informed ongoing work of the World Bank on digital skills and have been revi sed as this work evolved An early draft formed part of the technical background work for the th Forum of the Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences Engineering and Technology PASET which is facilitated by the World Bank The Forum Destination igital Africa Preparing our Youth for the Future was held in May in Kigali and attended by African countries and many partner countries Subsequent revisions of the draft July and November were used as World Bank inputs for the African Union Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa The paper and the proposed digital skills framework were also used to revise the Digital Skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool to prepare the DEA Scorecard and for the Digital Skills Country Action Plan Technical Assistance provided to PASET countries The Digital Skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool and Scorecard which incorporate the digital skills framework outlined in the paper were revie wed and endorsed by the Education Global Practice in early and ubsequently all the pillars of DEA Country Diagnostic Tool and Scorecard were formally reviewed and endorsed by the World Banks Africa region in May The present version incorp orates revisions made in concepts and descriptions of programs measurements and indicators in line with the above work and further elaborat es the advanced and highly specialized digital skills using the EUs eCompetence Framework for ICT Professions Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Summary This paper presents framework for digital skills based on review of international frameworks It discusses the demand and supply of digital skills as well as mapping with formal education programs at different levels of the system that could produce these skills It also gives examples of programs outside of formal education programs that could be used for imparting skills training Finally it suggests indicators Annex that could be used to be tter measure progress towards the objectives of the DEA initiative The paper does not cover the question of connecting schools and universities to broadband the types of technologies that could be used in education or the issues that need to be addresse in implementing the use of technology these are covered in other background papers The paper highlights the following issues Digital skills for citizens and non ICT professions One of the most comprehensive framework of digital skills for citize ns is the uropean Union EU DigComp Digital Skills Competence Framework andor its adap tation by UNESCO UIS in the Digital Literacy Global Framework DLGF The DigComp framework has competence areas while the DLGF framework has seven competence areas to better address developing country contexts Both have four proficiency levels basic intermediate advanced and highly specialized which can be further broken down into levels depending on the level of task com plexity The framework is especially useful for defining basic and intermediate skills that need to be broadly acquired by the youth population Adapt ation of his framework to the local contexts of countries is required in order to develop relevant educa tion courses training programs and assessment frameworks Countries will need assistance to do this ii Digital skills for the ICT professions require separate framework that describes the highly technical content and composition of skills applied in the ICT workplace The EUs Competence Framework provides useful reference which includes competence areas and proficiency levels associated with competencies required and applied in the ICT professions iii While he demand for digital skills is difficult to assess especially in the informal sector the requirement for basic digital skills is likely to become ubiquitous This is also the case for intermediate level skills in most formal sector jobs New approaches to assessing labor market demand including data from online job search platforms and Artificial Intelligence AI based analysis can help to identify the skills that are in demand at levels above the basic level iv While the supply of digital skills is equally challenging to assess selfreported measures suggest large proportion of th ose living in some of the Africa countries do not even possess the most basic digital skills which reflects their lack of familiarity with using broad set of digital devices and services For non ICT professions and citizens more broadly digital skills can be developed though formal learning in educational institutions well as informal and nonformal learning programs Basic digital skills should be provided to all high school students While he content of many of these courses is readily available there is important work to be done to adapt these to local contexts and to use local content Further implementation challenges of delivering at scale have to be addressed In North Africa where primary schools are better equipped basic digital skills can be provided at this level as well Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Basic and in some cases intermediate digital skills should also be provided out side of school settings especially as the majority of young people in regions such as Africa are out of school The se skills would ne ed to be provided together with foundational literacy and numeracy programs While variety of learning content associated with basic and intermediate digital skills are already available public private partnerships would need to be explored for efficie nt delivery to this population Intermediate digital skills should be provided to students in upper secondary schools and to all students in technical vocational and undergraduate nonICT programs as these students will enter occupations that require increasing use of technology At the technical vocational and undergraduate level students in non ICT courses that are more technology intensive can also to be taught advanced digital literacy skills In order to develop intermediate advanced and specialized skills for the ICT professions TVET and higher education institutions need to develop and reform courses that are benchmarked to international frameworks At the TVET level these include hardware and software relate courses for IT technicians while at the university level they include the core engineering programs such as electrical and computer engineering science programs At present both TVET and university courses in these disciplines are too theoretical and outdated Considerable and sustained efforts to reform these program are essential for African countries to assimilate and diffuse digital technologies Bootcamps and rapid skillingcoding courses can also help to produce advanced digital skills especially when there are spikes in demand for particular skillsprogramming languages These can be delivered through universities in partnership with companies or by the latter on their own Highly specialized digital skills will be imparted through postgraduate programs in applied mathematics computer engineering courses of high quality to train faculty and to introduce new courses These may have to be done at the regional level due to the shortages of highly skilled instructors who could handle such technical courses Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs The Importance of Digital Skills in Driving Digital Transformation Digital skills constitute one of the five foundational pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa initiative launched by the World Bank and are needed to mobilize digital innovations to transform economies societies and governments in Africa The other foundational pillars are igital infrastructure digital platforms digital financial services and digital entrepreneurship African economies require both digitally competent workforce as well as digitally literate citizens who could reap the benefits that the digital society brings digitally competent workforce can help strengthen the foundational pillars the installation of the digital infrastructure for example connectivity and data repositories that is most relevant for Africa the growth of digital entrepreneurship for example incubators and commerce that shapes digital industries and the development and use of digital platforms and digital financial services for example signatures and digital payments Moreover digitally competent workforce comprising large majority with basic digital skills and critical mass of skilled personnel and advanced specialists can help to extend the application of digital tools and processes in wide variety of sectors such as the informal service sector agriculture nergy transportation health and education to name few Digitally literate citizens can better reap the benefits of the digital economy by gaining access to more better and safer information ranging from government services commercial products and news as well engage with the wider community In contrast citizens who lack the capacity to digest complex and competing source of digital information and make appropriate judgements may fall into the traps of the digital economy including financial fra ud and especially for young people and children physical and other forms of abuse and exploitation The extent to which the spread of the digital economy is inclusive and broad based will depend on the inclusiveness of the five foundations Equity in dig ital skills across the population is likely to play particularly important role in sharing the prosperity promised by the digital economy concerted effort is required to equip the young population with digital skills Digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars in the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA initiative which includes Country Diagnostics on the state of the digital economy Scorecard to set targets and monitor progress and World Bank investments and technical support See Box As the term digital skills came to be used loosely across different pillars and strands of work this paper starts with the framework that can help to define these skills and the programscourses that could help to achieve them Broadly speaking the digital skills for citizens and the general workforce and digital skills for the ICT professions involve different domains and competences and require different frameworks which specify the relevant competences and proficiency levels These are summarized in Figure and further detailed in the next section Figure Digital Skills in the DEA Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box The Digital Economy for Africa DEA Initiative Prepared to support the implementation of the AU Digital transformation Strategy for Africa the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA Initiative sets out bold vision to ensure that every African individual business and government is digitally enabled by The goal is to drive the digital transformation of Africa and ensure its full participation in the global digital economy The DEA takes the approach of strengthening the enabling foundations that help advance digital economy that promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction In case country has good enabling foundations it is on the path of developing robust digital economy The reverse may also be true Based on the examination of the experiences of successful compan ies and public sector institutions that form digital economies those foundations are taken to be the availability of internet or broadband which brings people online the ability to identify and authenticate people digitally and the ability to pay or transact digitally Digital economies further energize when there is sizeable population of tech savvy workforce and an ecosystem that supports firms to enter or scale up in ways that brings about digital transformation across sectors Once those foundation are in place wide array of use cases can emerge mostly driven by the private sector in digitalizing economy bringing new products services and delivery channels Measurable goals for and have been proposed with DEA Scorecard coveri ng High Level Indicators and Targets as well as pillar specific High Level Indicators Annex The DEA Initiative is also fully embedded in the IDA Commitments Key commitments include support to ensure To help close the digital infrastructure ap IDA will support IDA countries to double their broadband penetration on the African continent including eight in landlocked countries by ii percent of entrepreneurship and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises MSME projects will inc orporate digital financial services andor digital entrepreneurship elements and ensure they address particular constraints facing women and people with disabilities iii At least percent of IDA financing operations for digital skills development will support womens access to higher productivity jobs including online work iv All IDA financing operations for Digital Development will support womens increased access to and usage of digital services Support at least IDA countries to adopt universally accessible GovTech solutions and vi Support building client capacity in percent of IDA FCS countries to use field appropriate digital tools for collection and analysis of geo tagged data and apply this technology to enhance project implementation and coordination The DEA initiative has prepared Country Diagnostics Tool to guide the World Banks mul tisector task team in carrying out an assessment of the five pillars of the digital economy as well as cross cutting areas This tool is current ly in the process of being deployed in large number of African countries Source Adapted from World Bank Digital Economy for Africa Country Diagnostic Tool and Guidelines for Task Teams Version economy country diagnostics forafrica Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Framework for Digital Skills Africa still lacks comprehensive framework for digital skills although some countries have developed broad fra meworks Many OECD countries and some Asian and Latin American nations have developed frameworks to guide measurement of digital skills in the population and support the development of education and training materials thorough review of existing Digital Skills Frameworks was undertaken as part of the background work for this paper The list of the frameworks is given in Appendix Table The most comprehensive and widely used framework for general digital skills is the European Unions DigComp and its more recent update DigComp which identifies five areas with competences The five areas are information and data literacy ii communication and collaboration iii digital content creation iv saf ety and problem solving Carretero et al For each competence there are eight proficiency levels in DigComp grouped into four broad headings Foundational Intermediate Advanced and Highly Specialized UNESCOs Institute of Statistics has built on this framework to adapt it to developing country contexts as part of its goal to develop methodology that can serve as the foundation for the Sustainable Development Goal for digital literacy As part of this adaptation UIS has proposed adding two more competences to the EU DigComp framework to include competences related to devices and software operations and career related competences detailed explanation on the competency areas and proficiency levels is given in Table Figure indicates that while the proportion of the workforce that has the basic level of proficiency in multiple competences should ideally be large this proportion will decline for those with higher levels of proficiencies Figure Digital Skills Framework for General Workforce and Population Competencies and Proficiency Levels Existing frameworks can be grouped into two broad categories Digital competence frameworks whic identify key components of digital competence at different levels of proficiency and User skills level frameworks which indicate digital skills needed by different types of digital users DigComp contains no conceptual updates to DigComp competence areas and competences but it includes updates to proficiency levels and examples of use Sustainable Development Goal Thematic Indicator Percentage of youthadults who have achieved at least minimum level of proficiency in digital iteracy skills Appendix Table provides more details Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs The proficiency levels reflect the cognitive challenge the complexity of the tasks as well as autonomy in completing the tasks Carretero et al At the lowest levels person is able to carry out simple task with help at levels the person is able to apply knowledge solve problems and helps others while at levels the person is professional who is contributing to technical scientific knowledge in that

specific career related digital technologies and content to have access to opportunities in the digital economy competences involving operating specialized digital technologies as well as working with digital content for specific career related fields Source Based on Carretero et al and UIS Note Proposed by UIS as additions to the DigComp framework which was subsequently updated to DigComp Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box Examples of Competencies and Proficiency Levels Required by Different Users Farmers mobile phone can help farmers to improve their earnings through their decisions regarding crops to grow and markets to sell their produce However the degree to which this happens will depend partly on the technology sophistication of the phone conn ection to the Internet and partly on the digital skills of the famer The competence related to devices and software operations means that the farmers can input SIM card into their phones turn it on and charge it Foundational information and data literacy skills would allow the farmer to receive text messages on their phone regarding weather forecasts market prices of products and effective farmer practices With high level of proficiency in the competence area of communication and collaborati on farmer could learn about connecting to an irrigation system and to program it by using online resources or tapping into an online community UIS Students At the foundational level of proficiency in creating digital content student can create digital presentation to showcase their work using for example simple video tutorial from YouTube to animate the presentation In collaborating through digital technologies student at an advanced level should be able to co create data and content for making video and be able to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate digital resources Carretero et al Employee person who is seeking to improve their career opportunities would be able to use the tools of massive open online course MOOC to enhance their learning experience This would require intermediate level proficiency in the competence area of problem solving creatively using digital technology Carretero et al Digital skills for the Information and Communication Technology ICT profession require separate framework that describes the highly technical content and composition of skil ls applied in the ICT workplace The EUs Competence Framework provides useful reference that covers competencies required and applied in the ICT professions using common language for skill levels that can be understood across Europe see Figure similar framework exi sts in the US called the Skills Framework for the Information Age SFIA In East Asia Japans ICT Dictionary is most commonly used as reference framework for digital skills for the ICT professions The Competence framework articulates competences req uired and deployed by ICT professionals including both practitioners and managers It was created for managers and human resource HR departments for education institutions universities technical training institutions and training bodies policy mak ers and other organisations in public and private sectors It can therefore be used with necessary adaptations to assess the quality of ICT and engineering programs at the university and TVET level as well as those provided outside the formal education system contentuploadsEuropean eCompetence Framework CENCWA pdf The Competence levels can also be related to the levels of the broader European Qualifications Framework Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Figure ECompetence framework for the ICT Professions Source Adapted from European Competence Framework As digital technologies penetrate an increasing number of sectors and occupations sections of the workforce that are in non ICT professions and occupations will also require more specialized digital competences characteristic of ICT technicians and specialists Hence there is not strict one toone mapping between the two frameworks and the two broad groups of professions Nevertheless this distinction is useful especially in the African context where the majority of workers are non ICT professions and occupations but will increasingly require basic or intermediate level digital skills as enumerated in the UNESCO DL GFEU DigComp framework The digital skills proficiency levels in this framework provide an indication of the omplexity of the tasks that can be undertaken by non ICT specialists For example foundation or basic level of proficiency in digital skills represents abilities required to carry out simple tasks using simple digital technologies such as the capacity to use basic digital devices or applications Basic digital skills are typically used in vocational or informal sector occupations and occupations involving routine tasks for instance Uber drivers grocery delivery personnel etc Intermediate level profi ciency would typically be required in middle level occupations such as the general workforce in formal small and medium enterprises SMEs that are using range of digital technologies small firms and shops engaging in commerce and using digital payme nts journalists who can use digital tools for collecting searching and analyzing information Advanced level proficiency which requires greater analytical skills as well as theoretical knowledge is typically required in occupations with high level of ICT intensity Figure presents rough mapping of broad categories of occupations according to two education related dimensions the theoretical and analytical dimension and job specific competences and the use of the two frameworks presented in this section Digital comp etences apart from the most rudimentary ones such as using mobile phone for voice calls or simple messages cannot be developed without foundational literacy and numeracy skills Certain competences such as communication and collaboration as well as hi gher levels of proficiency in all areas of competence also require socioemotional skills These include characteristics such as perseverance empathy trust self control and self esteem among others However even foundational skills are lacking in maj ority of the population including among young people after several years of schooling particularly Mikhail Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs in SSA Hence developing even basic digital skills will require ensuring minimum level of literacy and numeracy Figure Types of Digital Skills and ccupations Note Adapted from Mikhail

occupations ICT skilled technicians NonICT workforce using intermediate level general digital skills Vocational occupations Informal sector workforce using basic skillsTheoretical knowledge and analytical skills Job specific skills and competenciesExperimental applied conceptualConceptual intuitive Use of eCompetence Framework Use of DigCompDLGFDigital Skills Frameworks and Programs Demand for Digital Skills The spread of digital technologies may change the demand for skills in two opposing ways First there could be an increase in demand for basic and intermediate digital skills which help workers deploy these technologies as well as advanced digital and higher order cognitive and socioemotional skills which allow workers to leverage digital wo rkplaces to engage in nonroutine tasks Second there could be decrease in demand for routine skills or manual labor due to automation There is little systematic data on how the demand for digital skills or skills more broadly is changing in Africa However analysis presented in background paper for the World Development Report on Digital Dividends indicates that employment in occupations intensive in ICT use at work in developing countries has increased by percent between and alm ost two times the increase in developed countries Monroy Taborda et al The emergence of new industries and services in the digital economy as well as the spread of digital technologies in many traditional manufacturing and service sectors is likely to stimulate demand for digitally intensive occupations The ICT sector itself and emerging ICT intensive sectors such as commerce Internet enabled offshoring and online work bioengineering and so on will require workforce with range of di gital competences from intermediate to advanced and highly specialized levels Moreover demand will also emerge from the traditional sectors which are increasingly using digital technologies such as agriculture construction transportation and logistic manufacturing banking and finance health and government sectors in which the different categories of occupations ranging from scientific to the professional middle level and vocational occupations will require new digital skills Further while the ICT and ICT intensive sectors are not in themselves labor intensive they generate low skilled and medium skilled jobs in services such as retail food preparation and cleaning Box The demand for digital skills will be ubiquitous in the formal secto The World Economic Forum global surve of companies provides glimpse of the forthcoming transformations across industries including Africa The vast majority of companies in ach of the industries surveyed will adopt one or more of the new technologies listed in th survey the highest level of adoption will be in user and entity big data analytics percent of all companies app and web enabled markets percent internet of things percent machine learning and cloud computing percent Skills in these areas will be demanded by over percent of all industries with ICT professional services global health and financial services demanding these skill the most The other technologies that would have the biggest level of adoption include digital trade commerce augmented reality encryption new materials wearable electronics printing blockchain and robotics These technologies overall wil be introduced in over percent of all companies with digital trade adopted in percent The WEF survey also defined the new jobs and new roles of workers Top jobs that are expected to be in high demand moving forward are data analysts and data scientists rtificial Intelligence AI and machine learning specialists general and operations managers big data specialists digital transformation specialists sales and digital marketing professionals software applications developers and analysts and innovation professionals Based on these surveys the redundant roles are likely to be data entry clerks accounting bookkeeping and payroll clerks assembly and factory workers client in formation workers Analysis by LinkedIn in using its global database reveals trend of rising demand for jobs such as data scientists AI and machine learning specialists listing them on top of global demand including demand in Africa Further eve where earlier jobs continue workers and professionals would need to have hybrid skills not only the skills of their core profession but also digital skills The World Development Report notes that Kenyas mobile money service Pesa uses more than agents Hormuud Telecom the largest operator in Somalia employs staff but supports agents The technologies are printing Aerial and underwater robots App and web enabled markets Augmented and virtual reality Autonomous transport Biotechnology Cloud computing Digital trade Distributed ledger blockchain Encryption Humanoid rob ots Internet of things Machine learning New materials Non humanoid land robots Quantum computing Stationary robots User and entity big data analytics Wearable electronics Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs For instance an accountant would not only need the usual accounting knowledge but also skills in spreadsheets databases etc marketing director needs to also have skills in digital marketing social media and content marketing and using search engine optimization Note Only cities with LinkedIn members were included in this estimat ion which uses the skills and employment listed on the LinkedIn profiles of people However the effective demand for digital skills from the informal sector especially agriculture and services where the majority of people are employed in Africa is ikely to be constrained This is because of high levels of income volatility precariousness of employment and high opportunity costs that reduce participation in training or skills upgrading This may constrain the spread of digital technologies in these sectors Yet it is pre cisely in these labor intensive sectors where relatively simple technologies such as mobile phones can help to improve productivity in for example agriculture through better information on weather and prices as well regular technical advice on operation Small service providers food sellers tailors and so on can expand markets through the use of social media The informal manufacturing sector may also benefit from digital technologies such as printing which allows for small scale and customizable ools Finally ensuring that all citizens especially young people have basic digital skills is crucial for the extension of government services and for inclusion in the new economy The extent to which disruptive technological change is labor saving in Africa will depend on the number of routine tasks in jobs that might make them susceptible to automation relative wages and the lags in adoption of technology In general with lower wages and slower rate of technological adoption the risk of automa tion drastically reducing jobs is lower which gives time for governments to put in place policies for upskilling the population World Bank However each country needs to do this analysis to assess the demand for digital skills Artificial intelli gence enabled approaches can provide real time and predictive guidance on in demand skills and identify skills gaps especially for the formal sector or for employers and workers engaged in the digital economy Traditional methods of assessing demand em ployer surveys industry consultations focus groups can take long time and results can become quickly outdated when the job market is rapidly changing Further the skills assessed are not granular enough to provide guidance to training providers to hange their courses An example of such platform is JobKred which has developed algorithms to predict the top job occupations and top skills within these jobs which are demanded by the local area market Careers and skills recommendations engine is bu ilt by these methods to yield actionable relevant and accurate career and employment data However in the informal sector there are many knowledge and information failures that prevent the matching of demand and supply of skills Many small firms whe re the owners themselves have low levels of education are often not aware of new technology and new skills needs As in the case of other skills matching the supply with the demand for digital skills is best done in the context of programs that offer technical financial and marketing services to the informal sector Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Supply of Digital Skills While large proportion of the population in Africa has some familiarity with using mobile phones their capacity to handle broader set of digital devices and services are likely to be very limited Information about the current status of basic digital skills in the population is sparse The rapid spread of mobile phones and mobile Internet services in particular means that large proportion of the population has some familiarity with devices mainly phones some digital services government service and payments as well as social media However with the limited penetration of fixed broadband computers and laptops both in homes and educational institutions it is highly unlikely that there is even basic familiarity with broader digital services Access to digital devices does not necessarily translate into acquiring digital skills except the most foundational Although many countries have introduced ICT as subject in school education in practice most schools are not able to teach even basic skills because of the lack of electricity devices and access to digital materials or the Internet Only few have introduced computer assisted instruction Cross national askbased measures of digital skills suggest that the share of the population with basic digital skills is very low in number of countries in Africa Figure presents the proportion of the population with basic standard which roughly correspond to intermediate level in Figure and advanced digital skills based on self reported behavioral measures of digital skills The figure suggests that there are considerably lower proportion of people in Africa Togo Niger Cote dIvoire Djibouti and Tunisia with basic standard and advanced digital skills compared countries in Europe Asia and South America It also points to large within region differences whereby selected Northern African countries have higher proportion of the population with basic standards and advanced digital skills Generally speaking information about the levels of digital skills is very limited This is partly due to the lack of reliable metrics of digital skills as well as limited availability of any data on digital skills in Africa based on representative sample Many of the exis ting measures of digital skills are based on self reports or proxies based on possession of devices or tasks performed see Annex Many of the existing large scale household or labor force surveys in Africa do not systematically collect information on igital skills Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Figure Proportion of the population with basic standard and advanced skill levels Note Measuring the Information Society Report ITUs figures are based on Botswana Cabo Verde Cte dIvoire Djibouti Niger Egypt Morocco Sudan Togo Zimbabwe ITUs figures also assume that an individual has basic digital skills if heshe has engaged in at least one of the following four computer based activities during the last months copying or moving file or folder using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within document sending mails with attached files and transferring files between computer and other devices These task behaviors broadly correspond to DigcCompUNESCOs proficiency levels in the Competency areas Devices and software operations and Communication and collaboration and proficiency levels and The assumptio is that individuals proficiencies in DigCompUNESCOs Competence areas and are correlated with those in other Competence areas Another assumption is that the data from of countries represent data from the African continent ITUs figures also assume that an individual has advanced digital skills if heshe has engaged in the following computer based activities during the last months writing computer program using specialized programming language This task behavior broadly corresponds to DigcCompUNESCOs proficiency level in the Competency areas Devices and software operations and Digital content creation The assumption is that individuals proficiencies in DigCompUNESCOs Competence areas and are correlated with hose in other Competence areas Another assumption is that the data from cou ntries are representative of the African continent Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs An alternative way to assess the supply of digital skills is to use information on the completion of education assuming th at some form of ICT training is provided in education institutions see Figure Knowing the state of provision of school education it is likely that students in high schools in the majority of African countries acquire only basic digital skills if ICT is included in the curriculum and actually delivered Intermediate level skills may be provided at the upper secondary level mor careful assessment would require matching the ICT curriculum with the competences and proficiency levels in the UNESCOEU DigComp framework Digital skills for the ICT professions could be delivered at the upper secondary level and in TVET institutions and technology programs in short cycle tertiary institutions at the technician level in university undergraduate programs in engineering sciences mathematics and related fields and postgraduate programs in the same fields Again an assessment of the curriculum of these courses against international frameworks such as the EU Competence framework would provide better estimation of the skills of the students in these courses Hence using the proportion of students at different levels of education and in different types of ICT related courses could provide rough estimate of the supply of digital skills through the formal education system This mapping should be taken as indicative as because much of the learning in SSA schools including in techn ology related courses at the school level tend to be theoretical and focused on rote learning which do not develop the competences listed in the above mentioned frameworks Figure Digital Skills and Levels of Education We use the term ICT training here as this term is currently more common in African education systems rather than the term digital skills training Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Provision of Digital Skills through Formal Education and Training Institutions Fostering digital skills through the formal education system The digital competencies listed in Table can be acquired through formal education and training institutions for young people and on thejob formal training and informal training such as peer to peer learning for those in the workforce Increasingly online learning and blended learning are supplementing traditional training methods and vastly increasing the potential for enhan cing access Universalizing basic digital skills Basic digital skills refer to the proficiency levels and in the framework outlined in Table person who is proficient at this level would be able to do simple tasks that involve remembering content and instructions but also requires some guidance to execute In sub Saharan African asic digital skills programs can be offered in high schools lower secondary schools covering grades approximately and also at higher levels of education for those students who have not had access to digital skills training Apart from few more advanced countries in Southern Africa Kenya etc it is un likely that primary schools have the minimum required infrastructure to provide digital skills training In Northern Africa on the other basic digital skills training can be provided in primary schools as well An important decision is whether to provi de stand alone basic digital skills training to students or to integrate the use of digital technology across the curriculum Experience shows that the latter takes long time as teachers need to become confident in the use of technology and digital ontent promising way to start is to introduce basic digital skills training as subject for high school students Essential steps in this process are definition of curriculum selection of digital content teaching methods and assessment the pro vision of devices that can be used by students in sequence but in such manner as to allow equitable access stable source of supply connectivity to the internet and regular frequent training of all teachers not just the ICT teacher An extremely impo rtant aspect is ensur ing that there is adequate and consistent technical support for teachers and students to troubleshoot issues with hardware software internet connection and use of content Adaptation of existing basic digital skills curricula traini ng such as the International Computer Driving License see below is one quick way to introduce basic digital skills training Intermediate digital skills for the general workforce and for ICT professions Intermediate digital skills refer to proficiency evels and in the framework outlined in Table The student is able to independently perform simple tasks and well defined and routine tasks and straightforward problems and where heshe is able to remember and to understand Intermediate digital skills programs can be offered in lower and upper secondary schools and should be made available to all undergraduate students in universities Because intermediate digital skills require greater understanding of content in different situations they are best provided as part of teaching other courses This means that use of digital technology needs to be integrated across several subjects To begin with this could be done in language and mathematics as well as science subjects Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Integrating digital technology into teaching is far more complex than providing stand alone digital skills training at the basic level of proficiency It is ideal if the school has plan for the use of technology and heavy emphasis on teacher developme nt and continuous support is required Careful selection and curation of digital content appropriate to each subject is time consuming and requires technical expertise For the ICT technicians courses at the level of and of the EU ecompetence framework Figure are appropriate and these need to be provided in technical upper secondary schools and post secondary TVET institutions Advanced digital skills for non ICT and ICT professions Advanced digital skills refer to proficiency levels and in the DigComp DLGF outlined in Table For those in engineering and ICT professions advanced digital skills refer to the proficiency level in the eCompetence for ICT Professions framework Figure person who is proficient at this level would be able to deal with and provide guidance to others on different tasks nd problems that involve applying and evaluating content in complex situations Advanced digital skills are required for African countries to diffuse and adopt new digital technologies across many sectors of the economy Advanced digital skills programs for ICT courses require greater theoretical content and would typically be provided in relevant undergraduate courses in universities and other tertiary level courses Typically these would cover Engineering course specifically electrical and computer ngineering courses year courses these would constitute the core of the advanced digital skills programs Mathematics science and related undergraduate courses year courses in universities and technology courses in tertiary institutions The discipline of electrical and computer engineering is fundamental to the technologies of the th industrial revolution when artificial intelligence systems will be ubiquitous Hen ce reforming the content pedagogy and assessment of these courses should be priority Box Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box Advanced digital skills for the ICT professions require reform of core engineering courses in universities Given the rapid advances in scientific knowledge it has become impossible to fully train an engineer in the four years typically allotted for baccalaureate degree at university or even in the cumulative total of eight to nine years typically consider ed adequate for an advanced PhD degree The implication is that no engineering curriculum should set out to provide student with all the technical knowledge she needs for lifetime career What is required is to structure training program that focuses on imparting the fundamentals of the field and on providing the students with the skill to learn how to learn on their own The typical electrical and computer engineering curriculum at an African university differs significantly from that of university in developed country for example in Korea or Singapore While most electrical and computer engineering curricula in the developed world are four year programs some African universities have five year curricula for baccalaureate degree The key differences are heavier course load in each year The type of courses included in the curriculum some of which are not directly relevant to core subject material for electrical and computer engineering The content of the courses which do not sufficiently emphasize the fundamentals breadth and depth Lecturing as the dominant mode of instruction no recitations and rare tutorials with small groups Very large class sizes ranging from students No capstone project by students Almost exclusive reliance on the final examination no weightage to homework or continuous assessment Engineering curricula and syllabi are not regularly revised in African universities and the lack of widespread accreditati on of engineering programs in sub Saharan Africa by international bodies has serious implications for the quality of engineering programs in Africa Modern engineering curricula are typically structured to fit within four level scheme that emphasizes ertain skills and core knowledge At the base of the scheme are courses that impart foundational knowledge in the sciences physics chemistry and biology mathematics and computing computer literacy The foundational background is followed by set of courses considered to constitute the core subject matter of the particular engineering discipline Next the student is exposed to the breadth of the subject after which she can select one or two areas for an in depth study In addition to the course work typical four year undergraduate program generally offers the student an opportunity to work on capstone design project during the third or fourth year of their study Such projects usually have minimum duration of at least one academic semeste but could also extend to full academic year Capstone projects are intended to help students assimilate and internalize core engineering concepts learned in the course of their study Most capstone projects at world class universities are generally team projects intended to develop and impart interpersonal skills for working in teams this is in addition to learning how to manage and cope with unknown factors as well as known resource and time constraints on projects that are designed to closely emulate real world working conditions Note Adapted from Towe consultant report Highly Specialized Digital Skills for the ICT professions Although the UNESCOEU DigComp framework outlines ighly specialized digital skills proficiency levels and in Table which could in theory be available to citizens and the general workforce in practice this would be difficult to provide in the African context in most educational or other institutions For the ICT professions hese skills representing and levels of the EU Competence framework in Figure are typically provided at the postgraduate level Masters and doctorate level focusing on advanced computer science engineering applied mathematics and related fie lds and cater to occupations such as data scientists and AI engineers The availability of highquality postgraduate programs in these areas is very limited especially in sub Saharan Africa outside of South Africa This has an impact on the Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs quality of undergraduate training and also on the limited ability to develop new solutions and applications of digital technologies Development of highquality postgraduate programs requires high concentration of resources and alignment with international benchmar ks for quality for smaller countries or those with weaker capacity this is likely done best at the regional level and for all countries high quality regional programs can supplement national efforts Fostering digital skills outside the formal education system few case examples are provided to show how different levels of digital skills are being provided outside the formal education system However it must be noted that these levels may not exactly correspond to the frameworks mentioned in this paper and th ey are given for illustrative purposes Basic Digital Skills programs case examples The International Computer Drivers License ICDL offers courses that are for beginners with no prior computer or internet experience intermediate level courses are also offered see below The ICDL is computer literacy program which is based entirely on the European Computer Drivers Licence ECDL program operated by the EDCL Foundation and its syllabus content and assessment methods have not been adapted to country contexts Its syllabus is divided into modules and standardized tests are taken by the student after completing module It is adm inistered by accredited test centers operated by course vendors educational establishments large organizations or companies using guidelines provided by the ECDL Foundation ICDL appears to be the worlds leading computer skills certification organizat ion According to its website more than million people in over countries have engaged with the ICDL program through network of over ICDL Accredited Test Centers ATCs ICDL is present in almost all African countries For instance in Sout Africa there are more than ATCs in Kenya more than in Uganda and in Rwanda Box ICDL in Kenya Kenya is an interesting example of full scale adaptation not adaptation of ICDL Based on government decision in ICDL has become the st andard offering for organizations across the public and private sector Recently ICDL Africa signed Memorandum of Understanding MoU with the Kenya School of Government to offer ICDL to public sector workers across the KSG campuses throughout Kenya ach year over new candidates register for the program taking over certification tests annually ICDL Africa operates through an office in Nairobi with team of full time staff providing support to the large network of ATCs Organizatio ns wishing to become an ATC must first be accredited by the Technical Vocational Education and Training Authority TVETA The network of ATCs covers wide variety of sectors including schools technical training institutions universities Government ins titutions NGOs and commercial training organizations Every autumn ICDL Africa hosts its annual ATC Forum bringing together all ATCs as well as key stakeholders in the ICT and education sector to discuss updates to the ICDL program and share best pract ice from around the world ICDL was adopted into national law in Kenya in when the Information and Communications Act recognized the ICDL Certification as the entry level computer certification designed to demonstrate competence in computer use Th ailand has also officially recognized ICDL as an education standard However to our knowledge no European country has adopted ECDL into its legislation As result all training courses in Kenya meet the ICDL standard earlier some computer literacy courses were of low quality and employers can easily compare formal IT qualifications of applicants and employees Unfortunately no sources indicate how far the substance of the ICDL which basically is PC based would benefit from including ore on skills related to the use of mobile phones which have been the important drivers of the digital economy in Kenya It would be important to get an assessment of the appropriatenessneed for adaptation of the ICDL from members of the business communi ty in Kenya Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Given the extremely low level of literacy especially in SSA countries even the introductory courses of ICDL may need to be adapted for use in schools Box provides information about the implementation of ICDL in Kenya The Digital Doorway DD project launched in provides freely accessible ICT centers in the form of containers They encourage digital upskilling and computer literacy in rural areas of South Africa through unassisted and peer assisted learning Container DDs are placed in disadvantaged localities to improve the digital and informational literacy of disadvantaged children youth and adults through experimentation and exploration by allowing them to learn without formal training and minimal external input Based on the open source software Ubuntu Linux the content of container DDs includes the OpenOffice suite educational programs and content including interactive scientific simulations an introduction to computer terminology scientific software books Wikipedia etc This allows for varying computing activities ranging from entertainment to independent research Gush DDs come equipped with internet and local wireless hotspots for the content to be accessible to anyone with browser joint initiative of the government and private sector in South Africa more than systems have been deployed across all pro vinces of South Africa as of with the latest installation being in Each DD has the potential of reaching hundreds of users of users are below the age of years They have also been deployed across other African countries like Ethiopia Lesotho and Uganda while also being deployed in Australia and Solomon Islands Each ontainer house multimedia computer system with three or four user terminals Container DDs are solar powered and hence selfsustainabl robust and vandal proof units designed to thrive in areas without power or shelter PraDigi was launched in in rural India spearheaded by Pratham Google tablets have been distributed to children across villages Pratham an influential non profit provides numeracy and literacy content and partners with Slam Out Loud another non profit which provides performance and visual arts based educational content and training The goal is to provide cross disciplinar education and digital literacy in non formal setting through self paced and personalized learning tools The content caters to children aged to years but the rigor adjusts to each childs learning levels The freely accessible tablets provide contextual and interactive content in regional languages PraDig spin on the word prodigy encourages deeper mastery by promoting group based learning and assignments through shared tablets PraDigi staff visit villages once week to assess student prog ress through qualitative observational data and to troubleshoot This allows student progress to be measured holistically Intermediate digital skills programs case examples Various examples of

system or in partnership with universities are provided by variety of for profit providers through online and blended programs and also through rapid skills training bootcamps Examples of online and

wide variety of courses and proficiency levels within these programs courses are of varying lengths These initiatives are provided in mix of both formats from purely online programs including paid courses and MOOCs to in person training programs Rapid training in dvanced digital skills outside the education system particularly in the software industry have recently become very popular Such training sessions are usually on current topics that are in sudden high demand Because the standard ourses take more time to prepare graduates universities even in advanced countries are unable to respond to spikes of demand in certain area particularly in coding Universities can themselves offer such bootcamps over summer session but more rece ntly many forprofit companies have become active in this type of training especially when the need is in some of the most popular high level computer languages such as Python PHP Java etc However oding bootcamps work best for individuals ho already have background in the structure of computer languages but who do not have any experience programming in the particular language that there is demand for For these individuals having someone show them the gist of the language immediately allows them to make connections to their mental logical concept of the syntax they expect for computer language Learning is then very fast and within short time they are coding very well For anyone lacking in the underlying structure of how hig hlevel languages are constructed the lessons can be confusing and often frustrating Another area where bootcamps are popular is machine learning subarea of artificial intelligence again rapid training courses in this area tend to be more useful for individuals who have the mathematical background relevant to machine learning This background is found in algebra particularly in the field of matrices Concepts in manipulating large two and three dimensional matrices are key to machine learning The coding of algorithms into software applications for performing the manipulations can be meaningless if one does not have the conceptual framework on matrices The delivery of these programs is best organized in partnership with the private sector to ensure that the course meet the requirements of the specific jobs in current demand Adapted from Towe Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Table Advanced

basic literacy and numeracy skills in huge section of the population which are essential prerequisites for the acquisition of even the most rudimentary digital skills Self reported literacy rates among young people are high for example percent of young people aged report themselves as literate in most countries But actual reading proficiency tests done in the two SSA countries show functional literacy rates to be much lower Recent studies in SSA countries have found that the majority of fourth grade students cannot read paragraph and close to ninety percent could not solve mathematics world problem for eighth and ninth grade students in South Africa close to half of the students did not have basic mathematical knowledge including adding and subtracting whole numbers Furthermore over million children under the age of are estimated to be out of school Bashir et al The creation of advanced digital skills for the ICT professions through engineering computer science and related programs is restricted by the low access to post basic education Across the region enrollment rates in upper secondary education grades are extremely low In SSA the av erage is about percent but in many countries it is less than percent In higher education the gross enrollment ratio is below percent Enrollments in technical vocational education are below the average in other regions Limited enrollment in athematics and science streams in lower secondary and upper secondary and high failure rates in these subjects restricts the pipeline of those who could enroll in technical professional mathematics and science courses in higher education Estimates indi cate that less than quarter of the small number of students in higher education are in mathematics and science courses Further gender disparities become acute in upper secondary and higher education with very few girls participating in the technical nd professional courses that lead to high end jobs in the digital economy Equally important is the poor quality of courses and teaching in technical vocational and higher education especially in the technical professional and mathematics courses Lack of qualified faculty is one major issue with many university faculties in SSA not having postgraduate qualification Even more serious is the lack of industry experience which is especially important in the fast changing environment of digital technologi es Most universities still offer outdated courses in computer science courses electronics and telecommunications and information management systems Key specializations that are considered necessary for broad and deep digital economy are missing thes include cybersecurity mobile computing network and cloud technology ICT hardware and service infrastructure IT management ITM software development and engineering storage and data digital multimedia big data data analytics artificial intellig ence and so on Formal education and training institutions are important for preparing the pipeline of young workers and citizens for the digital world Training opportunities for those who are currently out of school or those in the workforce are equall important For this enormous stock of the population there are limited opportunities for training and few formal sector firms invest in the training of their workforce Digital technologies may offer the chance to multiply the offerings of training on asic digital skills which are linked to their jobs Migration of high skilled workers with digital skills can dampen the efforts made by countries to increase the supply of workers with advanced and highly specialized digital skills African countries vary considerably in the levels of economic development as well as the size and maturity of the labor market Some countries with relatively underdeveloped labor market for advanced and highly specialized digital skills eg Lesotho face risks of their hi ghskilled worker with digital skills migrating to neighboring countries in search for market that can reward those with such skills South Africa While there are clear benefits of brain drains eg remittances the efforts made by countries to fost er digital skills may be dampened Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Adaptation of existing courses programs for basic digital skills is this feasible option Development of new curricula and digital content is expensive and time consuming In low capacity environments choice has to be made between development versus adaptation of existing curricula and resources However the costs and effort required for meaningful adaptation must not be underestimated as apart from technical capacity requirements issues related to copyright intellectual property and licensing costs must be considered For instance the provision of basic and intermediate digital skills could be based on the ICDL However change or extension of the ICDL program is not straight forward because the European omputer Driving Licence ECDL program is owned and controlled by the ECDL Foundation The Foundation could be approached to know on what terms is would consider collaboration with the Bank or other actors on developing new modulessubjects The last upd ate of the ECDL was in and adaptation could be included as part of the next update the date is not yet known It would be preferable to collaborate with the ECDL Foundation and its network of national partners on changing and extending the ICDL program The ICDL certificates seem to be widely recognized by private and public employers and the infrastructure for eaching and testing is well developed in several countries An alternative system would be costly to establish and to maintain and at least in the beginning it would not be known by employers Before the Bank teams up with the national ICDL system it ill however require an assessment of the capacity and credibility of the relevant national structures and partner organizations It would also be useful to undertake an independent evaluation of the de facto competences of the holders of the different lev els of ICDL certificates and of the reliability of the testing system This could be conducted by qualified research institute In general this would require regional approach as it would be expensive to conduct the exercise of adaptation on case by case basis Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and Intermediate Level The measurement of digital skills in the population is not done extensively in SSA and is still at nascent stage in most countries Difficulties of designing and administering the survey including access to devices posed considerable challenges Nevert heless systematic assessment based on an accepted framework is required Annex provides more details of the issues involved and Appendix Tables and indicate sample questions from surveys and aggregation of indicators by Eurostat Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Annex Indic ators and Scorecards for Digital Skills in the Digital Economy for Africa Initiative The DEA initiative proposes two high level indicators to assess progress Percentage of lower secondary schools with access to internet for pedagogical purposes target all lower secondary schools by Proportion of youth and adults with advanced digital skills target by The frameworks used in this paper the Digital Literacy Global Framework based on DigComp and the EU Competence fra meworks adapted to African contexts can be used to define different levels of digital skills Basic digital skills large proportion of young people are still out of lower secondary school especially in sub Saharan Africa but also in parts of North Africa and it would be logistically difficult to provide the same level of basic digital skills training to all out of school children many of whom will lack of foundational literacy and numeracy skills Further it is impossible to have one test that wi ll measure the performance of all children It is therefore better to consider two indicators for basic skills For children in lower secondary school Percentage of children in the terminal year of lower secondary education who acquire basic digital sk ills equivalent to Foundation Level in the DigComp Framework For current out ofschool children Percentage of children aged years who acquire basic digital skills equivalent to Foundation Level in the DigComp Framework Provided that all basic digital skills programs for these children are based on the DigComp Framework and assessments test this level of proficiency the completion of these programs could be treated as an indicator of acquisition of very basic digital sk ills For the former group it is better not to specify the age as children will be of varying ages due to repetition and late entry in primary and lower secondary Further due to the high failure rate in the lower secondary examinations it is prefe rable not to use completers but all those who are in the terminal year of the lower secondary cycle Integration of the basic digital skills program in the lower secondary curriculum and assessment based on this would allow collection of data on how ma ny students acquire basic digital skills Advanced digital skills ICT professions and occupations The purpose of this indicator is to identify how African countries are developing the capacity to drive the digital economy through ICT and ICT enabled industries and services Although it is desirable to assess the level of advanced digital skills in the workforce it is not feasible to do so It is feasible measure the new entrants into this workforce as represented by the number of graduates of undergraduate level programs in engineering computer science mathematics and physics Ideally the programs would be assessed against the EU Competence framewor proficiency levels and or related framework It would also include graduates of online blended and rapid skills training programs provided such programs can also be assessed against the same framework Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Annex Table High Level Scorecard PILL AR GOAL

cover only digital skills at basic and intermediate level since the advanced and highly specialized skills are typically measured through assessment and certification by the formal education provider university or online provider Currently measures of basic intermediate digital skills constitute small portion of large scale surveys intended to understand ICT usage levels or adult skills of popula tion The principal surveys are indicated in the following Annex able Survey questions assess digital skills in two ways The first method is based on self assessment by the respondent and is the most commonly used approach The second method is to use an indirect form of assessment by posing questions about the types applications that the respondent can use For example when an individual uses an application that is conceived to be difficult to use this is held to be an indication of high lev el of skills Deursen et al Sample questions from such indirect assessments can be found in Appendix Table The DigComp Framework is used to guide the identification of limited set of indicators for the purposes of measurement of digital ompetence within the EU and number of other countries for comparative purposes through an ICT survey about activities realized during the previous months within four domains information communication content creation and problem solving It is ass umed that persons having realized certain activities eg copying or moving file or folder or using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within document have the corresponding skills However as the data is self reported they are likely to be positively biased The Eurostat indicators are simple the indicators for all the domains are listed in Appendix Table At the overall level the digital skill indicator defines four levels of skills no low basic and above basic whereb No refers to individuals who answered none in all categories plus those who have not used the internet in the last months or who have never used the internet Low refers to individuals having one or more none in three domains Basic refers to individuals having one or more basic but no none Above basic refers to individuals with above basic in all four domains similar simple indicator for digital skills would be appropriate for measuring at the population level in Africa Such an indicator could be inspired by the indicators and aggregation methods used by Eurostat to measure digital skills However the indicators must be Africanized as some of them are more relevant to PC users in Europe than to users of smartphones in Afric eg copying or moving files or using formula within spreadsheet Most of the basic and intermediate digital skills programs listed above administer performance tests with the purpose of certifying the level of digital skills Examples of most com monly used certification programs include Microsoft Digital Literacy Standard Curriculum CISCO Networking Academy International Computer Driving Licence ICDL Internet and Computing Core Certification IC Digital Literacy Certification etc Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Annex Table Examples of large scale questionnaires

Revolution has set forth demands for new generation of the labor force with comprehensive set of skills to meet the standards of the global market Despite widespread concerns about educational reforms and renovations to enhance the workforce capacity in terms of information and communication technology ICT skills research into the digital prociencies of students has been limited in Vietnam This dataset contains observations on the digital competency level of thgrade students in surveyed schools from ve provinces in Vietnam The investigation joining frequentist and Bayesian analyses aims to provide valuable insights into the current state of childrens attitudes behaviors competency levels and use of ICT within the Vietnamese educational context The values of the dataset lie in its proposed scientic framework for replication in multiple regions and contexts equally well as the feasibility of categorical regression techniques together with Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression analysis Dataset The dataset is submitted and will be published as supplement to this paper Dataset License CCBY Keywords information technology ICT skills digital citizenship Bayesian statistics Vietnam Summary This manuscript introduces dataset Supplementary Materials of observations of students from senior high schools across ve provinces and cities in Vietnam The dataset was collected Data doi data journal dataData of as component of the Digital Kids Asia Pacic DKAP project that aimed to investigate school students information and communication technology ICT competency levels in AsiaPacic through four pilot countries Vietnam Bangladesh Fiji and the Republic of Korea The DKAP investigation implemented by the United Nations Educational Scientic and Cultural Organization UNESCO in Bangkok within the scope of the Fostering Digital Citizenship through Safe and Responsible Use of ICT Project seeks to establish concrete understanding of ICT use and competency levels of regional children by creating and verifying framework to gather quantitative data reecting their attitudes perceptions prociency and behavioral use of ICT in an educational setting The compiled data include information regarding respondents demographic and personal features such as gender ICT awareness and access socioeconomic status school and neighborhood living standards and their digital citizenship competencies The goal of this dataset is not only to describe students ICT cognitive and noncognitive skills but also to encompass thorough examination of the relationship between demographic cognitive behavioral sociocultural and contextual factors and the digital competencies of school students Utilizing both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches analyses of these data would shed light on possible predictive factors and the determinants of ICT prociency as an essential ability of future global citizens This research is particularly crucial to developing economies that rely heavily on technology transfer to boost technological progress and sustain longterm economic growth Research has conrmed the underlying signicance of human capital stock in secondary and tertiary levels of education as absorption capacity in facilitating technology transfer The ICT skills readiness of school students is even more critical for low and middleincome economies in the era of Industry which presents substantial challenges and opportunities In Vietnam as particular case study researchers have pointed out the increased risks for the middleincome trap where investment will recede due to the rising labor cost and poor laborsaving technology As Vietnam transits from traditional entrepreneurship to new computational entrepreneurship skill shortages are another problem facing the Southeast Asian country with the high pitched percentage of wage workers at risk due to automation in the region As of low skilled workers still took up to over onethird of the total labor force in the country despite growing demand for information technology IT workers by per year Alongside the possible disruption in growth rates and concerns over the weak human capital Vietnams cybersecurity is still vulnerable with fourfold increase of the number of cyberattacks and incidents within one year from to Vietnam only ranked out of countries in global cybersecurity index in Recognizing this peril of falling far behind in the age of digitalization the Vietnamese government has made an ort to improve skills education for youth especially technical education In addition to enhancing the competitiveness of the labor force digital competencies are also relevant to widespread concerns facing the global community such as cyberbullying youth suicide depression or behavioral disorders Therefore ndings from this dataset are expected to have signicant implications for the development and rating of management and capacitybuilding policies in the emerging country Within the scope of this text description of the dataset including the survey questionnaire potential research questions the research framework and our data collection procedure will be presented Examples of possible statistical model methods and analyses will also be provided Limitations and potential implications of the dataset will be discussed in the nal section of the paper

the pilot countries The Vietnam Institute of Educational Sciences VNIES became the focal point of the Ministry of Education and Training to carry out the project component in Vietnam VNIES signed the contract with UNESCO Hanoi to conduct the survey in September in ve provinces within the country The survey questionnaire of the project in Vietnam was translated into Vietnamese from the English version of the DKAP framework The dataset contains responses by yearold school students regarding their digital competencies The questionnaire consists of multiplechoice questions most of which require the respondents to choose one single answer out of the provided options while some of the questions ask for more than one answer Questions and answers were treated as discrete and continuous variables and encoded according to the coding instructions provided by UNESCO see the dataset The questions were divided into two groups group contextual questions and group digital competence questions Group contains items asking for students ICT experiences along with their demographic information Group contains items concerning students ICT competencies across ve di erent domains Group Personal Background Questions The question items in group cover three domains student personal background eight items access and usage of digital devices items and socioeconomic status SES seven items

research is theoretically based on Bronfenbrenners bioecological model which describes childs maturity in interactions with multiple levels of sociodemographic cultural and societal elements that constitute his or her community In particular the model proposes four layers of the environment with respective impact on childs cognitive growth As illustrated in Figure the innermost circle represents microsystem that contains the developing individual together with their personal and closest ties The next layer is mesosystem involving the interdependence of the microsystems with which the developing individual actively interacts eg the childs interrelationship between home and school environments This is accommodated in an ecosystem with contexts having indirect and distant ects on the developing child The outermost layer macrosystem encompasses systematic crosscultural compatibilities together with philosophies or ideologies that reinforce the structure Data of Figure Research

There were articles about using social media forassignments and exam preparation Pednekar experts wanting to include it in school curriculum Pednekar but positive or even more re ective stories are harder to come by Perhaps the older generation mirrors its struggles and anxieties of navigating through the complex web of social media on young people and their protective instinct comes to the foreChildren are considered vulnerable and in need of protectionacross almost all disciplines However young people engagement with digitalsocial media is very different fromthat of adults Children practices online have evolved differently because they are often described as digital natives Burn et al Of course the impact of the COVID related lockdown subsequent to March has shifted perspectives considerably in relation to some of thesedebates with focus returning once more in the populardiscourse to accessibility and digital literacy and sideliningconcerns around screen time and other related debates In this paper we share insights from indepth personal interviews with community leaders from civil society researchand advocacy as well as professionals working with young peoplein India that address important questions relating to medialiteracy social connectedness and digital citizenship in adigitalsocial world Digital society is conceptualized as being governed by datacation and platformisation asKatzenbach and Bchle discussed the work of Mejias and Couldry who de ned data cation as cultural logic of quanti cation and monetisation of human life through digital information

MEDIA LITERACY SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND DIGITALCITIZENSHIP Notwithstanding the recent efforts to expand the scope of media literacy scholarship much of the literature on children and mediahas focused on Western countries and on dominant groups Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiawithin the middle classes which some scholars have referred to as WEIRD families those in Western Educated IndustrializedRich and Democratic contexts Henrich et al Alper et al In Western democracies citizenship is often tied to behaviors such as voting campaigning volunteering petitioning and protecting individuals rights For instance Choi found that digital citizenship is conceptualized by scholars in four main ways in terms of ethicssafety as political orpersonalized participation the ability to evaluate informationand critical resistanceactivism Below we have discussed somekey themes in the existing literature on digital citizenship amongyouth including safety and privacy engagement andparticipation and the role of various stakeholders in differentlearning environments Safety and Privacy One way in which digital citizenship has been conceptualized hasbeen through the lens of safety and privacy Issues of ethics mutualrespect creating safe environment and digital rights andresponsibilities were central to such conceptualizationsMossberger et al Ohler Robb and Shellenbarger FrauMeigs et al Vlaanderen et al The discussion around risks and literacy has related mainly toidentifying different kinds of potential risks social media posefor children and youth and ways of mitigating them Early workhas also been about quelling fears regarding technopanics moral panics over contemporary technology and its risks to young users eg cyberporn and online predators and showing links between hyped media coverage and consequent content legislationCassell and Cramer Marwick The nuances of lived realities were often ignored but recent studies have attempted toaddress these for example in Livingstone and work by Staksrud and colleagues and more recent work has startedfocusing on strategies to help children minimize these risksLivingstone et al Desimpelaere et al Some of these discussions have also revolved around digital rights andresponsibilities including free expression respecting intellectual property digital etiquette and wellbeing and lawful use of online spaces Robb and Shellenbarger McDool et al Subrahmanyam et al Desimpelaere et al Concerns regarding safety including bullying shaming violence and sexting of young people on social media werealso important themes in the literature Safety online has to dowith the environment available to children and youth just as onewould expect safety at home in school or at mall Livingstone et al found that children encountered solicitation of sex porn violence bullying shaming etc online They categorizedthese items into three type of risks content related conduct related and contact related Ringrose et al found link between online and of ine lives with gender issues reported in sexting and shaming girls especially on social networking sitesSNSs Other contextual variables apart from gender were age existing emotional issues broader family context andparents familiarity with technology with reference to adolescents excessive internet use and parental mediation in Europe Kalmus et al Additionally Marwick and boyd described how drama operates in teens online lives andhow widespread use of social media among teenagers has altered dynamics of aggression and con ict Recent scholarship focused on cyberbullying and how children can intervene to help victimsas well as parents role in imparting digital skills Vlaanderen et al Livingstone et al related concern is that of privacy which centers around the control one exerts over the nature and amount of personalinformation that is shared on social media and howknowledge about protecting one privacy online can help children Lee Desimpelaere et al Youth are sharing more personal information on their pro les than in the past They choose private settings for Facebook but sharewith large networks of friends Most teen social media users saidthey aren very concerned about thirdparty access to their data Madden et al Marwick and boyd also noted that social media has changed the ways in which one practices visibility and information sharing and offered model ofnetworked privacy to explain how privacy is achieved innetworked publics Another more recent study reported thatyoung people did not see their online and of ine lives as different and there was relation between facetoface anddigital interactions and selfesteem Palfrey Subrahmanyam et al Participation and Social Connectedness Participation has been conceptualized as both political and civic participation as well as personal or cultural participation Work on uses including expression and presentation of social mediaby children dealt with selfexpression identity formation statusnegotiation and peertopeer sociality as observed by boyd Hogan described the splitting of self presentation into performances synchronously situated and artifacts asynchronously exhibited derived from Goffman work on dramaturgy Lenhart et al described teens use of social media for romantic purposes like irting wooing breakingup controllingabusing and sharing usuallyofine relationship online Participation was also analyzed from uses and grati cations perspective Dunne et al QuanHaase and Young Within the United States social connectedness and digital citizenship have been viewed largely through the lens ofparticipation creative expressions and popular culture Forinstance Jenkins argued for policy and educational interventions to address the participation gap in how young people access and use media to develop competencies andexperiences to more fully express themselves as engagedcultural citizens However other scholars have emphasizedthat it is essential to foreground ethical and social justice issues by reimagining media literacies and social connectedness through civic engagement and antioppressionliteracies Scharrer and Ramasubramanian Mihailidis Ramasubramanian and Darzabi Scholars also found association between social media use and children wellbeing While social media use was found to be strongly associated with social capital it was not directly linkedwith wellbeing Ellison et al Best et al Researchers have noted an absence of robust causal research regarding this Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiadirect impact However McDool et al used proxy data to point to potential adverse effects of increasing time spent onlineon children wellbeing Nonetheless given that increase in social capital enhanced adolescents selfesteem and in turn sense of wellbeing this perspective merits further research Valkenburg et al Holmes outlined opportunities provided by socialization online as it leads to increased socialcapital and support and fosters connectedness thus making itpossible for young people to have possible positive experiences in the future Work has also been done on using social media toengage with youth on health related matters Byron et al Evers et al Hswen et al Hausmann et al Coyne et al Swist et al and more recently Coyne et al acknowledged the link between children ss media use and their wellbeing In their exhaustive review Swist et al observed that social media impacts children physical and mental health identity and relationshipslearning and play and risk and safety among other aspectsand those positive and negative mpacts must be seen in context On the other hand Coyne et al in their eightyear longitudinal study based on the Flourishing Families Project atBrigham Young University United States revealed thatincreased time spent on social media was not associated withincreased mental health issues and implored research to movebeyond its focus on screen time This is especially relevant in thecontext of our pandemic world Factors In uencing Learning Environments Several external factors in uence how youth engage with social media For instance access to technology parental involvementschool curricula and sociopolitical factors in uence both formal and informal learning environments Using socialmedia to enhance education and learning especially onlineFriedman and Friedman addressing the digital divide differential levels of access to digital devices and networksas well as the capacity to use them in productive andmeaningful ways suggesting media education as bridge and the creation of third space as way to address the divide Burn et al and advising caution in dealing with the moral panic related to it Bennett et al were the ideas dealt with in this theme Other scholars have emphasized onthe need for formal education of students on the professionaluse design and implementation of social media systems Jacobs et al In the realm of parenting it was noticed that mothers were likely to give and receive support on social media and use it as aparenting tool Duggan et al Active parental involvement was detected when the child had experienced online harm Kalmus et al Parenting strategies re ected anxieties about online risks and inadvertently contributed to limitingchildren opportunities Tripp Clearly balance needs to be found between panicking about risks online andopportunities that digitalsocial world offers young people AEuroAmerican parenting perspective emphasizes independenceand autonomy and other evidence Ho et al Smetana points towards cultural differences in parenting styles and its impact on children behaviorParental mediation was key to in uencing children sb sa behaviors Gelman et al thus making the development of open communication and trust in parentchild relationshipssignicant to young people wellbeing Lee and Chae PadillaWalker et al This was true in case of media ranging from television to the Internet Livingstone and Helsper Clark and included approaches like modeling and couse Connell et al Harrison Parental mediation was often categorized into two broad stylesactive and restrictive Lee and Chae PadillaWalker and Coyne while accepting this categorization characterized it as prearming and cocooning respectively Theactiveprearming style was more conversational open and trustbased relationship between the parent and children grounded incommunication modeling and couse strategies whereas restrictivecocooning style was more about rules and restrictions set by parents for their children to protect them from onlineharms and risks Livingstone in her study with Helsper andmore recently in her work with BlumRoss that extensivelyused interviews with parents has described parental mediationas active restrictive and cousing Livingstone and Helsper and as embrace balance and resist Livingstone and BlumRoss Livingstone and BlumRoss also tended to associate the embrace and resist strategies as potentially riskyin the sense of planning towards the longterm digital futureof young people favoring balance in world fraught with uncertainty Beyond Media Literacy Perspectives From the Global North While literature reviewed thus far is important for understanding key themes and factors in uencing media literacy digital citizenship and social connectedness it draws almost entirelyon scholarship from the Global North The paucity in literaturefrom the Global South is only now being remedied In the case ofIndia the problem might be partially alleviated by decolonizing research and the way it is reported and by building more diverse networks of scholarship both amongst scholars from within theGlobal South and across regions Other researchers have arguedfor the need for global approach to media literacy scholarship ina digital context Mihailidis Byrne et al De Abreu et al De Abreu et al Despite acknowledgement of the need to diversify and internationalize media literacy scholarship most often it isdiscussed within the context of nonUnited States Westerncountries in the Global North rather than including countriesand contexts from other parts of the world Consequently there are productive and active collaborations across Europe fuelled partly by European Research Council grants and transAtlanticpartnerships In other words such internationalization efforts tomedia literacy scholarship often end up unintentionallyreinforcing Eurocentric notions of media literacy constructedand perceived through Western lens We need to widen thisview which situates media literacy as originating from theUnited States Canada and Britain to acknowledge multiplesociocultural locations from which knowledge about literacies Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaand media technologies have evolved and continue to evolve It is important to further complicate and challenge the dominantEurocentric narrative given the diverse nature of communitieseven in the geographic region that falls into the Global North due to historical and contemporary migrations Examining central issues in nonWestern contexts Mihailidis discovered that nding support for media literacy work among decisionmakers and policymakers is often challengeSeveral media literacy educators in the Global South continue todraw on curricula developed in United States and Europeancontexts and stemming from Western models of mediaeducation and certain cultural understanding of childhoodThese curricula tend to focus on democratic practice freedom ofexpression and advertising literacies which might not necessarilybe relevant in all contexts Additionally there are other challenges in terms of building collaborations across various sectors focusing on children and media such as government nonpro ts industry and education respondent from the Middle East interviewedby Mihailidis cited in his study said Media literacy is about more than just analyzing media messages and barrierto entry in the public school system is that there are manydifferent of cial bodies who believe they should have say in the implementation of media literacy curricula Ramasubramanian and YadlinSegal conducted interviews with scholars and educators from various youth andmedia contexts from around the world to bring to light cultural differences in de nitions practices resources and policymaking which need to be considered in media literacy scholarship Forinstance Livingstone and Bulger discussed crosscultural differences between how children in the Global North access theinternet mostly through computer whereas those from theGlobal South typically access it through mobile phones with asingle device often being shared among several members of afamily They pointed to barriers such as lack of access totechnology teacher training parental knowledge andculturallyrelevant or locally produced curricular materials inthe Global South Similarly team of researchers Byrne et al who examined crossnational data from Argentina Philippines Serbia and South Africa found that childrentypically accessed the internet at home using mobile phonesThey also found that children in South Africa and Philippinesengaged in fewer online practices and had lower level of digitalliteracy compared to those in Argentina and Serbia Within Asian contexts existing research focused on topics such as ICT adoption censorship cybersafety and more broadlyon protectionism Cheung Lee AlNajjar For example AlNajjar found that in the Middle Eastern context much of the discourse surrounding youth media use has focused narrowly on media risks with little attention paid to the role of digital media in the betterment of self and societyFrom conservative Singaporean context Yue et al called for more research on digital citizenship from the Global South Intheir focus group discussions with Singaporean youth they foundthat media literacy skills in uence negotiations of public opinions in ways that challenged mainstream ideologies Similarly amongyoung Indonesian Muslim women they found that issues of pietyreligious obedience and ethical entrepreneurship wereemphasized Patankar et al observed the critical need for digital literacy in country like India that is diverse in itspopulace and inequalities and described government efforts tomake rural India digitally literate Focusing on unemployed women in India Mukherjee et al examined the impact of these programs and their perceived value and found theyenabled rural women to get jobs in for example BPOs BusinessProcessing Outsourcing units Akram and Kumar offered broad view of the positive and negative effects of social media onsociety while Kumar and Rangaswamy drew on actor network theory to ip notions of piracy and viewing pirated content arguing that it fuels media consumption technologyadoption and digital literacy Examining Digital Citizenship and Social Connectedness Within Indian Contexts Media literacy and media literacy education in India began receiving government attention only in early withperceptible growth of the internet both as driver of theeconomy with focus on skills and capacities and as spacefor leisure activity and communication and perhaps mostimportantly in relation to children as vehicle forinformation and knowledge dissemination and the potential todemocratise access to education especially in the pandemic context The discussion on media and children therefore proceeds on two occasionally intersecting pathways one is education through media and the other is education about media bothproduction and consumption Our interest in this project is thelatter In this regard the National Curriculum Frameworkproposed in that education in India should be connectedwith knowledge to life outside school which led to theintroduction of course on media studies for secondarystudents The Central Institute of Educational Technologyhelped in creating Media Clubs in schools to promote medialiteracy in India in up to NCERT with further records being unavailable However their focus was on media production as students brought out school newspapers as part of the Media Club rather than critical engagement with media State level bodies implemented andexecuted such media literacy and education activities at lowerlevels These tend to include literacies about media as well asmedia used to develop multiple literacies thus confounding the two pathways mentioned above For instance the GujaratInstitute of Educational Technology Education DepartmentGovernment of Gujarat produced television programmers forteachers and children of years of age GIET on media literacy However it was found that programs were often broadcast during school hours when children could not watch although some schools scheduled time for viewing inschool and college for undergraduate students Govindaraju and Banerjee Different state and central boards of education in India also periodically share guidelines regarding social media usage atschool and to keep stakeholders noti ed of activities that are encouraged for children learning But there appears to be gap between research praxis and policy in manner that Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiacontextualizes existing knowledge and helps support young people and carers maximize the bene ts of this digitalsocial world even as we take into account nuances of the local Currentpolicies do not insist on evidencebased decisionmaking or draw on experiences and expectations of wide range of stakeholders and clearly young people voices are not driving them nor have they been expected to in what has largely been topdown nonparticipatory policy process Similarly media is quick to offerbasic parenting advice regarding children online practices without attention to speci circumstances sometimes forcing relationships between the latest fad and its adverse effects There is slowly emerging body of interdisciplinary literature that looks at the need to build critical skills among young peoplein India These skills will allow them to negotiate digitallymediated world in terms of relationships and political and cultural realities Bhatia and PathakShelat It will also help children unpack media representations Sreenivas their engagement with social media like YouTube and WhatsAppdeepens Sarwatay Examining attitudes towards advertising literacy among Indian tweens Trehan found low levels of comprehension of persuasive intentexaggeration and misinformation but high levels of celebrityrecognition visual literacy and gender divide in terms ofperceived sexual objecti cation of women in advertising As part of tencountry comparative study of youth and digitalmedia use Raman and Verghese observed that political and civic socialization of urban Indian youth was largely dependent on social media fact that was similar to their counterparts in most parts of the world Such scholarshipbeing guided by the vision of developing an inclusive andmulticultural mindset will thus ll out the idea of what it means to be an informed citizen The present study adds to the sparse literature on media literacy from the Global South especially in terms of the roleof policymakers such as educators nonpro leaders and community leaders It examines how they shape discoursesabout digital citizenship and social connectedness within the Indian youth and media context The uncertainties of the online world have led parents in India to depend on mediadiscourse digitalsocial media teachers local parentingexperts digital media experts and organizations working withchildren for advice on how to deal with young people experiences online Questions of access uses practices risksand opportunities are common but many parents lack accessto wellresearched answers Newspapers largely run storiesmotivated by technopanics there is generational digitaldivide and parents often do not model what theypreach especially when their mediation follows restrictive style They tend to believe that regulation of some kind is solution at the family level by restricting use or accepting onlycertain kinds of access at the societal level by depending onschoolsteachers or at the institutional level with governmentalbans or board guidelines While some parents and teachers cited media literacy as possible solution Sarwatay policy and implementation arelacking in this regard As children digital natives might navigatethrough these digitalsocial worlds differently than their eldersthere is confusion about the dos and don ts and while advice is available access to parental mediation and communicationstrategies in digital world is unequal As more of ourexistence is digitally data ed citizenship itself is being digitized but there are myriad issues of how this existence is structured and designed and how parents can guide young people and learn fromthem as they navigate through these worlds ideally together Thisis why it is important to examine the underlying systems thatenable young people and their parents in these online worlds Whathelps them dispel notions fuelled by technopanics Can regulationhelp What is the role of media literacy How can socialconnectedness lead to better communication and engagementbetween parents and children and reduce navigation confusionHow do we become digital citizens even as structures and designsare evolving and getting optimized METHODS In this project we take an ecosystembased approach tounderstanding digital citizenship and social connectedness inthe Indian context using series of indepth interviews with aselected group of stakeholders As literature reviewed in the previous section suggested informal and formal learning environments have shaped how youth engaged with digitalcitizenship how media literacies are practiced and how socialconnectedness emerged in various contexts Various types ofcontextual factors such as family environments school curriculasociopolitical climate and technological access in uenced how youth used media to connect learn and participate in creativepersonal political and civic activities Therefore it is importantto examine the role of stakeholders such as parents teacherssocial workers children advocates and others who shape the media environment for young people Several educational and research organizations as well as the media in India have shown interest in youth and social media andhave considered in varying levels of detail how parents and children navigate experiences online Speci research priorities have emerged in the Indian context and given the relativerecency of such research in the Global South most oftenquantitative methods like surveys questionnaires andstructured interviews have been employed the main target ofthese being teachers and parents However little attention hasbeen paid to other in uencers of youth and media spaces such as social workers industry experts and children advocacy groups all of which also in uence mesolevel and macrolevel policies and practices related to digital media literacy From the management of technology and innovation standpoint Tsujimoto et al one of the signi cant ecosystems perspectives is the multiactor network perspectiveThe actors are government universities consumers rms policymakers user communities etc and they deal with keyvariables like power regulation and knowledge among othersThis multiactor network is but one aspect of the wider ecosystemof connective media theorized by van Dijck that includes invisible technical dimensions of online platforms includingbusiness and commerce aspects as well as infrastructures that Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaenable and support online activities as well as social and democratic dimensions van Dijck et al Experts interviewed in this study are actors in this network ofconnective media who juggle key variables mentioned above toensure balance in business social and democratic dimensions ofthe ecosystem Interviews as method to map stakeholders andecosystems have been used across several elds Ginige et al Raum Prieto et al Woods et al and was thus the chosen method for this study as well There has been some thoughtful dialogue on issues relating to digital media and children digital lives however these discussions tend to happen in rare ed and often disparate spaces and have not yet begun to make dent on policy Thispaper attempts to understand how key stakeholders understandthese issues and what they see as key concerns based on theirdeep understanding of the culture and socioeconomic contexts inwhich Indian children live their varied lives Indepth personalinterviews were conducted from October to December preCOVID period in Ahmedabad Gujarat India withprofessionals working directly and indirectly with young people and their parents in India in both informal and formal learning

policypraxis research axes Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in IndiaThe main questions that guided the interviews were How do they frame and perceive issues related to young people media literacy social connectedness and digital citizenship What insights have they gained through working with parents and children In this paper we de ne media literacy as young people ability to safely access and use digitalsocial media for identity andrelationships learning and play and consumer and civicpractices Social connectedness is characterized as the sense ofbelonging between young people and their adult caregivers in adigitalsocial world Digital citizenship is closely tied to the twoconcepts above in the broader context of engaging with the society around them in digitalsocial world Local ecosystem mapping through interviews was conducted to better understand how these experts describe and examine thecurrent scenario in India The nine experts interviewed are brie described in Table with their relative positioning in Figure along the policypraxisresearch axes Pseudonyms have been usedto protect their identities These stakeholders are either directly or indirectly working with parents and young people schools and teachersinternational institutions and organizations to become part ofthe ecosystem of connective media through their practice research andor eventually policy and have their ear to the ground as to how young people and parents navigate digitalsocial media world They come from relatively privilegedsection of the Indian society to be in position to impactpolicy directly or indirectly within their local ecosystem whiletheir work covers people across the socioeconomic spectrumThese experts engaged with the rst author in semistructured interviews around the following topics New media speci cally the Internet digitalsocial media Children and media in the local context Understanding of existing systems media discourse around this topic Gaps in research advocacy policy and academia Informed consent was obtained from participants at the start and scanned copy of the form was sent to them after completionof the interview Interviews were recorded and transcribedInterviews were conducted in English with conversationsometimes slipping into Hindi or Gujarati An interestingmethodological sidenote is that an application was used totranscribe interviews instantly and while it performed fairly decently in English it had trouble recognizing the Indian accent in some places and failed to transcribe nonEnglishspoken words correctly We had to correct those parts bylistening to the recording and editing the mistakes out With theexception of two who were interviewed by phone and emailrespectively due to their strict preference all interviews took placeat their of ceshomes Interviews were scheduled after explaining the purpose with each lasting between min to All participantsremarked on the importance of the topic in current timesThe interviews began with broad questions aimed at drawing out their ideas about digitalsocial media and their understandingof the local children and media landscape Across participantsthere was common theme of children and adolescents being inundated by media messages the compounding effect of digital social media and increased importance of parenting in thesetimes to safeguard children rights This led to deeper dive into issues they outlined to elicit responses related to existing systemsperceived gaps media discourse and possible solutionsResponses to these questions varied re ecting their different locations The child psychologist focused on the importance of goal setting and communication those involved with social mediaspoke about couse and balanced consumption experts who dealtin cyber crime took cautionary stance and academic and research experts focused on the need for research and foregrounding children voices Many asked why this topic was chosen perhaps to place it in loop of the discoursesurrounding these issues Data from interviews wassupplemented with researchers observations background peripheral conversation with experts and eld notes suggesting Nearly all interviewees had children and brought some context from existing experiences or voiced concernsabout anticipated problems Solutions cited came from personal experience peer discussions events about digital parenting and other professional avenues Identi cation of relevance of this topic and gaps in research advocacy policy and academia stemmed fromreections above While guided by literature we did not approach data with preexisting themes and used an inductive approach allowingthemes to emerge from the data

interview thereby allowing the researcher to rectifyand add to the process and remain open to developing ideasfurther even seeking new directions and interpretationsBrenner Glesne rst order of themes from the interview data was extracted which was further consolidated into second order which were the basis of thissection Analysis was done and quotes were pulled frominterviews to give layered detailed context Issues of childcentereddesign dearth of knowledge about opportunities andrisks of social media among parents and confusion around howto navigate this digital world were some of the themes thatemerged as interpreted from the interview data Questionswere raised about children wellbeing including what parents could do about this the possibility of and the problems withregulation and the need to focus on how parents could foster Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiatrust and meaningful connection with young people that would frame their engagement with technology Main themes from the interview data are shown in Figure Respondents pointed to what they saw as problem areas such astechnopanics digital divide navigation confusion andtechnology design that was not childcentric but alsoindicated possible approaches to addressing these issuesthrough regulation improved parental engagement and moreopen communication with all stakeholders These were groupedinto three broad themes of media literacy social connectednessand digital citizenship roughly corresponding to the themes inthe global scholarship as outlined in an earlier section ofthis paper Some experts spoke from cautionary perspective while others focused on safeguarding young people interests ABC was vehemently against giving social media access to very youngchildren observing that handing over phones to toddlers as abehavioral incentive was bad idea She also opined thatteenagers are going through rough phase in life as it is andparents need to be extra careful when they observe behavioralchanges in their adolescent children possibly due to digitalsocialmedia DEF was big believer in cousing digitalsocial mediawith children as strategy to digital parenting While she or herchild had not faced cyber crime personally she was wary of coming across unpleasant or dangerous experiences and felt one needed to be prepared Many sessions she organized for hermothers club focused on this theme Her mantras were practice what you preach and precaution is better than cure and this reected throughout the interview GHI and JKL believed parents exert lot of control over children media diets especially younger children and they needed to be aware of the digitalsocial world to make the right decisions for their wards They hadidenti ed an acute lack of awareness about several issues likeprivacy safety tools to safeguard young people online and hence organizedparticipated in events aimed at parents to spread awareness and aid parental mediation regarding children technology use MNO and PQR had seen many cases of cyber crime and victimization They were aware of the level of ignorance related torisks in digitalsocial world They hold frequent workshops andtrainingcounseling sessions for young people victims or highrisk individuals or organizations like corporate and governmententities While STU work is not directly focused on the impact of social media on young people he works on children rights and capacity building which ties in with awareness and trainingVYW strongly believes young people attention span and sleep are adversely affected and this needs research attention When confronted with the argument that young people love to bingewatch she countered with the nuance of viewership vsengagement and how the latter is getting more super cial XYZ posited generational shift in media consumption andengagement patterns Young people are moving towards avisual medium of expression however many of them strugglewith communicating verbally he said He also mentioned lackof acknowledgment of personal responsibility for your actions onsocial media and opined how that might contribute to increasingcases of cyberbullying Based on these interviews and the researcher seld notes the average middleclass schoolgoing urbanbased young personwith access to digitalsocial media would have full day routine with school extracurricular and other activities in amedia rich and dense environment as follows Waking up in themorning as the radio is playing tinkering with the smartphoneusually mom and television

WhatsAppFaceTimingVideoCalling family and friends and usinglaptopcomputerinternetenabled televisionvoice assistant for education and entertainment Parents on the other hand oscillated between how much access should be given to young people in this digitalsocial worldand were occasionally swayed by media discourse ontechnopanics to limit usage leading to tensions in relationshipswith their wards This gets further complicated when parentscantdon twon practice what they preach and young people call them out on these contradictions Parents tend to perceivecomputerlaptop use as productive behaviour while televisionsmartphone use as unproductive behaviour leading todisagreements and disharmony sometimes leading to breakdown of trust and communication between the parent and child While the opening questions helped build context regarding the local realities speci questions as the interviews progressed helped identify the following themes Technopanics Digital Divide and Hypocrisy Issues of risks and literacy health and wellbeing safety includingbullying shaming violence and sexting and privacy were raisedby experts who work directly and indirectly with young peopleand parents schools organizations etc Lack of digitalsocial media literacy was cited as one of the reasons why most parents and some young people were concerned regarding their onlineuses practices and experiences Media discourse also added fueltore as coverage about social media addiction challenges like blue whale and momo Pednekar and safety and privacy issues were sensationalized However this is challenge that canbe met by inculcating media literacy and digitalsmart parentingwhich is an uphill climb because we are still battling technopanicsdigital divide and hypocrisy DEF was frank in her admissionwhen she said We held panel discussion recently on digital media parenting on what should be the role of parents in today digital media scenario how do we cut down on screen time But sometimes we act like hypocrites We ask themchildren not to use it and as parents we use it so it partof the panel focused on how to balance it screen time MNO had the strong opinion that privacy does not exist in dataed world This problem is compounded by lack of awareness regarding online safety among majority citizensPQR concurred when she opined that usually people becomeaware of risks when something untoward happens The new media forms are much more easily accessible than the other forms of media and they are up to date However we must also note that such media is also plagued by fake news non consensual images revenge porn contents etc This makes theyoung minds sometimes glued to such media because they mayhave never seen such things and due to adolescent curiosity theymay be more than willing to share such things in groups secretlywhich may increase the humiliation of the victims To this end recognizing the need for steering discourse the Central Board of Secondary Education CBSE national level board of education in India managed by the Union Governmentand implemented in several public and private schools throughout the country issued the Guidelines for Safe and Effective Use of Internet and Digital Technologies in Schoolsand School Buses including Tips to stay safe on social networking sites for students This serves as primer for ideal online behaviour and can guide parents regardingtechnology mediation at home as well Experts also insisted that parents need to set aside their reservations about the digital divide and not being techsavvyenough They have to be more digitallysocially clued in so theycould pass on literacy lessons to children PQR found patterns inlevels of awareness and corresponding styles of parenting indifferent regions of the country She reported my organization receives cases from all across India However Ican highlight patterns from three regionsTamil Nadu West Bengal and Gujarat speci cally Parenting style may differ as per the culture of the region experience seen that compared to Gujaratand West Bengal Tamil Nadu parents are more aware andstricter when it comes to using of internet and social media bychildren Parents may be busy and they may not be able to monitor children always Cyber safety issues still remain laggingbehind when it comes to comparing Southern Western andEastern regions Clearly given the diversity and breadth of India one may nd different trends in different regions She opined that awarenessregarding cyber victimization was higher in South India compared to West and East India as they seemed to only spring to action after crime has been committed Howeverit is important to note that preexisting notions regarding adults or children digitalsocial abilities in uenced by technopanics or digital divide will only exacerbate the problem at hand This getscompounded when parents give out and act on contradictory setsof norms for uses and practices online as children tend to followin the parents footsteps Navigation Confusion ABC was of the rm opinion that digital and social media technologies do more harm than good for especially young and impressionable minds that can be swayed by the glamourand glitz of online platforms if certain opportunitybasedperspective was not built into young people psyche She insisted It is our responsibility as parents and teachers to show the younger generation through our actions that theseare but tools you use in life after receiving due instruction in howto effectively utilize them for your bene becoming ideal digital citizens Reecting on her practice as child psychologist she gave the analogy of children being soft as clay and how we can mold them through our words and actions She gave the example of goal setting exercise and how it is important to ensure children forgeand follow certain path for themselves She added And that we cant just teach them this by talking about it we have to show it to them to avoid navigation confusion Digital and social media canwork for or against our children positive experiences depending on how we have shaped their perspective about it She elaborated how this works by citing phenomenon she has come across many times especially among teenagers Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiabecause they are in the phase where they want to show off They want to show that they are something have friends have boyfriends have done this as status symbol So for teenagers rmly believe that in their formative years if we get them into the habit of goal setting then social media can be of good use because then it will serve as positive in uence Like when they follow celebrities on social media they will focus onhow Virat Kohli cricketer became such great sportspersonwhat does Bill Gates businessman say about becomingsuccessful But if this connection between goal setting andhow social media is perceived and can be used for our bene has not been established then they teenagers get into the showoff mode where they try to put up show of that which doesn exist What she is saying can be tied to our existing understanding that technology is neither good nor bad and it depends on how we use it Opportunities and risks exist in digitalsocial world justlike they did before and we need tools like goal setting to utilizethe affordances to our advantage DEF agreed as she ruminatedabout sharenting parents sharing about kids lives and their photos and videos online as she goes back to issues of hypocrisy and lack of policies to protect children from online risks Sheinsisted that we are confusing children when we create socialmedia accounts for infants and then insist they shouldn use these platforms because they are bad for them She also attributeda lack of awareness among parents and young people about safely navigating online to making contradictory andor restrictive decisions She believed cybercrime is hard to faceConsequences of cybercrime also affect you mentally so we must know about online safety precautions Every school andcollege should have sessions on cybercrime She mentioned that while guidelines like the CBSE ones above are helpful we need more to spread awareness andhelp parental mediation of children technology use This is because parents in India can sometimes go from one extreme ofsharenting and making accounts for underage children to anotherextreme of announcing blanket bans for adolescents usually based on academic performance and feedback This can confuse young people and raise questions like How do we navigate in this socialmedia world What can be the consequences of navigationconfusion How can we stop negative consequences Thesewere also some of the questions raised by the stakeholdersThe next issue gives us more insight into the genesis of thisnavigation confusion Technology and ChildCentered Design Digital and social media are considered ideal platforms forconnection communication and community building However sometimes platforms can alienate people even as we have false sense of security from being on the application orwebsite as we take its bene ts for granted GHI shared how websites she creates for schools to keep parents clued in onattendance homework and performance of students sometimesfosters deeper disconnect while maintaining the illusion ofinformation richness This is where an emphasis on socialconnectedness becomes important Issues of technology andchildcentered design enable you to have access to sometimeslarge scale aggregated data but you miss out on nuances that are unique to an individual She shared there is no communication between the teacher and the parentsEverything is updated on the website or application in way technology does lessen the burden but there is no personal touch But it depends on the school as well have enrolled my daughterin school that uses technology like smart board WhatsAppgroups but also believes in personal connection andcommunication Navigating digitalsocial media world also depends on the intrinsic composition of the platform JKL who heads an onlinemarketing rm insisted that lack of childcentereddesign is to blame for risks faced by young people and added that low levels ofawareness among adults is also problematic He cited examples ofcyber crimes and cyberbullying and made his case by explaining Online safety is currently not taken too seriously until they become victims or someone closer to them becomes victimand at that time they surrender to the situation and say Oh should do that take precautions we are not kidsdriven societylike for eg nding restaurant that has kidfriendly food You only realize these things when you experience them GHI insisted that technology is only an enabler and it is our responsibility to lean toward or away from it to balance thecommunicative aspect of our relationship with and surroundingchildren She posited that there is threeway relationshipbetween parents children and teachersschools and this triad is mediated by technology and personal communication The child needs to be at the focal point of this triad and technologyshould help not harm while centering young people in amediated communication design Social media technologiesrespond to user behaviors their affordances can be shaped bydeliberate and informed patterns of use We can either createsilos and echo chambers or actively seek multiple perspectives tofoster understanding Regulation and Policymaking Media literacy is often cited as one of the solutions to risks that new media bring along with its bene ts However is it too much to ask of individuals to be aware of everything and itsrepercussions Should the industry selfregulate Should thegovernment bring legislative regulation VYW agreed that thisproblem needs industry and government involvement and addedIf we give free rein to corporate and media companies they do what they do and then every time something new comes out theindividual or parent has to constantly worry about what newimpact it will have on me or my kid But at the same time censorship and regulation will always be problematic right XYZ who is also part of think tank on digital media platforms asserted the importance of keeping discourse around digital and social media and its impact on society aliveand current He urged Its important to bring experts together to put forth their ideas and perspectives on how digital and socialmedia is impacting people health and mental wellbeing Young people are digital natives and we are witnessing generationalshift in the way these new media technologies are being used However experts pointed that young voices are distinctly absent in the policymaking process possibility in regulation Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiacould be evidencebased policy and decisionmaking where digital natives participate along with older generationsHowever currently there is massive gap between whathappens on ground vs legislation or even advocacy around these issues Illustrative in this regard are recent bans on TikTok and PUBG etc popular platforms which youngpeople used for identity creation selfexpression communitybuilding among others While current bans are for politicalreasons earlier bans due to sensationalist media stories werelater lifted only to be reinstated again Many young peopleespecially from marginalized backgrounds used these platformsand these decisions overlooked impact on said audiencesusers Social Connectedness and Engagement Social connectedness in digitalsocial world depends on our communication and engagement with and demonstration of it to our children ABC emphasized Social media is absolutely ne because that the world we live in where everything is digital and thats how it going to be and there is nothing to worry about But as parent or educator or school which direction do you showyour children towards Do they think social media is resourcefor learning or to show off DEF echoed the sentiment Parenting in digital and social media world is just like coin with two sidesthe internet has everything from porn totips on parenting It is up to us where we draw the line andchoose and tell our kids what is good and bad Kids are after all kids and we as parents need to control ourselves and check our behavior practice what we preach Some experts though thought social media for very young children was complete nono If social media was having badimpact on teenagers parents were encouraged to limitrescindaccess for older children too Nonetheless the quantity andquality of social connectedness depends on goal setting as youhelp create systematic template for children to follow They havea sense of direction and will most likely nd ways to optimize opportunities and disarm risks in this online experiencenavigating these social worlds without confusion and with condence ABC added Assigning speci responsibilities to and setting goals withfor your children ensures they use theirscreen time wisely And this needs to start at the young age of twoto twoandahalf years because this approach becomes the wayof life as your child becomes teenager This becomes easier to do when you share communicative and engaging relationship with your children DEF shared heard panel expert say we should always add coin front of everything we do with our kids like coplay cosleep coread inthe initial years because we cannot completely shun these new technologies and their exposure in today world How long will you not tell your kid not to use any of the gadgets when you yourself are using it for hours This brings an interesting dynamic to notions of trust and communication between parents and children Parents can bondwith children over the latest online or do things together likewatch movie This helps foster and strengthen socialconnectedness and engagement and is in line with parentalmediation techniques like balance Livingstone and BlumRoss where the parentchild relationship is about doing things together and in moderation Parental Involvement Practice What Preach The involvement of parents in children digitalsocial lives is crucial towards ensuring young people long term wellbeing healthy relationship must be based on communication and trustIt is important that parents practice what they preach andremember that young people have rights in this digital age justas in other spheres of life STU who heads an initiative forchildren rights reiterated Children need guidance regarding their online practices just as they need guidance in educationsports career and life this is their right and digital citizenship is becoming an essential in our everchanging world VYW recounted that ordinary people use media positively ie using media to enhance life getting new friends getting new knowledge making you aware of something that enrichesyour life making you feel valued as citizen all of these thingsenhance lifeit not unimportant just because it on new media She added that parentchild communication can foster discipline and moderation in use chalk up multiple optionsfor activities and ensure certain minimum hours of sleep foreveryone as essential something that people are missing out on these days Parents and young people could navigate social world better by understanding how media literacy socialconnectedness and digital citizenship can help them with better sense of links between policy governance and regulation Social connectedness and engagement with young people Practicing what they preach There could be many social factors along with emergence of digital and social media contributing to trends in children uses practices and experiences online Additionally as PQR noted parenting styles may differ as per the regional culture and giventhe world we live in MNO reiterated digital parenting as the needof the hour We need to understand why and how young peopleuse social media to express and present themselves and focus onopportunities like education and learning to make the best use ofthese platforms DISCUSSION range of issues such as lack of childcentereddesign dearth ofknowledge about opportunities and risks of social media andconfusion about navigating this digitalsocial world emergedfrom thematic analysis Based on these insights we offerways to think about children wellbeing how adult caregivers can maximize children wellbeing the possibility of and problems with regulation and recommendations for parents tofoster trust and meaningful connection with young people to Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaframe their engagement with technology while pointing to research gaps and directions for future scholarship in India In most conceptions of society children are considered group that is vulnerable and in need of protection This responsibility to protect and care is placed by society largely on the shoulders of parents and other adults like teacherscaregivers etc and more broadly on the institutions that playa role in children growth and development Children have from their very inception been treated as special group by lawacademia and the market and in this regard media studiesare no exception As our review indicated scholarship hasbeen equivocal and often polarized regarding children media especially digitalsocial media access usage and its moderatingrole in identity formation and social interactions and morerecently on how children develop civic cultural and political ideas and notions of citizenship Nolas et al Concerns articulated in research and policy circles about children literacies rights and parental cautions about appropriate andproductive media useparticipation have also been re ected in mainstream media discourse In regard to the rst concern articulated in this paper of identifying research priorities speci to the Indian context these conversations offer some direction that research could take toinform developing digital media literacy programmers thataddress the fears anxieties hopes and everyday realities ofIndian families As some of the informants in this study have suggested this has led to multipronged yet somewhat uncoordinated response to managing anxieties and promisesof digital media in relation to children in the Indian contextAcross all the themes that emerged well conceived medialiteracy effort was seen as pivotal to mitigating risks andfacilitating positive relationship with media for youngpeople It is interesting that parents too are seen as importantparticipants in such literacy efforts both as targets of critical media literacy programs and as facilitators This may beparticularly important in the Indian context as parents experiences with media both digital and predigital vary widely depending on socioeconomic and cultural milieu This brings us to the second research question we set out to address how can such media literacy programmers address thenuanced needs of local cultures while working with existingoften civic literacy gaps There is also an important but in these conversations less perceptible shift from the language of responsibility to that of rights and participation In such aframework in the context of India communication rights arerealized through media literacy where children discover or are sensitized to issues of representation and participation in digitaland other media through deliberately thought out literacy programmers designed bearing in mind the very diverse contexts that Indian children occupy Shakuntala Banaji work for instance brings into conversation historical ideasabout children and childhood in India with everyday livedexperiences of children from the margins drawing from this the understanding that intervention for and about children mustinvolve children voices and recognition of their agency Banaji This perhaps is one way to respond to concerns expressed by some of the stakeholders around the topdown approach totechnology design as well as the relatively little effort put into actually involving children in conversations around theirmediatedmedia lives Such conversations of course cannotignore the fundamental truth about India that as is the case in other diverse cultures there is no one group of children that represents the whole and that even as we think about policybroadly there must be room for multiple local variations inapplication In recent years some multilateral agencies such as UNICEF and UNESCO have attempted to de ne and advocate for children rights drawing on researchbased inputs from activists and academics taking forward to some extent media literacy movement that emerged in the wake of thespread of television In most of these projects there has beenrecognition that children occupy complex worlds and shared understanding of these diverse realities based on rigorous research must inform policy and programmatic interventionsThese have engendered partnerships between developmentagencies and academics with slowly increasingrepresentation from the Global South The Global Kids Onlineproject initiated by UNICEF the London School of Economicsand Political Science for instance while starting off with aEurocentric focus has now broadened to include network ofresearchers from countries India among them Theinterdisciplinary and international nature of such networksholds promise for widening of the lens that informs policy in areas such as education and technology development both key to realizing any media literacy agenda However what seems to bemissing is the link with the state institutions that allow forinterventional ideas to be supported at scale in sustainable ways But no matter where one looks it is dif cult to escape the ambivalence that pervades thinking in the area of children andmedia and the usefulness of media literacy efforts in the face of arapidly changing increasingly interconnected world wherechildren and the adults in their lives seem to have to continually recalibrate their ways of being learning andrelating While some hail social media developments as opportunities for children to learn and grow others fear risks of exposure to world we do not fully know and understandLivingstone and Helsper There is also the fear of the older generation parents teachers etc of being left behind due totheir lack of understanding and ability of maneuvering thesemedia as compared to the younger generation which is identi ed asdigital natives Burn et al Some also question the skills of these natives in navigating the complicated world of socialmedia Hence the emergence of literature aroundliteracy ranging from information literacy to media literacy and digital literacy to social media literacy to enable children and parents to skillfully and safely engage with this virtual environment Buckingham Bennett et al Livingstone All these questions acquire different nuances and meanings in different cultures and in India asperhaps in other transitional societies they must be consideredagainst range of social political and economic issues In thedeeply paternalistic and patriarchal family structures forinstance how might children autonomy and parental engagement operate How might social metier use or device Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiaownership and control vary across demographic categories What in fact might social connectedness or digital citizenshipfor children mean in context where even adults nd themselves multiply disadvantaged and disenfranchised How does media literacy then work alongside other urgently required literacies to empower children and facilitate their growth There is no doubt that there is rich and rapidly growing body of scholarship on children engagement with digital technologies and many convincing arguments for robustmedia literacy programs While opinions will always range andoften fall into sharply divided buckets together they open upquestions for future research some of which are alluded to aboveAs noted earlier much of the work that is currently drawn uponby researchers educators and policy makers and cited hereoriginates from the United States and United Kingdom to lesser extent Europe and Australia In this review there was one study from Saudi Arabia one on Latino immigrants with fewfeaturing sections on Asian countries like China and India In theIndian context the authors could only nd limited industry research on this topic from organizations like ASSOCHAMTCS etc some academic research done by students which cameto the foreground because of localregional newspaper coverageand spot of mainstream media work circling around sensationalstories like underage use social media crises such as the BlueWhale game and the more recent BoisLockerRoom incidentand tips to parents While issues related to digital media use and practice comes into public attention during such incidents there has been little sustained scholarly engagement that spans thespectrum from educators to media scholars to policy makers toprogram implementers the full complement of perspectives and disciplinary knowledge that may be required to make medialiteracy in the country an evidence based project In terms of methodology the larger research projects currently underway in India are modeled on or directed largely by Westernframeworks including the Global Kids Online project which of course offers room for cultural contextualization Deeperethnographic engagements that allow for contextualized understanding of children media practices and qualitative interviews with teachers and parents would help build morerobust evidence base that can inform policy It may be worthwhileto think back on efforts such as Newspapers in Educationprograms that were led by the media industry recognizingtheir need to build consumer base among younger readersand understand how they also served as media literacy efforts soas to gain some sense of what might work today and with whatkinds of partners industry the state educational institutions and parents After all digital media are here to stay and whetherwe like it or not we need to make productive use of them as tools as environments or as interfaces Despite the considerable technopanic generated around the negative aspects of socialdigital media like violence bullyinghate addiction and privacy there are also positives including thepossibility of agentic self representation productive interactionsand rich relational experiences increased access to education andlearning opportunities and even employment We need moreresearch that looks at the differential ways in which mediapenetration and access might affect children opportunities inthis regard and how media literacy could be way to mitigate some of these issues There is also need to consider such issues asyoung people understanding of ethics in the digital world their adoption of and thoughts about technologies like virtual reality augmented reality and arti cial intelligence and how they use their networked self to cross over into adulthood again all within the cultural contexts of India For instance how might we understandethical decisionmaking within the framework of religiouscommunity What forms does bullying take online wherestudents of diverse backgrounds might be interacting and can the lessons from racebased discrimination stand in for castebased discrimination in India How can children activate theiragency through and with digital media The example of UNICEF Children as Media Producers CAMP suggests that children even in resource poor contexts can engage with media technology when given chance and when equipped with the right tools of critical literacy But to build such media literacyprograms one requires the understanding gained from robustresearch using methods that are appropriate to particularcontext and the participants who occupy it All these issues have gained new salience in the global experience of the COVID pandemic and its widerangingimpact on social life particularly on children education As briey alluded to earlier this has brought in new urgency to the issue of digitalsocial media literacy for both children andcaregivers It also forces us to recognize and address in literacy programs the complexities introduced when children need to learn online where parental involvement takes on completelynew texture and the granularities of lived context accessconnectivity space familial structures and responsibilitiesdetermine the ways in which young people relate not only tothe digital but also to life in general The informants in this study offered media literacy as broad umbrella approach that could address most of the issues that theythemselves identi ed as problematic in relation to children engagement with digital media But they could point to almostno locally generated knowledge that could undergird culture centered approach to media literacy This then becomes an area that is ripe for exploration by young scholars in not only mediaand communication but also education child developmentsociology and social policy studies In other contexts scholarshave called out the need to decolonize digital culture studiesRisam Arora it is important that we begin this process in relation to media literacy studies as well Given thatmedia literacy is second order research area dependent on diverse bodies of knowledge including those mentionedpreviously this would mean that we need to develop creativecollaborations across disciplines and engage not only in extensive primary research but also actively dialogue across subject borders LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION This paper is starting point for more dialogue and support rst for developing culturecentered approach to understanding coreissues developing argumentation taking into account multiplesocioeconomic realities and ultimately for using media literacy Frontiers in Human Dynamics March Volume Article Sarwatay et al Media Literacy in Indiafor active engagement and participation by youth in pluralistic nonWestern democratic context We acknowledge that majorlimitation of this study is its dependence on narrow range ofstakeholders which gives us only slight avor of the range of opinions and experiences that could inform further research The larger project this data is from will also bring in additionalinsights from indepth interviews with children themselvesparents and educators Nevertheless while stakeholderparticipants interviewed were privileged in many ways theirwork spread across the socioeconomic spectrum which meansthat their views are certainly informed by sensitivity to largerIndian contexts Policy formulation in this area and more importantly implementation needs to take exible approach that is sensitive to multiple lived realities of children across India Certainly contextual factors like age gender family background education income and ruralurban location feedinto these differences But this is both the challenge and value ofqualitative research that while drawing out broad themes likely to resonate across situations there is acknowledgment ofvariations therein Another limitation is digital learning and social connectedness have been greatly affected in the pandemicrelated lockdownWhile this study was conducted preCOVID future researchmust consider how these relationships affect young people andmedia literacy in India in the context of virtual learning working from home and greater social isolation during the pandemic Further research using culturecentered approaches to medialiteracy and digital citizenship are needed within the GlobalSouth including in India Additionally as this study revealsbeyond youth and parents conducting research on otherstakeholders who shape media and educational policies areimportant to consider within media literacy scholarship inorder to fully understand

University of Machala Machala Ecuador Correspondence Received October Accepted November Published November gidgidgidgidgidgidgidgidgid gid gidgidgidgidgidgidgid Abstract Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in the st Century in professional and personal lives The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID pandemic educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes The aim of this research is to present comparative study of three countries higher education institutions Spain Italy and Ecuador analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation focusing on the development of digital literacy The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratorycorrelational scope using questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in sample of students Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teachers digital skills sources for learning that may be adapted communication between university and students and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation mainly communication teaching and digital competences Otherwise digital literacy is not being guaranteed which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives Keywords digital literacy COVID generation students lockdown higher education communication Introduction The development of the knowledge society implies social transformation in which citizens need new skills and competencies On the one hand technological availability has motivated worldclass universities to develop innovative programs and new ideas to accelerate and improve both teaching and learning On the other as JonasDwyer and Pospisil observe even if the technological revolution has been catalyst for change in universities research has shown that introducing new educational technologies alone does not improve teaching and learning outcomes if they are not accompanied by specific training Therefore in context of development and expansion of an increasingly digital society training in competencies within the scope of digital literacy of higher education students should be essential nonetheless it is often viewed as something that is often taken for granted In Poores words today more than ever we have the opportunity and the technologies to assist us in the human project of shaping creating authoring and developing ourselves however we will not be able to achieve liberating collective intelligence until we can achieve collective digital literacy Publications doi publications journal publicationsPublications of Aligning with rezTorneros holistic approach understanding media literacy as concept embracing all the elds and all the competences related to media digital literacy is understood as the acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies understood in broad sense in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society Digital literacy may be understood as an interrelated set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age developed and evolved in di erent dimensions address in models acknowledge by countries and governments Within the context of the COVID crisis this has become even more evident The World Health Organization WHO declared COVID as global public health emergency of international concern on th January as well as pandemic on th March As of th April UNESCO reported that there have been affected learners out of total enrolled learners in countries in all levels of learning Exactly as in many other aspects of everyday life COVID had serious impact on students instructors and educational organizations around the globe the pandemic caused schools colleges and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses and quickly move conventional education to distance and virtual learning Current educational circumstances are so unique that some authors accurately propose to define this new situation crisis learning Due to this uniqueness and exceptionality of past and current circumstances many studies are emerging on the impact of COVID restriction measures in different educational levels and different contexts Most of these studies focus either on specific countries or on specific aspects such as technical aspects of elearning or psychological impact or communicative perspectives The onlyby the timeglobal study developed by Crawford and colleagues analyzing twenty countries educational responses concludes that the educational sector needs to unite to postulate future where students can be supported digitally without compromising academic quality and standards of the curriculum The aim of this research is to present comparative study of three countries higher education institutions Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain University of Torino in Italy and Technical University of Machala in Ecuador analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation focusing on the development of digital literacy Generation and the Digital Native Debate Although there is no absolute consensus about the precise boundaries of Generation most literature considers that it is composed of individuals born between the years and Their most important characteristic is that they are the rst generation that has never known world without the Internet Their lives are molded by the Internet which has been converted in natural part of their lives Prensky denes this cohort as digital natives implying that having been exposed to these digital technologies has endowed this generation with specic and even unique characteristics that make its members completely di erent from those growing up in previous generations Ters Myllyla and Ters consider that having grown up with highly sophisticated media they are naturally more Internet savvy than their forbearers displaying natural skills of digital native learners Veen and Vrakking in the same line propose to call this generation homo zappiens considering that this cohort have developed all the metacognitive skills necessary for enquirybased learning discoverybased learning networked learning experiential learning collaborative learning active learning selforganization and selfregulation problem solving by themselves According to this vision Generation students currently attending school or university are therefore considered experts in understanding technology socially open through the use of technology fast and impatient and interactive and resilient multitaskers Some research suggests that Generation Zers brains are structurally di erent to those of previous generations surrounded by complex visual imagery the part of their brain responsible for visual ability is more developed making them more reactive to visual learning but with shortened attention spanPublications of Accordingly there is growing agreement that there is gap between higher education and st century skills and that educational institutions should adapt their methodologies Both the concept itself and the description of the so called digital natives have been criticized lacking any empirical evidence or substantive characteristics Kirschner and De Bruyckere for example harshly criticize this denition comparing digital natives to Yetilike creatures myth someone that everyone talks about but that nobody has ever seen study carried out by Romero Guitert Sangr and Bullen comparing students of di erent ages for example found that older students years and thus born before who exhibited the characteristics attributed to digital natives more than their younger counterparts In their research of their students older than showed the characteristics of the so called digital natives more than their younger counterparts In terms of learning environment study from the University of Barcelona concludes that the digital native label does not provide evidence of better use of technology rather that technology use is mainly inuenced by the teaching model Consequently in research on rstyear undergraduate students at Hong Kong University Kennedy and Fox found that while students appear to use large quantity and variety of technologies for personal empowerment and entertainment they do always appear digitally literate in using technology to support their learning This is particularly evident when it comes to student use of technology as consumers of content rather than creators of content specically for academic purposes Adding to this Shatto and Erwin consider that Gen students ability to obtain information from online sources seems impressive but they lack the ability to critique the validity of the information and are likely to get frustrated if answers are not clear immediately Thus keeping the attention of the student and developing higher order thinking skills are critical components of successful teaching In other words many students entering university today have high level of exposure to digital technologies and media but they do not seem prepared to cross the bridge between personal and academic use of technology Therefore as academic knowhow is gained through formal education so too must technological prowess be gained through structured learning experiences For this reason it is vital that higher education institutions promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users with the generation of new competencies Digital Literacy As previously mentioned there is growing agreement that there is gap between higher education and st century skills and that educational institutions should adapt their methodology promoting explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users with the generation of new competencies Accordingly even though digital literacy has been one of those key concepts whose relevancy and weight as key element for digital citizenship have shifted from being recommended to essential the concept itself of digital literacy is not standardized its scope is broad and has been researched from dierent elds The most common approaches so far have been those of media studies educational studies computer science information science and librarianship Due to this the understanding of this competence can be diverse On the one hand the different understanding of digital literacy responds to the interests and scope of each era of literacy Therefore emerging at the end of the twentieth century with the spread of ICT Information and Communications Technology the term mainly referred to computer literacy that is to say to technological skills while with the growing of the knowledge society has highlighted that digital literacy should be understood as an interrelated set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age In particular the socalled critical approach has been growing mainly with the spread of media literacy studiesPublications of This approach highlights critical thinking as one of the fundamental aspects Aligning with PrezTorneros holistic approach understanding media literacy as concept embracing all the elds and all the competences related to media we understand digital literacy as the acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies understood in broad sense in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society Within this framework it is important to recognize that since there is no unifying denition of digital literacy many models and implementation are possible Accordingly we will examine our result within the respective reference framework Digital Literacy Development Models The development of digital literacy in Europe is based in both Spain and Italy on the DigCompEdu reference framework in which six dimensions are established that teachers must promote for the development of adequate digital literacy with series of subdimensions as shown below Dimension Professional engagement integrating organizational communication professional collaboration reective practice and digital continuous professional development Dimension Digital Sources resources including the following subdimensions selecting creating and modifying and managing protecting and sharing Dimension Teaching and learning teaching guidance collaborative learning selfregulated learning Dimension Assessment within assessment strategies analyzing evidence and feedback and planning Dimension Empowering learners embracing accessibility and inclusion di erentiation and personalization and actively engaging learners Dimension Facilitating learners digital competence which includes ve subdimensions information and media literacy communication content creation responsible use and problem solving In the context of Ecuador Digital Agenda establishes dimensions for the promotion of digital literacy Dimension Hardware which includes two subdimensions connectivity and equipment Dimension Digital learning including the following subdimensions curriculum learning methodologies content and digital sources Dimension Teachers development long life learning preservice teachers education and professionalization developing digital competences Dimension Communication and promotion focusing on visualization engaging and empowering and web content Dimension Innovation related with developing new skills and competences for teachers and learners The establishment of reference frameworks for the development of digital literacy in both contexts is very similar as can be seen in their description and they are the fruit of collective awareness of the need to develop new literacy according to the context of society of the information In addition its international recognition has implied an ort in recent years from organizations institutions and governments so that this change was being put into practice The objective of the work presented here is to carry out specic temporal approximation during the quarantine time for COVID MarchApril with study of the perception of university students to verify whether during this period of global connement has sought the development of dimensions that guarantee the acquisition of digital literacy To ensure greater signicance of the results the study was applied to three countries Spain Italy and Ecuador with high incidence of COVIDPublications of Materials and Methods From the study of the reference frameworks for digital literacy in the three contexts studied Spain Italy and Ecuador the study dimensions associated with the variables that would later be included in the design of the questionnaire were designed based on the DigCompEdu and the Digital Agenda Thus the study dimensions were established as follows Dimension Teachers professional engagement and collaboration it is related to professional engagement the capability to integrate organizational communication professional collaboration and ective practice and development Dimension Digital learning and sources this dimension is meant to be rethinking of conventional sources of learning complementing the development of other dimensions It includes the necessity for citizens to be aware of how to responsibly use access and manage digital content Dimension Teaching and teachers guidance and skills Learning strategies will denitely develop an appropriate digital literacy by designing planning and implanting in the di erent stages of learning digital tools and technologies Dimension Supporting empowering students having in mind this is dimension related to the development of digital literacy it will ensure not only access to digital learning resources and activities but empowering learners and fostering their digital competences These dimensions conducted to the denition of several variables of study for the design of the questionnaire The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratorydescriptive scope using three independent socio demographical variables of study gender age and country and dependent variables distributed for the analysis of each dimension as follows Teachers professional engagement and collaboration with four variables Digital learning and sources including six variables Teaching and teachers guidance and skills integrating ve di erent variables and Supporting empowering students with ve variables The dimensions and variables dened allow us to specify the purpose of the study drawing the following research questions RQ During lockdown do teachers from the university show professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation RQ What kind of sources have teachers used during the lockdown RQ Did teachers use new learning methodologies to guarantee quality in teaching RQ What was the perception of students about their teachers digital competences RQ Did students perceive negative aspects in the teaching lessons during lockdown RQ Did students feel their education was damaged because of this situation RQ Did students feel they had enough digital competence level to face the situation In the ndings of all research questions the analysis and results will er or not di erences among countries Based on this research questions the following objectives were addressed rst describe the situation in three countries studied focusing on the four dimensions designed related to digital literacy and secondly nd out if there were signicant di erences among the three groups studied In order to reach the second objective the hypothesis established were as follows Null Hypothesis There were no di erences among countries in the research questions dened Alternative Hypothesis HA There were di erences among countries in the research questions dened This descriptive research applied comparative study between Spain Italy and Ecuador on the specic dimensions consumption of devices and content during the global health crisis of COVID during the months of MarchMay The methodological proposal was designed from an exploratory perspective and applied the survey instrument which reached responses from university students from Spain Ecuador and Italy In total the study collected pieces of evidence from the three countriesPublications of Sample The invited sample conceived as the set of elements of the population that are asked to participate in the investigation corresponds to undergraduate students of Communication Journalism and Education The study was composed of students aged between and years old SD As shown in Mesa the description of the sample was in Spain the participation represents of the sample whose ages range from to years The students from Italy were the whose ages average between and years In the case of Ecuador aged between and years Table Description of the sample according to age gender and country Spain Italy Ecuador Total Gender Male Female Age The research was based on intentional sampling in the selection of the three participating universities In this type of sampling the subjects subjected to analysis and study are chosen by the researcher to be part of the sample with specific objective as they are considered adequate or suitable for the investigation Three universities from different sociogeographical settings were selected which received strong impact from COVID generating significant numbers of affected and deceased in their territorial environment In this regard the institutions that made up the study were Autonomous University of Barcelona Spain participating with students of the degree of Journalism University of Torino Italy with the participation of students of the degree of Education and Technical University of Machala Ecuador that participated in the study with students of the Communication degree Instrument and Procedure The design of the instrument was carried out with the objective of describing the observed situation and exploratory analysis of the research questions raised in order to analyze the established dimensions and find if there were differences among the three groups studied Spain Italy and Ecuador In the first phase the instrument was submitted to the judgment of experts six in total academics from the study area two in each country in order to establish clarity and relevance to the items This first step discarded total of items for being redundant or imprecise and allowed six of them to be reformulated For the analysis of the reliability of the instrument from the statistical point of view Cronbachs Alpha was carried out for each dimension of the study all values being above The instrument was designed with Google Forms tool and prior to its completion each participants permission was requested It is important to note that before the data gathering researchers assured the ethical issues in each university were addressed None of the three universities involved required authorization from the ethics committee due the nature of the study only the express participants permission The final instrument consisted of independent variables that collected sociodemographic information and of dependent variables total of thirtyone as can be read in Appendix Table Dichotomous type questions were chosen because of the nature of information the researchers intended to gather The dichotomous question format is used when the issue under consideration most likely is thought of in two possible values Statistical analysis of data was made with package SPSS version descriptive and inferential analysis was addressed In order to check the equality of variances Levenes test was applied which is proper for two or more groups obtaining pvalue below Results confirm there was no normality in the distribution of variables so non parametrical statistics were required in our study The study was conducted in two steps in order to reach objectives designed in the four dimensions firstly with basic statistics frequencies and chisquare test and secondlyPublications of to determine the strengths of associations after chisquare we observed Cramers the suitable measurement in nominal variables in order to reject or accept null hypothesis showing which groups are different or where the groups differ Accordingly Norris et al and the interpretation for effect size ES in Social Science in Cramers Vshould be considered as follows ES weak strong Results In order to establish clear explanation of results they are presented as the following in the dimensions designed responding in each case to the research questions involved Dimension Teachers Professional Engagement and Collaboration Results for the rst dimension were addressed in two steps as previously explained Firstly basic statics such as frequencies and chisquare for signicance where analyzed in order to extract dierences among countries as can be seen in Table In this regard students where asked in four dichotomous nominal variables Table Dierences among

the second dimension it is worth noting that students were asked ten items to check issues related to digital learning and sources during this period in which learning was mediated trough Internet From to items see Table they were asked about what kind of sources did teachers use during the lockdown and from to see Table what sources did they prefer for their lessons As seen in Table some items present di erences statistically signicant among countries which means we could reject null hypothesis it is worth noting that in the item videos and audiovisuals as the preferred sources for learning

communication and critical thinking have been related evolving all together in the multidimensional concept of digital literacy Already two decades since not only the international community strives to develop this digital literacy through education Publications of but also all countries and governments around the world education should ensure digital literacy whatever modality it acquires The aim of this research was to present comparativedescriptive study analyzing how high education in three di erent countries has faced the global lockdown situation in terms of ensuring the development of digital literacy Having in mind the unusual situation caused by COVID seems to be disruption for education that will obligate countries and governments to rethink educational systems it really makes sense to analyze what has happed during the lockdown situation in order to face future decisions with empirical information In this regard it could be said that one of the limitations of this study is that it only analyzed three countries future pathways could amplify the research area in order to study the impact of this situation in wider perspective In line with previous and recent research this study presents an overview of the development of digital literacy in three di erent contexts Spain Italy and Ecuador The novelty in this case is that research is framed in the global lockdown caused by COVID allowing us to make interesting conclusions for the near future in which the pandemic situation still ects education and global health Dimensions dened and analyzed support ndings and results in line with main frameworks dening digital literacy In this regard we could highlight the following conclusions from results obtained In first place and regarding dimension one studied Teachers professional engagement and collaboration related to the capability to integrate organizational communication professional collaboration and effective practice and development results make us conclude that significant differences exist among the three countries studied For Spanish and Italian students teachers have not been well coordinated in this situation they felt they were not properly informed and declare receiving contradictory information Nonetheless all samples Spanish Italian and Ecuadorian students felt they were not supported enough with statistically significant differences between Spain and Italy and Spain and Ecuador Spanish students were the most disappointed in this regard This evidence should be interpreted taking into account that in March the Italian government announced it would equip schools with digital platforms and tools for distance learning lend digital devices to less welloff students and train school staff in methodologies and techniques for distance learning Significant differences are shown as well among countries in the case of receiving contradictory information Spanish and Italian students declared points and points above Ecuadorian students About dimension two Digital learning and sources analyzed it can be concluded that digital sources used during the lockdown by teachers mainly texts and papers were not the ones the students would prefer as digital sources for learning which were videos and audiovisual materials Di erences among countries are interesting in this point showing that Spain was the county in which teachers used papers and texts the most and videos and audiovisuals less This may be one of the reasons for the high level of displeasure among students from all countries on the way teachers and universities have addressed the situation These results are in line with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Report highlighting several universities have struggled and lacked the experience and time they needed to conceive new ways to deliver instruction and assignments The third dimension analyzed Teaching and teachers guidance and skills gives evidence that students perceive positively the issue following their classes in distance learning modality however they perceive too many negative aspects such as online lessons being too similar to facetoface classes not adapting properly to the online philosophy In the case of Spain these results are reinforced in the fact students felt teachers did not have appropriate skills to manage distance online teaching Summarizing students perceptions the situation has given the worst quality of education less stimulating and boring lessons and more homework to do It is worth noting that no differences were found among countries in this regard so in future actions this dimension should be reinforced and enhanced Teachers digital skills still continue being key point in digital literacy development as previous research indicated All international frameworks and mostly nationals highlight dimension four as fundamental for proper digital literacy enhancement Supportingempowering students Existing literature also emphasizesPublications of this area as essential This dimension gives them the engagement that ensures the accessibility to learning sources and the use of technologies to foster their active and creative engagement Results in this dimension have no signicant di erences among countries studied Spanish students felt the most that the quality of teaching was the worst and Ecuadorian ones think the most learning process has lower level during the lockdown About too much work being demanded Spanish and Italian students were the most displeased groups Students felt condent about their digital skills and competences to face online distance learning They all show mature behavior receiving and evaluating fake news they mostly declared getting them but not sharing it at all The work presented is found in line with the last report by the OECD The Future of Education and Skills The future we want that constitutes part of the OECD Learning Framework but focusing on new concerns related to the development of proper digital literacy during and after COVID These conclusions give interesting insights from students to face future challenges that the crisis has brought to light firstly universities would need to rethink and reinvent learning environments not only based on digital platform striving to give learning possibilities through digitalization that expands and complement students learning secondly digital skills and competences should be reinforced in teachers as key point in new learning scenarios and it may be teachers are not ready enough for digital learning opportunities so efforts in technology investment are not enough to guarantee learning for the near future Author Contributions Conceptualization LC and ST methodology AP software AP

the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan Keywords Jordan Digital Media Literacy Arab Education Technology Introduction The concept of media literacy is not new but is definitely important among the researchers in the fields of education and the media Potter Several Western educat ional systems developed media literacy as way to enable citizens to achieve informed interactions with media messages Alhamadani Along with technological advancements came the concept of digital media literacy that emerged as broader and mor comprehensive Volume Issue December PP DOI

understanding of basic skills such as reading writing understanding and using modern technologies Pa rk Burford Digital skills have now become necessary to equip ommunity members with basic skills that will enable them to solve digital issues in their environment and the world at large Digital media literacy refers to having the ability to cr eate and use technologies to participate in and contribute to social cultural political and economic life It includes understanding the impact of recent technologies on society understanding and having the ability to manage digital identities fittingl and having the ability to find organize understand evaluate analyze and cr eate digital information Hobbs Digital literacy involves critically participating in technology and developing social awareness However variety of things together with business agenda and cultural understandings will form how technology is employed to convey information Assal Having the ability to speak and represent data is entirely different in numerous contexts and to different audiences for example visual audio or matter modes This involves finding and choosing relevant information critically evaluating and re contextualizing data and is underpinned by an understanding of the cultural and social contexts during which this takes place Digital literacy provides the citizens with the flexibility to require advantage of the wealth of recent and rising opportunities related to digital technologies while additionally remaining aware of what the different challenges technology will give In short di gital literacy is the savvyness that permits to participate in the digital realm meaningfully and safely In order for the desired benefit of digital media literacy to be realized it is necessary to possess the skills that constitute the measurement to ols for the effectiveness of digital media literacy for individuals Digital media literacy skills are extensions of media literacy skills where the essence of the vocation and competence are to equip citizens the ability to search for the right informatio and using those information efficiently and positively Individuals need skills to get good understanding of how to create knowledge express reality and engage in civic activities and social work Hobbs When measuring media literacy competenc conventional definitions

Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved media creation is the main characteris tic that distinguishes digital literacy from media literacy Park In UNESCO concluded that the most common digital literacy abilities are awareness access evaluation and creation This statement is agreed by scholars who have considered the se skills as measurements of digital media literacy competency Assal Fedorove Hallaq Jordanians are very much exposed to different types of media With population of million people there are thirty eight TV channels thirty nine radio stations and about thirty newspapers daily and weekly Media Commission According to the Jordanian Department of Statistics social media usage has reached With this widespread media usage particularly online media the Jor danian audiences are not solely exposed to smart data they are conjointly subjected to the risks of harmful usage and content This might embody violence extremism cultural invasion and incorrect conventional pictures regarding status race or gender additionally to the industrial nature of media messages Darweesh The level of digital media literacy in Jordan has been developed in recent years there is positive move towards educating the Jordanian people about digital media Ashdiefat Khasawneh Melki Jordan Media Institute JMI is probably the countrys biggest proponent for media literacy JMI is freelance media institute that aims to enhance the output of Jordanian media and to promote the name and image of the media profession domestically and regionally by establishing medium that helps to circularize the ideas of media literacy JMI In this paper we will revie the digital media literacy in Jordan and we will describe the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan

recent developments of digital media literacy in Jordan Finally in section we will provide the conclusion and recommendation Methodology This paper is conceptual in na ture However the historical analysis provided was done through careful reading of literatures on media literacy in the Arab world generally and in Jordan more specifically This study is also part of the first authors PhD thesis in which he had conduct ed multiple interviews with relevant parties such as media experts and members of the Jordan Media Institute JMI Therefore the discussion provided is also based on deliberate input from experts in the area who are very familiar with the media and educ ation landscape in Jordan History of Digital Media Literacy in The Arab World and Jordan The Arab world neglected media literacy for long time which led to negative consequences that exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic disturbances AbuFadil described the reason for neglecting digital media literacy to the Arab higher education systems which have been suffered from the absence of facilities and equipment that require digital literacy Moreover the individual academic initiati ves that called for media literacy in Arab universities have been met with opposition and lack of support from traditional academics while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of Media and digital literacy Melki and Maaliki Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Furthermore media literacy is at the bottom of the list of Arab priorities as it reflects the state of the media itself which is tool of power and indicates lack of respect for the press and its lack of prestige and this is reflected in the degree of credibility thus it serves the interest of the ruling elites Saleh However digital media literacy has been included in the curricula of number of Egyptian universities since in addition to WeChat organizing workshops for final year students at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University on media literacy Tayie In Palestine the concept of media literacy was new concept at the level of civil society so efforts were limited to some initiatives activities and projects that have increased since Nuseibeh and Abu Arqoub At the begin ning of the new millennium nterest in digital media literacy began in Jordan through some official Jordanian initiatives to develop digital literacy such as the Minis try of Education training te achers to use computers by obtaining the International Computer Driving License ICDL program as well as the INTEL Education for the Future program hoping to provide teachers With computer skills and employing them in the ducational process and using them in obtaining media content that affects digital media literacy Olaimat The Ministry of Education in cooperation with several bodies including the Center for the Protection and Freedom of Journalists launched th Education Through Journalism program which was considered the first training in media literacy in which schools invest on daily newspapers to teach many educational materials such as history geography science reading civic education creatio and expression to group of school students The exercises and activities were are carried out inside the classroom at the rate of one session per week to enable students to keep pace with the developments of the age and the knowledge revolution and to creat spirit of dialogue and interaction with various community issues With the aim of training Jordanian youth providing them with knowledge and skills to deal with the media facing illiteracy in information and communication technology and promoting fr eedom of expression the Jordanian National Committee for Education Culture and Science in cooperation with the UNESCO Office in Amman and the Arab Women Media Center implemented an exploratory project entitled Introducing the concept of media literacy in Jordanian schools With funding from the Swedish government in Assal The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations UNAOC and Google in cooperation with the World Bank Institute held training workshop in entitled Digital Tools or News Gathering and Cross Cultural Reporting at the Jordan Media Institute in Amman UNAOC Durra which was considered step towards Introducing the concept of digital literacy in Jordan The International Center for Journalists organized training course at the Jordan Media Institute in on the use of electronic tools in public service issues which dealt with preparing press reports building electronic news websites media ethics in the electronic age and social media and how to em ploy This is in its coverage of result related to public services with the participation of media professionals and journalists from several Arab countries Jordan Media Institute Accordingly it appears that the stages by which the adoption of th digital media literacy concept by Jordanian official institutes was not part of clear process and policy based on strategy for developing this concept and benefiting from it while not being adopted by the Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Jordanian government and placing it among its priorities during the period before They were just initiatives by international institutions and Jordanian civil society institutions Challenges That Face the Implementation of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan Recently the concept of digital lit eracy has entered which is broader and more comprehensive than media literacy but it is not substitute for it Rather it needs broader awareness of basic skills such as reading writing understanding and accessing new technologies Park The state of digital media literacy in the Arab world including Jordan is weak as interest in it comes at the bottom of the list of priorities for Arab countries noting that it reflects the state of media itself Saleh On other words the digit al media literacy in the Arab world is still in the initial foundational stages Melki The challenges facing digital media literacy are summarized by several reasons including political economic and social culture For instance The Arab wor ld including Jordan neglected digital media literacy for long time which led to negative consequences that exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic unrest Abu Fadil Many obstacles stand in front of the spread of media and digital literacy such as the structure of the media which in turn does not provide the opportunity for sufficient number of voices to participate and the various political and social situations restrict the flow and availability of information in addition the imbalance in the ability of individuals to communicate their opinions and voices Assal Among the factors affecting Digital Media Literacy in Jordan are the economic weakness and the high costs of production and publishing with the lack of financial support provided for the development of human resources and education on which media literacy depends on Saleh Moreover Arab higher education systems suffer from the absence of facilities and equipment that require digital literacy nd individual academic initiatives that called for media literacy in Arab universities were met with opposition and lack of support from traditional academics while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of digital media literacy In addition it does not feel that it should be integrated into the school curriculum Melki and Maaliki Although Jordanian youth have the skill and intelligence to use digital technologies they mostly still unaware of the dangers of social medi and that most of these young people are ignorant of the Internet thr eat such as privacy threat espite their extensive use of social media they cannot be described as fruitful producers Consequently Jordanian youth who used the nternet have suffere from the lack of effective application of blogs Like young bloggers in many other developing countries Mohamed they predominantly blogged about entertainment and light news indicating the lack of their awareness regarding the power of these mean in influencing social and political views Melki Despite the challenges the application of digital media literacy in Jordan has witnessed remarkable developments during the recent period and this will be discussed in the next section Develop ment of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan Recently digital media literacy has been developed remarkably as these developments were represented in several stages the beginning of which was in when the Jordanian Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved academics became aware and interested in the concept of digital media literacy and they pressured the politicians to pay closer attention to this concept In response new researches and studies were published to delineate and discuss the concept of digital media literacy Jordanian academics were focused on identifying the tools that individuals must possess to qualify them to interact with the media in positive way For instance Ash diefat Khasawneh studied the extent to which Jordanian school students possess the concept of digi tal media literacy which gave simplified picture of the scene Assal studied the extent of parents awareness of digital media literacy and the importance of this concept to them because of its potential Subsequently the UNESCO Amman office aunched project to support the media in Jordan with funding from the European Union starting from until and the project included developing media education capabilities UNESCO In addition to this the Jordan Media Institute in part nership with UNESCO launched the Media and Information Education Project in Jordan in May which comes within the main project to support the media in Jordan which UNESCO began implementing in with funding from the European Union Jordan Media Institute The project came in two phases the first included the institutes development of Jordanian public policy paper in the field of media and information educatio in educational institutions The paper analyze the universities curricula and the extent to which they contain media literacy concepts The paper suggested strategy that will work to introduce these concepts while the second phase introduced the concept of Media education in educational curricula within the framework of coop eration with relevant parties that included the Ministry of Education and the Jordanian universities Among others this Initiative wanted to train male and female teachers on media and information literacy skills so that they can transfer the necessary kn owledge to students of grades seven eight and nine in number of schools Jordan Media Institute In the Jordan Media Institute launched the Jordanian Media Credibility Observatory Akeed with an important role in providing recipients with digital media literacy skills and enhancing th eir presence among individuals The observatory contributed by verifying and monitoring media content published in the Jordanian media to enhance the quality of information by stressing on the elements of object ivity redibility and accuracy It also proposed for awareness be imparted to Jordanians so that they can verify hose elements in the messages they receive Akeedjo The objectives of the observatory reinforce the objectives of the existence of digital media literacy by protecting individuals and groups from the negative and unethical influences that may exist in the media content It also enhances the accessibility skill of the recipient by assigning the human right to knowledge by being able to achieve objecti vity and separate between news and advertisements between facts and speculation and the separation of information facts on the one hand and imagination and emotions on the other hand and it also contr ibutes to providing students and journalists with the tools necessary to enhance future media education programs Durra In the Jordanian government adopted the policy paper on digital media literacy that was drafted by the Jordan Media Instit ute in partnership with the European Union and UNESCO Followed by training for school and Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved university students on digital media literacy concepts through several training programs funded by external donors and most notably UNESCO Most recently while be ing affected by the global Corona pandemic the government has developed through the Ministry of Culture an executive plan for the National Initiative for the Promotion of Media and Information literacy for the years Because of the dire ne ed to depend on digital technologies caused by the pandemic the Ministryn develop ed work program to improve societys ability to deal with information sources news and digital media tools The strategic objective of the plan is to integrate media and informational literacy concepts and skills into the Jordanian educational system publish them in schools and universities incorporate the activities of cultural and youth institutions and civil society institutions and spread awareness of them through he media and in the public sphere According to the general policy paper presented by the Jordanian government these are the main reasons why digital media literacy is societal necessity in Jordan First Knowledge Transfer Tool Digital Media literacy is tool for developing and reforming education and tool for transferring knowledge through technology oday he use of information and communication technology ICT is the most prominent and important tool in increasing access to education raising the quality of education using advanced teaching and learning methods improving learning outcomes and reforming educational systems management UNESCO Second Digital Media Literacy is Considered Means of Social Integration It can be point ed out that digital media literacy is an effective tool that improves opportunities for social harmony and opportunities for societal understanding and understanding as the press and radio were used in early periods in the reproduction of more integrated societies that agreed on common large goals without exceeding the value of diversity for example as happened in the Malaysia Mohamed Contemporary Jordanian society is now very diverse mainly due to the modern formation of society and the emergenc of the state The waves of refugees that have not stopped over the course of six decades have increased society diversification and although the state and society have been able to digest this diversity and reproduce it in many stations Jordan still ne eds to a greater extent in depth efforts in support of social integration processes bridging gap and some aspects of fragility Thus communication technology can assist Jordanians to beco me more integrated by sharing and expressing through digital and social media Third Bridging the Political and Social Participation Gap Learning the skills of sharing information and producing and sharing media content is the basic feature of the communication and informat ion revolution and the events and transformations that the world is witnessing in the last decade confirm that this pattern of participation is contributing to determining the level content and size of participation that individuals practice in various aspects of life foremost of which is social and political participation As is well known participation is the solid foundation for development and modernization when the responsibility base expands The quality of dealing with information and news improves opportunities for political participation whether elect oral participation or participation in public affairs in addition to the role of digital media education in improving Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved citizens ability to accept equality and seek it specifically between ender the empowerment of women and strengthening the participat ion of special groups Digital media education today defines this way in which more generations can be brought up ready for positive and productive participation thanks to the cognitive and cultural cultivation of participation based on evaluation selec tion of ideas and critical thinking Jordan suffers from multi faceted participation crisis whether in the political or socio economic dimensions evidenced by the weak electoral participation that did not exceed in the Eighteenth Council elect ions The gender gap in womens participation rates appears more obvious and embarrassing as the rate of Jordanian womens economic participation in the labor market is still low and does not exceed compared with at the Arab point and at the global level and weak and distorted participation extends to other sectors such as work Volunteering and non profit work as this sector only accounts for compared to of the global average Jordanian Department of Statistics Fourth ationalize Societal Culture in Confronting Extremism and Hate Speech Digital media has become one of the open sources today that allows participation for young people untried and old and at time when the mass media and new information sources along with the traditional media have come to dominate wide area of individuals times they have been transformed by the political conflict in the Middle East and North Africa regions And others to effective platforms for spreading extremism and spreading hate speech as many reports indicate that these means have become trap for hunting young people by terrorist organizations in addition to their role in spreading extremist ideas and creating followers for them Therefore Jordanian youth find themselves in the midst of torrent of information flow and at time when traditional educational institutions deny them expression and traditional media do not give them real attention young people find the new media of expression available on digita media specifically social media an escape from exclusion and marginalization Its ability does not depend on the inexpensive means it provides and without direct censorship but rather allows anonymity which has opened the way to anomalous expressions such as expressions of cultural and verbal violence and hates speech on the one hand and extremist religious and political discourse Digital media literacy contributes to large extent to developing the capabilities of individuals to examine evaluate accept or reject media messages as what media literacy provides makes young people and new youths more immune to political and ideological propaganda at the forefront of which is the distinction between messages with political and ideological goals and news Impartial information makes the recipients more alert and aware of extremist messages In order to benefit from the integration of digital media education plan had to be developed Implementation of the national initiative that according to the Mi nister of Culture Twissi includes four areas which are the Schools Univesrities youth and cultural institutions and civil society and the public sphere in cities Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Area Schools It includes training activities and access to about of the Ministry of Education schools in the Kingdoms governorates within directorates of education and training male and female teachers and the introduction of digital media literacy concepts and skills to the educational curricula in the concerned classes and ensuring their sustainability reviewing them and developing student activities guides specialized in digital media education For students of basic education and establishing student clubs specialized in this field Area Unive rsities It aims to build the capacities of group of faculty members in Jordanian universities and to invite universities to offer specialized courses in digital media education and the establishment of university student clubs and parallel activities the field of media and information education This goal includes establishing student clubs in the field of media and informational education and working with teacher training colleges to offer educational programs in media and informatics education Area Youth and Cultural Institutions It aims to train and build capacity for members of the youth centers of the Ministry of Youth and the cultural bodies of the Ministry of Culture in all parts of the Kingdom and to enable group of youth centers and young women and cultural bodies to develop units for digital media awareness and the production of media and information content Area Civil Society and The Public Sphere in Cities The plan aims to administer sub grants targeting group of civil society institutions interested in launching new and innovative initiatives in the fields of media and information education under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and the Office of the Minister of State for Media Affairs and the implementation of awareness campaigns to spread the concepts of media education And informatics through group of public service media and the creation of digital platform for free education and training Conclusion and Recommendations In short we have explicated the challenges and development of di gital media literacy in Jordan he sequence of entering the concept of digital media literacy Jordan was reviewed and the challenges that faced Jordan to apply the concepts of digital media literacy were presented For instance the digital media literacy programs that were implemented were financed and supported by external institutions in addition to the challenge of cultural awareness among young people in dealing with digital media correctly and in produc tive way was constituted as an obstacle for the digital media literacy in Jordan The political challenges also clearly affected the progress of the development of digital media literacy through the various media outlets that represent the decision makers opinions and control what is presented As for recent years specifically since government interest in the concept of digital media literacy became apparent through practical steps that were manifested by the introduction of training programs in sch ools and universities and the development of strategic plan for digital media literacy In response to the analyses provided the au thors recommend for the Jordanian authorities to further enhance their digital media initiatives by adopting the following Volume Issue December PP DOI IJLGC Copyright GLOBAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SDN BHD All rights reserved Establishing clear digital media literacy curriculum in schools and universities as separate and independent curriculum to be taught in theoretical and practical way and to be designed locally in Jordan to comply with local culture and cu stoms The teachers and trainers of digital media literacy must be specialized in digital media to provide content related to digital media literacy in professional and beneficial way Disseminating media messages through various media outlets explaining the importance of digital media literacy Which includes understanding media contemporary communication news literacy information literacy digital citizenship to create state of public trust and cognitive immunization in the face of rumors and misinformation and this perspective is committed to promoting the principles of human rights freedom expression and gender justice The paper concludes by confirming that the potential of digital media literacy in Jordan is very positive If the government and the relevant authorities maintain their commitment to realize the strategic plans that are already in place it wont be long before Jordanians become savvy technology users and Jordan will become the leader on digital media literacy especi ally in the Arab world The authors also propose for more studies to be conducted to understand how digital media literacy can be made more effective and relevant when it is studied within the context of particular culture and socio political backgrounds Such studies can provide more avenues for comparing the applicability of different digital media literacy methods and modules References AbuFadil Torrent Grizzle Opportunities for media and information literacy in the Middle East and North Africa The

University of Machala Machala Ecuador Correspondence Received October Accepted November Published November gidgidgidgidgidgidgidgidgid gid gidgidgidgidgidgidgid Abstract Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in the st Century in professional and personal lives The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID pandemic educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes The aim of this research is to present comparative study of three countries higher education institutions Spain Italy and Ecuador analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation focusing on the development of digital literacy The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratorycorrelational scope using questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in sample of students Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teachers digital skills sources for learning that may be adapted communication between university and students and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation mainly communication teaching and digital competences Otherwise digital literacy is not being guaranteed which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives Keywords digital literacy COVID generation students lockdown higher education communication Introduction The development of the knowledge society implies social transformation in which citizens need new skills and competencies On the one hand technological availability has motivated worldclass universities to develop innovative programs and new ideas to accelerate and improve both teaching and learning On the other as JonasDwyer and Pospisil observe even if the technological revolution has been catalyst for change in universities research has shown that introducing new educational technologies alone does not improve teaching and learning outcomes if they are not accompanied by specific training Therefore in context of development and expansion of an increasingly digital society training in competencies within the scope of digital literacy of higher education students should be essential nonetheless it is often viewed as something that is often taken for granted In Poores words today more than ever we have the opportunity and the technologies to assist us in the human project of shaping creating authoring and developing ourselves however we will not be able to achieve liberating collective intelligence until we can achieve collective digital literacy Publications doi publications journal publicationsPublications of Aligning with rezTorneros holistic approach understanding media literacy as concept embracing all the elds and all the competences related to media digital literacy is understood as the acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies understood in broad sense in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society Digital literacy may be understood as an interrelated set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age developed and evolved in di erent dimensions address in models acknowledge by countries and governments Within the context of the COVID crisis this has become even more evident The World Health Organization WHO declared COVID as global public health emergency of international concern on th January as well as pandemic on th March As of th April UNESCO reported that there have been affected learners out of total enrolled learners in countries in all levels of learning Exactly as in many other aspects of everyday life COVID had serious impact on students instructors and educational organizations around the globe the pandemic caused schools colleges and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses and quickly move conventional education to distance and virtual learning Current educational circumstances are so unique that some authors accurately propose to define this new situation crisis learning Due to this uniqueness and exceptionality of past and current circumstances many studies are emerging on the impact of COVID restriction measures in different educational levels and different contexts Most of these studies focus either on specific countries or on specific aspects such as technical aspects of elearning or psychological impact or communicative perspectives The onlyby the timeglobal study developed by Crawford and colleagues analyzing twenty countries educational responses concludes that the educational sector needs to unite to postulate future where students can be supported digitally without compromising academic quality and standards of the curriculum The aim of this research is to present comparative study of three countries higher education institutions Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain University of Torino in Italy and Technical University of Machala in Ecuador analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation focusing on the development of digital literacy Generation and the Digital Native Debate Although there is no absolute consensus about the precise boundaries of Generation most literature considers that it is composed of individuals born between the years and Their most important characteristic is that they are the rst generation that has never known world without the Internet Their lives are molded by the Internet which has been converted in natural part of their lives Prensky denes this cohort as digital natives implying that having been exposed to these digital technologies has endowed this generation with specic and even unique characteristics that make its members completely di erent from those growing up in previous generations Ters Myllyla and Ters consider that having grown up with highly sophisticated media they are naturally more Internet savvy than their forbearers displaying natural skills of digital native learners Veen and Vrakking in the same line propose to call this generation homo zappiens considering that this cohort have developed all the metacognitive skills necessary for enquirybased learning discoverybased learning networked learning experiential learning collaborative learning active learning selforganization and selfregulation problem solving by themselves According to this vision Generation students currently attending school or university are therefore considered experts in understanding technology socially open through the use of technology fast and impatient and interactive and resilient multitaskers Some research suggests that Generation Zers brains are structurally di erent to those of previous generations surrounded by complex visual imagery the part of their brain responsible for visual ability is more developed making them more reactive to visual learning but with shortened attention spanPublications of Accordingly there is growing agreement that there is gap between higher education and st century skills and that educational institutions should adapt their methodologies Both the concept itself and the description of the so called digital natives have been criticized lacking any empirical evidence or substantive characteristics Kirschner and De Bruyckere for example harshly criticize this denition comparing digital natives to Yetilike creatures myth someone that everyone talks about but that nobody has ever seen study carried out by Romero Guitert Sangr and Bullen comparing students of di erent ages for example found that older students years and thus born before who exhibited the characteristics attributed to digital natives more than their younger counterparts In their research of their students older than showed the characteristics of the so called digital natives more than their younger counterparts In terms of learning environment study from the University of Barcelona concludes that the digital native label does not provide evidence of better use of technology rather that technology use is mainly inuenced by the teaching model Consequently in research on rstyear undergraduate students at Hong Kong University Kennedy and Fox found that while students appear to use large quantity and variety of technologies for personal empowerment and entertainment they do always appear digitally literate in using technology to support their learning This is particularly evident when it comes to student use of technology as consumers of content rather than creators of content specically for academic purposes Adding to this Shatto and Erwin consider that Gen students ability to obtain information from online sources seems impressive but they lack the ability to critique the validity of the information and are likely to get frustrated if answers are not clear immediately Thus keeping the attention of the student and developing higher order thinking skills are critical components of successful teaching In other words many students entering university today have high level of exposure to digital technologies and media but they do not seem prepared to cross the bridge between personal and academic use of technology Therefore as academic knowhow is gained through formal education so too must technological prowess be gained through structured learning experiences For this reason it is vital that higher education institutions promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users with the generation of new competencies Digital Literacy As previously mentioned there is growing agreement that there is gap between higher education and st century skills and that educational institutions should adapt their methodology promoting explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users with the generation of new competencies Accordingly even though digital literacy has been one of those key concepts whose relevancy and weight as key element for digital citizenship have shifted from being recommended to essential the concept itself of digital literacy is not standardized its scope is broad and has been researched from dierent elds The most common approaches so far have been those of media studies educational studies computer science information science and librarianship Due to this the understanding of this competence can be diverse On the one hand the different understanding of digital literacy responds to the interests and scope of each era of literacy Therefore emerging at the end of the twentieth century with the spread of ICT Information and Communications Technology the term mainly referred to computer literacy that is to say to technological skills while with the growing of the knowledge society has highlighted that digital literacy should be understood as an interrelated set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age In particular the socalled critical approach has been growing mainly with the spread of media literacy studiesPublications of This approach highlights critical thinking as one of the fundamental aspects Aligning with PrezTorneros holistic approach understanding media literacy as concept embracing all the elds and all the competences related to media we understand digital literacy as the acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies understood in broad sense in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society Within this framework it is important to recognize that since there is no unifying denition of digital literacy many models and implementation are possible Accordingly we will examine our result within the respective reference framework Digital Literacy Development Models The development of digital literacy in Europe is based in both Spain and Italy on the DigCompEdu reference framework in which six dimensions are established that teachers must promote for the development of adequate digital literacy with series of subdimensions as shown below Dimension Professional engagement integrating organizational communication professional collaboration reective practice and digital continuous professional development Dimension Digital Sources resources including the following subdimensions selecting creating and modifying and managing protecting and sharing Dimension Teaching and learning teaching guidance collaborative learning selfregulated learning Dimension Assessment within assessment strategies analyzing evidence and feedback and planning Dimension Empowering learners embracing accessibility and inclusion di erentiation and personalization and actively engaging learners Dimension Facilitating learners digital competence which includes ve subdimensions information and media literacy communication content creation responsible use and problem solving In the context of Ecuador Digital Agenda establishes dimensions for the promotion of digital literacy Dimension Hardware which includes two subdimensions connectivity and equipment Dimension Digital learning including the following subdimensions curriculum learning methodologies content and digital sources Dimension Teachers development long life learning preservice teachers education and professionalization developing digital competences Dimension Communication and promotion focusing on visualization engaging and empowering and web content Dimension Innovation related with developing new skills and competences for teachers and learners The establishment of reference frameworks for the development of digital literacy in both contexts is very similar as can be seen in their description and they are the fruit of collective awareness of the need to develop new literacy according to the context of society of the information In addition its international recognition has implied an ort in recent years from organizations institutions and governments so that this change was being put into practice The objective of the work presented here is to carry out specic temporal approximation during the quarantine time for COVID MarchApril with study of the perception of university students to verify whether during this period of global connement has sought the development of dimensions that guarantee the acquisition of digital literacy To ensure greater signicance of the results the study was applied to three countries Spain Italy and Ecuador with high incidence of COVIDPublications of Materials and Methods From the study of the reference frameworks for digital literacy in the three contexts studied Spain Italy and Ecuador the study dimensions associated with the variables that would later be included in the design of the questionnaire were designed based on the DigCompEdu and the Digital Agenda Thus the study dimensions were established as follows Dimension Teachers professional engagement and collaboration it is related to professional engagement the capability to integrate organizational communication professional collaboration and ective practice and development Dimension Digital learning and sources this dimension is meant to be rethinking of conventional sources of learning complementing the development of other dimensions It includes the necessity for citizens to be aware of how to responsibly use access and manage digital content Dimension Teaching and teachers guidance and skills Learning strategies will denitely develop an appropriate digital literacy by designing planning and implanting in the di erent stages of learning digital tools and technologies Dimension Supporting empowering students having in mind this is dimension related to the development of digital literacy it will ensure not only access to digital learning resources and activities but empowering learners and fostering their digital competences These dimensions conducted to the denition of several variables of study for the design of the questionnaire The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratorydescriptive scope using three independent socio demographical variables of study gender age and country and dependent variables distributed for the analysis of each dimension as follows Teachers professional engagement and collaboration with four variables Digital learning and sources including six variables Teaching and teachers guidance and skills integrating ve di erent variables and Supporting empowering students with ve variables The dimensions and variables dened allow us to specify the purpose of the study drawing the following research questions RQ During lockdown do teachers from the university show professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation RQ What kind of sources have teachers used during the lockdown RQ Did teachers use new learning methodologies to guarantee quality in teaching RQ What was the perception of students about their teachers digital competences RQ Did students perceive negative aspects in the teaching lessons during lockdown RQ Did students feel their education was damaged because of this situation RQ Did students feel they had enough digital competence level to face the situation In the ndings of all research questions the analysis and results will er or not di erences among countries Based on this research questions the following objectives were addressed rst describe the situation in three countries studied focusing on the four dimensions designed related to digital literacy and secondly nd out if there were signicant di erences among the three groups studied In order to reach the second objective the hypothesis established were as follows Null Hypothesis There were no di erences among countries in the research questions dened Alternative Hypothesis HA There were di erences among countries in the research questions dened This descriptive research applied comparative study between Spain Italy and Ecuador on the specic dimensions consumption of devices and content during the global health crisis of COVID during the months of MarchMay The methodological proposal was designed from an exploratory perspective and applied the survey instrument which reached responses from university students from Spain Ecuador and Italy In total the study collected pieces of evidence from the three countriesPublications of Sample The invited sample conceived as the set of elements of the population that are asked to participate in the investigation corresponds to undergraduate students of Communication Journalism and Education The study was composed of students aged between and years old SD As shown in Mesa the description of the sample was in Spain the participation represents of the sample whose ages range from to years The students from Italy were the whose ages average between and years In the case of Ecuador aged between and years Table Description of the sample according to age gender and country Spain Italy Ecuador Total Gender Male Female Age The research was based on intentional sampling in the selection of the three participating universities In this type of sampling the subjects subjected to analysis and study are chosen by the researcher to be part of the sample with specific objective as they are considered adequate or suitable for the investigation Three universities from different sociogeographical settings were selected which received strong impact from COVID generating significant numbers of affected and deceased in their territorial environment In this regard the institutions that made up the study were Autonomous University of Barcelona Spain participating with students of the degree of Journalism University of Torino Italy with the participation of students of the degree of Education and Technical University of Machala Ecuador that participated in the study with students of the Communication degree Instrument and Procedure The design of the instrument was carried out with the objective of describing the observed situation and exploratory analysis of the research questions raised in order to analyze the established dimensions and find if there were differences among the three groups studied Spain Italy and Ecuador In the first phase the instrument was submitted to the judgment of experts six in total academics from the study area two in each country in order to establish clarity and relevance to the items This first step discarded total of items for being redundant or imprecise and allowed six of them to be reformulated For the analysis of the reliability of the instrument from the statistical point of view Cronbachs Alpha was carried out for each dimension of the study all values being above The instrument was designed with Google Forms tool and prior to its completion each participants permission was requested It is important to note that before the data gathering researchers assured the ethical issues in each university were addressed None of the three universities involved required authorization from the ethics committee due the nature of the study only the express participants permission The final instrument consisted of independent variables that collected sociodemographic information and of dependent variables total of thirtyone as can be read in Appendix Table Dichotomous type questions were chosen because of the nature of information the researchers intended to gather The dichotomous question format is used when the issue under consideration most likely is thought of in two possible values Statistical analysis of data was made with package SPSS version descriptive and inferential analysis was addressed In order to check the equality of variances Levenes test was applied which is proper for two or more groups obtaining pvalue below Results confirm there was no normality in the distribution of variables so non parametrical statistics were required in our study The study was conducted in two steps in order to reach objectives designed in the four dimensions firstly with basic statistics frequencies and chisquare test and secondlyPublications of to determine the strengths of associations after chisquare we observed Cramers the suitable measurement in nominal variables in order to reject or accept null hypothesis showing which groups are different or where the groups differ Accordingly Norris et al and the interpretation for effect size ES in Social Science in Cramers Vshould be considered as follows ES weak strong Results In order to establish clear explanation of results they are presented as the following in the dimensions designed responding in each case to the research questions involved Dimension Teachers Professional Engagement and Collaboration Results for the rst dimension were addressed in two steps as previously explained Firstly basic statics such as frequencies and chisquare for signicance where analyzed in order to extract dierences among countries as can be seen in Table In this regard students where asked in four dichotomous nominal variables Table Dierences among

the second dimension it is worth noting that students were asked ten items to check issues related to digital learning and sources during this period in which learning was mediated trough Internet From to items see Table they were asked about what kind of sources did teachers use during the lockdown and from to see Table what sources did they prefer for their lessons As seen in Table some items present di erences statistically signicant among countries which means we could reject null hypothesis it is worth noting that in the item videos and audiovisuals as the preferred sources for learning

communication and critical thinking have been related evolving all together in the multidimensional concept of digital literacy Already two decades since not only the international community strives to develop this digital literacy through education Publications of but also all countries and governments around the world education should ensure digital literacy whatever modality it acquires The aim of this research was to present comparativedescriptive study analyzing how high education in three di erent countries has faced the global lockdown situation in terms of ensuring the development of digital literacy Having in mind the unusual situation caused by COVID seems to be disruption for education that will obligate countries and governments to rethink educational systems it really makes sense to analyze what has happed during the lockdown situation in order to face future decisions with empirical information In this regard it could be said that one of the limitations of this study is that it only analyzed three countries future pathways could amplify the research area in order to study the impact of this situation in wider perspective In line with previous and recent research this study presents an overview of the development of digital literacy in three di erent contexts Spain Italy and Ecuador The novelty in this case is that research is framed in the global lockdown caused by COVID allowing us to make interesting conclusions for the near future in which the pandemic situation still ects education and global health Dimensions dened and analyzed support ndings and results in line with main frameworks dening digital literacy In this regard we could highlight the following conclusions from results obtained In first place and regarding dimension one studied Teachers professional engagement and collaboration related to the capability to integrate organizational communication professional collaboration and effective practice and development results make us conclude that significant differences exist among the three countries studied For Spanish and Italian students teachers have not been well coordinated in this situation they felt they were not properly informed and declare receiving contradictory information Nonetheless all samples Spanish Italian and Ecuadorian students felt they were not supported enough with statistically significant differences between Spain and Italy and Spain and Ecuador Spanish students were the most disappointed in this regard This evidence should be interpreted taking into account that in March the Italian government announced it would equip schools with digital platforms and tools for distance learning lend digital devices to less welloff students and train school staff in methodologies and techniques for distance learning Significant differences are shown as well among countries in the case of receiving contradictory information Spanish and Italian students declared points and points above Ecuadorian students About dimension two Digital learning and sources analyzed it can be concluded that digital sources used during the lockdown by teachers mainly texts and papers were not the ones the students would prefer as digital sources for learning which were videos and audiovisual materials Di erences among countries are interesting in this point showing that Spain was the county in which teachers used papers and texts the most and videos and audiovisuals less This may be one of the reasons for the high level of displeasure among students from all countries on the way teachers and universities have addressed the situation These results are in line with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Report highlighting several universities have struggled and lacked the experience and time they needed to conceive new ways to deliver instruction and assignments The third dimension analyzed Teaching and teachers guidance and skills gives evidence that students perceive positively the issue following their classes in distance learning modality however they perceive too many negative aspects such as online lessons being too similar to facetoface classes not adapting properly to the online philosophy In the case of Spain these results are reinforced in the fact students felt teachers did not have appropriate skills to manage distance online teaching Summarizing students perceptions the situation has given the worst quality of education less stimulating and boring lessons and more homework to do It is worth noting that no differences were found among countries in this regard so in future actions this dimension should be reinforced and enhanced Teachers digital skills still continue being key point in digital literacy development as previous research indicated All international frameworks and mostly nationals highlight dimension four as fundamental for proper digital literacy enhancement Supportingempowering students Existing literature also emphasizesPublications of this area as essential This dimension gives them the engagement that ensures the accessibility to learning sources and the use of technologies to foster their active and creative engagement Results in this dimension have no signicant di erences among countries studied Spanish students felt the most that the quality of teaching was the worst and Ecuadorian ones think the most learning process has lower level during the lockdown About too much work being demanded Spanish and Italian students were the most displeased groups Students felt condent about their digital skills and competences to face online distance learning They all show mature behavior receiving and evaluating fake news they mostly declared getting them but not sharing it at all The work presented is found in line with the last report by the OECD The Future of Education and Skills The future we want that constitutes part of the OECD Learning Framework but focusing on new concerns related to the development of proper digital literacy during and after COVID These conclusions give interesting insights from students to face future challenges that the crisis has brought to light firstly universities would need to rethink and reinvent learning environments not only based on digital platform striving to give learning possibilities through digitalization that expands and complement students learning secondly digital skills and competences should be reinforced in teachers as key point in new learning scenarios and it may be teachers are not ready enough for digital learning opportunities so efforts in technology investment are not enough to guarantee learning for the near future Author Contributions Conceptualization LC and ST methodology AP software AP

['Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Considerations for Design and Production of Digital Books for Early Literacy in Ethiopia TERESA DOBSON University of British Columbia MARLENE ASSELIN University of British Columbia ALEMU ABEBE CODE Ethiopia Abstract This paper considers the implications of digital text production models for the development of reading materials for emergent and early readers in the Ethiopian context We draw from several theoretical frameworks and also from comments of Ethiopian academics writers and publishers to ground descriptions of Ethiopian contexts of language and literacy We then present three different models for the production and curation of digital stories for children and contemplate how these models align with existing literacy traditions and practices We also raise questions about the potential effects on the development of literary culture and childrens literature in Ethiopia of projects imed at rapidly producing large corpora of literature for children Ultimately we pose complicated cultural and linguistic questions that need to be taken into consideration to provide appropriate and original early literacy materials in Ethiopia Keywor ds Ethiopia early literacy childrens literature digital texts Introduction Low literacy rates in some majority world contexts are deemed problematic particularly by the Euro Western world and have precipitated intervention in the form of literacy programs Wickens Sandlin Such programs promote the use of digital texts as an essential component of urgently needed early literacy programs primarily as means to reduce publication costs and increase knowledge mobility United States Agency for International Development USAID These recommendations are set against backdrop of history of donated context insensitive books from the Global North that have had little impact on access Much of the digital material trickling down into the hands of children in the Global South are cultural and linguistic downloads from the same foreign publishers of donated print books which raises ethical concerns about the appropriateness of texts for children and the development of local culture of childrens literature And yet small portion of new texts generated through emergent digital projects do originate internally with local writers illustrators and publishers thereby promising more relevance Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page This paper considers the cultural linguist ic and technological implications of digital models of text production and curation with particular focus on the Ethiopian context of language and literacy To establish this context we describe Ethiopias linguistic and cultural diversity as well as Ethiopian traditions and practices around early reading book culture and storytelling We then present analyses of digital book production projects producing storybooks for children in Ethiopian languages Multiple theoretical framings inform our discuss ion of the deeply complex historical political religious social and economic context of Ethiopian language and literacy It is this context that digital book production projects need to take into account if the aim is to provide means of access to original culturally and linguistically relevant literacy materials for emergent and early readers in Ethiopia We also include information and perspectives from Ethiopian academics writers and publishers who emailed answers to series of questions about their experiences with stories and their views of contemporary childrens reading materials in Ethiopia Perspectives offered through the activities described above illustrate and extend descriptions of th Ethiopian context of language and literacy derived from literature Subsequently we planned focus group discussion with our seven participants about the implications and possibilities of digital book production at the College of Educational and Behavi oral Studies at Addis Ababa University At the request of the Dean of the College however we changed the focus group structure to that of presentation on local digital book production project This presentation was open to all faculty and graduate st udents Comments and questions from attendees inform the second half of this paper The Ethiopian Context Literacy and Linguistic Diversity in Ethiopia According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS the rate of literacy in Ethiopia has dramatically increased over the past years and continues to rise steadily Figures published for suggest that almost of youth are now literate in comparison to reported rate for youth of less than in and about in see Table Over the past few decades there has also been marked increase reported in literacy rates among girls and women to the point that the literacy gap between men and women between the ages of and is now reported to be less than see Table Joshi and Verspoor observe that one impetus for change has been the goal set by the Ethiopian government of becoming middle income country by to MoFED Such goal Joshi and Verspoor note is only possible in countries with high rates of literacy among both men and women and sufficient number of secondary graduates to support middle income economy Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Table Ethiopian Literacy Rates by age for the years and as reported by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS Literacy Rates By Year age and older and older no data Table Ethiopian literacy rates by age and gender as reported by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS Literacy Rates Total Male Female years years and older years and older As acknowledged by the UIS itself potential shortcomings of any set of national statistics such as those cited above relate to how literacy is defined and the methods by which literacy data is collected In International Literacy Statistics Review of Concepts Methodology and Current Data UIS author Roy Carr Hill draws on the work of New Literacy Studies scholars in observing that literacy only has meaning within its particular context of social practice and does not transfer easily across contexts there are different literacy practices in different domains of social life such as education religion workplace public services and family and community activities They change over tim and these different literacies are supported and shaped by different institutions and social relationships UIS The question of how literacy rates have been defined and measured over the past years in Ethiopia is beyond the scope of this paper suffice it to say that the above statistics are offered with the caveat that they are not infallible Collecting reliable literacy data in Ethiopia is challenging for number of reasons not the least of which is that the nation is one of great linguistic and cultural diversity In responding to the census for example citizens reported over languages as mother tongues and identified themselves as belonging to over distinct ethnic groups Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia Language and Literacy Volume Egress Page In working paper on the medium of instruction MoI in Ethiopian schools Vujich offers an overview of key language poli cies over the past years that have influenced literacy practices and achievement in school Drawing on Getachew and Derib he notes that the first official Ethiopian educational language policy emerged in in the form of directive that Amh aric was to be the general language of instruction and that in Amharic was also made the official language in Ethiopias revised constitution thus extending its use beyond the education sector to the political legal and administrative spheres Vujich Notably however Amharic has never been the language of the majority in Ethiopia Census data collected in shows that only of the population reported Amharic or Amaringa as mother tongue Afaan Oromo was in fact the ost common reported mother tongue while the remainder of the population reported over other languages as mother tongues Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia Ultimately the shift toward an Amharic speaking state which has been nterpreted by historians as nation building and power consolidation effort on the part of then Emperor Haile Selassie Getachew Derib Smith Vujich has led to complex scenario whereby many Ethiopian children particularly those in regions where Amharic is not dominant eg Oromia the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region SNNP Somali and Tigraydid have not had access to education in their first language Further at the same time Amharic was set as the medium of instruction MoI in early schooling English was promoted as the MoI in upper primary and secondary schools as well as in teacher training institution Heugh Benson Bogale Yohannes Vijich This meant children had to learn yet anoth er language to gain access to upper elementary and secondary schooling Vijich notes that while the socialist inspired revolution of resulted in formal reversal of Selassies homogenising policies in practice Amharic remained the language of in struction in primary schools principally because teachers most often spoke Amharic and were not trained in the use of local mother tongues Vijich The status quoprimary education in Amharic was nevertheless gradually contested Data collected by the ministry of education in the mid showed that performance in science and technology of students with Amharic as mother tongue was markedly higher than that of students with other first languages and the disadvantage of the MoI for non Amharic speakers was identified as likely cause Vijich This perspective is in line with developing understandings of the importance of the mother tongue in education see for example an extensive review of research on this topic in the recent andscape Report on Early Grade Literacy Kim Boyle Zuilkowski Nakamura As Cummins observes When the mother tongue is promoted in school the concepts language and literacy skills that children are learning in the majority lang uage can transfer to the home language In short both languages nurture each other Bilingual children perform better in school when the school effectively teaches the mother tongue and where appropriate develops literacy in that language By contr ast when childrens mother tongue is encouraged to atrophy and its development stagnates childrens personal and conceptual foundation for learning is undermined Cummins Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Cummins further notes that the challenge for educators and policymakers in highly multilingual settings is to shape the evolution of national identity in such way that the rights of all citizens including school children are respected and the cultural linguistic and economic resources of the nation are maximized To do other than offer education in the mother tongue particularly to children attending school in the very communities their ancestors have inhabited for generations violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child UNCRC which states tha education of children shall be directed toward the development of respect for the childs parents his or her own cultural identity and language and values and that child shall not be denied the right in community with other members of his or her group to enjoy his or her own culture to profess and practise his or her own religion or to use his or her own language United Nations Articles and The African Charter of Rights and Welfare of the Child adopted in by the Or ganisation of African Unity builds on the principles of the UNCRC also emphasizing that childrens education should include the preservation and strengthening of positive African morals traditional values and cultures OAU Article In keepi ng with these perspectives in new policy emerged in Ethiopia guaranteeing children the right to primary education in their first language Cognizant of the pedagogical advantage of the child in learning in mother tongue and the rights of nationali ties to promote the use of their languages primary education will be given in nationality languages Government of Ethiopia Even now however the implementation of this policy remains challenging in areas of high linguistic diversity for numbe of reasons including the difficulty in finding teachers fluent in local languages the challenge of offering teacher training in those languages the paucity of reading materials suitable to the context and the expense of translation when local reading materials are not available In the next section of this paper we focus on the third of these challenges the paucity of reading materials considering in particular the availability of storybooks that might support early literacy development Early Reading Book Culture and Storytelling in Ethiopia Many researchers have argued that early literacy acquisition is best supported by the extensive reading of storybooks particularly those that are closely connected to childrens home and community environments Bronfenbrenners ecological systems theory Bronfenbrenner Morris for example explains the interplay of various embedded contexts eg social legal economic and religious on human development For young childrens development the most immediate and influential environment is the microsystem consisting of the childs family and close community Applying this perspective to the selection of early reading materials for children it is widely acknowledged that the stories children hear and learn to read should include those in wh ich they can see themselves and their worlds the microsystem Such stories are those that describe characters with whom children can easily relate engaging in recognizable activities such as familiar childhood games or customary family and community pract ices As development progresses early childhood educators scaffold childrens reading materials to extend beyond immediate family and community contexts Acknowledging and drawing on childrens funds of knowledge Moll Greenberg in early learning settings respectfully and effectively supports literacy development Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page especially with children of diversity Moll Gonzalez Moll and his colleagues define funds of knowledge as those historically accumulated and culturally developed bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and wellbeing Moll Gonzalez Similarly the schema theory of reading proposed by Anderson and Pearson posits that comprehension requires the ability to relate reading or viewing to ones own schema or knowledge which includes content knowledge and knowledge of textual forms Recognizing the funds of knowledge and schemata students bring to classroom settings and providing reading materials that are both linguistic ally meaningful and culturally relevant allows beginning readers not only to identify with characters settings and events but also to understand vocabulary and cultural themes Thus along with the rise of multicultural childrens picture books have bee discussions of cultural authenticity in relation to both written subject matter and illustrations Fox Short Although some argue for specific definitions Smith and Wiese broadly define cultural authenticity as the extent to which the reteller adaptor or illustrator remains reasonably true to the original printed source accurately and respectfully represents the values and beliefs of the cultural group and responsibly depicts geographical historical and cultural details In the Ethiopian context there is not long tradition of the publication of the sorts of early reading materials described abovethat is illustrated books for children This is not because there is no history of literacy and book production in Ethiopia On the contrary as Winslow observes the Ethiopian tradition of manuscript production is one of the longest in the world and scribal practices that are centuries old are still practiced where they have been lost elsewhere Isolationist for period of almost years due to geopolitical and religious factors Ethiopia has preserved many practices intact from the medieval period including the production of parchment manuscripts Consequently Winslow remarks contemporary scholars of manuscript culture look to Ethiopia for an understanding of medieval book production techniques Figure Evidence of long history of literacy and book culture in Ethiopia scribe in Lalibela preparing texts for sale to tourists parchment manuscript date unknown written in Geez located in high mountain rock hewn church approximately km from Lalibela Photos TM Dobson personal archives Historically the primary script used for manuscript production in Ethiopia was Geez language for writing liturgical scholarly and literary work that is no longer in Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page general use beyond he church Scelta Quezzaire Belle Elsewhere in most settings outside the church communications were in oral form Notes McCann the written form as bureaucratic exercise did not supplant the oral tradition until well into the modern era Not surprisingly therefore book culture in Ethiopia is still strongly tied to its liturgical and scholarly origins and books are serious objects for serious content Figure Publishing storybooks for children is unique notion for many in Ethiopia Storytelling for children instead remains primarily oral genre In an effort to get sense of perspectives on and experiences with early literacy texts in Ethiopia we sought input from seven Ethiopian citizens involved in education and book production These participants all professionals included member of an NGO working in early literacy projects university faculty in education an author of childrens books in major indigenous Ethiopian languages and local publisher Planned Sky pe interviews were not possible due to challenges with connectivity so participants answered questions via email Asked about the most common types of stories in their own homes growing up they listed riddles songs indoor and outdoor games animal stor ies and fables The functions of these stories according to one participant are to teach kids how to socialize to make critical thinkers learn manners and to entertain Riddles for instance help children to think critically Participant NGO Memb er Another intimated that storytelling is primarily didactic in nature Children are expected to attend carefully during storytelling sessions right up to the point that the message is made clear Grandparents are more willing than parents to tell stor ies to children When grandparent tells story children sit around herhim and listen Usually they sit rounding the fireplace in home When the teller tells orally from hisher memory children listen with strict discipline They can smile gesture nd even laugh But they do not shout move from place to place and push each other They listen until the teller finishes and tells message of the story Participant Professor of Childhood Studies Participants identified the tellers of these stories family and community members including grandmothers mothers fathers uncles aunts and neighbours One participant remarked that siblings also tell the stories to one another point that is also emphasized by Jirata in his work on the oral radition among the Guji Oromo in Southern Ethiopia Most remarked that the stories they recall were told orally from memory regularly in the evening before bed One reported hearing stories through radio and television observing there was popular stor yteller called Ababa Tesfaye on TV childrens show in my time Participant Publisher Another participant published Ethiopian YA author who responded to our questions via email captured the richness of storytelling sessions by noting the different environments in which his mother and father orated My father came from an Oromo family and he used to tell us about his home town and my mother came from Amhara family and she used to tell us about her home town In Ethiopia extended coffee ceremony is common and neighbors are called as most house wives are around and find excuses to start telling about it Sometimes my Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page mother speaks about the same story again and again had very strong grandmother yet neighbors were afraid of her Most believed she was more than years old She was like legend My mother told stories about her grandmother passed away at years old Unsure though as no birth certificates could get clues of her age by what she spoke about historically Even men were afraid of her She was very logical She was part of relatively well off countryside family She was very bossy and supervised the men over their work She was ahead of her time by assuming the responsibility herself for mens work and anyones work She remain center topic of stories today My father had business and my siblings and used to go to where the restaurant business is located He used to tell stories about his home town not necessarily for us but for customers and others Then we used to listen what he had to say Father was Oromo when he came to the city he suffered exploitation He started restaurant business in Addis and was forced to change his name to Amharic to get customers His wife was Amharic at the time this was cultural no no to give daughter to an Oromo man From my fathers stories learned about things more indirectly than directly as he wasnt necessarily talking to me but to his customers and friends and would be around pretending to play but also listening Participant Ethiopian Writer no editorial changes have been made to these notes Notably in keeping with the Ecological Systems Theory discussed earlier which stresses the immediacy and import of the microsystem the stories alluded to here are of hometowns and important people therein Over the lengthy process of preparing coffee roasting grinding boiling filtering pouring the women find excuses to start telling about it the neuter pronoun here presumably referring to the recurring story of the legendary grandmother and her prescient behaviours that pushed the boundaries of ge nder roles The story is not explicitly didactic and formal as is the case in another participants earlier description of children sitting attentively and waiting for the message Nor are the fathers stories examples of direct instruction specifically intended for children rather children glean from these adult stories by eavesdropping while pretending to play If we view emergent and early reading materials as most appropriate when they reflect the microsystem then it stands to reason that initial efforts at publishing childrens literature in Ethiopia have drawn on the stories of the oral tradition commonly told in the home and community When we asked our participants to list appropriate subjects or topics for young childrens books they proposed that literature for early reading should be about animals the environment or surroundings eg trees rivers etc holidays people in the localities stories with morals and the common story topics Regarding to the last suggestion the partici pant in question named several Ethiopian fables that are recognizable as part of the oral tradition including biblical tale The Monkey and the Lion The Wise Man and Foolish Man and The Clever Children In writing about the oral tradition of th Guji Oromo in southern Ethiopia Jirata notes The concept of oral practice signifies oral tradition as comprising cultural genres that include myths legends folktales jokes proverbs riddles chants blessings curses insults folk songs and folk beliefs The concept of oral process denotes oral Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page tradition as events of social interaction and entails performances such storytelling riddling singing dancing joking and chanting Thus oral tradition can be understood as cultural practices produced and reproduced through oral interactions Given this complexity story forms for very young children which by necessity are orally transmitted are regularly the last to make the transition to writing in any culture and are still deemed nascent in many traditions of writing eg Salisbury Styles reticence to render such oral practices into writing in any context stems at least partially from the fact that performative elements are difficult if not impossible to transmediate The bridge from oral to written forms is made in childrens books to some degree through reliance on illustration to support and extend verbal content This multimodal element of childrens texts inevitably becomes factor in the cost and ease of their production both in print and digital environments In the next section we discuss several initiatives having an impact on access to early storybooks in Ethiopia Digital Texts for Young Readers in Ethiopia As noted earlier we hoped to plan follow up focus group session with our seven participants at Ad dis Ababa University in May however we were asked by the Dean to open the session to all faculty and students and to convert the format to more formal presentation on the production of digital books for early literacy in Ethiopia Thirteen facul ty and graduate students in fields related to education and early childhood development along with one NGO representative attended our May workshop Consideration for the Production of Digital Books for Early Literacy in Majority World Contexts In this presentation we contemplated the ways literacy is being fostered particularly in reference to the lack of readily available childrens storybooks in Ethiopian indigenous languages We also introduced three approaches to digital access that may lead to increased availability of early reading materials the International Childrens Digital Library ICDL the CODE Ethiopia Digital Books and Family Literacy Project and two crowdsourcing projects aimed at generating large multilingual digital corpora namely Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project Because the seminar room did not have connectivity we presented all these projects as screen captures via data projector Below is discussion of these projects in consideration of the responses from our workshop participant group The International Childrens Digital Library ICDL The ICDL is an open access curated collection of books that is primarily designed as read only platform The ICDL goal as stated on their website is to build collection that represents outstanding historical and contemporary books from throughout the world Ultimately the Foundation aspires to have every culture and language represented so that every child can know and appreciate the riches childrens literature from the world community International Childrens Digital Library para Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page With volumes in languages this project having launched in November is about halfway to the stated goal of collecting volume in languages Druin et al ICDL Users are not invited to author stories although they can add metadata to existing stories in the form of keyword tags The ICDL Collection Development Policy makes clear that the primary focus making available existing published volumes that are currently available in print and within copyright out of print but within the copyright protection of the country in which they were published or freely available in the public domain there is no explicit solicitation for new materials International Childrens Digital Library In other words this is primarily print digitization project geared toward creating an open educational resource in the form of digital corpus of previous ly published childrens books in multiple languages The ICDL was prescient in terms of recognizing the need for resource of this type however the requirement of negotiating copyright for most of the volumes added slows the growth of the collectionat time when there is immediate need for early reading materials in some contexts Additionally by collecting already published work the project is not aimed at the root problem discussed earlier that there are few if any published storybooks in many lang uages used as MoI in early education within and beyond Ethiopia At the time of writing this paper there were only two books listed by country as Ethiopian in the ICDL BothFafis Sheep and Lions Tale are traditional stories in Amharic that were ori ginally published in and respectively by the Ethiopian Books for Children and Educational Foundation The CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project The second project we introduced was the CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project This began as small scale pilot intended to complement national reform in education aimed at improving access and equity in early childhood care and education Et hiopian Ministry of Education The project initially targeted children aged to and their families in three rural areas where appropriate reading materials for the target group were unavailable The primary objectives were to develop culturally nd linguistically meaningful early reading materials written and illustrated by local writers and artists to provide access to and guided experience with the texts in family literacy program and to invite communities to write stories relevant to their contexts thereby fostering an interest in the writing of stories within communities Abebe Asselin Dorion Abebe CODE Ethiopia Ethiopia based librarians writers and CODE Ethiopia members initially selected six stories common to the oral tradition Abebe notes that these were made available in two local languages Amharic and Afaan Oromo and that the themes of the stories related to animals school life and friendship np Notably most are moral or religious tales with strong didactic element Colonial influence in the Ethiopian oral tradition is also evident in the selection of Wondime Yakob Brother Jacob or Frre Jacques described on the project site as the Amharic version of the well known French nursery rhyme with melody that is almost the same as the French one CODE Ethiopia Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Although the rhyme is heavily adapted to the point that it is dissimilar to the original rhyme in most respects the story describes the morning routine of brother and sister who wake each other up and later go to school to acquire knowledge Although this CODE Ethiopia pilot work was initially couched as digital book project the book production model is consistent with contemporary approaches to print publication CO DE Ethiopia deemed dual platform approach necessity that is all books must be produced in such way that multiple copies of each text can be distributed in either print or digital formats In this respect conventional design approach for Western onographs is employed Books are construed as artefacts with title page front matter and multiple pages featuring text and image with margins see Figure Printed versions can be produced quickly for home reading or if hardware or power fails via photocopier see Figure Given this model there is limited opportunity to explore the multimodal affordances of digital platforms affordances such as audio and video features that might be better suited to setting with strong oral tradition Instead the bulk of digital materials produced might be described as print adaptations Joyce Both print and digital versions of the books produced in the context of this project are distributed under Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial license Figure Fantu ena ekiduwa Fantu and her Plan is the story of Grade student who tells about her daily activities Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Printed copies of the Afaan Oromo version of New Year and Children Ayyaana Waggaa fi Daaimman Beyond production of the six books there was focus on building corpus of context sensitive texts by inviting each of the three communities involved in the pilot to contribute two stories commonly told in their own contexts CODE Ethiopia selected and edited three of the resulting stories and had them illustrated by the project illustrator Atilabachew Reda Original books from this project along with the three contributed by communities have now been translated into six Ethiopian languages Each translation was treated with extreme care for sensitivity to context including attendance to local dialects and customs as well as reworking of illustrations to reflect local settings Consider for example three unique covers for the Amharic Afaan Oromo and Somali versions of New Year and Children Figures The nine books have been prepared in PDF formats and are loaded onto tablets for use in ongoing literacy projects managed by CODE Ethiopia They have also been acquired by the African Storybook Project Those who attended the session commented favourably on this project and the demonstrable feasibility of the approach with regard to future literacy and collection building endeavours Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Amharic version of New Year and Children with cover reflecting traditional dress of the Amhara Region Figure One of two given the unique dialects of this language Oromo versions of New Year and Children with cover reflecting dress common in the Dire Dawa area Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Somali version of New Year and Children with cover reflecting Muslim dress common in the Somali Region Outsourcing to the rowd Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project The third and fourth approach we introduced were crowdsourcing initiatives that harness the collective wisdom of communities in the quest to develop large corpora rapidly specifically Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project ASb Both projects llow users to read download translate and create stories Like ICDL Bloom has global scope while ASb has an African focus Bloom sets out the problem that both projects aim to address on its splash page observing that literacy educators are regular ly faced with too few books in localized indigenous language settings to successfully foster literacy We know that it takes stacks of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the practice needed to develop true literacy The problem has been who will make all those books How will we find the time Where will we get the content So we settle for the possible and hope for the best Bloom Library para Therefore key challenge addressed by such projects similar to the CODE Ethiopia project is building interest in story writing and the capacity for bookmaking in local communities where collections of reading materials are not available To this end Bloom dramatically lowers the bar by providing simple touse software and range of book templates so that many more people can get involved in building large collection of local language books Bloom Library Data from the Internet Archive show that Bloom Library and ASb were launched at roughly the same time The Archive shows Bloom Library had launched at bloomlibraryorg by July meanwhile by September ASb had launched preliminary site announc ing its initiative at africanstorybookorg and provided site with functionality for users by May Both projects have since collected many volumes in the case of Bloom Library and almost in the case of ASb Unlike ICDL and Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Bloom Libra ry there is not readily apparent count of the total number of books on ASb although up until April it was possible to estimate based on summing the totals in each category and assuming books did not regularly appear in multiple categories The slower growth of Bloom Library despite its global scope is likely matter of accessibility Bloom Library requires users to download software before reading and uploading stories and this software is only available for PC and Linux standalone computers For creators Bloom Library also recommends the installation of The Art of Reading curated collection of line drawings fonts and typing script for lord who do not have way to type their own language The fact that download is required to create and read and that there is no compatibility for the Mac OS undoubtedly reduces the number of users of and contributors to the Bloom Library Nevertheless this approach evidently does have benefits for instance it offers way for users to create offline which is major consideration for settings with unreliable Internet access ASb on the other hand has circumvented such platform wars by opting for web application based on JavaScript and hosted in Drupal shell No registration or local software is required to read or download ASb books The only potential impediment to submit or version ie translate story is the creation of an account Thus the ASb collection having removed all barriers to access other than connectivity is growing most rapidly of all It is also noteworthy that strong promotion of translation or versioning by the ASb has contributed to the rapid growth of its corpus point to which we will return Both the Bloom Library and ASb growth rates eclipse that of the pr ojects discussed earlier recall that it has taken the ICDL years to collect volumes Clearly the possible described by Bloom Library in opting for crowdsourcing over curation is coming to fruition what is less clear is whether their hope or the best in taking this approach is being realized As Porcello and Hsi note in speaking of the variable quality of open educational resources OER there are benefits and drawbacks to crowdsourcing approaches On one hand collections using rowdsourcing allow wide range of online users to contribute choosing their own descriptions and keywords to catalog review and manage OERs This can produce large and loose collections Although dedicated users from the resulting online communities might be more willing to detail their instructional experiences and personal connections to OERs overall quality may be quite variable On the other hand having professional staff with disciplinary expertise populate catalog and maintain curated collecti ons usually results in fine tuned coherent and smaller collections Although these collections grow more slowly often with less vocal user communities they can quickly respond to new quality or educational standards Porcello Hsi As we considered the possibilities of the crowdsourcing projects for the Ethiopian context with those in attendance the question of reimagining texts for different contexts through versioning and adaptation became main point of interest At the time of our presentation in Addis Ababa there were no volumes in Ethiopian languages in the Bloom Library collection this continues to be the case There was however growing collection of books on ASb As noted earlier connectivity was unavailable for our workshop so we selected four Amharic books as examples and Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page included representative screen captures within our presentation These were as follows Fantu and her Plan CODE Ethiopia book with which the group was familiar How Many counting book ith simple sketches of insects birds and mammals The Girl Who Got Rich moral story about two poor hungry sisters who separately encounter leper woman with magical powers and receive different fates in accordance with their treatment of her an Like to Read simple text for early readers about boy who enjoys reading and wanders about his home trying to find family members with whom he can share his story Beyond the CODE Ethiopia text all of the above books are versioned from other languages not indigenous to Ethiopia The counting book How Manywritten by Clare Verbeek Thembani Dladla and Zanele Buthelezi and illustrated by Sandra McDougall first appeared in Zulu It was originally produced through the Seed Books project of the School of Education and Development and the Centre for Adult Education at the University of KwaZulu Natal South Africa The Girl Who Got Rich is by Ugandan author Salaama Wanale written in Lumasaaba and versioned by the same author to Amharic The illustr ations are attributed to Mango Tree which is apparently Mango Tree Educational Enterprises Ugandan educational consulting firm Doherty personal communication March Finally Like to Read is written by Letta Machogo in Sepedi with illustrations by Wiehan de Jager both of South Africa The Amharic translation is by Sehin Tefera and Mezemir Girma Like to Read One example of versioning for the Ethiopian context Of the four texts the first three drew little in the way of comment or response The group was familiar with the CODE Ethiopia text The second two texts How Many and The Girl Who Got Rich depicted items or settings that were familiar local animals in the first case and the traditional tukal homes common in East Africa in the latter The fourth text Like to Read drew an audible gasp of surprise What garnered the groups attention was not the story but the illustrations The cover and first pag spread show smartly dressed boy in well appointed home He is seated in an orange upholstered chair next to which is leafy plant in large vase landscape painting hangs on the vibrant green wall behind him and it appears there is wall towall carpeting on the floor like to read or like reading declares the boy see Figure On the second page spread he stands at the door of his baby sisters room He is searching for someone with whom he can read The baby is sleeping soundly in white crib large soother in her mouth mobile comprised of smiling stars hangs above the crib The walls appear to be papered in pink with cloud wall appliqu positioned next to the crib Who can read to the boy asks see Figure Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Like to Read first page spread Figure like to Read second page spread Those in attendance were not familiar with the crowdsourcing approach of the ASb that results in stories migrating across contexts through versioning or adaptation At first glance it would be easy for any reader to overlook metadata and surmise that story written in Amharic should be of Ethiopian origin But the images so clearly not reflecting Ethiopian settings made the book untenable and created discomfort The illustrations are by Wiehan de Jager designer from Cape Town South Africa They reflect mixed design elements mostly of European origin from Colonial Revival Style eg machine milled trim and moulding to Mid Century Modern eg simple lines geometric patterns and aesthetic contrast In Ethiopian homes however such design features wallpaper mouldings carpeting mobiles cribs and so on are rare Many homes especially in rural areas are constructed with mud plastered wooden walls and grass roofs and single room may serve for sleeping keeping all household belongings cooking and dining keeping warm by burning wood and also for tethering domes tic animals at night Animut Balkew Lindtjrn study showed that of Ethiopian homes have flooring of earth and sand or dung and that use one room for sleeping Family beds are the norm Only of rural households have pi ped Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page water and of rural households have electricity Toilets are often shared among several households even in urban settings Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia This reality stands in contrast to the domestic spaces pictured by Wieh an de Jager in Like to Read He depicts the protagonist wandering through home comprised of multiple rooms living room nursery and kitchenbefore venturing out to the front of the house where he finds men fixing car on paved driveway Figure This last detail is also incongruent with local context in consideration of the fact that Ethiopia stands near the bottom of the cars percapita list globally at or vehicles per people eg Deloitte Figure Like to Rea seventh page spread Illustrations from Like to Read provoked comment among presentation attendees about the disjuncture between such images and the reality of Ethiopian settings Participants discussed the challenge of finding balance between generating culturally sensitive reading materials and steering clear of ethnocentrism One individual emphasized that texts should be reflective of and consistent with the particular social context of the intended readership Another agreed stipulating that hen children learn to read it must be with culturally relevant materials There was clear aversion among many present to the concept of generic readers texts designed for learning to read in contrast to authentic context specific stories Yet one erson presented another perspective suggesting that stories serve as means of socialization and can be viewed as vehicles of ethnocentrism This prompted the question To what extent should or can stories be bias or culture free One speaker argued for the merit of stories designed for literacy learning that are transferable across cultures while another suggested stories such as Like to Read are not artefacts of bias but evidence of Ethiopias diversity Still another claimed that ethnocentrism is sy stemic and that an exclusive focus on culturally sensitive texts would further promote this perspective In considering these responses it is important to note that the presentation attendees were unaware the story was versioned rather than an original ork in Amharic Evaluating books from various projects was not the focus of the session the aim rather was to put forth more broadly the affordances of digital means of knowledge mobilization for early Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page literacy education in the Ethiopian context In making book selections therefore we did not attend to which stories were versioned and which were originally in Amharic intending merely to flick through screen captures to show that number of Amharic books were available and then to invite attendees to look at the ASb site themselves plan the lack of connectivity in our seminar room prevented Ultimately however we would suggest it is very likely that many ASb readers who make keyword searches for stories in particular target languages will not be aware if they encounter unique or versioned stories Without the presence of clear statements indicating the versioning history of the narrativestory biographies if you will it would be easy for those readers not attuned to the way in which the corpus is produced to overlook metadata and like our audience find an unexpected disjuncture between the context suggested by the text and the context suggested by the illustrations In report on the African Storybook Project Welch and Glennie sta te that versioned stories make up the bulk of the corpus End ofmonth statistics from January through June show the ratio of the number of versioned stories to the number of unique stories is consistently greater than to Like to Read alone had been versioned times at the time of the writing of this paper into range of languages indigenous to Africa and otherwise Furthermore the story is typically translated not from the Sepedi version which is given the status of being the orig inal story but from one of two English instantiations Both are also by the story author Letta Machoga but have slight lexical variations Like to Read and Love to Read Notably our analysis of the versions of Like to Read was completed before changes to the ASb interface effected in early April buried the site metadata at least for the moment to the point that it is no longer possible to trace the versioning history of stories Welch and Glennie explain that the ASb has activel pursued translation as an effective way to build the corpus noting that each story can be translated into multiple languages for no cost and that workshops with local language speakers have proved very effective They remark in particular on successful translation workshop with participants that produced versions of seven existing stories In many ways this is an exciting initiative In an ASb blog post on versioning Dorcus Wepukhulu Kenya based coordinator for the ASb observes that translation workshop participants become involved in complex discussions about matters of translation pondering appropriateness to context text level and so on They consider for example whether they are engaging in translation or adapt ation depending on the extent of the nature of changes to the text eg whether the aim is to stay as close to original narrative as possible or to adapt for context suitability They grapple with dialects and regional preferences as well as with the appropriateness of oral or written constructions Wepukhulu The language work described by Wepukhulu is clearly careful but the matter of how illustrations are managed through the process of versioning is worrisome Wepukhulu ends her writing pondering this dilemma There is the issue of whether can adapt the text and retain the illustrations or could adapt illustrations and retain the text At the moment it is not possible to do the latter How can adapt actionsevents in story without having to adapt illustrations Wepukhulu np Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page As we have seen in consideration of Like to Read the question is broader than this Even if the translation reflects the source very closely that is to say if actions and events are unaltered to the extent that this is possible in translation failure to bring illustrations in line with the intended context could derail meaning for young readers In texts for emergent and early readers illustrations are integral to meaning making There is much research in this area that is beyond the scope of this paper suffice it to say that picture books work through the integration of visual and verbal meanings eg Painter Martin Unsworth mergent readers use pictures as primary clues to construct meaning and may benefit from texts in which images reinforce the verbal meaning eg Anderson Hiebert Scott Wilkenson Clay Harste Woodward Burke Books for more advanced readers may evidence increasingly complex use of illustration to reinforce extend or interrogate the verbal aspects of the text Evans In spite of wealth of knowledge about the critical role of images in childrens literature both crowdsourcing projects appear to privilege the verbal ov er the visual elements by relying on stock illustrations or promoting image reuse Bloom Library project of global scale offers curated collection of line drawings The Art of Reading This free collection contains more than line drawings sui table for use in reading materials Bloom Library ASb has offered cost benefit analysis for image reuse An important additional dimension is that it is possible to produce these storybooks at fraction of the cost of original titles because he illustrations are re usable and the digital tools exist for publishing of translation in the same format The African Storybook commissions high quality digital illustrations at an average cost of USD per page book Each translation and adapta tion makes use of the same illustrations So the initial investment in the book is spread across the or more versions of the book that are created In addition the professional illustrations are stored in the African Storybook image bank and can be use not only for translations and adaptations of storybook but combined to create new storybooks Welch Glennie Although ASb project members report that the stories are written and illustrated by Africans Stranger Johannessen it is not clear that this is in fact the case Listed illustrators for some books for instance are widely accessible image banks and Internet image search engines such as Google Even in the case that illustrators and writers are African the ques tion remains as to whether these illustrations and writings are transportable across the exceedingly diverse continent that is Africa as we have seen in the case of Like to Read Are the drawings of Weihan De Jager white designer and specialist in co rporate branding living in South Africa relevant in settings associated with the many languages into which the book has now been translated Suggesting this should be the case as intimated in the cost analysis above seems dangerously close to the sort of one size fitsall racial ethnic territorial or geopolitical essentialism that has long plagued Africa putting what is clearly valuable project in danger of being cast as an engine of neo colonialism Most certainly this cost saving strategy runs counter to the ASb goal Children need to have books in familiar language with stories that reflect their context and experience as well as their hopes for the future so that they can connect with them emotionally Welch Glennie Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page It is not our intent to dismiss the important work of Bloom Library or the ASb but rather to enter into conversation about the benefits and drawbacks of various methodologies for building corpus of early reading materials that is highly sensitive to cultu ral context While template driven production approaches crowdsourcing open licences and versioning may build corpus quickly and at low cost they are all Western models of knowledge production and mobilization that require careful navigation when used for the generation of culturally sensitive literary materials for primarily oral contexts Literary culture childrens literature and mass literacy has developed over hundreds of years in the global North ultimately we wonder what is the effect of accelerating the process in particular settings with newly literate populations Evidently there is much work to be done in examining the limitations and affordances of various models for this proposed work Conclusion Many have represented low literacy rates in majority world contexts as crisis and range of literacy programs have been initiated in responsesome of which we have discussed in this paper We view these programs as exceedingly valuable in many ways We also recognize however even as we acknowledge our involvement in such projects two of the authors of this paper spearheaded the CODE Ethiopia project described earlier that we must continue to engage in critical conversations about the impacts both positive and negative of various interventions As Graff rightly observed almost four decades ago it is not given that literacy translates to economic social and cultural success On the contrary literacy is often used by those in authority as the vehicle for the efficient training of the population and the maintenance of hegemony Graff As Luke has observed in contemporary human capital models of education advocated by institutions such as UNESCO levels of literacy ontinue to be taken as robust predictors of economic take off industrial development and indeed socioeconomic and political enfranchisement Wickens and Sandlin suggest that in spite of the fact that the literacy community is fully aw are that literacy is inherently politicaland that many current programs continue social control there is persistent suggestion that literacy education is vital in all parts of the globe even in contexts with strong oral traditions Thus its absence is met with panicked movements to address perceived lack as quickly as possible Ultimately in reference to programs of potential relevance in the Ethiopian context we ask the following questions What are the implications of initiatives that impose Western models of literacy in contexts with strong oral traditions What is the long term effect of rapid injection of literary materials on emergent communities of literary artists and illustrators in local contexts What are the limitations of current appro aches that lean toward template driven dual platform publication and perhaps obscure the possibility of multimodal approaches In contexts where the oral transmission of knowledge prevails are there possibilities for more innovative multimodal approache that might harness the affordances of digital publication None of these are easy questions but they are vital as we consider conditions for inclusion and equity across multiple communities languages forums and expressive modes within the Ethiopian ontext and

high school in Tangerang Indonesia tota of students are taken as the sample in the current study The randomized pretest posttest control group design was used in the study Using quasi experimental research nonequivalent control group design the students in the experimental groups comp leted the process through digital storytelling The students test and questionnaires were used to collect the data In order to test whether there was an improvement within groups and to see if there were differences between groups the hypotheses were te sted using the test and obtaining gain scores The result showed that the visual memory and writing skill of students undergoing digital storytelling technique and of those undergoing conventional teaching but no significant differences were found betwee the two conditions They had same proficiency focused and same concentration during the learning process and the students had many opinions in experimental class Based on the percentages students post test showed that students visual memory was mor dominant than students writing skill after applying digital storytelling Moreover this research also found that students learning motivation was very good and created good of class atmosphere in experimental class during the learning process by usi ng digital storytelling Keywords digital storytelling visual memory writing skill INTRODUCTION In the acquisition and fluency of language skills may be directly involved visual memory Magnussen said that memory is retain stimulus information in memory which is assessed in term precision Visual memory is one of the power to remember or recall such as images scenes words and other information which presented visually Visual memory is important to develop because according to Phillips Christie visual memory has role in wide variety of everyday tasks It has also been considered fundamental on every type of academic learning The students should be able to visualiz the stimulus in their mind Visual memory is complex process for students Current theory of visual working memory inv olving capacity and resolution as the two important aspects of visual working memory storage Yao Chen and Qian The memory storage system of working memory includes subsystems They maintain verbal spatial and visual information The feel is so hard to remember with what they have seen so the students should learn and understand the ability to store and recall mental images in the memory efficiently to help their learning foreign language Michel et al This memory will store in short term memory as many as students should remember with the duration is briefly to Imam Sudarmaji Agus Mulyana Karsiyah Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students visual memory and writing skill see Acco rding to Baddeley et al that short term memory is able to store limited quantities of information for limited periods of time So if the students did not pay attention they will feel difficult in pl acing visual which means that they need stimuli for be able to visualize The students may have difficulty during several operations such as remembering general view of words in reading and writing also sequencing the letters if such skills have not impro ved While writing is one of the four skills in English The students felt that writing is as more complicated than the other skills and became challenging area of language learning Jabali Javed et al said that even native speakers of English can feel difficulty in demonstrating good of writing The students often feel confused when they are using the rules of writing such as grammatical and they also lac of vocabulary According to Maazi Janfesha and Nik et al said that writing has an important role which is assumed as the most complex process Sylvester Greenidge stated that writing has difficulty to start and it is very complex process to write although after the teacher assists the students for prewriting activities such as brainstorming to generate the ideas or supports an upcoming writing assignment Learning to write is difficult and complex process because it concerned with the knowledge bout the structure of language Rusinovci Students also need to know how to express their idea feeling opinion critical thinking in written text Fadhly The stud ents still do not understand how to write in English and they dont know their mistakes on their writing The technique or strategies to teach writing may not be interesting for the students Klimova claimed that if the teacher uses appropriate techniquestrategies to teach the students it can be more inter esting and considers students personality Writing instruction in language teaching and learning can improve students writing skill Coker et al Teacher should pay attention to the students writing strategies and the types of writing instructions Bai Palermo and Thomson The current advancement in the information and communicatio technology ICT or digital era has provided the learners with various tools with the form of computer based or Internet based resources Many teachers ow use digital tools in addition to other instruction methods and not as substitute learning Hillmayr et al Digital Learning can help students take charge of their own lear ning and make them fun Schmoelz Zwart et al The use of digital technology can amplify this experience and provide concrete support in the development of language and communication skills Rubegni and Landoni Thang et al One of the technique in language teaching is digital storytelling DST DST technique helps students develop their better language skills and this technique can be considered as an essential tool in foreign language learning and teaching Razmi Pourali and Nozad DST which combines the characteristic of storytelling with different interactive media tools can benefit language learning in variety of ways It was found to encourage and motivate students and at the same time enhance their communication skills Cierci and Gultekin Thang et al DST helps students to find apply learn and share each other various amount of vocabulary and moreover helps them to think critically due to the limitation of script writing and presen ted digitally Tajeri Syal and Marzban Teachers can provide students sharing experience to enhance learning through seeing hearing and feeling Beck and Sitzman DST is also good technique that suitable for the students to teach visual memory and writing also can help the students to improve their visual memory capacity and writing skill Sarica and Usluel Some researcher said that digital storytelling gives positive effect for the students According to Gallets that through storytelling students can be mo re thinking and imaginative skill Also their mental process played more active role Story will influence memory and the storytelling can facilitate students cognitive changes Schank and Abelson Besides visual memory digital storytelling can be used as an effective learning tool to improve students writing skill Xu et al Campbell Yang Wu Sarica Usluel Yama Ulusoy Tarigan Liana Abdel Hack Helwa also said that through digital storytelling narrative writing and critical thinking skills were developed In the latest decade many researc her conducted the research to investigate the use of digital story telling in language learning First Eman Mohamed Hasnaa Sabry had research which investigated the effectiveness of using digital storytelling and Weblogs instruction english language REVIEW Journal of English Education

instruction is effective in enhancing the EFL narrative writing and critical thinking skills among EFL majors at Faculty of Education Second Sarica Usluel investigated the effect of digital storytelling on the visual memory capacity and writing skills of students in primary school Then Tarigan Liana conducted the research to examine the effectiveness of us ing digital story telling in teaching writing skill of students in higher education or university The result showed that the students writing skill are improved after implementing digital story telling as the teaching media The study showed that digital story telling is effective to enhance students writing skill The previous research focus on the subject in primary school and university The current study intend to confirm the use of digital storytelling as language teaching technique in foreign lan guage class in senior secondary school The focus of the study is to know whether there is any significant effect of digital storytelling on the students visual memory and writing skill to know which one is more dominant between students visual memory nd writing skill and to know how the students learning motivation and class atmosphere through applying digital storytelling METHOD This study used experimental method The design of this study was quasi experimental research nonequivalent contro group design The researcher chose this design because according to Fraenkel et al there were two different classes treatment namely experimental class and control class and do not include the use of random assignment This study was conducted by the researcher who taught in two different classes namely experimental class and control class Where experimental class was the class that applied by using digital

Year While the sample was students in MIPA Science Class as the experimental group and MIPA Science Class as the control group The researcher chose the sample based on the previous information their pro ficiency and their relevancy with the study purpose The data of this study was quantitative data The quantitative data were obtained by the scores of students task from pre test and post test Writing test instrument and questionnaire are used to co llect the data After the students visual memory and writing scores had been collected the researcher analyzed the data using one paired ttest to see the comparison between pre test and posttest mean scores and to see the effect of using digital storyt elling on students visual memory and writing skill It also enabled the researcher to know the dominant between visual memory and writing skill after applying digital storytelling While questionnaire were used to know the added value that wanted to be nown in the achievement of students learning outcomes was the students learning motivation and class atmosphere RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The classroom observation data showed that the result of experimental class and control class In experimental class the researcher started by giving materials about narrative text and how to write narrative text by using digital it such as by Power Point Then show the videos of the stories including with the sound system After students watched some pictures of the stories showed to them They have to remember and understand of the story and can re write the story of narrative text that they remembered While in control class the researcher gave the material about narrative text and how to write it by using convent ional teaching gallery walk They have to remember Imam Sudarmaji Agus

the whiteboard Then asked the students to rewrite the story of narrative text that they remembered This research also easured the level of motivation of students after learning by using digital storytelling technique Questionnaire of learning motivation that has been given to the students in experimental class during the learning process Besides measuring of the learnin motivation researcher also measured the level of the class atmosphere The score of class atmosphere was obtained from questionnaire that has been given to the students in experimental class during the learning process by using digital storytelling tech nique Students score of visual memory The students score in experimental class and control class are increased As the Minimum Mastery Criterion KKM at the tenth grade is Based on the result that there was no students not pass on visual memo ry in experimental class that taught by using digital storytelling technique students can pass KKM values means the students got the score than as KKM values While based on the visual memory test that was given in control class the researcher ot the total score was students could not pass KKM values and students could pass KKM values It means almost all of students in control class have score more than Even though there are several students got the score gain with KKM values Students score of writing skill The students score in experimental class and control class are increased but many students have score below the minimum criteria KKM In experimental class students could not achieve KKM values and students co uld achieve KKM values While in control class students could not achieve KKM values and students could achieve KKM values It can be seen from graphic below Figure Students post test in experiment and

storytelling that applied by the researcher has no difference to improve the students writing skill at the tenth of high school in Tangerang From the students analysis of visual memory and writing skill taught by using digital storytelling in experimental class and by using gallery walk in cont rol class the researcher has found the result of students visual memory and writing skill The researcher have just given the pretest treatment and post test in order to know the students visual memory and writing skill The result of teaching visu al memory and writing skill taught by the researcher using digital storytelling technique was good because the students scores are increased between pre test and post test score So their visual memory and writing skill had improved The score of post test was higher than pre test In visual memory students can pass KKM values and in writing skill students can pass KKM values Based on the percentages students post test of visual memory is more dominant than writing skill after applying digita storytelling technique The testing of research hypotheses indicated that Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected it means there is no significant difference of using digital storytelling on the students visual memory and writing skill This research is re lated with the previous research such as from Sarica Usluel about visual memory that is no statistical difference was found that the students less interaction with visuals in experimental class than control class But this research did not correspond to Sarica Usluel for writing skill that can be said the significant result to improve writing skill of students in experimental and control class Also from Yama Ulusoy stated that through digital storytelling could successfully result in improvement students writing skill Tarigan Liana said that the students writing skill after using digital storytelling technique was significantly higher than before their used Although fundamentally that vi sual memory need to take long time to develop because the growth of memory capacity begins in infancy and continues through early adulthood Terry While also for writing is assumed the most difficult to be learnt by the student As Brown stated that there are many aspects that can be assessed when the teacher measure the students writing skill such as content organization grammar vocabulary mechanic and the score of writing test was taken based on proficiency categories In this research there is no different between experimental and control class Although there is no activities related to the digital storytelling were conducted in control class because the condition of the students were same and had same proficiency They focused and had concentration when researcherteacher taught the students either by digital storytelling or gallery walk but the students have many opinions in experimental class So that the learning outc omes obtained almost same or have no different Based on this matter the researcher conducted by giving questionnaire to get the students learning motivation and atmosphere class during the learning process in experimental class by using digital storyt elling technique The result showed that the application of this technique had proven to have very good effect in increasing learning motivation In addition this technique also could create good and conducive classroom atmosphere students active to ask and students able to solve problem Witte Rogge stated that if the students are active during the learning process so the technique has positive effect and it can believe the students learning motivation and class atmosphere were better CONCLUSION The students score of visual memory in experimental class are increased after applying digital storytelling The students score of post test was higher that pre test it was students can pass KKM Minimum Mastery Criterion values While the students score of writing skill in experimental class als increased after applying digital storytelling The score of post test was higher than pre test it was students can pass KKM values So the level of achievement of the KKM values from these had improved Based on the percentages of students post test score that visual memory was more dominant than writing skill after applying digital storytelling at the tenth grade students of higher school in Tangerang in academic year The result of statistic which obtained by analyzing data through test of statistic calculation it indicated that Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected which means that there is no significant difference of using digital storytelling on the students visual memory and writing skill at the tenth grade of higher school in Tan gerang Imam Sudarmaji Agus Mulyana Karsiyah Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students visual memory and writing skill Some factors influenced no statistical difference between experimental class and control class due to the condition of students were same proficiency and from both of classes that the students focused and had concentration when the teacher giving the materials either by digital storytelling or gallery walk also the students in experimental have many opinions during the learning process So that the learning outcomes were same or no have different Although there is no statistical different digital storytelling can contribute in experimental class It can be proved from the students questionnaire showed that the students learning motivation was very good and created

['The Gender Labor Market Gap in the Digital Economy Monserrat Bustelo Luca Flabbi Mariana Viollaz October Abstract Recent years have seen an evergreater expansion of the digital economy development that may bring new opportunities to workers who were at disadvantage in the traditional economy We focus on specific set of workers who belong to such group women We study skill set of particular relevance in the digital economy and estimate their returns in the labor market according to gender across four Latin American countries We find that information and communication technologies ICT skills and science technology engineering and mathematics STEM skills yield significant positive returns for both men and women However there is significant gender gap that favors men on the STEM returns There is also sizable gender gap regarding the amount of skills accumulated by gender Through an OaxacaBlinder decomposition we estimate that up to of the gender gap in hourly wages may be due to the lower returns that women receive relative to men on their STEM skills If an investment in skills relevant to the digital economy may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries remains an open and relevant question Contact Information Monserrat Bustelo InterAmerican Development Bank New York Avenue NW

years have seen major changes in global labor markets Technical innovation is leading to greater expansion of digital economy in which old jobs are lost new jobs are created and even the same jobs are approached differently and require different competences If old jobs are lost but new ones are created then new opportunities may arise for workers who were previously at disadvantage in the traditional economy In this paper we focus on specific set of workers who belong to such group women Gender gaps in the labor market have been significant and persistent empirical regularity in most countries around the world Blau and Kahn The digital economy affects this longstanding gap and may act to reduce or magnify it depending on the skills that men and women can acquire and deliver in the labor market Focusing on set of highincome countries OECD finds that differences in skill endowments between male and female workers account for some but not all of the wage gap When controlling for skills relevant to the digital economy the gender wage gap is reduced by to percentage pointsOECD also shows evidence of gender gaps in skills tracing some back to human capital acquisition during the schooling years However among recent generations the study finds that the gender gap in skills relevant to the digital economy is more ambiguous In some areas girls outperform boys eg collaborative problem solving but are outperformed by boys in others eg digitalrelated skills Our report focuses on Latin American countries where no systematic analysis of the interaction between the digital economy and the gender gap has been undertakenThe primary reason for the number of reports by multilateral organizations and international thinktanks are making similar point for the OECD see OECD for the World Bank see Box in World Bank for the ILO see Ryder for the WEF see World Economic Forum for the IDB see Busso et al See Section in OECD The highest reduction is for Japan which has the highest gender wage gap among OECD countries at about Some country reports are starting to look at gender differences in skill acquisition but without relating the results to gender differentials in the labor market See for example OECD on Chile The report using PIAAC data absence of systematic contributions across Latin America relates to data limitations Representative individuallevel data capable of capturing the skills required in the digital economy are scarce We are taking first step in this analysis by using data sets comprising this relevant information for four Latin American countries Chile Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador We have obtained the relevant information by combining two different surveys that collected data on skills the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies PIAAC survey available for Chile in and the Skills Towards Employment and Productivity STEP survey available for Colombia and Bolivia in and for El Salvador in After extracting the estimation sample we document gender gaps in skills endowments and estimate returns to skills We control for variety of factors including heterogeneous returns by with respect to the endogenous selection of women in the labor market Finally we decompose the gender gap in the portion resulting from differences in returns to skills and differences in skill endowments Two specific skills yield significant returns across the board STEM science technology engineering and math and ICT information and communication technologies ICT returns are similar across genders with an increase of one standard deviation in the skill generating return in hourly wages of about By contrast STEM returns differ significantly between genders with an increase of one standard deviation generating return for men and return for women Results by country show some differences in magnitudes Returns to STEM are higher than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador We also estimate that higher levels of education imply significantly higher returns for men but not for women The estimates indicate that STEM endowments and returns play an important role in explaining the aggregate gender gap in hourly wages the lower endowments for women may be responsible for up to of the gap while the lower returns for women may account for close to on study skill formation in the Latin American and the Caribbean region provided evidence on the availability and adoption of digital technologies but not on their relation to the gender gap Structure The paper is organized as follows Section describes the data and the specific indicators we build to describe the digital economy Section provides standard descriptive statistics on the gender gaps in the labor market integrating gaps in skills relevant to the digital economy Section provides estimates of the returns to these skills according to gender The estimates control for rich set of individual characteristics and in some specifications for selection in the labor market We also provide evidence regarding the interaction of the skills with the sectors most exposed to the digital economy as well as with education levels Section focuses on the gender gap in hourly wages and unpacks the extent to which the gap can be accounted for by differences in returns relative to differences in the endowment of digitaleconomyrelevant skills Section provides final comments and summary of the results Appendix includes details about the construction of the variables of interest Appendix presents the complete regression results and Appendix provides results according to country Web Appendix includes additional specifications and robustness checks Data We combine information from two surveys that collected data on skills at work First we use information accessible in the PIAAC survey available for Chile in The PIAAC is survey processing skills literacy numeracy and problem solving and gathers data on how adults use their skills at work The survey is implemented by an international consortium contracted by the OECD and is designed to ensure international comparability of the data Second we use information from the STEP survey available for Colombia and Bolivia in and El Salvador in STEP is survey collected by the World Bank and gathers data on skills in urban areas of low and middleincome countries It also shares the main objectives and structure of the PIAAC questionnaire It strives to record the data in way that renders it comparable across different countries Still two concerns remain regarding the comparability of STEP and PIAAC for our purposes The first relates to differences in sampling STEP is representative of people aged living in urban areas while PIAAC is representative of people aged living in both urban and rural areas represented more heavily in nonurban areas agriculture forestry and fishery as well as mining and quarrying Due to the slightly disparate age range between the two surveys we include individuals aged in the estimation sample We also restrict the sampling to wage employees of the private sector except for El Salvador where it is not possible to distinguish between the private and public sector These restrictions generate final estimation sample with observation for Chile for Bolivia for Colombia and for El Salvador The second relates to differences in survey questions PIAAC and STEP use different questionnaires to collect information Still the questions about labor market outcomes demographic characteristics socioeconomic variables and ability measures generate variables that allow for high degree of comparability between the surveys The differences in survey questions become more relevant when crafting measures of skills as eliciting skills is more difficult and arguably less agreed upon task than eliciting demographic characteristics or standard labor market outc devote the next section of the paper to describing how we build the relevant skills measures from parability across countries and surveys Throughout the paper the unit of observation of the data remains the individual worker The level of analysis operates at both the country level and the aggregate level pooling all countries into single data set Typically we discuss the results from the pooled sample in the main text of the paper and report countrylevel results in the Web Appendix We could not limit our direct focus to the urban population in Chile because PIAAC does not report an indicator for urban and rural areas The only geographic indicator reported by PIAAC is the OECD territorial level region which for Chile corresponds to of the regions of the country We have combined this information with the ruralurban indicator contained in nationally representative household survey for Chile the CASEN survey Based on CASEN we can calculate the proportion of the population in each region living in urban areas Results show that most of the population in each Chilean region is concentrated in urban centers In most of the regions more than of the population lives in urban areas with the most rural region Maule reporting of urban population Still we have performed robustness exercise where we eliminated regions with less than or of the population living in urban areas Our results were barely affected Skills measures We build the skills measures to summarize the information collected in the numerous relevant survey questions and in order to maximize the comparability with previous literature and across countries We focus on skills relevant in the digital economy The previous literature has identified ICT and STEM quantitative skills as critical to thriving in the digital era OECD OECD It has also argued that soft social and interpersonal skills jointly with creativity and critical thinking will become critical in future innovative labor markets Ryder World Economic Forum OECD To capture both sets of competencies we follow the classification proposed by Grundke et al in preparatory work for series of OECD reports on skills and the digital economyThey define the following six sets of skills using data from the PIAAC survey on OECD countries ICT skills are those related to ICT use from reading and writing emails to using Word and Excel or programming language Managerial and communication skills capture strategic management abilities for the generation of sustainable competitive advantages including human resource management practices which encompassnegotiating with people instructing advising and persuading people Readiness to learn and creative problemsolving skills include the ability to solve problems in the process of developing organizational capabilities and improving firm performance Selforganization skills to changes and absorb shocks Marketing and accounting skills include abilities associated with accounting tasks such as reading financial invoices and bills and with frontofoffice marketing tasks such as interacting with clients STEM quantitative skills include the ability to apply algebra simple or complex and prepare charts and tables In Table in Appendix we provide details on the exact questions from PIAAC and STEP that we use to generate each skill measure and the metric associated with each variable Variables from See OECD PIAAC derive exactly from the definition proposed by Grundke et al We construct the same set of measures using the PIAAC for Chile as they did using the PIAAC on the OECD countries in their analysis In the STEP surveys for Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador we identify the questions aimed at capturing the same skills and that are as close as possible to those available in PIAAC The first important difference between the two surveys is that most variables in PIAAC capture the while STEP involves combination of binary questions whether person performs certain task at work or not with some categorical frequency questions as in PIAAC In order to overcome these differences between surveys we construct the skill measures applying standardization methodology used by previous studies Acemoglu and Autor Almeida et al First for each variable associated to skill category we calculate the mean and standard deviation and standardize the variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation Second for each worker in the sample we obtain score for each skill category by adding all the standardized variables obtained in the first step Third for all skill measures to have zero mean and standard deviation of one we do one additional standardization of the six skill categories by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation The standardization is performed for each country separately The second important difference concerns the difference in the actual questions Many important questions are extremely similar for example those related to ICT skills or STEM skills but there are others with more salient differences For example to build marketing and accounting skills PIAAC includes question on the frequency of selling products or services but STEP does not Our strategy here has been to base our choices on previous literature using the STEP survey to construct skills measures Di Carlo et al Roseth et al Lo Bello et al or combining both PIAAC and STEP to compare across state Lewandowski et al The main difference between these previous studies and our paper is that they have focused on different set of skills mirroring the measures available in US surveys instead of those available in the OECD PIAAC surveys The only difference is the exclusion of variable capturing physical skills that Grundke et al included in the ICT measure with negative weight They focus on the difference between cognitive and manual skills and between routine and nonroutine tasks Digital intensity In our econometric analysis we also estimate differential returns according to the digital intensity of each economic sector Digital intensity refers to the degree in which the production and the performance of given sector has been impacted by the digital transformation ie the same set of technological innovations that have made relevant the skills that are the object of this study The process of digital transformation is complex involving more than mere investment in computers software cold computing or other digital tools embedding them in production with the appropriate human capital and using them when deal Calvino et al Looking at digital intensity is important in our context because the skills most relevant to the digital economy may be complementary to the technologies and business practices used by least study the heterogeneity on returns by the degree of digital intensity at the sector level We proceed by defining an indicator variable of digital intensity for each of economic sectors following the classification established by Calvino et al for subset of OECD countries Using data from the Latin American region to define the digital intensive indicator variable would seven variables to describe given sector as more or less digitalintensive level of investment in ICT equipment level of investment in software and databases purchases of ICT services purchases of ICT goods robot use revenues from online sales and intensity of ICT specialists None of these variables are reliably collected for Latin American and the Caribbean LAC countries so we use the same indicator defined by Calvino et al but apply it to our LAC countries To determine the extent to which transferring the OECD classifications to LAC countries represents credible way to proceed we use the only variable with some correlation to digital intensity available on the LAC region The International Federation of Robotics IFR provides counts of the stock of robots by economic sector country and year worldwide including the four countries under investigation here We calculate the average number of robots in each economic sectors above the median We compare this classification specification from the Latin American region to the one appearing in Calvino et al to evaluate the viability of the robot use component of their digital intensive indicator The comparison indicates correlation of between the Latin American classification and the OECD classification lending some weight to the use of the OECD classification in our estimates Still some important differences exist in the intensity of robot use between regions Table in Appendix shows the average number of operational robots for seven aggregate economic sectors in the Latin American region in the United States and in Western Europe The number of operational robots is between and times larger in the United States and Europe relative to Latin America In conclusion the comparison shows that LAC countries and highincome OECD countries are generally similar in terms of the sectors of the economy with high digital intensity but that the degree of intensity is likely to be much smaller in LAC countries than in OECD countries Descriptive Analysis The Gender Gap We first describe the gender gaps in the labor market and the gender differentials in the relevant skills variables In terms of human capital measures Table documents the high rates of education of the women in our sample relative to the men of women are higheducated upper secondary education completed or more while the percentage is for men In terms of labor market performance the usual gender gap in earnings emerges The average wage of loweducated women is of the average wage of loweducated men for the higheducated group the value is We also find the usual gender asymmetries in the distribution of occupation of women are employed in this occupational category relative to of men Among men crafts and related trades is the main occupation employing about of the workforce In terms of sectors both women and men are largely employed in the services sector but the percentage for women is higher reaching while for men it is similar pattern is found when comparing the percentages of women and men employed in digitalintensive sectors For women we are looking at while for men it is The usual gender gap in labor market participation is also confirmed by our data Figure shows that on average of women in the sample do not participate in the labor market compared to of men There are important differences by education levels Loweducated women participate at rate while higheducated women participate at rate Gender differences with respect to skills relevant to the digital economy are reported in Figure and at the bottom of Table The largest difference relates to STEM where the average skill level for men is of standard deviation above the mean while the average for women is of standard deviation below the mean smaller disadvantage for women is observed in the context of ICT skills where they hold value of standard deviation below the mean compared to similar value which is of course above the mean for men On all the other three skills men and women do not show noticeable differences Econometric Analysis Returns to Skills by Gender This section presents estimates of the impact of skills on hourly wages according to gender We also analyze how these returns to skills interact with the digital intensity of the sector in which the worker is employed The interaction is relevant to understand how skills play role in the process ders that while the digital economy is expanding it may have not yet reached all the sectors of the labor market The econometric analysis focuses on estimating equations of the form where the natural log of the hourly wage of individual of gender in country wij is regressed on set of individuallevel controls the vector xij measure of the individual skill relevant in the digital economy sij and countryfixed effect the percentage change in earnings associated with unit increase in the amount of skill Following the literature estimating earnings functions we label this coefficient the return to skills All the skill indexes are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation of one in the overall population It is worth noting here that the parameters to be estimated are denoted by the superscript to indicate that we are estimating genderspecific coefficients In other words we are estimating equation separately by gender This specification is different with respect to the one used by OECD which performs specific returns to skills by interacting gender dummy with the skill variable and then estimating on the pooled sample of men and women In terms of equation this is equivalent to having the superscript but only specific returns on all the variables Without this flexibility the returns to skills could capture some of the genderspecific impacts of the other covariates We find that this specification is indeed relevant numerous coefficients are significantly different between men and women In Section we show the extent to which using the OECD specifications instead impacts our results The individuallevel controls included in the vector xij are quite parsimonious due partly to data availability and also to the returns we aim to identify Specifically the vector includes constant age and age squared an indicator variable of completed upper secondary education or more and literacy and numeracy test scores In short the baseline specification controls for broad human capital indicators age and education for proxy of basic cognitive abilities literacy and numeracy scores and for aggregate differences between the economies the countryfixed effects The only additional controls available across all data sets available for our inclusion in the specification are sectors and occupations indicator variables We decided not to include them in the baseline specification for the following reason Choice of sector and occupation is endogenous and as such the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of certain occupationindustry cell Since we are interested in gender gaps in the overall return to skills we have preferred not to decompose the returns in the component due to occupation and sector choices and in the component due to differences within given sector and occupation cell To simplify notation we do not add the indicator to the observed variables but it is understood that we will include in each regression only individuals belonging of specific gender Literacy and numeracy test scores are unfortunately not available for all countries Literacy scores are available for Bolivia Colombia and Chile while numeracy scores are only available for Chile We have therefore decided to have them interact with the country fixed effects in the section for specification pooling all the countries together Still estimating the coefficient conditional on industry and occupation is informative and we present these estimates in Section Main Results The main results on returns to skills are presented in Figure The two main cognitive skills relevant in the digital economy ICT and STEM show positive and significant returns for both men and women but in STEM the returns are significantly higher for men Specifically one standard deviation increase in the STEM skill measure implies increase in wages for men and an increase in wages for women ICT skill returns are more similar across genders ranging from for women to for men The returns to the other skills are lower but still positive and significant except for marketing and accounting for women Compared with the returns estimated in OECD countries the returns to ICT and STEM are higher than the estimated average over the pooled set of OECD countries OECD estimates returns to ICT skills to be about for women and about for men The returns to STEM skills are estimated at and for women and men respectively Contrary to the results for the four LAC countries there is gender gap in returns to ICT favoring women while there is no significant difference in returns to STEM by gender We have tried to determine whether the difference in results with respect to OECD derives from differences in the specification As mentioned above even when the variables employed are comparable the specifications are slightly different OECD estimates that by having gender dummy interacted with skills while we prefer more flexible specification where all the returns are allowed to be genderspecific We have run the specification preferred by OECD on our data and found that the difference in specification explain only small portion of the difference We discuss the results in Section The main results of the returns to skills interacted with the level of digital intensity in the sector are presented in Figure The figure reports the additional impact of given skill when the worker We report point estimates with the dot and the diamond and the confidence interval with vertical lines As result any time that the vertical line does not cross zero it means that the coefficient is significantly different from zero See Figure page OECD is employed in sector with high digital intensity The exercise is meant to capture the extent to which portion of the overall returns discussed above is due to composition effects across sectors ie if the skills have significant and positive returns only in those sectors that are more impacted by the digital economy or if they are equally valuable across all sectors The figure shows that digital intensity does not generally have significant impact Most of the coefficients are not significantly different from zero and the point estimates are very close to zero Again this result stands in stark contrast with the findings for OECD countries OECD estimates that working in digitalintensive industries increases returns to skill by about to percentage points The results for our four Latin American countries indicate that either digital intensity is not very pronounced in Latin America or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all the sectors of Latin American economies Even with the data at our disposal we cannot disentangle the two explanations but some of the evidence discussed in Section indicate that digital intensity is indeed less pronounced in Latin America than in OECD countries Specifically Table in Appendix shows that the average number of operational robots for seven aggregate economic sectors the only direct measure of digital intensity available for LAC countries is between and times larger in the United States and Western Europe than in Latin America This result is consistent with the analysis based on the broader Digital Adoption Index reported by Busso et al The index shows that Latin America lags behind highincome economies in terms of availability and adoption of digital technologies In other words if the sectors of the economy with high digital intensity are similar between LAC countries and highincome OECD countries the extent of the intensity is much smaller in LAC To summarize the results obtained by aggregating the data gleaned from the four countries under study we estimated significant and large returns to ICT and STEM with no significant gender differences on the first but significant gender gap in favor of men on the second ii For the other skill measures we found positive but lower returns with mainly not statistically significant differences between women and men iii The digital intensity of the sectors does not seem crucial factor in determining these returns The exception are selforganization and marketing accounting which have respectively slightly smaller and slightly higher returns when used in digitalintensive sectors See Figure page OECD See Figure page Busso et al In Appendix we look at each country in isolation from the others we actually found results for each that are qualitatively similar to the aggregate for Chile Bolivia and Colombia but with some differences in magnitude Returns to STEM are higher than the aggregate ofChile and lower than the aggregate of Bolivia and Colombia El Salvador on the other hand does not report gender gap favoring men in returns to STEM both men and women have positive but similar returns Returns to ICT in El Salvador are also little different than the aggregate indicating higher but not significantly so return for women Extra returns for working in digitalintensive sectors estimated by country confirm the aggregate results Digital intensity does not significantly increase returns to skills Heterogeneous Effects We focus on the heterogeneous effect on the individual characteristic most relevant with respect to skills formation and acquisition schooling levels We focus on upper secondary education and we report the differential effect on the returns of individuals who completed this educational level with respect to individuals who completed less The results are reported in Figure They show that higher levels of education yield significantly higher returns for men but not for women For women the increase in returns never departs significantly from zero and the point estimates are always lower than those for men In the next section we discuss whether these differences may be due to the different selection in the labor market by gender These results are more mixed when looking at regressions by country Figure in Appendix In Chile we estimate significantly higher returns for higheducated men on all skills except readiness to learn In Bolivia and El Salvador only half of the skill types demonstrate significant increases in Colombia only one What remains broadly similar to the aggregate results is that the increase in returns is higher for men than women The only important exception is Colombia where the point estimate of increase in ICT and STEM is higher for women However the estimated coefficient is not significantly different from zero in either case Selection in the Labor Market Women participate in the labor market less than men This is common feature among most labor markets and it holds in our samples Figure shows that women participate in the labor market less than men at all education levels The Web Appendix shows the results of each country Because participation is nonrandom ie it is the result of choice the women we observe working may be systematically different from those not working If the characteristics over which they are different are related to their performance in the labor market then the return to skills we estimated are only representative of the population of women working and not of the entire population of women This bias may affect some relevant policy implications For example if policy is successful in increasing the skill levels of women should we expect the returns that were affected by the policy to be more like those of the women currently participating or the ones who are not Because some of the factors related to productivity remain unobserved it is not easy to answer this question It may therefore be useful to estimate set of returns that can indicate if the estimated returns of women currently working are significantly different from those of the overall population of women We adopt standard Heckman selection model Heckman to obtain returns that consider selection in the labor market To avoid relaying only on distributional assumptions for identification we adopt an exclusionrestriction number of children affects her participation decision but not the wage paid to her Results are presented in Figure and show relatively small changes with respect to the baseline specifications reported in Figures and Still two small differences are worth mentioning First the point estimate of the return to ICT becomes higher for women than men However both in the baseline specification and in the selectioncorrection specification the differences in returns between men and women are not significantly different from each other Second the gap in favor Notice that in principle the same selection problem also applies to men but because high proportion of men participate in the labor market we follow the common practice of ignoring selection in the labor market for them In other words even if not all men participate in the labor market the small proportion of men who do not is unlikely to affect the overall estimates very much This assumption is common in the literature but it is not without limitations If it is true that firms cannot offer wage contracts contingent to the presence of children some evidence shows that the unequal distribution of household work between men and women may generate systematic and potentially causal association between wages and the presence of children of men in returns to STEM is reduced because the point estimate for women increases from to By looking at results by country reported in Figure of Appendix we can see that these minor changes are mainly driven by Chile In Chile controlling for selection increases returns to ICT from to and returns to STEM from to Another relevant change takes place in Bolivia where returns to STEM become significantly different from zero when controlling for selection With respect to heterogeneous returns correcting for selection does not qualitatively change the results The results are reported in Figure and should be compared to Figures and Overall they confirm the lack of significantly higher returns for agents working in the digitalintensive sector and reiterate that only men have significantly higher returns when they complete upper secondary education Finally estimates obtained by correcting for selection show that this is not the source of differences with respect to returns estimated in OECD countries OECD Selectioncorrection slightly increases the differences because it leads to slightly higher returns to ICT and STEM for women Robustness Analysis In this section we provide robustness analysis along three dimensions First we study how the results change when we replicate the specifications of the OECD we constrain all the coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns to skills Second we study how the results change when we control for sectors and occupations Finally we check if the results controlling for selection are affected by using different exclusionrestrictions in the selection model Results constraining all the coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns to skills are reported in Table This specification consists in running equation on sample pooling together men and women and then interacting the women indicator variable with the variable measuring the specific skill under consideration Our favorite baseline specification allows all the coefficients to be genderspecific because it allows for more flexibility This different constrained version lets only the return to skill be genderspecific as result returns to skills may capture some of the genderspecific impacts of the other covariates By focusing on the two skills with the strongest impact in the baseline specification ICT and STEM the estimation results in the constrained specification are essentially identical to ICT and show small difference to STEM If in the baseline specification returns to STEM are estimated to be those for women are percentage points lower returns on the constrained specification are estimated to be whereas those for women are percentage points lower This slightly lower gender gap in constrained specification is an indication that allowing for genderspecific returns on the other covariates and on countryfixed effects is useful for estimating returns closer to consistent values Results controlling for sectors and occupations are reported in Table As mentioned sectors and occupations are important controls given that each sectoroccupation cell may require and use the skills in the digital economy differently Conditioning on them may clarify if the differences in returns we observed are due to the sorting of men and women over these cells or to different returns within cells Because occupational choices are endogenous and withinsector differences may be affected by unobservable characteristics this analysis remains largely descriptive In other words the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of certain occupation The estimation results conditioning on sectors and occupation qualitatively confirm the main result in the baseline specification We estimate significant returns to ICT and STEM with no significant gender differences in the former but significant gender gap in favor of men in the latter Quantitatively both ICT and STEM returns are estimated to be lower when sectors and occupation controls are introduced For example ICT returns decreased from in the baseline specification to in the specification controlling for sector and occupation the corresponding values for men were and respectively These results indicate probably not surprisingly that portion of the returns to ICT and STEM is because individuals who possess those skills work in sector and occupation that pay relatively more in comparison to people with lower level of these skills More interestingly the gender gap in ICT returns is unaffected when we change the specification unlikethe gender gap in STEM returns In other words conditioning on the sector and occupation cell returns to STEM are estimated to be much greater than returns to STEM than in the economy as whole The results suggest that different choices of occupation and sector are not the main driver of the overall gender gap in STEM returns womens occupational choices visavis men decreasethe gender gap in returns present within sectoroccupation cells Results controlling for how different exclusionrestrictions affect our selection model are reported in Table In our baseline selection model we used the presence of children as the exclusion restriction varying very likely to affect the participation decisions of women However not only fertility decisions are endogenous but the presence of children may also directly impact wages and not only participation Still we are limited in terms of data availability on the exclusion restrictions we can use in the selection model Furthermore the number of children is the only variable available on all data sets However if we limit ourselves to the STEP countries we can use additional information Specifically we use information about whether the mother or father of the person answering the survey lives in the household This presence may be very influential on the labor market participation decision of women either because they can help in household production or because they need resources for their care We therefore built an indicator variable for whether the mother or father of the person answering the survey is living in the household We use it as an exclusionrestriction alone and jointly with the presenceofchildren variable Estimation results show very little sensitivity to the various exclusionrestrictions For example the overall STEM return in STEP countries is estimated to be about without controlling for selection When controlling for selection it is estimated to be just little lower ranging from when using only the presence of children as an exclusionrestriction to when using only the presence of grandparents to when using both PostEstimation Analysis Decomposing the Gender Gap The previous section presented estimates of the returns to skills and to other individual characteristics by gender Using these estimates it is possible to decompose the overall gender gap We have also run OLS regressions using the exclusionrestriction variables directly in the wage regressions We found that they are typically not significant while they always are in the participationdecision equation Although the exclusionrestrictions are not formally testable since we use them for identification this reduced form results lends some credibility to them in the portion due to differences in returns and to differences in endowments The most popular procedure to accomplish this is labeled in the literature as OaxacaBlinder decomposition It is simply an accounting exercise based on mean differences The regressions we have presented in the previous sections and defined in equation are ordinary least squares OLS regressions guaranteeing that where the overbar denotes sample mean the hat denotes estimated value and the indicator gmw denotes genderspecific values The countryfixed effect component is averaged out over all the individuals living in the country In other words equation states that OLS estimation guarantees that the mean of the dependent variable is exactly predicted by the estimated coefficients applied to the sample mean of the regressors Based on this result and one step of algebra the gender earnings gap the difference in average earnings between men and women can be decomposed in the portion due to differences in the sample mean of the regressors the endowments and in the portion due to differences in the estimated coefficients the returns Focusing on the returns and endowments of relevant skills related to the digital economy denoted with we can write See Blinder and Oaxaca For more recent assessment of the approach see Oaxaca and Ransom For more general decomposition involving the entire distribution see Machado and Mata To formally define it we need to add an indicator function dij if individual lives in country leading to where the first term on the righthand side denotes gender differences in endowments in digital economyrelevant skills weighted by the male return and the second term denotes gender differences in returns to those skills weighted by the female endowment Figure reports the ratio between each of these two terms and the overall gender gap For example looking at STEM skills we estimate that both gender differences in endowments and in returns have significant impact in explaining the gender gap The point estimates indicate that endowments could be responsible for up to of the difference and returns for up to We see this as the main result to be drawn from the decomposition Two other significant effects are present Differences in ICT endowments have marginally significant impact whereas differences in returns in marketing and accounting have more substantial impact with the potential to explain up to of the gap We perform an additional exercise by reporting the endowment and returns components when including all skills measures at the same time Results appear in the last panel of Figure and show that endowments explain approximately of the gender wage gap while the returns to skills do not have any explanatory power Results by country are reported in Appendix Figure They confirm the overall main results for Bolivia Chile and Colombia STEM has significant impact with differences in returns contributing up to of the gap in Bolivia up to in Chile and up to in Colombia El Salvador is the only country where STEM does not have either an economically significant or statistically significant impact on the earnings gender gap In terms of other skills the countryby country results show that the significant impact of marketing and accounting in the aggregate sample was mainly driven by Colombia Conclusion We studied gender differentials in the labor market with focus on skills relevant to the digital economy Specifically we estimated the returns to skills using standard wage regressions but we allowed for heterogeneous effects and considered selection in the labor market We focused on Recall that the estimated returns are based on running separate regressions each with only one of the digital economyrelevant skills at the time Since there are likely to be correlations between skills the estimates report the maximum impact that the skill may have in explaining the gap four Latin American countries for which all the relevant data are available Bolivia Chile Colombia and El Salvador We found that the group of skills described as ICT and as STEM have significant positive returns for both men and women However there is significant gender gap in favor of men on the returns to STEM while the returns to ICT are very similar between the two genders We also estimated the returns in specifications allowing for heterogeneity by education and sector of occupation We found that having upper secondary education or higher implies significantly higher returns for men but not for women Unlike the results obtained on OECD countries OECD OECD we did not find any significant impact related to working in digitalintensive sector This means that either digital intensity is less pronounced in Latin American countries than OECD countries or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all sectors of Latin American economies All these results are confirmed when controlling for selection in the labor market for women We also performed robustness analysis where we studied how results change by varying the specification and by employing various exclusionrestrictions in the selection model Finally we provided decomposition of how skills relevant to the digital economy may contribute to the gender gap in wages By computing standard OaxacaBlinder decomposition based on our estimates we concluded that both gender differences in endowments and in returns to STEM skills have significant impact in explaining the gender gap in earnings The point estimates indicate that endowments could be responsible for up to of the difference and returns for up to The summary of results provided so far is aggregated over the four countries under consideration Many of our results were confirmed when performing the same analysis for each country separately The most relevant differences between countries concerned returns to STEM They were estimated to be higher than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia and Colombia El Salvador is the only country not reporting gender gap in favor of men in returns to STEM As result El Salvador is the only country for which gender differences related to STEM skills do not explain the overall gender gap in earnings Why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries can only be partially answered by our analysis The list of possible explanations is broad The first possibility is selection into different sectors and occupations men and women may systematically choose to work in different jobs even when possessing similar skills Our robustness analysis controlling for sectors and occupations indicated that this is not the case The withinsector and occupation gaps are higher than the overall gap The second possibility is selection in the labor market iewomen participate in the labor market at lower proportion than men If only the relatively less productive women participate then their lower returns may reflect genuine productivity differential Our analysis estimating series of selection models indicated that this mechanism may at most explain very small portion of the differential The third possibility is different labor market experiences and labor market attachments Some evidence suggests that time investments in household production are very different between men and women This is reflected both in the extensive and intensive margins of labor supply The extensive margin differential is reflected in the lower participation rate for women and the selection models we estimated take this into account The intensive margin is reflected in hours worked which is accounted for by using hourly wages as dependent variables in our estimations However there is an important dynamic element that our static estimates could not properly consider over time lower labor supply implies lower accumulation of human capital on the job Our controls for labor market experience is very crude and therefore some of the impact of human capital accumulation on the job may be picked up by other returns such as returns to education and returns to skills The only objection to this explanation is that human capital accumulation on the job should involve all skills not only STEM skills while we estimate the gender gap only on STEM returns The fourth possibility is discrimination against women in STEM professions There is growing even if by no means conclusive literature suggesting that STEM and related professions may be more prone to gender discrimination than other professions With the data at our disposal we neither can exclude nor confirm such an explanation Finally the fifth possibility is that the quality of the STEM skills acquired by men and women may be different explaining the gap in terms of underlining productivity differentials This may result from human capital acquired before entering the labor market By controlling for numeracy score our regressions should condition on some of those differences but the difference may result also from human capital acquired on the job after entering the labor market This is the same mechanism we described when discussing the dynamic implication of gender differences in Evidence collected in timeuse survey provides convincing evidence in this respect For crosscountry evidence see van der Lippe et al and Apps and Rees For evidence on Latin American country see SalazarSaenz on Colombia See for example Buffington et al and Carrell et al labor supply Given the limited controls for dynamic behavior in our empirical models this is another mechanism that cannot be ruled out In conclusion we found that if investing in skills relevant to the digital economy specifically in ICT and STEM may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women it remains relevant open question in understanding why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender gap Our results can rule out some explanations but cannot precisely point to the actual mechanism At least two explanations remain good candidates to explain the gender gap in STEM returns the presence of stronger discrimination against women in STEMrelated professions than in other professions and the lifecycle impact of different rate of human capital accumulation on the job between men and women The first suggests policies directly targeting the labor market and the second suggests policies improving worklife balance for both men and women For recent assessment of these

['Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit Tati Lathipatud Durriyah Muhammad Zuhdi Fakultas Ilmu Tarbiyah dan Keguruan Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Indonesia Corresponding author Tati Lathipatud Durriyah Email ABSTRACT Research found that many student teachers are active users of digital technologies yet they are reluctant to make use of digital technologies for literacy teaching purposes Efforts to prepare student teachers for technology integration are pressingly needed Also needed is data that informs us about student teachers participation engagement with digital technologies and how they might utilize those technologies for literacy teaching The article reports on classroom research project that explored Indonesian student teachers initial perception about the use of digital technologies for EFL teaching For one semester the first author taught course to group of student teachers at state Islamic university in Jakarta in which they learned conceptual and practical knowledge about digital technologies in teaching and learning The student teachers were tasked to explore digital technologies available and had to integrate those technologies into teaching units contained in junior high English textbook Popular digital technologies selected included Facebook blogs Skype and WhatsApp Each offers unique potential to facilitate and enhance language learning Student reflections provided insight into their considerations for their digital technology selections Key words Digital Literacy Qualitative Student Teachers EFL Indonesia INTRODUCTION Acquiring literacy is fundamental for ones development People whose literacy skills are developed are more likely to explore and reach their potential UNESCO The International Literacy Association ILA an authoritative world literacy organization publishes on their website definition of literacy Literacy is the ability to identify understand interpret create compute and communicate using visual audi ble and digital materials across disciplines and in any context The ability to read write and communicate connects people to one another and empowers them to achieve things they never thought possible para The statement highlights two important points First the lit eracy teaching currently needed should enable people to com municate and connect Second people currently use various modes of communication including text audio graph ics and video This literacy definition encompasses literacy engage mentalso an aspect of digital literacy as students engage with digital contexts eg digital technologies Literacy engage ment here is understood to be the manner in which students engage in learning participate using those contexts Hafner Chik Jones It is clear then that teaching literacy skills that enable people to communicate and connect through such modes is key that drives current literacy education Published by Australian International Academic Centre PTY LTD Copyright the authors This is an open access article under CC BY license students literacy skills are unfortunately not well developed USAID reported that many Indone sian students displayed low critical thinking ability they lacked the ability to reflect and evaluate information presented to them This ability is paramount for students to be academically and professionally advanced Spires Bart lett Spires and Bartlett contend that in an increasing ly digital environment students must acquire digital literacy skills that enable them to select and use digital tools that are suitable for their purposes Echoing ILA Spires and Bartlett view digital literacy as wideranging set of practices that enable students to create share and understand meaning and knowledge in digital environment According to ILAs report digital literacy tops the list as the most prescient topic to be addressed in literacy education The report surveyed and interviewed research ers and literacy educators from around the world The re port also noted that there should be more attention given to strategic efforts for excellent literacy education One of those efforts involves teacher preparation that equips student teachers with skills to foster students literacy development Specifically one that is concerned with digital technology To our knowledge studies that attempted to investigate Indonesian student teachers use of digital technology for teaching and learning are small in number and they tend to International Journal of Education Literacy Studies ISSN ARTICLE INFO Article history Received January Accepted July Published July olume Issue Conflicts of interest None Funding None IJELS be quite specific in terms of the use of digital technologies eg Rodliyah Our research is explorative in the sense that we asked student teachers about their preferred digital technologies when planning to teach We claim that there is large gap between the available research and our need to be informed about digital technology use among stu dent teachers Objectives and Research Questions In this research we sought to address question related to the digital technology use within teacher education pro gram We were interested in investigating the learning expe riences of student teachers enrolled in course titled Media and Language Learning The course goal was to educate stu dent teachers about teaching subject English that is in formed by digital literacy Specifically our research aimed to investigate the student teachers perception about the use of digital technologies as they learned about theories and prac tices related to the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning Our guiding questions were What kind of digital technologies would student teach ers select to integrate into their teaching plan What were their considerations when selecting digital technologies for teaching and learning Digital Literacy and Teacher Education Research on digital literacy is well documented eg Coiro et al Recent developments have provided us with information about some digital literacy roles in literacy ed ucation Major reports such as the Cambridge Assessment Report summarized several conclusions concerning digital literacy in literacy education First literacy education should encompass the teaching of print media literacy and digital technology Second literature is at the core of literacy teach ing and it should be taught within the context of digital dis course Cambridge Assessment These conclusions emphasize that digital literacy is vitally important skill that students in the digital age should acquire What counts as digital literacy Spires and Bartlett simplify the scope of digital literacy into three categories finding and utilizing digital content producing digital con tent and disseminating digital content These categories highlight complex skills and abilities that students must obtain Skills such as critical thought and value judgment are very important for locating and utilizing digital content Likewise creativity innovation and understanding of socio logical context are very critical for producing and dissemi nating digital contents number of studies have explored digital literacy in the context of teacher education PriceDennis and PriceDennis and colleagues investigated some ef forts to prepare student teachers to integrate technology into literacy teaching Their findings reveal gap between the availability and use of digital technologies in classrooms The sentiment is shared by literacy researchers with similar interests Bauer Kenton Doering Hughes Huff man Koc Bakir Lei Wright Wilson This gap in technology use is concerning when con sidering that technology is available and part of students daily lives Additionally lack of accommodation of digital technologies use in teacher education program will not help student teachers to imagine how pedagogy that involves digital technologies can be structured and implemented in an established learning environment classrooms Although limited in number available research notably demonstrates that student teachers tend to be more sensitive to the use of digital technologies when they are accustomed to and are active users of the digital technologies Collier Foley Mo guel Barnard Hundley Holbrook Williams Baumann We may conclude that what is pressing in promoting digital technologies in teacher education is the effort to instruct student teachers to learn about through and with technology Cervetti Damico Pearson including instruction on how to be active participant in digital literacy practices Hundley Holbrook Meanwhile other studies also present us with the possibility of managing an online learning environment Juzwik et al and its relation to promoting student teachers confi dence in writing skill Norman Spencer To summarize the aforementioned research has informed us that it is crucial for teachers to be active users of digital technologies in order to benefit from them Included in those benefits is the use of digital technologies within learning environment that enables student teachers to increase their confidence in literacy skill learning METHODS Context and Participants Our research utilized qualitative paradigm and took place within an undergraduate English education program at state affiliated Islamic university in Jakarta For one se mester the first author taught course called Media and Language Learning The enrolled student research par ticipants could be described as active users of leading social media platforms For instance quick survey conducted at the beginning of the course showed that all student teach er participants had Facebook accounts and were actively logged in All of them owned digital technology devices such as laptops and smartphones enabling them to access digital information and data using wireless network The Course and Data Sources The course content encompassed basic discussions of tech nology in teaching different kinds of technology and dig ital literacy and its teaching application The course aimed to promote development of Indonesian student teachers digital literacy In order to do that course goals empha sized building the student teachers conceptual and practi cal knowledge about teaching English through the use of modern technology To facilitate this process the student teachers were assigned the text Teaching English Language Learners Through Technology by Erben Ban and Castae da Each week they took turns leading the book Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit discussion Selected chapters from Dudeney Hockly and Pegrums Digital Literacies were also assigned and discussed to broaden the perspective about technology use in teaching that would include digital literacy especially the idea of creating and sharing digital contents The course as signments were directly tied to the use of media technology for language learning They included writing weekly reflec tive papers on the readings and classroom discussions The student teachers were assigned to expand teaching units by integrating digital technologies relevant to each unit Work ing in groups they used grade seven English textbook an official Kurikulum textbook to exercise their working understanding about technology and learning by way of in fusing relevant technologies into units of teaching contained in the textbook The students were encouraged to explore available and familiar technology and to make sense of how those technologies might be beneficial for learning All of these assignments were submitted to the instructor in both paper and electronic copies The copies become the data sources for this research Digital Literacy Focus Digital literacy in relation to the teaching of English in this research focused on the integration of digital technologies into language teaching Dudeney et al Hockly In Hocklys work entitled Digital Literacies What are They and Why Should We Care Hockly argues that it is impera tive for language teachers to teach media literacy skills and digital competencies digital literacy or an ability to effec tively make use of the technologies at our disposal para Beyond simply gaining practical technical skills Hockly asserts that digital literacy in EFL teaching will en able students to use and create digital products and connect to wider audiences of fellow digital readers and writers Data Analysis To analyze our data we followed tradition of Grounded Theory which enabled us to approach data organically and minimize certain theoretical assumptions We used Ground ed Theorys general principles as put forward by Strauss and Corbin Glesne of rereading the data sources for the identification of themes reanalyzing the data by continu ously comparing themes across data constant comparative method and then using open coding to identify themes and patterns of data Overall this process included four phases first compar ing results with emerging themes second testing and rede fining the themes third continuing to reduce the number of themes and fourth constructing explanatory theory position data In the first phase we categorized our coding following wide range of themes including the four language skills listening read speaking and writing and vocabulary teaching Second as we coded we learned that number of digital technologies were frequently found across the themes For instance Facebook was found in the themes of writing reading and vocabulary teaching We also collapsed the initial themes that separated technologies being used as tool for instruction and being used for learning activities instead we focused on describing activities that student teachers performed with digital technologies Therefore as result of reduction in the third phase we focused on the themes that specified explicitly the kinds of digital technol ogies that student teachers preferred in the activities within their lessons Finally we connected the themes with theo retical justification For instance in explaining the student teachers preference for learning in Facebook closed group space they used it as an electronic classroom that allows anyone to engage in active participation we referred to theory that highlights the importance of providing language learners with many opportunitiesspaces to use their lan guage productively and meaningfully Erben et al In every phase of data collection and analysis our goal was the data would present us literacy teaching that emerged from data sources collected from research participants Spe cifically we focused on digital literacy put forward earlier by Hockley that entails the ability to effectively make use of the technologies at our disposal para We want ed to know which of many accessible teaching technologies the student teachers preferred as shown within their lesson plans We then narrated the final themes while guided by these research questions What kind of digital technologies would student teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan and What were their considerations when selecting digital technologies for teaching and learning RESULTS The main themes that we highlighted from our data involved digital technology use for teaching More specifically our data suggest that the digital technologies appeared to have great potential for teaching English language skills In show ing the findings we discuss the amounts of data that corre spond to digital technologies being selectedanswering the question What kind of digital technologies would student teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan Embed ded in the discussion are student teachers considerations for selecting those technologies answering the question What were their considerations when selecting digital technolo gies for teaching and learning Our findings discussion will follow the following order Facebook closed groups blogs Skype and other oIPs and WhatsApp Facebook Closed Group Of all the features in Facebook Facebook closed group was the student teachers most preferred digital technology Creating closed group is the first step to transform Face book into space for teaching and learning activities Many student teachers in this research claimed that Facebook closed group is an ideal place to facilitate eclassrooms as the platform enables students to have interactive discussions According to our student teachers Facebook closed group offers experiences found in typical online classrooms online class environment They are free to post from IJELS wide variety of digital formats such as videos and news links They can invite others for discussion in the comment section Similar to regular class students in Facebook group can conveniently perform activities such as getting information from students disseminating information and reviewing books with ease Students just need to copy link and share it to group wall Images videos and video links from Youtube can all be posted and all of these can be used for classroom discussion Students can also post an elec tronic document for example as part of class assignment submission they can submit their assignments by upload ing electronic copies onto group wall They would then tag the teacher to notify him or her that the assignment has been submitted Similarly teachers can also tag any students whose assignments have not been submitted Many student teachers found this seemingly transparent process exciting and motivating For one they are able to read classmates work Furthermore they enjoyed participating in the Face book group since it opened wide opportunities for students to comment and to give likes thumbsup icon They argued that teachers leave benefit from having opportunities available to provide additional teaching resources beyond the textbook by sharing digital content to Facebook group wall stu dent teacher succinctly stated these aforementioned potential benefits of Facebook closed group as follows Facebook closed group as an online platform can be used as place to share materials discussions between teachers students and colleagues collect assignments and other activities The student teachers felt that Facebook groups most useful feature lies in its ability to provide space for inter active discussion One type of interactive discussion they planned to do in Facebook group would look like the fol lowing the teacher writes on group wall questions related to song and students then comment on these questions the song should have been played earlier in classroom In an other case the teacher uploads set of images with differ ent expressions which then students will comment on with narrative descriptions for each one of those images Other interactive discussions may occur when students exchange comments or give feedback on assignments that their class mates upload on the group wall Students will gain benefits from both exercising their writing skills as well as learning from classmates For teachers activities such as these will allow them to monitor students writing skill development Continuing the example activity above student teachers in this study planned an activity involving writing descrip tion about range of different expressions They would then ask specifically for students to write descriptive piece using adjectives Other students would have chance to comment on each adjectival description and state which one they found well written Student teachers felt that this peer commenting and liking would motivate their students to do their best in order to earn positive feedback In short student teachers in this study appeared to be convinced that Facebook group is good space for interactive activities Similarly the stu dent teachers suggested that the use of Facebook group to enhance student learning could be maximized Most specifi cally they planned to use online groups to extend the limited hours of classroom instruction In their teaching plan they assigned after school online work to maintain the interactive discussion about topics yet to be masteredcomprehended by students Student teachers also expressed feeling less intimidated within the Facebook group and they felt this more com fortable space increased their potential for learning They reflected on their own experiences as active Facebook users and noted that they could express their opinions more freely there than in typical classroom As one student teacher re marked We prefer Facebook because in here students tend to be active and free to express an opinion when asked by teachers Many confessed that they often feel too embar rassed or intimidated to share opinions in class One student teacher claimed that Facebook has an ability to encourage students so that they feel comfor table to express opinions without fearing of making mistakes Blogs Blogs weblogs or online journals were quite popular among student teachers Many maintained blog and wrote regularly about variety of topics that interested them They seemed to nurture their writing habit on blog so it is not surprising that blogs potential for writing skill develop ment appeared obvious for many of them Creating blog involves establishing an account with blogging platform Many student teachers mentioned Blogspotcom Wordpress com and Wattpad as popular sites in Indonesia Some of the writingrelated activities they planned to make out included explor ing different genres of writing Student teachers discussed having their students study the descriptive writing genre by writing about their favorite singers Other genre writing such as poetry could be based upon theme of their choice such as parents friends and teachers Student teachers also planned to ask students to complete an interactive dialogue activi ty on blog First students would write dialogue from picture depicting settings characters or an activity They would then write their version of dialogue on their own blog Later students would visit their classmates blogs and leave comments suggestions and perhaps alternative dialogues The students could use classmates feedback and comments to revise their writing Another interactive writing idea was to have students develop letter for correspondence to classmate letter writing Unlike the previous activity students would publish revised letter on their blog They would address it to classmate whom they intend to become letter recipient Student teachers also proposed blog activity for reading and writing connection Lee The planned teaching process would begin with students responding to reading Through the written summarizing or retelling student com prehension would be apparent and their writing progress within the blog posts would be evident Their gradual writing process would be documented on the blog from beginning to final draft In this case documenting their writing process on blog would enable students to have firsthand experience of writing as process and give them control and responsi bility for their writing process sense of writing ownershipDigital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit Including blogs in their teaching plans may seem natural as the student teachers have already used blogs to write and document their thoughts and feelings When blogging they include hashtags defined by MerriamWebster web dictio nary as word or phrase preceded by the symbol that clas sifies or categorizes the accompanying text Incorporating hashtags within these digital platforms such as Wattpad gives them sense of connection to others who have simi lar interests Clicking on hashtags takes them to other blogs where they are able to learn and be inspired by other peo ples writing Having personal space through blog and at the same time wanting to connect with others seemed to dominate the student teachers preference to integrate blog technology into teaching plan Skype Skype and other similar oIPs oice over Internet Protocol digital technology used for live verbal communication via the Internet is popular in Indonesia The student teachers in this study identified Skypes potential for learning espe cially as tool to exercise students oral English proficiency Erben et al Categorized as synchronous technology Skype needs an Internet connection to function An ideal use of Skype for learning is an activity that happens in realtime live where being spontaneous is part of the learning pro cess as with speaking skills The student teachers felt Skype would work well as tool for oral English proficiency prac tice with peers Using Skypeinstalled smartphone that connects to the Internet students would be able to conve niently practice with partners One student regular user of Skype and similar oIPs cited the popularity of Skype and its potential for learning when endorsing the practice For teaching speaking skill suggest Skype and Google hang outs since these two are commonly used in Indonesia When was in high school my friend and often used Skype and Google hangouts for video call think they are also sui table for teacher to use the tools both as training and assessing speaking skill Skype is also commonly used for conferencing The stu dent teachers preferred Skype technology for its ease of in stallation on personal technology devices like laptops and smartphones In addition to its clear voice quality they ar gued that Skype has features that enable them to have con ference in group group conference WhatsApp An instant messaging platform WhatsApp popularity is credited to its affordability immediacy flexibility of space could contain long text and sense of community Church Oliveira These factors about WhatsApp were confirmed in the present study as student teachers explained how they planned to take advantage of using WhatsApp for teaching and learning purposes First they re ferred to group feature in WhatsApp that allows them to communicate and disseminate information to invited mem bers typically created exclusively for range of different interests WhatsApp group makes it possible for members to distribute documents video clips photos and links to oth er sites or information and even to broadcast news to much wider audiences The following quote is from student teacher describing how she planned to infuse WhatsApp into classroom activity teacher asks students to go out classroom to find room similar to the description in the book or that have been discussed Students will take note what they will be findings Working in group they are free to look for room with sui table description During the search ing time the teacher and students will be connected via WhatsApp in one of their digital devices smartphone or Ipad Using WhatsApp students will share what they have found images and description After the time is up and images being searched are collected students will write description about each one of the pictures The use of WhatsApp in the above activity is not only as an immediate communication tool during dynamic group activity but also as detailed and transparent process during the time students are con figuring their understanding learn ers community Student teachers enjoyed WhatsApp for its intimacy and for the communal experience They maintained that they formed sense of community when they were in WhatsApp group This sense of community and intimacy within WhatsApp differed from their Facebook group ex perience where they felt less privacy However the student teachers agreed that WhatsApp carries some limitations for learningmore so than other technologies like Facebook for instance In WhatsApp users have to download videos within messages in order to watch them this is not the case with Facebook where users can watch videos instantly from the Facebook page Student teachers also found WhatsApp message threads somewhat overwhelming and hard to fol low They were skeptical about using WhatsApp for class room discussion and considered Facebook group to be more preferable and conducive for learning DISCUSSIONS This research sought to explore Indonesian student teachers initial perceptions about digital technologies for teaching and learning Our report focused on digital technologies that they selected to include in their teaching plans as well as their ideas for including them When selecting those digital technologies the student teachers referred to their personal experiences when explaining what made these technologies potential tools for teaching and learning In other words these digital technologies emerged organically among these research participants For discussions we will focus on con necting the findings with research about potential digital technologies that confirms our exploratory research findings We intend to show that the potential of the student teacher selected digital technologies has also been found in other research contexts and approaches beyond the present study The student teachers inclusion of Facebook in their teaching plans reveals information that echoes the analysis advanced by Manca and Ranieri two Italian schol ars who conducted metareview analysis on the use of IJELS Facebook for learning We will use their review as refer ence in discussing our Facebook findings Facilitating eclassrooms Our findings confirmed Manca and Ranieris review on studies about the way in which Facebook group and some of its identifiable characteristics are useful as learning space The characteristics that they identified in clude being able to share learning resources to leave com ments to write on walls and to initiate discussions The fact that Facebook group provided features such as these deems it good space for learning Having interactive discus sion To some extent this finding echoes Manca and Ran ieris conclusion that Facebook groups use for learning is overwhelmingly for interactive discussions Furthermore they have an interesting finding that in having an interactive discussion in Facebook group students appear to bene fit from learning from each other mutual learning which makes them more aware of exercising critical thinking Providing safe and less intimidating space This confirms Manca and Ranieris research review which concludes that Facebook is one digital technology that is able to provide supports and facilities to learn as while on Facebook stu dents tend to freely participate discuss and share informa tion They also tend to be more open to discussion Addition ally in some cases English language learners participated and interacted more online than in traditional classrooms where they tend to be passive due to language barriers and social pressures Our blog findings especially when pertaining to the stu dent teachers suggestion that they had more sense of own ership echo the research finding by Ducate and Lomicka Ducate and Lomickas research showed that blog appears to be helpful skill practice for students who are learning to write in foreign language Their findings about the advantages of writing on blog are especially evident in providing learners strong sense of belonging and writing creativity ownership and creativity Ducate and Lomicka also point to other benefits of blogs for students students appear to be comfor table on their blog experimenting with language use crucial factor in mastering new language In short writing on blog gave students space where they felt more relaxed in experimenting and exercising expres sions while learning foreign language At the same time though blog is by default public space unless the set ting is changed to private In this case foreign language learner who feels comfor table writing on blog is somewhat connected to teachers and classmates who are able to leave comments and offer suggestions This finding is similar to the present study about including tags hashtags in blog posting in order to connect with others who share interests The student teachers in the study noted Skypes poten tial benefit for developing students verbal abilityas in this case oral English proficiency question whether Skype presents itself as beneficial for language learning was ex amined in an experimental research by Japanese researchers Kato Spring and Maori where they assigned con trol and experimental groups of students who learned for eign languages English and Japanese The researchers used Skype as support to provide meaningful experience in an authentic environment In using Skype both groups had na tive partners in respective language American students with Japanese native partners and Japanese with American part ners with whom they practiced using structures and activi ties developed by the researchers Their findings showed sta tistically significant improvement of communication skills listening and speaking skills in both groups of language learning students When they communicated they tended to talk longer and were able to react to the target language being spoken Especially with American students studying Japanese the improvement showed in their ability to speak with more varied vocabularies and longer sentences In contrast control students of both language groups who re ceived no Skype practices showed little improvement Also their qualitative findings explanation is quite convincing in affirming the benefits of using Skype as medium for lan guage learning development This studys student teachers appreciated WhatsApps ability to offer sense of immediacy and intimacy in learn ing activity To some extent WhatsApp serves as window that gives us insights about the student teachers personal agency in the learning process as well as insights about their social interactions and collaborations with others Dabbagh Kitsantas This is perhaps what British researchers OHara and colleagues called process of doings in WhatsApp where members build connections by shar ing brief notes and short narrations and sharing light mo ments by communicating thoughts feelings news photos videos and links OHarra and colleagues contend that the use of WhatsApp for such activities fits the description of dwelling place in which WhatsApp is digital platform where peoplemembers enjoy being involved in dynam ic discussions that cover wide range of topics and inter estsdwelling is not simply place but doing and needs to be seen as constituted by things done and felt endlessly in the momentbymoment of togetherness and directionality CONCLUSIONS Earlier we cited English teaching specialist Nicky Hockly who insisted that English teachers should incorporate digital literacy competency in digital technologies use into teaching Our semester long data revealed insights pointing to number of advantages as perceived by the Indonesian EFL student teachers The student teachers in this research agreed that digital technologies like Facebook closed group offer inviting environments for students to participate stu dents feel safe to share thoughts in Facebook closed group Classrooms that integrate digital technologies have good chance to foster students ownership in developing writing skill blogs and to develop spontaneous and authentic oral communication Skype Finally student teachers felt that the ability of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to offer intimacy and immediacy provides the potential to nurture dynamic community of learners where feelings of together ness and accessibility are expected As the authors final note the digital technologies mentioned above are categorized as synchronoustechnology requiring users to be online at the Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into Teaching Unit same time in order to communicate in real time Erben et al This online connectivity requirement may be an issue for students in Indonesia who like the student teachers in this research would likely be dependent on the free wireless network available on schooluniversity campus Otherwise they would have to ration their use of limited Internet data from smartphones We are suggesting this as point of con sideration for teachers who are interested in exploring digital technology integration into their teaching Finally the present study limits its discussion on student teachers engagement with digital technologies for teaching Therefore we decided that concerns related to data privacy and online security

['Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Considerations for Design and Production of Digital Books for Early Literacy in Ethiopia TERESA DOBSON University of British Columbia MARLENE ASSELIN University of British Columbia ALEMU ABEBE CODE Ethiopia Abstract This paper considers the implications of digital text production models for the development of reading materials for emergent and early readers in the Ethiopian context We draw from several theoretical frameworks and also from comments of Ethiopian academics writers and publishers to ground descriptions of Ethiopian contexts of language and literacy We then present three different models for the production and curation of digital stories for children and contemplate how these models align with existing literacy traditions and practices We also raise questions about the potential effects on the development of literary culture and childrens literature in Ethiopia of projects imed at rapidly producing large corpora of literature for children Ultimately we pose complicated cultural and linguistic questions that need to be taken into consideration to provide appropriate and original early literacy materials in Ethiopia Keywor ds Ethiopia early literacy childrens literature digital texts Introduction Low literacy rates in some majority world contexts are deemed problematic particularly by the Euro Western world and have precipitated intervention in the form of literacy programs Wickens Sandlin Such programs promote the use of digital texts as an essential component of urgently needed early literacy programs primarily as means to reduce publication costs and increase knowledge mobility United States Agency for International Development USAID These recommendations are set against backdrop of history of donated context insensitive books from the Global North that have had little impact on access Much of the digital material trickling down into the hands of children in the Global South are cultural and linguistic downloads from the same foreign publishers of donated print books which raises ethical concerns about the appropriateness of texts for children and the development of local culture of childrens literature And yet small portion of new texts generated through emergent digital projects do originate internally with local writers illustrators and publishers thereby promising more relevance Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page This paper considers the cultural linguist ic and technological implications of digital models of text production and curation with particular focus on the Ethiopian context of language and literacy To establish this context we describe Ethiopias linguistic and cultural diversity as well as Ethiopian traditions and practices around early reading book culture and storytelling We then present analyses of digital book production projects producing storybooks for children in Ethiopian languages Multiple theoretical framings inform our discuss ion of the deeply complex historical political religious social and economic context of Ethiopian language and literacy It is this context that digital book production projects need to take into account if the aim is to provide means of access to original culturally and linguistically relevant literacy materials for emergent and early readers in Ethiopia We also include information and perspectives from Ethiopian academics writers and publishers who emailed answers to series of questions about their experiences with stories and their views of contemporary childrens reading materials in Ethiopia Perspectives offered through the activities described above illustrate and extend descriptions of th Ethiopian context of language and literacy derived from literature Subsequently we planned focus group discussion with our seven participants about the implications and possibilities of digital book production at the College of Educational and Behavi oral Studies at Addis Ababa University At the request of the Dean of the College however we changed the focus group structure to that of presentation on local digital book production project This presentation was open to all faculty and graduate st udents Comments and questions from attendees inform the second half of this paper The Ethiopian Context Literacy and Linguistic Diversity in Ethiopia According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS the rate of literacy in Ethiopia has dramatically increased over the past years and continues to rise steadily Figures published for suggest that almost of youth are now literate in comparison to reported rate for youth of less than in and about in see Table Over the past few decades there has also been marked increase reported in literacy rates among girls and women to the point that the literacy gap between men and women between the ages of and is now reported to be less than see Table Joshi and Verspoor observe that one impetus for change has been the goal set by the Ethiopian government of becoming middle income country by to MoFED Such goal Joshi and Verspoor note is only possible in countries with high rates of literacy among both men and women and sufficient number of secondary graduates to support middle income economy Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Table Ethiopian Literacy Rates by age for the years and as reported by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS Literacy Rates By Year age and older and older no data Table Ethiopian literacy rates by age and gender as reported by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics UIS Literacy Rates Total Male Female years years and older years and older As acknowledged by the UIS itself potential shortcomings of any set of national statistics such as those cited above relate to how literacy is defined and the methods by which literacy data is collected In International Literacy Statistics Review of Concepts Methodology and Current Data UIS author Roy Carr Hill draws on the work of New Literacy Studies scholars in observing that literacy only has meaning within its particular context of social practice and does not transfer easily across contexts there are different literacy practices in different domains of social life such as education religion workplace public services and family and community activities They change over tim and these different literacies are supported and shaped by different institutions and social relationships UIS The question of how literacy rates have been defined and measured over the past years in Ethiopia is beyond the scope of this paper suffice it to say that the above statistics are offered with the caveat that they are not infallible Collecting reliable literacy data in Ethiopia is challenging for number of reasons not the least of which is that the nation is one of great linguistic and cultural diversity In responding to the census for example citizens reported over languages as mother tongues and identified themselves as belonging to over distinct ethnic groups Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia Language and Literacy Volume Egress Page In working paper on the medium of instruction MoI in Ethiopian schools Vujich offers an overview of key language poli cies over the past years that have influenced literacy practices and achievement in school Drawing on Getachew and Derib he notes that the first official Ethiopian educational language policy emerged in in the form of directive that Amh aric was to be the general language of instruction and that in Amharic was also made the official language in Ethiopias revised constitution thus extending its use beyond the education sector to the political legal and administrative spheres Vujich Notably however Amharic has never been the language of the majority in Ethiopia Census data collected in shows that only of the population reported Amharic or Amaringa as mother tongue Afaan Oromo was in fact the ost common reported mother tongue while the remainder of the population reported over other languages as mother tongues Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia Ultimately the shift toward an Amharic speaking state which has been nterpreted by historians as nation building and power consolidation effort on the part of then Emperor Haile Selassie Getachew Derib Smith Vujich has led to complex scenario whereby many Ethiopian children particularly those in regions where Amharic is not dominant eg Oromia the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region SNNP Somali and Tigraydid have not had access to education in their first language Further at the same time Amharic was set as the medium of instruction MoI in early schooling English was promoted as the MoI in upper primary and secondary schools as well as in teacher training institution Heugh Benson Bogale Yohannes Vijich This meant children had to learn yet anoth er language to gain access to upper elementary and secondary schooling Vijich notes that while the socialist inspired revolution of resulted in formal reversal of Selassies homogenising policies in practice Amharic remained the language of in struction in primary schools principally because teachers most often spoke Amharic and were not trained in the use of local mother tongues Vijich The status quoprimary education in Amharic was nevertheless gradually contested Data collected by the ministry of education in the mid showed that performance in science and technology of students with Amharic as mother tongue was markedly higher than that of students with other first languages and the disadvantage of the MoI for non Amharic speakers was identified as likely cause Vijich This perspective is in line with developing understandings of the importance of the mother tongue in education see for example an extensive review of research on this topic in the recent andscape Report on Early Grade Literacy Kim Boyle Zuilkowski Nakamura As Cummins observes When the mother tongue is promoted in school the concepts language and literacy skills that children are learning in the majority lang uage can transfer to the home language In short both languages nurture each other Bilingual children perform better in school when the school effectively teaches the mother tongue and where appropriate develops literacy in that language By contr ast when childrens mother tongue is encouraged to atrophy and its development stagnates childrens personal and conceptual foundation for learning is undermined Cummins Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Cummins further notes that the challenge for educators and policymakers in highly multilingual settings is to shape the evolution of national identity in such way that the rights of all citizens including school children are respected and the cultural linguistic and economic resources of the nation are maximized To do other than offer education in the mother tongue particularly to children attending school in the very communities their ancestors have inhabited for generations violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child UNCRC which states tha education of children shall be directed toward the development of respect for the childs parents his or her own cultural identity and language and values and that child shall not be denied the right in community with other members of his or her group to enjoy his or her own culture to profess and practise his or her own religion or to use his or her own language United Nations Articles and The African Charter of Rights and Welfare of the Child adopted in by the Or ganisation of African Unity builds on the principles of the UNCRC also emphasizing that childrens education should include the preservation and strengthening of positive African morals traditional values and cultures OAU Article In keepi ng with these perspectives in new policy emerged in Ethiopia guaranteeing children the right to primary education in their first language Cognizant of the pedagogical advantage of the child in learning in mother tongue and the rights of nationali ties to promote the use of their languages primary education will be given in nationality languages Government of Ethiopia Even now however the implementation of this policy remains challenging in areas of high linguistic diversity for numbe of reasons including the difficulty in finding teachers fluent in local languages the challenge of offering teacher training in those languages the paucity of reading materials suitable to the context and the expense of translation when local reading materials are not available In the next section of this paper we focus on the third of these challenges the paucity of reading materials considering in particular the availability of storybooks that might support early literacy development Early Reading Book Culture and Storytelling in Ethiopia Many researchers have argued that early literacy acquisition is best supported by the extensive reading of storybooks particularly those that are closely connected to childrens home and community environments Bronfenbrenners ecological systems theory Bronfenbrenner Morris for example explains the interplay of various embedded contexts eg social legal economic and religious on human development For young childrens development the most immediate and influential environment is the microsystem consisting of the childs family and close community Applying this perspective to the selection of early reading materials for children it is widely acknowledged that the stories children hear and learn to read should include those in wh ich they can see themselves and their worlds the microsystem Such stories are those that describe characters with whom children can easily relate engaging in recognizable activities such as familiar childhood games or customary family and community pract ices As development progresses early childhood educators scaffold childrens reading materials to extend beyond immediate family and community contexts Acknowledging and drawing on childrens funds of knowledge Moll Greenberg in early learning settings respectfully and effectively supports literacy development Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page especially with children of diversity Moll Gonzalez Moll and his colleagues define funds of knowledge as those historically accumulated and culturally developed bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and wellbeing Moll Gonzalez Similarly the schema theory of reading proposed by Anderson and Pearson posits that comprehension requires the ability to relate reading or viewing to ones own schema or knowledge which includes content knowledge and knowledge of textual forms Recognizing the funds of knowledge and schemata students bring to classroom settings and providing reading materials that are both linguistic ally meaningful and culturally relevant allows beginning readers not only to identify with characters settings and events but also to understand vocabulary and cultural themes Thus along with the rise of multicultural childrens picture books have bee discussions of cultural authenticity in relation to both written subject matter and illustrations Fox Short Although some argue for specific definitions Smith and Wiese broadly define cultural authenticity as the extent to which the reteller adaptor or illustrator remains reasonably true to the original printed source accurately and respectfully represents the values and beliefs of the cultural group and responsibly depicts geographical historical and cultural details In the Ethiopian context there is not long tradition of the publication of the sorts of early reading materials described abovethat is illustrated books for children This is not because there is no history of literacy and book production in Ethiopia On the contrary as Winslow observes the Ethiopian tradition of manuscript production is one of the longest in the world and scribal practices that are centuries old are still practiced where they have been lost elsewhere Isolationist for period of almost years due to geopolitical and religious factors Ethiopia has preserved many practices intact from the medieval period including the production of parchment manuscripts Consequently Winslow remarks contemporary scholars of manuscript culture look to Ethiopia for an understanding of medieval book production techniques Figure Evidence of long history of literacy and book culture in Ethiopia scribe in Lalibela preparing texts for sale to tourists parchment manuscript date unknown written in Geez located in high mountain rock hewn church approximately km from Lalibela Photos TM Dobson personal archives Historically the primary script used for manuscript production in Ethiopia was Geez language for writing liturgical scholarly and literary work that is no longer in Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page general use beyond he church Scelta Quezzaire Belle Elsewhere in most settings outside the church communications were in oral form Notes McCann the written form as bureaucratic exercise did not supplant the oral tradition until well into the modern era Not surprisingly therefore book culture in Ethiopia is still strongly tied to its liturgical and scholarly origins and books are serious objects for serious content Figure Publishing storybooks for children is unique notion for many in Ethiopia Storytelling for children instead remains primarily oral genre In an effort to get sense of perspectives on and experiences with early literacy texts in Ethiopia we sought input from seven Ethiopian citizens involved in education and book production These participants all professionals included member of an NGO working in early literacy projects university faculty in education an author of childrens books in major indigenous Ethiopian languages and local publisher Planned Sky pe interviews were not possible due to challenges with connectivity so participants answered questions via email Asked about the most common types of stories in their own homes growing up they listed riddles songs indoor and outdoor games animal stor ies and fables The functions of these stories according to one participant are to teach kids how to socialize to make critical thinkers learn manners and to entertain Riddles for instance help children to think critically Participant NGO Memb er Another intimated that storytelling is primarily didactic in nature Children are expected to attend carefully during storytelling sessions right up to the point that the message is made clear Grandparents are more willing than parents to tell stor ies to children When grandparent tells story children sit around herhim and listen Usually they sit rounding the fireplace in home When the teller tells orally from hisher memory children listen with strict discipline They can smile gesture nd even laugh But they do not shout move from place to place and push each other They listen until the teller finishes and tells message of the story Participant Professor of Childhood Studies Participants identified the tellers of these stories family and community members including grandmothers mothers fathers uncles aunts and neighbours One participant remarked that siblings also tell the stories to one another point that is also emphasized by Jirata in his work on the oral radition among the Guji Oromo in Southern Ethiopia Most remarked that the stories they recall were told orally from memory regularly in the evening before bed One reported hearing stories through radio and television observing there was popular stor yteller called Ababa Tesfaye on TV childrens show in my time Participant Publisher Another participant published Ethiopian YA author who responded to our questions via email captured the richness of storytelling sessions by noting the different environments in which his mother and father orated My father came from an Oromo family and he used to tell us about his home town and my mother came from Amhara family and she used to tell us about her home town In Ethiopia extended coffee ceremony is common and neighbors are called as most house wives are around and find excuses to start telling about it Sometimes my Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page mother speaks about the same story again and again had very strong grandmother yet neighbors were afraid of her Most believed she was more than years old She was like legend My mother told stories about her grandmother passed away at years old Unsure though as no birth certificates could get clues of her age by what she spoke about historically Even men were afraid of her She was very logical She was part of relatively well off countryside family She was very bossy and supervised the men over their work She was ahead of her time by assuming the responsibility herself for mens work and anyones work She remain center topic of stories today My father had business and my siblings and used to go to where the restaurant business is located He used to tell stories about his home town not necessarily for us but for customers and others Then we used to listen what he had to say Father was Oromo when he came to the city he suffered exploitation He started restaurant business in Addis and was forced to change his name to Amharic to get customers His wife was Amharic at the time this was cultural no no to give daughter to an Oromo man From my fathers stories learned about things more indirectly than directly as he wasnt necessarily talking to me but to his customers and friends and would be around pretending to play but also listening Participant Ethiopian Writer no editorial changes have been made to these notes Notably in keeping with the Ecological Systems Theory discussed earlier which stresses the immediacy and import of the microsystem the stories alluded to here are of hometowns and important people therein Over the lengthy process of preparing coffee roasting grinding boiling filtering pouring the women find excuses to start telling about it the neuter pronoun here presumably referring to the recurring story of the legendary grandmother and her prescient behaviours that pushed the boundaries of ge nder roles The story is not explicitly didactic and formal as is the case in another participants earlier description of children sitting attentively and waiting for the message Nor are the fathers stories examples of direct instruction specifically intended for children rather children glean from these adult stories by eavesdropping while pretending to play If we view emergent and early reading materials as most appropriate when they reflect the microsystem then it stands to reason that initial efforts at publishing childrens literature in Ethiopia have drawn on the stories of the oral tradition commonly told in the home and community When we asked our participants to list appropriate subjects or topics for young childrens books they proposed that literature for early reading should be about animals the environment or surroundings eg trees rivers etc holidays people in the localities stories with morals and the common story topics Regarding to the last suggestion the partici pant in question named several Ethiopian fables that are recognizable as part of the oral tradition including biblical tale The Monkey and the Lion The Wise Man and Foolish Man and The Clever Children In writing about the oral tradition of th Guji Oromo in southern Ethiopia Jirata notes The concept of oral practice signifies oral tradition as comprising cultural genres that include myths legends folktales jokes proverbs riddles chants blessings curses insults folk songs and folk beliefs The concept of oral process denotes oral Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page tradition as events of social interaction and entails performances such storytelling riddling singing dancing joking and chanting Thus oral tradition can be understood as cultural practices produced and reproduced through oral interactions Given this complexity story forms for very young children which by necessity are orally transmitted are regularly the last to make the transition to writing in any culture and are still deemed nascent in many traditions of writing eg Salisbury Styles reticence to render such oral practices into writing in any context stems at least partially from the fact that performative elements are difficult if not impossible to transmediate The bridge from oral to written forms is made in childrens books to some degree through reliance on illustration to support and extend verbal content This multimodal element of childrens texts inevitably becomes factor in the cost and ease of their production both in print and digital environments In the next section we discuss several initiatives having an impact on access to early storybooks in Ethiopia Digital Texts for Young Readers in Ethiopia As noted earlier we hoped to plan follow up focus group session with our seven participants at Ad dis Ababa University in May however we were asked by the Dean to open the session to all faculty and students and to convert the format to more formal presentation on the production of digital books for early literacy in Ethiopia Thirteen facul ty and graduate students in fields related to education and early childhood development along with one NGO representative attended our May workshop Consideration for the Production of Digital Books for Early Literacy in Majority World Contexts In this presentation we contemplated the ways literacy is being fostered particularly in reference to the lack of readily available childrens storybooks in Ethiopian indigenous languages We also introduced three approaches to digital access that may lead to increased availability of early reading materials the International Childrens Digital Library ICDL the CODE Ethiopia Digital Books and Family Literacy Project and two crowdsourcing projects aimed at generating large multilingual digital corpora namely Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project Because the seminar room did not have connectivity we presented all these projects as screen captures via data projector Below is discussion of these projects in consideration of the responses from our workshop participant group The International Childrens Digital Library ICDL The ICDL is an open access curated collection of books that is primarily designed as read only platform The ICDL goal as stated on their website is to build collection that represents outstanding historical and contemporary books from throughout the world Ultimately the Foundation aspires to have every culture and language represented so that every child can know and appreciate the riches childrens literature from the world community International Childrens Digital Library para Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page With volumes in languages this project having launched in November is about halfway to the stated goal of collecting volume in languages Druin et al ICDL Users are not invited to author stories although they can add metadata to existing stories in the form of keyword tags The ICDL Collection Development Policy makes clear that the primary focus making available existing published volumes that are currently available in print and within copyright out of print but within the copyright protection of the country in which they were published or freely available in the public domain there is no explicit solicitation for new materials International Childrens Digital Library In other words this is primarily print digitization project geared toward creating an open educational resource in the form of digital corpus of previous ly published childrens books in multiple languages The ICDL was prescient in terms of recognizing the need for resource of this type however the requirement of negotiating copyright for most of the volumes added slows the growth of the collectionat time when there is immediate need for early reading materials in some contexts Additionally by collecting already published work the project is not aimed at the root problem discussed earlier that there are few if any published storybooks in many lang uages used as MoI in early education within and beyond Ethiopia At the time of writing this paper there were only two books listed by country as Ethiopian in the ICDL BothFafis Sheep and Lions Tale are traditional stories in Amharic that were ori ginally published in and respectively by the Ethiopian Books for Children and Educational Foundation The CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project The second project we introduced was the CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project This began as small scale pilot intended to complement national reform in education aimed at improving access and equity in early childhood care and education Et hiopian Ministry of Education The project initially targeted children aged to and their families in three rural areas where appropriate reading materials for the target group were unavailable The primary objectives were to develop culturally nd linguistically meaningful early reading materials written and illustrated by local writers and artists to provide access to and guided experience with the texts in family literacy program and to invite communities to write stories relevant to their contexts thereby fostering an interest in the writing of stories within communities Abebe Asselin Dorion Abebe CODE Ethiopia Ethiopia based librarians writers and CODE Ethiopia members initially selected six stories common to the oral tradition Abebe notes that these were made available in two local languages Amharic and Afaan Oromo and that the themes of the stories related to animals school life and friendship np Notably most are moral or religious tales with strong didactic element Colonial influence in the Ethiopian oral tradition is also evident in the selection of Wondime Yakob Brother Jacob or Frre Jacques described on the project site as the Amharic version of the well known French nursery rhyme with melody that is almost the same as the French one CODE Ethiopia Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Although the rhyme is heavily adapted to the point that it is dissimilar to the original rhyme in most respects the story describes the morning routine of brother and sister who wake each other up and later go to school to acquire knowledge Although this CODE Ethiopia pilot work was initially couched as digital book project the book production model is consistent with contemporary approaches to print publication CO DE Ethiopia deemed dual platform approach necessity that is all books must be produced in such way that multiple copies of each text can be distributed in either print or digital formats In this respect conventional design approach for Western onographs is employed Books are construed as artefacts with title page front matter and multiple pages featuring text and image with margins see Figure Printed versions can be produced quickly for home reading or if hardware or power fails via photocopier see Figure Given this model there is limited opportunity to explore the multimodal affordances of digital platforms affordances such as audio and video features that might be better suited to setting with strong oral tradition Instead the bulk of digital materials produced might be described as print adaptations Joyce Both print and digital versions of the books produced in the context of this project are distributed under Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial license Figure Fantu ena ekiduwa Fantu and her Plan is the story of Grade student who tells about her daily activities Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Printed copies of the Afaan Oromo version of New Year and Children Ayyaana Waggaa fi Daaimman Beyond production of the six books there was focus on building corpus of context sensitive texts by inviting each of the three communities involved in the pilot to contribute two stories commonly told in their own contexts CODE Ethiopia selected and edited three of the resulting stories and had them illustrated by the project illustrator Atilabachew Reda Original books from this project along with the three contributed by communities have now been translated into six Ethiopian languages Each translation was treated with extreme care for sensitivity to context including attendance to local dialects and customs as well as reworking of illustrations to reflect local settings Consider for example three unique covers for the Amharic Afaan Oromo and Somali versions of New Year and Children Figures The nine books have been prepared in PDF formats and are loaded onto tablets for use in ongoing literacy projects managed by CODE Ethiopia They have also been acquired by the African Storybook Project Those who attended the session commented favourably on this project and the demonstrable feasibility of the approach with regard to future literacy and collection building endeavours Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Amharic version of New Year and Children with cover reflecting traditional dress of the Amhara Region Figure One of two given the unique dialects of this language Oromo versions of New Year and Children with cover reflecting dress common in the Dire Dawa area Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Somali version of New Year and Children with cover reflecting Muslim dress common in the Somali Region Outsourcing to the rowd Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project The third and fourth approach we introduced were crowdsourcing initiatives that harness the collective wisdom of communities in the quest to develop large corpora rapidly specifically Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project ASb Both projects llow users to read download translate and create stories Like ICDL Bloom has global scope while ASb has an African focus Bloom sets out the problem that both projects aim to address on its splash page observing that literacy educators are regular ly faced with too few books in localized indigenous language settings to successfully foster literacy We know that it takes stacks of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the practice needed to develop true literacy The problem has been who will make all those books How will we find the time Where will we get the content So we settle for the possible and hope for the best Bloom Library para Therefore key challenge addressed by such projects similar to the CODE Ethiopia project is building interest in story writing and the capacity for bookmaking in local communities where collections of reading materials are not available To this end Bloom dramatically lowers the bar by providing simple touse software and range of book templates so that many more people can get involved in building large collection of local language books Bloom Library Data from the Internet Archive show that Bloom Library and ASb were launched at roughly the same time The Archive shows Bloom Library had launched at bloomlibraryorg by July meanwhile by September ASb had launched preliminary site announc ing its initiative at africanstorybookorg and provided site with functionality for users by May Both projects have since collected many volumes in the case of Bloom Library and almost in the case of ASb Unlike ICDL and Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Bloom Libra ry there is not readily apparent count of the total number of books on ASb although up until April it was possible to estimate based on summing the totals in each category and assuming books did not regularly appear in multiple categories The slower growth of Bloom Library despite its global scope is likely matter of accessibility Bloom Library requires users to download software before reading and uploading stories and this software is only available for PC and Linux standalone computers For creators Bloom Library also recommends the installation of The Art of Reading curated collection of line drawings fonts and typing script for lord who do not have way to type their own language The fact that download is required to create and read and that there is no compatibility for the Mac OS undoubtedly reduces the number of users of and contributors to the Bloom Library Nevertheless this approach evidently does have benefits for instance it offers way for users to create offline which is major consideration for settings with unreliable Internet access ASb on the other hand has circumvented such platform wars by opting for web application based on JavaScript and hosted in Drupal shell No registration or local software is required to read or download ASb books The only potential impediment to submit or version ie translate story is the creation of an account Thus the ASb collection having removed all barriers to access other than connectivity is growing most rapidly of all It is also noteworthy that strong promotion of translation or versioning by the ASb has contributed to the rapid growth of its corpus point to which we will return Both the Bloom Library and ASb growth rates eclipse that of the pr ojects discussed earlier recall that it has taken the ICDL years to collect volumes Clearly the possible described by Bloom Library in opting for crowdsourcing over curation is coming to fruition what is less clear is whether their hope or the best in taking this approach is being realized As Porcello and Hsi note in speaking of the variable quality of open educational resources OER there are benefits and drawbacks to crowdsourcing approaches On one hand collections using rowdsourcing allow wide range of online users to contribute choosing their own descriptions and keywords to catalog review and manage OERs This can produce large and loose collections Although dedicated users from the resulting online communities might be more willing to detail their instructional experiences and personal connections to OERs overall quality may be quite variable On the other hand having professional staff with disciplinary expertise populate catalog and maintain curated collecti ons usually results in fine tuned coherent and smaller collections Although these collections grow more slowly often with less vocal user communities they can quickly respond to new quality or educational standards Porcello Hsi As we considered the possibilities of the crowdsourcing projects for the Ethiopian context with those in attendance the question of reimagining texts for different contexts through versioning and adaptation became main point of interest At the time of our presentation in Addis Ababa there were no volumes in Ethiopian languages in the Bloom Library collection this continues to be the case There was however growing collection of books on ASb As noted earlier connectivity was unavailable for our workshop so we selected four Amharic books as examples and Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page included representative screen captures within our presentation These were as follows Fantu and her Plan CODE Ethiopia book with which the group was familiar How Many counting book ith simple sketches of insects birds and mammals The Girl Who Got Rich moral story about two poor hungry sisters who separately encounter leper woman with magical powers and receive different fates in accordance with their treatment of her an Like to Read simple text for early readers about boy who enjoys reading and wanders about his home trying to find family members with whom he can share his story Beyond the CODE Ethiopia text all of the above books are versioned from other languages not indigenous to Ethiopia The counting book How Manywritten by Clare Verbeek Thembani Dladla and Zanele Buthelezi and illustrated by Sandra McDougall first appeared in Zulu It was originally produced through the Seed Books project of the School of Education and Development and the Centre for Adult Education at the University of KwaZulu Natal South Africa The Girl Who Got Rich is by Ugandan author Salaama Wanale written in Lumasaaba and versioned by the same author to Amharic The illustr ations are attributed to Mango Tree which is apparently Mango Tree Educational Enterprises Ugandan educational consulting firm Doherty personal communication March Finally Like to Read is written by Letta Machogo in Sepedi with illustrations by Wiehan de Jager both of South Africa The Amharic translation is by Sehin Tefera and Mezemir Girma Like to Read One example of versioning for the Ethiopian context Of the four texts the first three drew little in the way of comment or response The group was familiar with the CODE Ethiopia text The second two texts How Many and The Girl Who Got Rich depicted items or settings that were familiar local animals in the first case and the traditional tukal homes common in East Africa in the latter The fourth text Like to Read drew an audible gasp of surprise What garnered the groups attention was not the story but the illustrations The cover and first pag spread show smartly dressed boy in well appointed home He is seated in an orange upholstered chair next to which is leafy plant in large vase landscape painting hangs on the vibrant green wall behind him and it appears there is wall towall carpeting on the floor like to read or like reading declares the boy see Figure On the second page spread he stands at the door of his baby sisters room He is searching for someone with whom he can read The baby is sleeping soundly in white crib large soother in her mouth mobile comprised of smiling stars hangs above the crib The walls appear to be papered in pink with cloud wall appliqu positioned next to the crib Who can read to the boy asks see Figure Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page Figure Like to Read first page spread Figure like to Read second page spread Those in attendance were not familiar with the crowdsourcing approach of the ASb that results in stories migrating across contexts through versioning or adaptation At first glance it would be easy for any reader to overlook metadata and surmise that story written in Amharic should be of Ethiopian origin But the images so clearly not reflecting Ethiopian settings made the book untenable and created discomfort The illustrations are by Wiehan de Jager designer from Cape Town South Africa They reflect mixed design elements mostly of European origin from Colonial Revival Style eg machine milled trim and moulding to Mid Century Modern eg simple lines geometric patterns and aesthetic contrast In Ethiopian homes however such design features wallpaper mouldings carpeting mobiles cribs and so on are rare Many homes especially in rural areas are constructed with mud plastered wooden walls and grass roofs and single room may serve for sleeping keeping all household belongings cooking and dining keeping warm by burning wood and also for tethering domes tic animals at night Animut Balkew Lindtjrn study showed that of Ethiopian homes have flooring of earth and sand or dung and that use one room for sleeping Family beds are the norm Only of rural households have pi ped Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page water and of rural households have electricity Toilets are often shared among several households even in urban settings Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia This reality stands in contrast to the domestic spaces pictured by Wieh an de Jager in Like to Read He depicts the protagonist wandering through home comprised of multiple rooms living room nursery and kitchenbefore venturing out to the front of the house where he finds men fixing car on paved driveway Figure This last detail is also incongruent with local context in consideration of the fact that Ethiopia stands near the bottom of the cars percapita list globally at or vehicles per people eg Deloitte Figure Like to Rea seventh page spread Illustrations from Like to Read provoked comment among presentation attendees about the disjuncture between such images and the reality of Ethiopian settings Participants discussed the challenge of finding balance between generating culturally sensitive reading materials and steering clear of ethnocentrism One individual emphasized that texts should be reflective of and consistent with the particular social context of the intended readership Another agreed stipulating that hen children learn to read it must be with culturally relevant materials There was clear aversion among many present to the concept of generic readers texts designed for learning to read in contrast to authentic context specific stories Yet one erson presented another perspective suggesting that stories serve as means of socialization and can be viewed as vehicles of ethnocentrism This prompted the question To what extent should or can stories be bias or culture free One speaker argued for the merit of stories designed for literacy learning that are transferable across cultures while another suggested stories such as Like to Read are not artefacts of bias but evidence of Ethiopias diversity Still another claimed that ethnocentrism is sy stemic and that an exclusive focus on culturally sensitive texts would further promote this perspective In considering these responses it is important to note that the presentation attendees were unaware the story was versioned rather than an original ork in Amharic Evaluating books from various projects was not the focus of the session the aim rather was to put forth more broadly the affordances of digital means of knowledge mobilization for early Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page literacy education in the Ethiopian context In making book selections therefore we did not attend to which stories were versioned and which were originally in Amharic intending merely to flick through screen captures to show that number of Amharic books were available and then to invite attendees to look at the ASb site themselves plan the lack of connectivity in our seminar room prevented Ultimately however we would suggest it is very likely that many ASb readers who make keyword searches for stories in particular target languages will not be aware if they encounter unique or versioned stories Without the presence of clear statements indicating the versioning history of the narrativestory biographies if you will it would be easy for those readers not attuned to the way in which the corpus is produced to overlook metadata and like our audience find an unexpected disjuncture between the context suggested by the text and the context suggested by the illustrations In report on the African Storybook Project Welch and Glennie sta te that versioned stories make up the bulk of the corpus End ofmonth statistics from January through June show the ratio of the number of versioned stories to the number of unique stories is consistently greater than to Like to Read alone had been versioned times at the time of the writing of this paper into range of languages indigenous to Africa and otherwise Furthermore the story is typically translated not from the Sepedi version which is given the status of being the orig inal story but from one of two English instantiations Both are also by the story author Letta Machoga but have slight lexical variations Like to Read and Love to Read Notably our analysis of the versions of Like to Read was completed before changes to the ASb interface effected in early April buried the site metadata at least for the moment to the point that it is no longer possible to trace the versioning history of stories Welch and Glennie explain that the ASb has activel pursued translation as an effective way to build the corpus noting that each story can be translated into multiple languages for no cost and that workshops with local language speakers have proved very effective They remark in particular on successful translation workshop with participants that produced versions of seven existing stories In many ways this is an exciting initiative In an ASb blog post on versioning Dorcus Wepukhulu Kenya based coordinator for the ASb observes that translation workshop participants become involved in complex discussions about matters of translation pondering appropriateness to context text level and so on They consider for example whether they are engaging in translation or adapt ation depending on the extent of the nature of changes to the text eg whether the aim is to stay as close to original narrative as possible or to adapt for context suitability They grapple with dialects and regional preferences as well as with the appropriateness of oral or written constructions Wepukhulu The language work described by Wepukhulu is clearly careful but the matter of how illustrations are managed through the process of versioning is worrisome Wepukhulu ends her writing pondering this dilemma There is the issue of whether can adapt the text and retain the illustrations or could adapt illustrations and retain the text At the moment it is not possible to do the latter How can adapt actionsevents in story without having to adapt illustrations Wepukhulu np Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page As we have seen in consideration of Like to Read the question is broader than this Even if the translation reflects the source very closely that is to say if actions and events are unaltered to the extent that this is possible in translation failure to bring illustrations in line with the intended context could derail meaning for young readers In texts for emergent and early readers illustrations are integral to meaning making There is much research in this area that is beyond the scope of this paper suffice it to say that picture books work through the integration of visual and verbal meanings eg Painter Martin Unsworth mergent readers use pictures as primary clues to construct meaning and may benefit from texts in which images reinforce the verbal meaning eg Anderson Hiebert Scott Wilkenson Clay Harste Woodward Burke Books for more advanced readers may evidence increasingly complex use of illustration to reinforce extend or interrogate the verbal aspects of the text Evans In spite of wealth of knowledge about the critical role of images in childrens literature both crowdsourcing projects appear to privilege the verbal ov er the visual elements by relying on stock illustrations or promoting image reuse Bloom Library project of global scale offers curated collection of line drawings The Art of Reading This free collection contains more than line drawings sui table for use in reading materials Bloom Library ASb has offered cost benefit analysis for image reuse An important additional dimension is that it is possible to produce these storybooks at fraction of the cost of original titles because he illustrations are re usable and the digital tools exist for publishing of translation in the same format The African Storybook commissions high quality digital illustrations at an average cost of USD per page book Each translation and adapta tion makes use of the same illustrations So the initial investment in the book is spread across the or more versions of the book that are created In addition the professional illustrations are stored in the African Storybook image bank and can be use not only for translations and adaptations of storybook but combined to create new storybooks Welch Glennie Although ASb project members report that the stories are written and illustrated by Africans Stranger Johannessen it is not clear that this is in fact the case Listed illustrators for some books for instance are widely accessible image banks and Internet image search engines such as Google Even in the case that illustrators and writers are African the ques tion remains as to whether these illustrations and writings are transportable across the exceedingly diverse continent that is Africa as we have seen in the case of Like to Read Are the drawings of Weihan De Jager white designer and specialist in co rporate branding living in South Africa relevant in settings associated with the many languages into which the book has now been translated Suggesting this should be the case as intimated in the cost analysis above seems dangerously close to the sort of one size fitsall racial ethnic territorial or geopolitical essentialism that has long plagued Africa putting what is clearly valuable project in danger of being cast as an engine of neo colonialism Most certainly this cost saving strategy runs counter to the ASb goal Children need to have books in familiar language with stories that reflect their context and experience as well as their hopes for the future so that they can connect with them emotionally Welch Glennie Language and Literacy Volume Issue Page It is not our intent to dismiss the important work of Bloom Library or the ASb but rather to enter into conversation about the benefits and drawbacks of various methodologies for building corpus of early reading materials that is highly sensitive to cultu ral context While template driven production approaches crowdsourcing open licences and versioning may build corpus quickly and at low cost they are all Western models of knowledge production and mobilization that require careful navigation when used for the generation of culturally sensitive literary materials for primarily oral contexts Literary culture childrens literature and mass literacy has developed over hundreds of years in the global North ultimately we wonder what is the effect of accelerating the process in particular settings with newly literate populations Evidently there is much work to be done in examining the limitations and affordances of various models for this proposed work Conclusion Many have represented low literacy rates in majority world contexts as crisis and range of literacy programs have been initiated in responsesome of which we have discussed in this paper We view these programs as exceedingly valuable in many ways We also recognize however even as we acknowledge our involvement in such projects two of the authors of this paper spearheaded the CODE Ethiopia project described earlier that we must continue to engage in critical conversations about the impacts both positive and negative of various interventions As Graff rightly observed almost four decades ago it is not given that literacy translates to economic social and cultural success On the contrary literacy is often used by those in authority as the vehicle for the efficient training of the population and the maintenance of hegemony Graff As Luke has observed in contemporary human capital models of education advocated by institutions such as UNESCO levels of literacy ontinue to be taken as robust predictors of economic take off industrial development and indeed socioeconomic and political enfranchisement Wickens and Sandlin suggest that in spite of the fact that the literacy community is fully aw are that literacy is inherently politicaland that many current programs continue social control there is persistent suggestion that literacy education is vital in all parts of the globe even in contexts with strong oral traditions Thus its absence is met with panicked movements to address perceived lack as quickly as possible Ultimately in reference to programs of potential relevance in the Ethiopian context we ask the following questions What are the implications of initiatives that impose Western models of literacy in contexts with strong oral traditions What is the long term effect of rapid injection of literary materials on emergent communities of literary artists and illustrators in local contexts What are the limitations of current appro aches that lean toward template driven dual platform publication and perhaps obscure the possibility of multimodal approaches In contexts where the oral transmission of knowledge prevails are there possibilities for more innovative multimodal approache that might harness the affordances of digital publication None of these are easy questions but they are vital as we consider conditions for inclusion and equity across multiple communities languages forums and expressive modes within the Ethiopian ontext and

misinformation circulating online is crit ical challenge for modern societies While research to date has focused on psychological and political antecedents to this phe nomenon few studies have explored the role of digital media literacy shortfalls Using data from preregistered survey exper iments conducted around recent elections in the United States and Bharat we assess the effectiveness of an intervention modeled closely on the worlds largest media literacy campaign which pro vided tips on how to spot false news to people in countries Our results indicate that exposure to this intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of both mainstream and false news head lines but effects on the latter were signicantly larger As result the intervention improved discernment between mainstream and false news headlines among both nationally representative sam ple in the United States by and highly educated online sample in India by This increase in discernment remained measurable several weeks later in the United States but not in India However we nd no effects among representative sam ple of respondents in largely rural area of northern India where rates of social media use are far lower digital literacyjsocial mediajmisinformation Social media platforms have proved to be fertile ground for inammatory political misinformation People around the world increasingly worry that socalled fake news and other forms of dubious or false information are misleading votersa fear that has inspired government actions to address the problem in number of countries Research into online misinformation has thus far focused on political economic and psychological factors In this arti cle we focus on another human vulnerability to online political misinformation shortfalls in digital media literacy While largely overlooked in the emerging empirical litera ture on digital disinformation and fake news the concept of digital media literacy usefully captures the skills and competen cies needed to successfully navigate fragmented and complex information ecosystem Even under ideal conditions most people struggle to reliably evaluate the quality of information they encounter online because they lack the skills and contex tual knowledge required to effectively distinguish between gamy and lowquality word content The connection between digital media literacy and misinfor mation was identied early by theorists Misinformationand disinformationbreeds as easily as creativity in the feverswamp of personal publishing according to an inuential intro duction to the subject It will take all of the critical skills users can muster to separate truth from ction ref xii More than later these warnings seem prescient Sur vey research shows that few people are prepared to effectivelynavigate the digital world For example the Pew Research Cen ter found as recently as that only of US adults have the skills and condence to learn new information effectively online Nonetheless people worldwide increasingly obtain news and information from social media platforms that lack tra ditional editorial controls allowing politicians and other actors to widely disseminate misinformation via algorithmic news feeds Without the necessary digital media literacy skills people frequently fall victim to dubious claims they encounter in this context These concerns have become especially salient in the United States and India in recent years In the United States low quality online articles were distributed widely on social media in the months before the US presidential election This phenomenon created widespread fears that fake news was mis leading people at massive scale Smartphone use has also made India the worlds largest democracy fertile environment for online rumors and misinformation Viral misinformation Signicance Few people are prepared to effectively navigate the online information environment This global decit in digital media literacy has been identied as critical factor explain ing widespread belief in online misinformation leading to changes in education policy and the design of technology plat forms However little rigorous evidence exists documenting the relationship between digital media literacy and peoples ability to distinguish between low and highquality news online This largescale study evaluates the effectiveness of realworld digital media literacy intervention in both the United States and India Our largely encouraging results indi cate that relatively short scalable interventions could be effective in ghting

became signicant concern during the Indian general election as political parties engaged in aggressive digital cam paign efforts via short message service SMS and messaging applications like WhatsApp For instance one analy sis found that over of the news shared on Facebook during the election by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party BJP came from dubious outlets Many nonprots and governments are seeking to counter these trends and the related threat of foreign manipulation campaigns by improving the digital media literacy of news con sumers For instance American universities increasingly teach media literacy to undergraduate students and similar efforts are also being proposed at the kindergarten to grade Similarly WhatsApp and the National Association of Soft ware and Service Companies announced plans to train nearly people in India through inperson events and posts on social media to spot misinformation Despite the attention and resources these initiatives have received however little largescale evidence exists on the effec tiveness of promoting digital media literacy as response to online misinformation Existing scholarly work related to digital and media literacy is frequently qualitative in nature or focused on specic subpopulations andor issues Observational nd ings are mixed and randomized controlled trials remain rare Two related but more specic approaches have been shown to be somewhat effective in countering misinformation and are important to note however First inoculation interventions have been employed to protect audiences against misleading content by warning of misinformation and either correcting spe cic false claims or identifying tactics used to promote it This approach has been shown to reduce the persuasiveness of misin formation in specic domains In addition other studies evaluate the effectiveness of providing warnings about specic misinformation We therefore seek to determine whether efforts to promote digital media literacy can improve respondents ability to cor rectly evaluate the accuracy of online content across issues Such nding would suggest that digital media literacy shortfalls are key factor in why people fall victim to misinformation In par ticular we see the effects of exposure to Facebooks Tips to Spot False News which were developed in collaboration with the nonprot First Draft and subsequently promoted at the top of users news feeds in countries in April and printed in fullpage newspaper advertisements in the United States the United Kingdom France Germany Mexico and India variant of these tips was later distributed by WhatsApp Facebook subsidiary in advertisements published in Indian and Pakistani newspapers in These tips are therefore almost surely the most widely disseminated digital media lit eracy intervention conducted to date The full treatments are provided in SI Appendix section The US treatment which was adapted verbatim from Facebooks campaign consists of strategies that readers can use to identify false or misleading stories that appear on their news feeds whereas the India treat ment which uses adapted versions of messages shown in India by Facebook and WhatsApp presents These interventions provide simple rules that can help individ uals to evaluate the credibility of sources and identify indicators of problematic content without expending signicant time or attention For instance one sample tip recommends that respon dents be skeptical of headlines warning that If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable they probably are Such an approach should reduce reliance on loweffort processes that frequently lead people astray eg perceptions of cognitive uency by teaching people more effective heuristics eg skepticism toward catchy headlines Importantly the success of this approach does not require readers to take burdensome steps like conducting research or thinking deeply about each piece of news they encounter which is typically impossible in practice given the volume of stories that social media users encounter Instead this intervention aims to provide simple decision rules that help people distinguish between mainstream and false news which we call discernment following ref There are important reasons to be skeptical about the effec tiveness of this approach Prior research has found that media literacy interventions like this can help people think critically about the media content they receive However prior stud ies focus mostly on ofine health behavior the extent to which these interventions are effective for controversial political claims or online misinformation is largely unknown Moreover such interventions may struggle to overcome peoples reliance on heuristics such as familiarity and congeniality that news con sumers use to evaluate the credibility of online stories Finally attempting to identify false news through close scrutiny of headline differs from the typical approach of professional fact checkers who usually use lateral reading of alternative sources to corroborate claims We therefore conducted preregistered survey experiments in both the United States and India examining the effectiveness of presenting people with tips to help spot false news sto ries The US and India studies were each preregistered with Evidence in Governance and Politics see Materials and Meth ods All preregistered analyses are reported in this article or in the replication archive for the study Strikingly our results indicate that exposure to variants of the Facebook media liter acy intervention reduces peoples belief in false headlines These effects are not only an artifact of greater skepticism toward all informationalthough the perceived accuracy of mainstream news headlines slightly decreased exposure to the intervention widened the gap in perceived accuracy between mainstream and false news headlines overall In the United States the effects of the treatment were particularly strong and remained statis tically measurable after delay of approximately wk These ndings suggest that efforts to promote digital media literacy can improve peoples ability to distinguish between false and main stream news content result with important implications for both scientic research into why people believe misinformation online and policies designed to address the problem Our main research hypotheses evaluate whether the media literacy intervention reduces belief in false news stories hypoth esis increases belief in mainstream news content and improves respondents ability to distinguish between them We also consider three research questions RQs for which our priori expectations were less clear First past research shows that the effects of many experimental treatments eg in persuasion and framing studies decay quickly over time although providing participants with novel information may have more longlasting effects We therefore test the durability of our treatment effect by leveraging twowave panel design to tests its effects several weeks after the initial intervention RQ Second it is also possible that interventions may work only to make individuals more skeptical of noncongenial content they are already inclined to dismiss leaving their vulnerability to ideologically consistent misinformation unchanged We there fore test for the heterogeneity of the treatment effects based on the partisan congeniality of the content RQ Finally we test whether the intervention changed selfreported intentions to share false stories or subsequent online news consumption behavior in the US sample where these measures were available RQ Additional analyses exploring heterogenous treatment effects and alternate outcomes are discussed below but full mod els appear in SI Appendix section These analyses include whether intuitive cognitive style or prior headline exposure of Guess et alDownloaded by guest on June POLITICAL

Other Literature Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Preface This paper was prepared as background paper for the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA initiative in which digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars and which was launched in January Presenting digital skills framework was considered the first step in preparing the digital skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool to be used by the World Banks country teams to present strategies to foster and leverage digital skills for the emerging digital economy and DEA Score card which is being used by the World Bank to monitor progress towards achieving the DEA targets for the African continent to be achieved before These targets are aligned with the strategic orientations of the World Bank Group as well as the global development agenda ie SDG Earlier working drafts of this paper have informed ongoing work of the World Bank on digital skills and have been revi sed as this work evolved An early draft formed part of the technical background work for the th Forum of the Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences Engineering and Technology PASET which is facilitated by the World Bank The Forum Destination igital Africa Preparing our Youth for the Future was held in May in Kigali and attended by African countries and many partner countries Subsequent revisions of the draft July and November were used as World Bank inputs for the African Union Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa The paper and the proposed digital skills framework were also used to revise the Digital Skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool to prepare the DEA Scorecard and for the Digital Skills Country Action Plan Technical Assistance provided to PASET countries The Digital Skills pillar of the DEA Country Diagnostic Tool and Scorecard which incorporate the digital skills framework outlined in the paper were revie wed and endorsed by the Education Global Practice in early and ubsequently all the pillars of DEA Country Diagnostic Tool and Scorecard were formally reviewed and endorsed by the World Banks Africa region in May The present version incorp orates revisions made in concepts and descriptions of programs measurements and indicators in line with the above work and further elaborat es the advanced and highly specialized digital skills using the EUs eCompetence Framework for ICT Professions Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Summary This paper presents framework for digital skills based on review of international frameworks It discusses the demand and supply of digital skills as well as mapping with formal education programs at different levels of the system that could produce these skills It also gives examples of programs outside of formal education programs that could be used for imparting skills training Finally it suggests indicators Annex that could be used to be tter measure progress towards the objectives of the DEA initiative The paper does not cover the question of connecting schools and universities to broadband the types of technologies that could be used in education or the issues that need to be addresse in implementing the use of technology these are covered in other background papers The paper highlights the following issues Digital skills for citizens and non ICT professions One of the most comprehensive framework of digital skills for citize ns is the uropean Union EU DigComp Digital Skills Competence Framework andor its adap tation by UNESCO UIS in the Digital Literacy Global Framework DLGF The DigComp framework has competence areas while the DLGF framework has seven competence areas to better address developing country contexts Both have four proficiency levels basic intermediate advanced and highly specialized which can be further broken down into levels depending on the level of task com plexity The framework is especially useful for defining basic and intermediate skills that need to be broadly acquired by the youth population Adapt ation of his framework to the local contexts of countries is required in order to develop relevant educa tion courses training programs and assessment frameworks Countries will need assistance to do this ii Digital skills for the ICT professions require separate framework that describes the highly technical content and composition of skills applied in the ICT workplace The EUs Competence Framework provides useful reference which includes competence areas and proficiency levels associated with competencies required and applied in the ICT professions iii While he demand for digital skills is difficult to assess especially in the informal sector the requirement for basic digital skills is likely to become ubiquitous This is also the case for intermediate level skills in most formal sector jobs New approaches to assessing labor market demand including data from online job search platforms and Artificial Intelligence AI based analysis can help to identify the skills that are in demand at levels above the basic level iv While the supply of digital skills is equally challenging to assess selfreported measures suggest large proportion of th ose living in some of the Africa countries do not even possess the most basic digital skills which reflects their lack of familiarity with using broad set of digital devices and services For non ICT professions and citizens more broadly digital skills can be developed though formal learning in educational institutions well as informal and nonformal learning programs Basic digital skills should be provided to all high school students While he content of many of these courses is readily available there is important work to be done to adapt these to local contexts and to use local content Further implementation challenges of delivering at scale have to be addressed In North Africa where primary schools are better equipped basic digital skills can be provided at this level as well Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Basic and in some cases intermediate digital skills should also be provided out side of school settings especially as the majority of young people in regions such as Africa are out of school The se skills would ne ed to be provided together with foundational literacy and numeracy programs While variety of learning content associated with basic and intermediate digital skills are already available public private partnerships would need to be explored for efficie nt delivery to this population Intermediate digital skills should be provided to students in upper secondary schools and to all students in technical vocational and undergraduate nonICT programs as these students will enter occupations that require increasing use of technology At the technical vocational and undergraduate level students in non ICT courses that are more technology intensive can also to be taught advanced digital literacy skills In order to develop intermediate advanced and specialized skills for the ICT professions TVET and higher education institutions need to develop and reform courses that are benchmarked to international frameworks At the TVET level these include hardware and software relate courses for IT technicians while at the university level they include the core engineering programs such as electrical and computer engineering science programs At present both TVET and university courses in these disciplines are too theoretical and outdated Considerable and sustained efforts to reform these program are essential for African countries to assimilate and diffuse digital technologies Bootcamps and rapid skillingcoding courses can also help to produce advanced digital skills especially when there are spikes in demand for particular skillsprogramming languages These can be delivered through universities in partnership with companies or by the latter on their own Highly specialized digital skills will be imparted through postgraduate programs in applied mathematics computer engineering courses of high quality to train faculty and to introduce new courses These may have to be done at the regional level due to the shortages of highly skilled instructors who could handle such technical courses Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs The Importance of Digital Skills in Driving Digital Transformation Digital skills constitute one of the five foundational pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa initiative launched by the World Bank and are needed to mobilize digital innovations to transform economies societies and governments in Africa The other foundational pillars are igital infrastructure digital platforms digital financial services and digital entrepreneurship African economies require both digitally competent workforce as well as digitally literate citizens who could reap the benefits that the digital society brings digitally competent workforce can help strengthen the foundational pillars the installation of the digital infrastructure for example connectivity and data repositories that is most relevant for Africa the growth of digital entrepreneurship for example incubators and commerce that shapes digital industries and the development and use of digital platforms and digital financial services for example signatures and digital payments Moreover digitally competent workforce comprising large majority with basic digital skills and critical mass of skilled personnel and advanced specialists can help to extend the application of digital tools and processes in wide variety of sectors such as the informal service sector agriculture nergy transportation health and education to name few Digitally literate citizens can better reap the benefits of the digital economy by gaining access to more better and safer information ranging from government services commercial products and news as well engage with the wider community In contrast citizens who lack the capacity to digest complex and competing source of digital information and make appropriate judgements may fall into the traps of the digital economy including financial fra ud and especially for young people and children physical and other forms of abuse and exploitation The extent to which the spread of the digital economy is inclusive and broad based will depend on the inclusiveness of the five foundations Equity in dig ital skills across the population is likely to play particularly important role in sharing the prosperity promised by the digital economy concerted effort is required to equip the young population with digital skills Digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars in the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA initiative which includes Country Diagnostics on the state of the digital economy Scorecard to set targets and monitor progress and World Bank investments and technical support See Box As the term digital skills came to be used loosely across different pillars and strands of work this paper starts with the framework that can help to define these skills and the programscourses that could help to achieve them Broadly speaking the digital skills for citizens and the general workforce and digital skills for the ICT professions involve different domains and competences and require different frameworks which specify the relevant competences and proficiency levels These are summarized in Figure and further detailed in the next section Figure Digital Skills in the DEA Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box The Digital Economy for Africa DEA Initiative Prepared to support the implementation of the AU Digital transformation Strategy for Africa the World Banks Digital Economy for Africa DEA Initiative sets out bold vision to ensure that every African individual business and government is digitally enabled by The goal is to drive the digital transformation of Africa and ensure its full participation in the global digital economy The DEA takes the approach of strengthening the enabling foundations that help advance digital economy that promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction In case country has good enabling foundations it is on the path of developing robust digital economy The reverse may also be true Based on the examination of the experiences of successful compan ies and public sector institutions that form digital economies those foundations are taken to be the availability of internet or broadband which brings people online the ability to identify and authenticate people digitally and the ability to pay or transact digitally Digital economies further energize when there is sizeable population of tech savvy workforce and an ecosystem that supports firms to enter or scale up in ways that brings about digital transformation across sectors Once those foundation are in place wide array of use cases can emerge mostly driven by the private sector in digitalizing economy bringing new products services and delivery channels Measurable goals for and have been proposed with DEA Scorecard coveri ng High Level Indicators and Targets as well as pillar specific High Level Indicators Annex The DEA Initiative is also fully embedded in the IDA Commitments Key commitments include support to ensure To help close the digital infrastructure ap IDA will support IDA countries to double their broadband penetration on the African continent including eight in landlocked countries by ii percent of entrepreneurship and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises MSME projects will inc orporate digital financial services andor digital entrepreneurship elements and ensure they address particular constraints facing women and people with disabilities iii At least percent of IDA financing operations for digital skills development will support womens access to higher productivity jobs including online work iv All IDA financing operations for Digital Development will support womens increased access to and usage of digital services Support at least IDA countries to adopt universally accessible GovTech solutions and vi Support building client capacity in percent of IDA FCS countries to use field appropriate digital tools for collection and analysis of geo tagged data and apply this technology to enhance project implementation and coordination The DEA initiative has prepared Country Diagnostics Tool to guide the World Banks mul tisector task team in carrying out an assessment of the five pillars of the digital economy as well as cross cutting areas This tool is current ly in the process of being deployed in large number of African countries Source Adapted from World Bank Digital Economy for Africa Country Diagnostic Tool and Guidelines for Task Teams Version economy country diagnostics forafrica Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Framework for Digital Skills Africa still lacks comprehensive framework for digital skills although some countries have developed broad fra meworks Many OECD countries and some Asian and Latin American nations have developed frameworks to guide measurement of digital skills in the population and support the development of education and training materials thorough review of existing Digital Skills Frameworks was undertaken as part of the background work for this paper The list of the frameworks is given in Appendix Table The most comprehensive and widely used framework for general digital skills is the European Unions DigComp and its more recent update DigComp which identifies five areas with competences The five areas are information and data literacy ii communication and collaboration iii digital content creation iv saf ety and problem solving Carretero et al For each competence there are eight proficiency levels in DigComp grouped into four broad headings Foundational Intermediate Advanced and Highly Specialized UNESCOs Institute of Statistics has built on this framework to adapt it to developing country contexts as part of its goal to develop methodology that can serve as the foundation for the Sustainable Development Goal for digital literacy As part of this adaptation UIS has proposed adding two more competences to the EU DigComp framework to include competences related to devices and software operations and career related competences detailed explanation on the competency areas and proficiency levels is given in Table Figure indicates that while the proportion of the workforce that has the basic level of proficiency in multiple competences should ideally be large this proportion will decline for those with higher levels of proficiencies Figure Digital Skills Framework for General Workforce and Population Competencies and Proficiency Levels Existing frameworks can be grouped into two broad categories Digital competence frameworks whic identify key components of digital competence at different levels of proficiency and User skills level frameworks which indicate digital skills needed by different types of digital users DigComp contains no conceptual updates to DigComp competence areas and competences but it includes updates to proficiency levels and examples of use Sustainable Development Goal Thematic Indicator Percentage of youthadults who have achieved at least minimum level of proficiency in digital iteracy skills Appendix Table provides more details Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs The proficiency levels reflect the cognitive challenge the complexity of the tasks as well as autonomy in completing the tasks Carretero et al At the lowest levels person is able to carry out simple task with help at levels the person is able to apply knowledge solve problems and helps others while at levels the person is professional who is contributing to technical scientific knowledge in that domain Box provides examples of competencies and proficiency levels for different uses Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Table Summary of Digital Competences based on EU DigComp and Digital

evolution competences involving resolving digital issues creatively using digital technologies bridging personal gaps in digital skills as well as computational thinking Career related competences Use specific career related digital technologies and content to have access to opportunities in the digital economy competences involving operating specialized digital technologies as well as working with digital content for specific career related fields Source Based on Carretero et al and UIS Note Proposed by UIS as additions to the DigComp framework which was subsequently updated to DigComp Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box Examples of Competencies and Proficiency Levels Required by Different Users Farmers mobile phone can help farmers to improve their earnings through their decisions regarding crops to grow and markets to sell their produce However the degree to which this happens will depend partly on the technology sophistication of the phone conn ection to the Internet and partly on the digital skills of the famer The competence related to devices and software operations means that the farmers can input SIM card into their phones turn it on and charge it Foundational information and data literacy skills would allow the farmer to receive text messages on their phone regarding weather forecasts market prices of products and effective farmer practices With high level of proficiency in the competence area of communication and collaborati on farmer could learn about connecting to an irrigation system and to program it by using online resources or tapping into an online community UIS Students At the foundational level of proficiency in creating digital content student can create digital presentation to showcase their work using for example simple video tutorial from YouTube to animate the presentation In collaborating through digital technologies student at an advanced level should be able to co create data and content for making video and be able to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate digital resources Carretero et al Employee person who is seeking to improve their career opportunities would be able to use the tools of massive open online course MOOC to enhance their learning experience This would require intermediate level proficiency in the competence area of problem solving creatively using digital technology Carretero et al Digital skills for the Information and Communication Technology ICT profession require separate framework that describes the highly technical content and composition of skil ls applied in the ICT workplace The EUs Competence Framework provides useful reference that covers competencies required and applied in the ICT professions using common language for skill levels that can be understood across Europe see Figure similar framework exi sts in the US called the Skills Framework for the Information Age SFIA In East Asia Japans ICT Dictionary is most commonly used as reference framework for digital skills for the ICT professions The Competence framework articulates competences req uired and deployed by ICT professionals including both practitioners and managers It was created for managers and human resource HR departments for education institutions universities technical training institutions and training bodies policy mak ers and other organisations in public and private sectors It can therefore be used with necessary adaptations to assess the quality of ICT and engineering programs at the university and TVET level as well as those provided outside the formal education system contentuploadsEuropean eCompetence Framework CENCWA pdf The Competence levels can also be related to the levels of the broader European Qualifications Framework Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Figure ECompetence framework for the ICT Professions Source Adapted from European Competence Framework As digital technologies penetrate an increasing number of sectors and occupations sections of the workforce that are in non ICT professions and occupations will also require more specialized digital competences characteristic of ICT technicians and specialists Hence there is not strict one toone mapping between the two frameworks and the two broad groups of professions Nevertheless this distinction is useful especially in the African context where the majority of workers are non ICT professions and occupations but will increasingly require basic or intermediate level digital skills as enumerated in the UNESCO DL GFEU DigComp framework The digital skills proficiency levels in this framework provide an indication of the omplexity of the tasks that can be undertaken by non ICT specialists For example foundation or basic level of proficiency in digital skills represents abilities required to carry out simple tasks using simple digital technologies such as the capacity to use basic digital devices or applications Basic digital skills are typically used in vocational or informal sector occupations and occupations involving routine tasks for instance Uber drivers grocery delivery personnel etc Intermediate level profi ciency would typically be required in middle level occupations such as the general workforce in formal small and medium enterprises SMEs that are using range of digital technologies small firms and shops engaging in commerce and using digital payme nts journalists who can use digital tools for collecting searching and analyzing information Advanced level proficiency which requires greater analytical skills as well as theoretical knowledge is typically required in occupations with high level of ICT intensity Figure presents rough mapping of broad categories of occupations according to two education related dimensions the theoretical and analytical dimension and job specific competences and the use of the two frameworks presented in this section Digital comp etences apart from the most rudimentary ones such as using mobile phone for voice calls or simple messages cannot be developed without foundational literacy and numeracy skills Certain competences such as communication and collaboration as well as hi gher levels of proficiency in all areas of competence also require socioemotional skills These include characteristics such as perseverance empathy trust self control and self esteem among others However even foundational skills are lacking in maj ority of the population including among young people after several years of schooling particularly Mikhail Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs in SSA Hence developing even basic digital skills will require ensuring minimum level of literacy and numeracy Figure Types of Digital Skills and ccupations Note Adapted from Mikhail

analytical skills Job specific skills and competenciesExperimental applied conceptualConceptual intuitive Use of eCompetence Framework Use of DigCompDLGFDigital Skills Frameworks and Programs Demand for Digital Skills The spread of digital technologies may change the demand for skills in two opposing ways First there could be an increase in demand for basic and intermediate digital skills which help workers deploy these technologies as well as advanced digital and higher order cognitive and socioemotional skills which allow workers to leverage digital wo rkplaces to engage in nonroutine tasks Second there could be decrease in demand for routine skills or manual labor due to automation There is little systematic data on how the demand for digital skills or skills more broadly is changing in Africa However analysis presented in background paper for the World Development Report on Digital Dividends indicates that employment in occupations intensive in ICT use at work in developing countries has increased by percent between and alm ost two times the increase in developed countries Monroy Taborda et al The emergence of new industries and services in the digital economy as well as the spread of digital technologies in many traditional manufacturing and service sectors is likely to stimulate demand for digitally intensive occupations The ICT sector itself and emerging ICT intensive sectors such as commerce Internet enabled offshoring and online work bioengineering and so on will require workforce with range of di gital competences from intermediate to advanced and highly specialized levels Moreover demand will also emerge from the traditional sectors which are increasingly using digital technologies such as agriculture construction transportation and logistic manufacturing banking and finance health and government sectors in which the different categories of occupations ranging from scientific to the professional middle level and vocational occupations will require new digital skills Further while the ICT and ICT intensive sectors are not in themselves labor intensive they generate low skilled and medium skilled jobs in services such as retail food preparation and cleaning Box The demand for digital skills will be ubiquitous in the formal secto The World Economic Forum global surve of companies provides glimpse of the forthcoming transformations across industries including Africa The vast majority of companies in ach of the industries surveyed will adopt one or more of the new technologies listed in th survey the highest level of adoption will be in user and entity big data analytics percent of all companies app and web enabled markets percent internet of things percent machine learning and cloud computing percent Skills in these areas will be demanded by over percent of all industries with ICT professional services global health and financial services demanding these skill the most The other technologies that would have the biggest level of adoption include digital trade commerce augmented reality encryption new materials wearable electronics printing blockchain and robotics These technologies overall wil be introduced in over percent of all companies with digital trade adopted in percent The WEF survey also defined the new jobs and new roles of workers Top jobs that are expected to be in high demand moving forward are data analysts and data scientists rtificial Intelligence AI and machine learning specialists general and operations managers big data specialists digital transformation specialists sales and digital marketing professionals software applications developers and analysts and innovation professionals Based on these surveys the redundant roles are likely to be data entry clerks accounting bookkeeping and payroll clerks assembly and factory workers client in formation workers Analysis by LinkedIn in using its global database reveals trend of rising demand for jobs such as data scientists AI and machine learning specialists listing them on top of global demand including demand in Africa Further eve where earlier jobs continue workers and professionals would need to have hybrid skills not only the skills of their core profession but also digital skills The World Development Report notes that Kenyas mobile money service Pesa uses more than agents Hormuud Telecom the largest operator in Somalia employs staff but supports agents The technologies are printing Aerial and underwater robots App and web enabled markets Augmented and virtual reality Autonomous transport Biotechnology Cloud computing Digital trade Distributed ledger blockchain Encryption Humanoid rob ots Internet of things Machine learning New materials Non humanoid land robots Quantum computing Stationary robots User and entity big data analytics Wearable electronics Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs For instance an accountant would not only need the usual accounting knowledge but also skills in spreadsheets databases etc marketing director needs to also have skills in digital marketing social media and content marketing and using search engine optimization Note Only cities with LinkedIn members were included in this estimat ion which uses the skills and employment listed on the LinkedIn profiles of people However the effective demand for digital skills from the informal sector especially agriculture and services where the majority of people are employed in Africa is ikely to be constrained This is because of high levels of income volatility precariousness of employment and high opportunity costs that reduce participation in training or skills upgrading This may constrain the spread of digital technologies in these sectors Yet it is pre cisely in these labor intensive sectors where relatively simple technologies such as mobile phones can help to improve productivity in for example agriculture through better information on weather and prices as well regular technical advice on operation Small service providers food sellers tailors and so on can expand markets through the use of social media The informal manufacturing sector may also benefit from digital technologies such as printing which allows for small scale and customizable ools Finally ensuring that all citizens especially young people have basic digital skills is crucial for the extension of government services and for inclusion in the new economy The extent to which disruptive technological change is labor saving in Africa will depend on the number of routine tasks in jobs that might make them susceptible to automation relative wages and the lags in adoption of technology In general with lower wages and slower rate of technological adoption the risk of automa tion drastically reducing jobs is lower which gives time for governments to put in place policies for upskilling the population World Bank However each country needs to do this analysis to assess the demand for digital skills Artificial intelli gence enabled approaches can provide real time and predictive guidance on in demand skills and identify skills gaps especially for the formal sector or for employers and workers engaged in the digital economy Traditional methods of assessing demand em ployer surveys industry consultations focus groups can take long time and results can become quickly outdated when the job market is rapidly changing Further the skills assessed are not granular enough to provide guidance to training providers to hange their courses An example of such platform is JobKred which has developed algorithms to predict the top job occupations and top skills within these jobs which are demanded by the local area market Careers and skills recommendations engine is bu ilt by these methods to yield actionable relevant and accurate career and employment data However in the informal sector there are many knowledge and information failures that prevent the matching of demand and supply of skills Many small firms whe re the owners themselves have low levels of education are often not aware of new technology and new skills needs As in the case of other skills matching the supply with the demand for digital skills is best done in the context of programs that offer technical financial and marketing services to the informal sector Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Supply of Digital Skills While large proportion of the population in Africa has some familiarity with using mobile phones their capacity to handle broader set of digital devices and services are likely to be very limited Information about the current status of basic digital skills in the population is sparse The rapid spread of mobile phones and mobile Internet services in particular means that large proportion of the population has some familiarity with devices mainly phones some digital services government service and payments as well as social media However with the limited penetration of fixed broadband computers and laptops both in homes and educational institutions it is highly unlikely that there is even basic familiarity with broader digital services Access to digital devices does not necessarily translate into acquiring digital skills except the most foundational Although many countries have introduced ICT as subject in school education in practice most schools are not able to teach even basic skills because of the lack of electricity devices and access to digital materials or the Internet Only few have introduced computer assisted instruction Cross national askbased measures of digital skills suggest that the share of the population with basic digital skills is very low in number of countries in Africa Figure presents the proportion of the population with basic standard which roughly correspond to intermediate level in Figure and advanced digital skills based on self reported behavioral measures of digital skills The figure suggests that there are considerably lower proportion of people in Africa Togo Niger Cote dIvoire Djibouti and Tunisia with basic standard and advanced digital skills compared countries in Europe Asia and South America It also points to large within region differences whereby selected Northern African countries have higher proportion of the population with basic standards and advanced digital skills Generally speaking information about the levels of digital skills is very limited This is partly due to the lack of reliable metrics of digital skills as well as limited availability of any data on digital skills in Africa based on representative sample Many of the exis ting measures of digital skills are based on self reports or proxies based on possession of devices or tasks performed see Annex Many of the existing large scale household or labor force surveys in Africa do not systematically collect information on igital skills Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Figure Proportion of the population with basic standard and advanced skill levels Note Measuring the Information Society Report ITUs figures are based on Botswana Cabo Verde Cte dIvoire Djibouti Niger Egypt Morocco Sudan Togo Zimbabwe ITUs figures also assume that an individual has basic digital skills if heshe has engaged in at least one of the following four computer based activities during the last months copying or moving file or folder using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within document sending mails with attached files and transferring files between computer and other devices These task behaviors broadly correspond to DigcCompUNESCOs proficiency levels in the Competency areas Devices and software operations and Communication and collaboration and proficiency levels and The assumptio is that individuals proficiencies in DigCompUNESCOs Competence areas and are correlated with those in other Competence areas Another assumption is that the data from of countries represent data from the African continent ITUs figures also assume that an individual has advanced digital skills if heshe has engaged in the following computer based activities during the last months writing computer program using specialized programming language This task behavior broadly corresponds to DigcCompUNESCOs proficiency level in the Competency areas Devices and software operations and Digital content creation The assumption is that individuals proficiencies in DigCompUNESCOs Competence areas and are correlated with hose in other Competence areas Another assumption is that the data from cou ntries are representative of the African continent Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs An alternative way to assess the supply of digital skills is to use information on the completion of education assuming th at some form of ICT training is provided in education institutions see Figure Knowing the state of provision of school education it is likely that students in high schools in the majority of African countries acquire only basic digital skills if ICT is included in the curriculum and actually delivered Intermediate level skills may be provided at the upper secondary level mor careful assessment would require matching the ICT curriculum with the competences and proficiency levels in the UNESCOEU DigComp framework Digital skills for the ICT professions could be delivered at the upper secondary level and in TVET institutions and technology programs in short cycle tertiary institutions at the technician level in university undergraduate programs in engineering sciences mathematics and related fields and postgraduate programs in the same fields Again an assessment of the curriculum of these courses against international frameworks such as the EU Competence framework would provide better estimation of the skills of the students in these courses Hence using the proportion of students at different levels of education and in different types of ICT related courses could provide rough estimate of the supply of digital skills through the formal education system This mapping should be taken as indicative as because much of the learning in SSA schools including in techn ology related courses at the school level tend to be theoretical and focused on rote learning which do not develop the competences listed in the above mentioned frameworks Figure Digital Skills and Levels of Education We use the term ICT training here as this term is currently more common in African education systems rather than the term digital skills training Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Provision of Digital Skills through Formal Education and Training Institutions Fostering digital skills through the formal education system The digital competencies listed in Table can be acquired through formal education and training institutions for young people and on thejob formal training and informal training such as peer to peer learning for those in the workforce Increasingly online learning and blended learning are supplementing traditional training methods and vastly increasing the potential for enhan cing access Universalizing basic digital skills Basic digital skills refer to the proficiency levels and in the framework outlined in Table person who is proficient at this level would be able to do simple tasks that involve remembering content and instructions but also requires some guidance to execute In sub Saharan African asic digital skills programs can be offered in high schools lower secondary schools covering grades approximately and also at higher levels of education for those students who have not had access to digital skills training Apart from few more advanced countries in Southern Africa Kenya etc it is un likely that primary schools have the minimum required infrastructure to provide digital skills training In Northern Africa on the other basic digital skills training can be provided in primary schools as well An important decision is whether to provi de stand alone basic digital skills training to students or to integrate the use of digital technology across the curriculum Experience shows that the latter takes long time as teachers need to become confident in the use of technology and digital ontent promising way to start is to introduce basic digital skills training as subject for high school students Essential steps in this process are definition of curriculum selection of digital content teaching methods and assessment the pro vision of devices that can be used by students in sequence but in such manner as to allow equitable access stable source of supply connectivity to the internet and regular frequent training of all teachers not just the ICT teacher An extremely impo rtant aspect is ensur ing that there is adequate and consistent technical support for teachers and students to troubleshoot issues with hardware software internet connection and use of content Adaptation of existing basic digital skills curricula traini ng such as the International Computer Driving License see below is one quick way to introduce basic digital skills training Intermediate digital skills for the general workforce and for ICT professions Intermediate digital skills refer to proficiency evels and in the framework outlined in Table The student is able to independently perform simple tasks and well defined and routine tasks and straightforward problems and where heshe is able to remember and to understand Intermediate digital skills programs can be offered in lower and upper secondary schools and should be made available to all undergraduate students in universities Because intermediate digital skills require greater understanding of content in different situations they are best provided as part of teaching other courses This means that use of digital technology needs to be integrated across several subjects To begin with this could be done in language and mathematics as well as science subjects Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Integrating digital technology into teaching is far more complex than providing stand alone digital skills training at the basic level of proficiency It is ideal if the school has plan for the use of technology and heavy emphasis on teacher developme nt and continuous support is required Careful selection and curation of digital content appropriate to each subject is time consuming and requires technical expertise For the ICT technicians courses at the level of and of the EU ecompetence framework Figure are appropriate and these need to be provided in technical upper secondary schools and post secondary TVET institutions Advanced digital skills for non ICT and ICT professions Advanced digital skills refer to proficiency levels and in the DigComp DLGF outlined in Table For those in engineering and ICT professions advanced digital skills refer to the proficiency level in the eCompetence for ICT Professions framework Figure person who is proficient at this level would be able to deal with and provide guidance to others on different tasks nd problems that involve applying and evaluating content in complex situations Advanced digital skills are required for African countries to diffuse and adopt new digital technologies across many sectors of the economy Advanced digital skills programs for ICT courses require greater theoretical content and would typically be provided in relevant undergraduate courses in universities and other tertiary level courses Typically these would cover Engineering course specifically electrical and computer ngineering courses year courses these would constitute the core of the advanced digital skills programs Mathematics science and related undergraduate courses year courses in universities and technology courses in tertiary institutions The discipline of electrical and computer engineering is fundamental to the technologies of the th industrial revolution when artificial intelligence systems will be ubiquitous Hen ce reforming the content pedagogy and assessment of these courses should be priority Box Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Box Advanced digital skills for the ICT professions require reform of core engineering courses in universities Given the rapid advances in scientific knowledge it has become impossible to fully train an engineer in the four years typically allotted for baccalaureate degree at university or even in the cumulative total of eight to nine years typically consider ed adequate for an advanced PhD degree The implication is that no engineering curriculum should set out to provide student with all the technical knowledge she needs for lifetime career What is required is to structure training program that focuses on imparting the fundamentals of the field and on providing the students with the skill to learn how to learn on their own The typical electrical and computer engineering curriculum at an African university differs significantly from that of university in developed country for example in Korea or Singapore While most electrical and computer engineering curricula in the developed world are four year programs some African universities have five year curricula for baccalaureate degree The key differences are heavier course load in each year The type of courses included in the curriculum some of which are not directly relevant to core subject material for electrical and computer engineering The content of the courses which do not sufficiently emphasize the fundamentals breadth and depth Lecturing as the dominant mode of instruction no recitations and rare tutorials with small groups Very large class sizes ranging from students No capstone project by students Almost exclusive reliance on the final examination no weightage to homework or continuous assessment Engineering curricula and syllabi are not regularly revised in African universities and the lack of widespread accreditati on of engineering programs in sub Saharan Africa by international bodies has serious implications for the quality of engineering programs in Africa Modern engineering curricula are typically structured to fit within four level scheme that emphasizes ertain skills and core knowledge At the base of the scheme are courses that impart foundational knowledge in the sciences physics chemistry and biology mathematics and computing computer literacy The foundational background is followed by set of courses considered to constitute the core subject matter of the particular engineering discipline Next the student is exposed to the breadth of the subject after which she can select one or two areas for an in depth study In addition to the course work typical four year undergraduate program generally offers the student an opportunity to work on capstone design project during the third or fourth year of their study Such projects usually have minimum duration of at least one academic semeste but could also extend to full academic year Capstone projects are intended to help students assimilate and internalize core engineering concepts learned in the course of their study Most capstone projects at world class universities are generally team projects intended to develop and impart interpersonal skills for working in teams this is in addition to learning how to manage and cope with unknown factors as well as known resource and time constraints on projects that are designed to closely emulate real world working conditions Note Adapted from Towe consultant report Highly Specialized Digital Skills for the ICT professions Although the UNESCOEU DigComp framework outlines ighly specialized digital skills proficiency levels and in Table which could in theory be available to citizens and the general workforce in practice this would be difficult to provide in the African context in most educational or other institutions For the ICT professions hese skills representing and levels of the EU Competence framework in Figure are typically provided at the postgraduate level Masters and doctorate level focusing on advanced computer science engineering applied mathematics and related fie lds and cater to occupations such as data scientists and AI engineers The availability of highquality postgraduate programs in these areas is very limited especially in sub Saharan Africa outside of South Africa This has an impact on the Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs quality of undergraduate training and also on the limited ability to develop new solutions and applications of digital technologies Development of highquality postgraduate programs requires high concentration of resources and alignment with international benchmar ks for quality for smaller countries or those with weaker capacity this is likely done best at the regional level and for all countries high quality regional programs can supplement national efforts Fostering digital skills outside the formal education system few case examples are provided to show how different levels of digital skills are being provided outside the formal education system However it must be noted that these levels may not exactly correspond to the frameworks mentioned in this paper and th ey are given for illustrative purposes Basic Digital Skills programs case examples The International Computer Drivers License ICDL offers courses that are for beginners with no prior computer or internet experience intermediate level courses are also offered see below The ICDL is computer literacy program which is based entirely on the European Computer Drivers Licence ECDL program operated by the EDCL Foundation and its syllabus content and assessment methods have not been adapted to country contexts Its syllabus is divided into modules and standardized tests are taken by the student after completing module It is adm inistered by accredited test centers operated by course vendors educational establishments large organizations or companies using guidelines provided by the ECDL Foundation ICDL appears to be the worlds leading computer skills certification organizat ion According to its website more than million people in over countries have engaged with the ICDL program through network of over ICDL Accredited Test Centers ATCs ICDL is present in almost all African countries For instance in Sout Africa there are more than ATCs in Kenya more than in Uganda and in Rwanda Box ICDL in Kenya Kenya is an interesting example of full scale adaptation not adaptation of ICDL Based on government decision in ICDL has become the st andard offering for organizations across the public and private sector Recently ICDL Africa signed Memorandum of Understanding MoU with the Kenya School of Government to offer ICDL to public sector workers across the KSG campuses throughout Kenya ach year over new candidates register for the program taking over certification tests annually ICDL Africa operates through an office in Nairobi with team of full time staff providing support to the large network of ATCs Organizatio ns wishing to become an ATC must first be accredited by the Technical Vocational Education and Training Authority TVETA The network of ATCs covers wide variety of sectors including schools technical training institutions universities Government ins titutions NGOs and commercial training organizations Every autumn ICDL Africa hosts its annual ATC Forum bringing together all ATCs as well as key stakeholders in the ICT and education sector to discuss updates to the ICDL program and share best pract ice from around the world ICDL was adopted into national law in Kenya in when the Information and Communications Act recognized the ICDL Certification as the entry level computer certification designed to demonstrate competence in computer use Th ailand has also officially recognized ICDL as an education standard However to our knowledge no European country has adopted ECDL into its legislation As result all training courses in Kenya meet the ICDL standard earlier some computer literacy courses were of low quality and employers can easily compare formal IT qualifications of applicants and employees Unfortunately no sources indicate how far the substance of the ICDL which basically is PC based would benefit from including ore on skills related to the use of mobile phones which have been the important drivers of the digital economy in Kenya It would be important to get an assessment of the appropriatenessneed for adaptation of the ICDL from members of the business communi ty in Kenya Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Given the extremely low level of literacy especially in SSA countries even the introductory courses of ICDL may need to be adapted for use in schools Box provides information about the implementation of ICDL in Kenya The Digital Doorway DD project launched in provides freely accessible ICT centers in the form of containers They encourage digital upskilling and computer literacy in rural areas of South Africa through unassisted and peer assisted learning Container DDs are placed in disadvantaged localities to improve the digital and

wide variety of courses and proficiency levels within these programs courses are of varying lengths These initiatives are provided in mix of both formats from purely online programs including paid courses and MOOCs to in person training programs Rapid training in dvanced digital skills outside the education system particularly in the software industry have recently become very popular Such training sessions are usually on current topics that are in sudden high demand Because the standard ourses take more time to prepare graduates universities even in advanced countries are unable to respond to spikes of demand in certain area particularly in coding Universities can themselves offer such bootcamps over summer session but more rece ntly many forprofit companies have become active in this type of training especially when the need is in some of the most popular high level computer languages such as Python PHP Java etc However oding bootcamps work best for individuals ho already have background in the structure of computer languages but who do not have any experience programming in the particular language that there is demand for For these individuals having someone show them the gist of the language immediately allows them to make connections to their mental logical concept of the syntax they expect for computer language Learning is then very fast and within short time they are coding very well For anyone lacking in the underlying structure of how hig hlevel languages are constructed the lessons can be confusing and often frustrating Another area where bootcamps are popular is machine learning subarea of artificial intelligence again rapid training courses in this area tend to be more useful for individuals who have the mathematical background relevant to machine learning This background is found in algebra particularly in the field of matrices Concepts in manipulating large two and three dimensional matrices are key to machine learning The coding of algorithms into software applications for performing the manipulations can be meaningless if one does not have the conceptual framework on matrices The delivery of these programs is best organized in

basic literacy and numeracy skills in huge section of the population which are essential prerequisites for the acquisition of even the most rudimentary digital skills Self reported literacy rates among young people are high for example percent of young people aged report themselves as literate in most countries But actual reading proficiency tests done in the two SSA countries show functional literacy rates to be much lower Recent studies in SSA countries have found that the majority of fourth grade students cannot read paragraph and close to ninety percent could not solve mathematics world problem for eighth and ninth grade students in South Africa close to half of the students did not have basic mathematical knowledge including adding and subtracting whole numbers Furthermore over million children under the age of are estimated to be out of school Bashir et al The creation of advanced digital skills for the ICT professions through engineering computer science and related programs is restricted by the low access to post basic education Across the region enrollment rates in upper secondary education grades are extremely low In SSA the av erage is about percent but in many countries it is less than percent In higher education the gross enrollment ratio is below percent Enrollments in technical vocational education are below the average in other regions Limited enrollment in athematics and science streams in lower secondary and upper secondary and high failure rates in these subjects restricts the pipeline of those who could enroll in technical professional mathematics and science courses in higher education Estimates indi cate that less than quarter of the small number of students in higher education are in mathematics and science courses Further gender disparities become acute in upper secondary and higher education with very few girls participating in the technical nd professional courses that lead to high end jobs in the digital economy Equally important is the poor quality of courses and teaching in technical vocational and higher education especially in the technical professional and mathematics courses Lack of qualified faculty is one major issue with many university faculties in SSA not having postgraduate qualification Even more serious is the lack of industry experience which is especially important in the fast changing environment of digital technologi es Most universities still offer outdated courses in computer science courses electronics and telecommunications and information management systems Key specializations that are considered necessary for broad and deep digital economy are missing thes include cybersecurity mobile computing network and cloud technology ICT hardware and service infrastructure IT management ITM software development and engineering storage and data digital multimedia big data data analytics artificial intellig ence and so on Formal education and training institutions are important for preparing the pipeline of young workers and citizens for the digital world Training opportunities for those who are currently out of school or those in the workforce are equall important For this enormous stock of the population there are limited opportunities for training and few formal sector firms invest in the training of their workforce Digital technologies may offer the chance to multiply the offerings of training on asic digital skills which are linked to their jobs Migration of high skilled workers with digital skills can dampen the efforts made by countries to increase the supply of workers with advanced and highly specialized digital skills African countries vary considerably in the levels of economic development as well as the size and maturity of the labor market Some countries with relatively underdeveloped labor market for advanced and highly specialized digital skills eg Lesotho face risks of their hi ghskilled worker with digital skills migrating to neighboring countries in search for market that can reward those with such skills South Africa While there are clear benefits of brain drains eg remittances the efforts made by countries to fost er digital skills may be dampened Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Adaptation of existing courses programs for basic digital skills is this feasible option Development of new curricula and digital content is expensive and time consuming In low capacity environments choice has to be made between development versus adaptation of existing curricula and resources However the costs and effort required for meaningful adaptation must not be underestimated as apart from technical capacity requirements issues related to copyright intellectual property and licensing costs must be considered For instance the provision of basic and intermediate digital skills could be based on the ICDL However change or extension of the ICDL program is not straight forward because the European omputer Driving Licence ECDL program is owned and controlled by the ECDL Foundation The Foundation could be approached to know on what terms is would consider collaboration with the Bank or other actors on developing new modulessubjects The last upd ate of the ECDL was in and adaptation could be included as part of the next update the date is not yet known It would be preferable to collaborate with the ECDL Foundation and its network of national partners on changing and extending the ICDL program The ICDL certificates seem to be widely recognized by private and public employers and the infrastructure for eaching and testing is well developed in several countries An alternative system would be costly to establish and to maintain and at least in the beginning it would not be known by employers Before the Bank teams up with the national ICDL system it ill however require an assessment of the capacity and credibility of the relevant national structures and partner organizations It would also be useful to undertake an independent evaluation of the de facto competences of the holders of the different lev els of ICDL certificates and of the reliability of the testing system This could be conducted by qualified research institute In general this would require regional approach as it would be expensive to conduct the exercise of adaptation on case by case basis Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and Intermediate Level The measurement of digital skills in the population is not done extensively in SSA and is still at nascent stage in most countries Difficulties of designing and administering the survey including access to devices posed considerable challenges Nevert heless systematic assessment based on an accepted framework is required Annex provides more details of the issues involved and Appendix Tables and indicate sample questions from surveys and aggregation of indicators by Eurostat Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Annex Indic ators and Scorecards for Digital Skills in the Digital Economy for Africa Initiative The DEA initiative proposes two high level indicators to assess progress Percentage of lower secondary schools with access to internet for pedagogical purposes target all lower secondary schools by Proportion of youth and adults with advanced digital skills target by The frameworks used in this paper the Digital Literacy Global Framework based on DigComp and the EU Competence fra meworks adapted to African contexts can be used to define different levels of digital skills Basic digital skills large proportion of young people are still out of lower secondary school especially in sub Saharan Africa but also in parts of North Africa and it would be logistically difficult to provide the same level of basic digital skills training to all out of school children many of whom will lack of foundational literacy and numeracy skills Further it is impossible to have one test that wi ll measure the performance of all children It is therefore better to consider two indicators for basic skills For children in lower secondary school Percentage of children in the terminal year of lower secondary education who acquire basic digital sk ills equivalent to Foundation Level in the DigComp Framework For current out ofschool children Percentage of children aged years who acquire basic digital skills equivalent to Foundation Level in the DigComp Framework Provided that all basic digital skills programs for these children are based on the DigComp Framework and assessments test this level of proficiency the completion of these programs could be treated as an indicator of acquisition of very basic digital sk ills For the former group it is better not to specify the age as children will be of varying ages due to repetition and late entry in primary and lower secondary Further due to the high failure rate in the lower secondary examinations it is prefe rable not to use completers but all those who are in the terminal year of the lower secondary cycle Integration of the basic digital skills program in the lower secondary curriculum and assessment based on this would allow collection of data on how ma ny students acquire basic digital skills Advanced digital skills ICT professions and occupations The purpose of this indicator is to identify how African countries are developing the capacity to drive the digital economy through ICT and ICT enabled industries and services Although it is desirable to assess the level of advanced digital skills in the workforce it is not feasible to do so It is feasible measure the new entrants into this workforce as represented by the number of graduates of undergraduate level programs in engineering computer science mathematics and physics Ideally the programs would be assessed against the EU Competence framewor proficiency levels and or related framework It would also include graduates of online blended and rapid skills training programs provided such programs can also be assessed against the same framework Digital Skills Frameworks and Programs Annex Table High Level Scorecard PILL AR GOAL

cover only digital skills at basic and intermediate level since the advanced and highly specialized skills are typically measured through assessment and certification by the formal education provider university or online provider Currently measures of basic intermediate digital skills constitute small portion of large scale surveys intended to understand ICT usage levels or adult skills of popula tion The principal surveys are indicated in the following Annex able Survey questions assess digital skills in two ways The first method is based on self assessment by the respondent and is the most commonly used approach The second method is to use an indirect form of assessment by posing questions about the types applications that the respondent can use For example when an individual uses an application that is conceived to be difficult to use this is held to be an indication of high lev el of skills Deursen et al Sample questions from such indirect assessments can be found in Appendix Table The DigComp Framework is used to guide the identification of limited set of indicators for the purposes of measurement of digital ompetence within the EU and number of other countries for comparative purposes through an ICT survey about activities realized during the previous months within four domains information communication content creation and problem solving It is ass umed that persons having realized certain activities eg copying or moving file or folder or using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within document have the corresponding skills However as the data is self reported they are likely to be positively biased The Eurostat indicators are simple the indicators for all the domains are listed in Appendix Table At the overall level the digital skill indicator defines four levels of skills no low basic and above basic whereb No refers to individuals who answered none in all categories plus those who have not used the internet in the last months or who have never used the internet Low refers to individuals having one or more none in three domains Basic refers to individuals having one or more basic but no none Above basic refers to individuals with above basic in all four domains similar simple indicator for digital skills would be appropriate for measuring at the population level in Africa Such an indicator could be inspired by the indicators and aggregation methods used by Eurostat to measure digital skills However the indicators must be Africanized as some of them are more relevant to PC users in Europe than to users of smartphones in Afric eg copying or moving files or using formula within spreadsheet Most of the basic and intermediate digital skills programs listed above administer performance tests with the

Dr David Wanyonyi Khatete Senior Lecturer Department of Educational Communication and Technology Kenyatta University Dr Bernard Chomba Mugo Lecturer Department of Educational Communication and Technology Kenyatta University Abstract Purpose The research was to establish teachers attitud towards integrating ICT in classroom instruction Methods The study was carried out in secondary schools of the southern region Eritrea descriptive survey research design was adopted The study targeted public secondary schools in the region Str atified random sampling technique was used to get sample of secondary schools from subregions The sample of respondents of the study was drawn from thes secondary schools of subregions The respondents were school directors Biology teachers and grade eleven students Questionnaires interview and observation schedules were used as instruments for data collection Questionnaire for Biology teachers and students Interview Schedule for school Directors were employed Piloting and consultation were conducted to establish validity and reliability before the instruments were used for the actual data collection The data collected included both qualitative and quantitative data The quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS The qualitative data obtained rom the open ended questions were analyzed thematically based on research objectives Results The study found that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning They liked to use ICT in their Biology lessons they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting understandable and improves learners performance Unique Contribution to Theory Practice and olicy The study recommended that Ministry of Education should provide adequate in service training on ICT integration skills for teachers Key Words Teachers Attitude ICT Integration Classroom Instruction Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp INTRODUCTION Attitude is one of the teacher factor that affect the use of ICT in the classroom Having positive attitude is crucial in integrating ICT in education Muslem Yusuf and Juliana conducted study on attitude and barriers to ICT use amo ng English teachers in Indonesia The study used questionnaire and interview for teachers selected by purposive sampling technique The finding of the study show ed that participant teachers had positive perceptions of the implementation of ICT in classroom teaching and learning Teachers believe that ICT support them in their lessons as well as helps them to find information that enriches their lessons easily and qu ickly They also think that ICT makes teaching in the class more interesting Hong carried out study on teachers views of ICT integration using open ended semi structured interview for teachers from different parts of Colorado USA The study revealed that teacher involved in the study had positive attitude towards ICT as an instructional tool They liked ICT as pedagogical tool and as resource bank for their teaching Teachers wanted to learn new ways of using ICT to deliver instructional materials to stude nts effectively and showed their willingness to incorporate ICT in their lessons frequently This is because they believed that ICT is current trend and it has many benefits for students Further the study found that low availability of ICT resources especially the availability of computers and unreliable internet connection were major barriers that limited the implementation of ICT in the classroom Daher Bayaa and Anabousy conducted experimental study on in service athematics teachers integration of ICT as innovative practice in lower secondary and found out that the teachers ad positive attitudes and beliefs Despite their positive feeling teachers were reluctant to integrate technology in their lessons due to their little experience and different obstacles they encountered in the integration of ICT in education According to the study carried out by Semerci and Aydn on examining high school teachers attitudes towards ICT use in education applying descriptive res earch design and questionnaire for teachers working in different schools of Ankara turkey Teachers displayed high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low level of anxiety towards ICT use in education Adegbenro Gumbo and Olakanmi investigated in service secondary school teachers technology integration needs an ICT enhanced classroom in Pretoria South Africa using Questionnaire and focus group discussion The finding of the study revealed that teachers had positive attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms Teachers were willing to learn more ab out how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes However teachers faced difficulties in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their inadequate knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices According to Ottestad an online survey was done on school leaders and teachers from Norwegian primary and lower secondary schools revealed that there was correlation between the attitude and behavio of school leaders and the ttitude and behavio of teachers regarding ICT integration in classroom practices Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp study conducted by Msila in South Africa using an interview to explore the view of teachers on digital technology use in instruction Findings showed that younger teachers were more open minded than the older teachers who found the introduction of ICT discouraging In the end the study concluded that the success of digital technology in classrooms depend more on teacher competence as well as positive attitudes towards ICT Similarly study conducted on preservice Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology teaching revealed that preservice Biology teachers had positive attitude with no difference in gender or class Yapici and Heved anli The resence of positive attitude in teachers enhances the use of ICT in instruction However least was known about Biology teachers attitude toward the integration of ICT in teaching and learn ing in the outhern Regions secondary schools in Eritrea Statement of the Problem The use of technology has influenced all human aspects of life and it has an impact on how education is delivered The Government of Eritrea through the Ministry of duca tion has placed effort in introducing new curriculum that focuses on learner centered outcome based interactive pedagogy The new curriculum allows learners to actively participate in their learning In addition to this ICT policy in education has bee launched for integrating ICT in education While studying iology is important for it generally helps us to get better understanding about ourselves the world and its natural processes the performance of this subject in secondary schools in Eritrea was not satisfactory in the last five years The performance of Biology as indicated in table was poor in the last five years This can have serious implication for the quality of education and discourage students from studying Biology This problem of low performance could be solved by integrating CT in teaching and learning of Biology Various researches conducted on ICT integration in education have proved that integrating ICT in teaching and learning improve the quality of learning and perform ance of learners Moreover ICT integration simplifies abstract and complex concepts create cooperative learning and create interest in learning among students In essence integration of ICT creates learner centered learning environment Although the integration of ICT has many benefits that can be considered as opportunities it also has numerous challenges It demands educational transformation such as changing curriculum assessment and importantly changing role of teachers from being ustodians of knowledge to being facilitator in pedagogy The effective integration of ICT in teaching and learning requires the availability of ICT resources Teachers preparedness on ICT integration and attitude of teachers towards ICT integration in teaching learning However it is not clear whether Biology teachers integrate ICT in the classroom instruction with the purpose of improving teaching and learning of biology This study therefore intended to examine the integration of ICT in teaching and learning of Biology in the Southern egion of Eritrea METHODOLOGY This study used descriptive survey research design The study took place in the Southern Region Eritrea The arget population for the study comprised public secondary schools of the southern region school directors Biology teachers and grade eleven Biology Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp students of secondary schools of the southern region Eritrea In this study stratified purposive sampling and simple random sampling techniques were used Stratified sampling was used to determine sample of schools from public secondary schools The school directors of the sampled schools were purposively selected to participate in the study Simple random sampling technique was further applied to obtain Biolo gy teachers and of students of grade eleven making students from the sampled school From the sampled sch ool three Biology teachers one teacher from the list of teachers who teach grade grade and grade was randomly picked to parti cipate in the study

Few school directors were not able to decide about teachers attitude Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp One school director was quoted in saying that Without providing ICT resources necessary for teaching and learning their subject giving them adequate trai ning on how to integrate ICT in biology teaching and without observing them using ICT in their classrooms it is not easy to judge about teachers attitude towards ICT integration in teaching and learning School Director No Based on the quot ation of the school director it was difficult to measure teachers attitude towards the integration of ICT in Biology lessons before providing the requirements The school directors were also asked to give their view on how they see the integration ICT in teaching and learning Majority of them believe ICT would improve the quality of teaching and learning However few responded that computer and internet could take the attention of students away from their Biology learning When school directors have positive attitude towards ICT integration in schools they can give the necessary support for teachers in using ICT in their lessons Teachers students and school directors involved in the study showed positive attitude towards the integration ICT in teaching and learning process The findings of this study were in ag reement with several research studies study

had positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning They liked to use ICT in their Biology lessons they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting understandable and improves learner performance In addition the study revealed that the attitude of the majority of school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in educationEven though positive attitude existed in the schools community ICT was not applied for teaching and Journal of Education and Practice ISSN Online Vol Issue No pp learning of Biology This could be due to other barriers that influenced ICT integration in instruction Conclusion The study concluded that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had positive attitudes towards th use of ICT in teaching and learning The attitude of school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education Though the attitude of teachers and school directors was positive ICT was not integrated into instruction From thi it is logical to conclude that having positive attitude alone could not make ICT integration practical in the classrooms Recommendations The study recommended that Ministry

['The Gender Labor Market Gap in the Digital Economy Monserrat Bustelo Luca Flabbi Mariana Viollaz October Abstract Recent years have seen an evergreater expansion of the digital economy development that may bring new opportunities to workers who were at disadvantage in the traditional economy We focus on specific set of workers who belong to such group women We study skill set of particular relevance in the digital economy and estimate their returns in the labor market according to gender across four Latin American countries We find that information and communication technologies ICT skills and science technology engineering and mathematics STEM skills yield significant positive returns for both men and women However there is significant gender gap that favors men on the STEM returns There is also sizable gender gap regarding the amount of skills accumulated by gender Through an OaxacaBlinder decomposition we estimate that up to of the gender gap in hourly wages may be due to the lower returns that women receive relative to men on their STEM skills If an investment in skills relevant to the digital economy may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries remains an open and relevant question Contact Information Monserrat Bustelo InterAmerican Development Bank New York Avenue NW

MexicoToluca Ciudad de Mexico and Centro de Estudios Distributivos Laborales Sociales CEDLAS Email The paper also includes Web Appendix available at xlsxattredirectsd Introduction Motivation Recent years have seen major changes in global labor markets Technical innovation is leading to greater expansion of digital economy in which old jobs are lost new jobs are created and even the same jobs are approached differently and require different competences If old jobs are lost but new ones are created then new opportunities may arise for workers who were previously at disadvantage in the traditional economy In this paper we focus on specific set of workers who belong to such group women Gender gaps in the labor market have been significant and persistent empirical regularity in most countries around the world Blau and Kahn The digital economy affects this longstanding gap and may act to reduce or magnify it depending on the skills that men and women can acquire and deliver in the labor market Focusing on set of highincome countries OECD finds that differences in skill endowments between male and female workers account for some but not all of the wage gap When controlling for skills relevant to the digital economy the gender wage gap is reduced by to percentage pointsOECD also shows evidence of gender gaps in skills tracing some back to human capital acquisition during the schooling years However among recent generations the study finds that the gender gap in skills relevant to the digital economy is more ambiguous In some areas girls outperform boys eg collaborative problem solving but are outperformed by boys in others eg digitalrelated skills Our report focuses on Latin American countries where no systematic analysis of the interaction between the digital economy and the gender gap has been undertakenThe primary reason for the number of reports by multilateral organizations and international thinktanks are making similar point for the OECD see OECD for the World Bank see Box in World Bank for the ILO see Ryder for the WEF see World Economic Forum for the IDB see Busso et al See Section in OECD The highest reduction is for Japan which has the highest gender wage gap among OECD countries at about Some country reports are starting to look at gender differences in skill acquisition but without relating the results to gender differentials in the labor market See for example OECD on Chile The report using PIAAC data absence of systematic contributions across Latin America relates to data limitations Representative individuallevel data capable of capturing the skills required in the digital economy are scarce We are taking first step in this analysis by using data sets comprising this relevant information for four Latin American countries Chile Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador We have obtained the relevant information by combining two different surveys that collected data on skills the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies PIAAC survey available for Chile in and the Skills Towards Employment and Productivity STEP survey available for Colombia and Bolivia in and for El Salvador in After extracting the estimation sample we document gender gaps in skills endowments and estimate returns to skills We control for variety of factors including heterogeneous returns by with respect to the endogenous selection of women in the labor market Finally we decompose the gender gap in the portion resulting from differences in returns to skills and differences in skill endowments Two specific skills yield significant returns across the board STEM science technology engineering and math and ICT information and communication technologies ICT returns are similar across genders with an increase of one standard deviation in the skill generating return in hourly wages of about By contrast STEM returns differ significantly between genders with an increase of one standard deviation generating return for men and return for women Results by country show some differences in magnitudes Returns to STEM are higher than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador We also estimate that higher levels of education imply significantly higher returns for men but not for women The estimates indicate that STEM endowments and returns play an important role in explaining the aggregate gender gap in hourly wages the lower endowments for women may be responsible for up to of the gap while the lower returns for women may account for close to on study skill formation in the Latin American and the Caribbean region provided evidence on the availability and adoption of digital technologies but not on their relation to the gender gap Structure The paper is organized as follows Section describes the data and the specific indicators we build to describe the digital economy Section provides standard descriptive statistics on the gender gaps in the labor market integrating gaps in skills relevant to the digital economy Section provides estimates of the returns to these skills according to gender The estimates control for rich set of individual characteristics and in some specifications for selection in the labor market We also provide evidence regarding the interaction of the skills with the sectors most exposed to the digital economy as well as with education levels Section focuses on the gender gap in hourly wages and unpacks the extent to which the gap can be accounted for by differences in returns relative to differences in the endowment of digitaleconomyrelevant skills Section provides final comments and summary of the results Appendix includes details about the construction of the variables of interest Appendix presents the complete regression results and Appendix provides results according to country Web Appendix includes additional specifications and robustness checks Data We combine information from two surveys that collected data on skills at work First we use information accessible in the PIAAC survey available for Chile in The PIAAC is survey processing skills literacy numeracy and problem solving and gathers data on how adults use their skills at work The survey is implemented by an international consortium contracted by the OECD and is designed to ensure international comparability of the data Second we use information from the STEP survey available for Colombia and Bolivia in and El Salvador in STEP is survey collected by the World Bank and gathers data on skills in urban areas of low and middleincome countries It also shares the main objectives and structure of the PIAAC questionnaire It strives to record the data in way that renders it comparable across different countries Still two concerns remain regarding the comparability of STEP and PIAAC for our purposes The first relates to differences in sampling STEP is representative of people aged living in urban areas while PIAAC is representative of people aged living in both urban and rural areas represented more heavily in nonurban areas agriculture forestry and fishery as well as mining and quarrying Due to the slightly disparate age range between the two surveys we include individuals aged in the estimation sample We also restrict the sampling to wage employees of the private sector except for El Salvador where it is not possible to distinguish between the private and public sector These restrictions generate final estimation sample with observation for Chile for Bolivia for Colombia and for El Salvador The second relates to differences in survey questions PIAAC and STEP use different questionnaires to collect information Still the questions about labor market outcomes demographic characteristics socioeconomic variables and ability measures generate variables that allow for high degree of comparability between the surveys The differences in survey questions become more relevant when crafting measures of skills as eliciting skills is more difficult and arguably less agreed upon task than eliciting demographic characteristics or standard labor market outc devote the next section of the paper to describing how we build the relevant skills measures from parability across countries and surveys Throughout the paper the unit of observation of the data remains the individual worker The level of analysis operates at both the country level and the aggregate level pooling all countries into single data set Typically we discuss the results from the pooled sample in the main text of the paper and report countrylevel results in the Web Appendix We could not limit our direct focus to the urban population in Chile because PIAAC does not report an indicator for urban and rural areas The only geographic indicator reported by PIAAC is the OECD territorial level region which for Chile corresponds to of the regions of the country We have combined this information with the ruralurban indicator contained in nationally representative household survey for Chile the CASEN survey Based on CASEN we can calculate the proportion of the population in each region living in urban areas Results show that most of the population in each Chilean region is concentrated in urban centers In most of the regions more than of the population lives in urban areas with the most rural region Maule reporting of urban population Still we have performed robustness exercise where we eliminated regions with less than or of the population living in urban areas Our results were barely affected Skills measures We build the skills measures to summarize the information collected in the numerous relevant survey questions and in order to maximize the comparability with previous literature and across countries We focus on skills relevant in the digital economy The previous literature has identified ICT and STEM quantitative skills as critical to thriving in the digital era OECD OECD It has also argued that soft social and interpersonal skills jointly with creativity and critical thinking will become critical in future innovative labor markets Ryder World Economic Forum OECD To capture both sets of competencies we follow the classification proposed by Grundke et al in preparatory work for series of OECD reports on skills and the digital economyThey define the following six sets of skills using data from the PIAAC survey on OECD countries ICT skills are those related to ICT use from reading and writing emails to using Word and Excel or programming language Managerial and communication skills capture strategic management abilities for the generation of sustainable competitive advantages including human resource management practices which encompassnegotiating with people instructing advising and persuading people Readiness to learn and creative problemsolving skills include the ability to solve problems in the process of developing organizational capabilities and improving firm performance Selforganization skills to changes and absorb shocks Marketing and accounting skills include abilities associated with accounting tasks such as reading financial invoices and bills and with frontofoffice marketing tasks such as interacting with clients STEM quantitative skills include the ability to apply algebra simple or complex and prepare charts and tables In Table in Appendix we provide details on the exact questions from PIAAC and STEP that we use to generate each skill measure and the metric associated with each variable Variables from See OECD PIAAC derive exactly from the definition proposed by Grundke et al We construct the same set of measures using the PIAAC for Chile as they did using the PIAAC on the OECD countries in their analysis In the STEP surveys for Bolivia Colombia and El Salvador we identify the questions aimed at capturing the same skills and that are as close as possible to those available in PIAAC The first important difference between the two surveys is that most variables in PIAAC capture the while STEP involves combination of binary questions whether person performs certain task at work or not with some categorical frequency questions as in PIAAC In order to overcome these differences between surveys we construct the skill measures applying standardization methodology used by previous studies Acemoglu and Autor Almeida et al First for each variable associated to skill category we calculate the mean and standard deviation and standardize the variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation Second for each worker in the sample we obtain score for each skill category by adding all the standardized variables obtained in the first step Third for all skill measures to have zero mean and standard deviation of one we do one additional standardization of the six skill categories by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation The standardization is performed for each country separately The second important difference concerns the difference in the actual questions Many important questions are extremely similar for example those related to ICT skills or STEM skills but there are others with more salient differences For example to build marketing and accounting skills PIAAC includes question on the frequency of selling products or services but STEP does not Our strategy here has been to base our choices on previous literature using the STEP survey to construct skills measures Di Carlo et al Roseth et al Lo Bello et al or combining both PIAAC and STEP to compare across state Lewandowski et al The main difference between these previous studies and our paper is that they have focused on different set of skills mirroring the measures available in US surveys instead of those available in the OECD PIAAC surveys The only difference is the exclusion of variable capturing physical skills that Grundke et al included in the ICT measure with negative weight They focus on the difference between cognitive and manual skills and between routine and nonroutine tasks Digital intensity In our econometric analysis we also estimate differential returns according to the digital intensity of each economic sector Digital intensity refers to the degree in which the production and the performance of given sector has been impacted by the digital transformation ie the same set of technological innovations that have made relevant the skills that are the object of this study The process of digital transformation is complex involving more than mere investment in computers software cold computing or other digital tools embedding them in production with the appropriate human capital and using them when deal Calvino et al Looking at digital intensity is important in our context because the skills most relevant to the digital economy may be complementary to the technologies and business practices used by least study the heterogeneity on returns by the degree of digital intensity at the sector level We proceed by defining an indicator variable of digital intensity for each of economic sectors following the classification established by Calvino et al for subset of OECD countries Using data from the Latin American region to define the digital intensive indicator variable would seven variables to describe given sector as more or less digitalintensive level of investment in ICT equipment level of investment in software and databases purchases of ICT services purchases of ICT goods robot use revenues from online sales and intensity of ICT specialists None of these variables are reliably collected for Latin American and the Caribbean LAC countries so we use the same indicator defined by Calvino et al but apply it to our LAC countries To determine the extent to which transferring the OECD classifications to LAC countries represents credible way to proceed we use the only variable with some correlation to digital intensity available on the LAC region The International Federation of Robotics IFR provides counts of the stock of robots by economic sector country and year worldwide including the four countries under investigation here We calculate the average number of robots in each economic sectors above the median We compare this classification specification from the Latin American region to the one appearing in Calvino et al to evaluate the viability of the robot use component of their digital intensive indicator The comparison indicates correlation of between the Latin American classification and the OECD classification lending some weight to the use of the OECD classification in our estimates Still some important differences exist in the intensity of robot use between regions Table in Appendix shows the average number of operational robots for seven aggregate economic sectors in the Latin American region in the United States and in Western Europe The number of operational robots is between and times larger in the United States and Europe relative to Latin America In conclusion the comparison shows that LAC countries and highincome OECD countries are generally similar in terms of the sectors of the economy with high digital intensity but that the degree of intensity is likely to be much smaller in LAC countries than in OECD countries Descriptive Analysis The Gender Gap We first describe the gender gaps in the labor market and the gender differentials in the relevant skills variables In terms of human capital measures Table documents the high rates of education of the women in our sample relative to the men of women are higheducated upper secondary education completed or more while the percentage is for men In terms of labor market performance the usual gender gap in earnings emerges The average wage of loweducated women is of the average wage of loweducated men for the higheducated group the value is We also find the usual gender asymmetries in the distribution of occupation of women are employed in this occupational category relative to of men Among men crafts and related trades is the main occupation employing about of the workforce In terms of sectors both women and men are largely employed in the services sector but the percentage for women is higher reaching while for men it is similar pattern is found when comparing the percentages of women and men employed in digitalintensive sectors For women we are looking at while for men it is The usual gender gap in labor market participation is also confirmed by our data Figure shows that on average of women in the sample do not participate in the labor market compared to of men There are important differences by education levels Loweducated women participate at rate while higheducated women participate at rate Gender differences with respect to skills relevant to the digital economy are reported in Figure and at the bottom of Table The largest difference relates to STEM where the average skill level for men is of standard deviation above the mean while the average for women is of standard deviation below the mean smaller disadvantage for women is observed in the context of ICT skills where they hold value of standard deviation below the mean compared to similar value which is of course above the mean for men On all the other three skills men and women do not show noticeable differences Econometric Analysis Returns to Skills by Gender This section presents estimates of the impact of skills on hourly wages according to gender We also analyze how these returns to skills interact with the digital intensity of the sector in which the worker is employed The interaction is relevant to understand how skills play role in the process ders that while the digital economy is expanding it may have not yet reached all the sectors of the labor market The econometric analysis focuses on estimating equations of the form where the natural log of the hourly wage of individual of gender in country wij is regressed on set of individuallevel controls the vector xij measure of the individual skill relevant in the digital economy sij and countryfixed effect the percentage change in earnings associated with unit increase in the amount of skill Following the literature estimating earnings functions we label this coefficient the return to skills All the skill indexes are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation of one in the overall population It is worth noting here that the parameters to be estimated are denoted by the superscript to indicate that we are estimating genderspecific coefficients In other words we are estimating equation separately by gender This specification is different with respect to the one used by OECD which performs specific returns to skills by interacting gender dummy with the skill variable and then estimating on the pooled sample of men and women In terms of equation this is equivalent to having the superscript but only specific returns on all the variables Without this flexibility the returns to skills could capture some of the genderspecific impacts of the other covariates We find that this specification is indeed relevant numerous coefficients are significantly different between men and women In Section we show the extent to which using the OECD specifications instead impacts our results The individuallevel controls included in the vector xij are quite parsimonious due partly to data availability and also to the returns we aim to identify Specifically the vector includes constant age and age squared an indicator variable of completed upper secondary education or more and literacy and numeracy test scores In short the baseline specification controls for broad human capital indicators age and education for proxy of basic cognitive abilities literacy and numeracy scores and for aggregate differences between the economies the countryfixed effects The only additional controls available across all data sets available for our inclusion in the specification are sectors and occupations indicator variables We decided not to include them in the baseline specification for the following reason Choice of sector and occupation is endogenous and as such the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of certain occupationindustry cell Since we are interested in gender gaps in the overall return to skills we have preferred not to decompose the returns in the component due to occupation and sector choices and in the component due to differences within given sector and occupation cell To simplify notation we do not add the indicator to the observed variables but it is understood that we will include in each regression only individuals belonging of specific gender Literacy and numeracy test scores are unfortunately not available for all countries Literacy scores are available for Bolivia Colombia and Chile while numeracy scores are only available for Chile We have therefore decided to have them interact with the country fixed effects in the section for specification pooling all the countries together Still estimating the coefficient conditional on industry and occupation is informative and we present these estimates in Section Main Results The main results on returns to skills are presented in Figure The two main cognitive skills relevant in the digital economy ICT and STEM show positive and significant returns for both men and women but in STEM the returns are significantly higher for men Specifically one standard deviation increase in the STEM skill measure implies increase in wages for men and an increase in wages for women ICT skill returns are more similar across genders ranging from for women to for men The returns to the other skills are lower but still positive and significant except for marketing and accounting for women Compared with the returns estimated in OECD countries the returns to ICT and STEM are higher than the estimated average over the pooled set of OECD countries OECD estimates returns to ICT skills to be about for women and about for men The returns to STEM skills are estimated at and for women and men respectively Contrary to the results for the four LAC countries there is gender gap in returns to ICT favoring women while there is no significant difference in returns to STEM by gender We have tried to determine whether the difference in results with respect to OECD derives from differences in the specification As mentioned above even when the variables employed are comparable the specifications are slightly different OECD estimates that by having gender dummy interacted with skills while we prefer more flexible specification where all the returns are allowed to be genderspecific We have run the specification preferred by OECD on our data and found that the difference in specification explain only small portion of the difference We discuss the results in Section The main results of the returns to skills interacted with the level of digital intensity in the sector are presented in Figure The figure reports the additional impact of given skill when the worker We report point estimates with the dot and the diamond and the confidence interval with vertical lines As result any time that the vertical line does not cross zero it means that the coefficient is significantly different from zero See Figure page OECD is employed in sector with high digital intensity The exercise is meant to capture the extent to which portion of the overall returns discussed above is due to composition effects across sectors ie if the skills have significant and positive returns only in those sectors that are more impacted by the digital economy or if they are equally valuable across all sectors The figure shows that digital intensity does not generally have significant impact Most of the coefficients are not significantly different from zero and the point estimates are very close to zero Again this result stands in stark contrast with the findings for OECD countries OECD estimates that working in digitalintensive industries increases returns to skill by about to percentage points The results for our four Latin American countries indicate that either digital intensity is not very pronounced in Latin America or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all the sectors of Latin American economies Even with the data at our disposal we cannot disentangle the two explanations but some of the evidence discussed in Section indicate that digital intensity is indeed less pronounced in Latin America than in OECD countries Specifically Table in Appendix shows that the average number of operational robots for seven aggregate economic sectors the only direct measure of digital intensity available for LAC countries is between and times larger in the United States and Western Europe than in Latin America This result is consistent with the analysis based on the broader Digital Adoption Index reported by Busso et al The index shows that Latin America lags behind highincome economies in terms of availability and adoption of digital technologies In other words if the sectors of the economy with high digital intensity are similar between LAC countries and highincome OECD countries the extent of the intensity is much smaller in LAC To summarize the results obtained by aggregating the data gleaned from the four countries under study we estimated significant and large returns to ICT and STEM with no significant gender differences on the first but significant gender gap in favor of men on the second ii For the other skill measures we found positive but lower returns with mainly not statistically significant differences between women and men iii The digital intensity of the sectors does not seem crucial factor in determining these returns The exception are selforganization and marketing accounting which have respectively slightly smaller and slightly higher returns when used in digitalintensive sectors See Figure page OECD See Figure page Busso et al In Appendix we look at each country in isolation from the others we actually found results for each that are qualitatively similar to the aggregate for Chile Bolivia and Colombia but with some differences in magnitude Returns to STEM are higher than the aggregate ofChile and lower than the aggregate of Bolivia and Colombia El Salvador on the other hand does not report gender gap favoring men in returns to STEM both men and women have positive but similar returns Returns to ICT in El Salvador are also little different than the aggregate indicating higher but not significantly so return for women Extra returns for working in digitalintensive sectors estimated by country confirm the aggregate results Digital intensity does not significantly increase returns to skills Heterogeneous Effects We focus on the heterogeneous effect on the individual characteristic most relevant with respect to skills formation and acquisition schooling levels We focus on upper secondary education and we report the differential effect on the returns of individuals who completed this educational level with respect to individuals who completed less The results are reported in Figure They show that higher levels of education yield significantly higher returns for men but not for women For women the increase in returns never departs significantly from zero and the point estimates are always lower than those for men In the next section we discuss whether these differences may be due to the different selection in the labor market by gender These results are more mixed when looking at regressions by country Figure in Appendix In Chile we estimate significantly higher returns for higheducated men on all skills except readiness to learn In Bolivia and El Salvador only half of the skill types demonstrate significant increases in Colombia only one What remains broadly similar to the aggregate results is that the increase in returns is higher for men than women The only important exception is Colombia where the point estimate of increase in ICT and STEM is higher for women However the estimated coefficient is not significantly different from zero in either case Selection in the Labor Market Women participate in the labor market less than men This is common feature among most labor markets and it holds in our samples Figure shows that women participate in the labor market less than men at all education levels The Web Appendix shows the results of each country Because participation is nonrandom ie it is the result of choice the women we observe working may be systematically different from those not working If the characteristics over which they are different are related to their performance in the labor market then the return to skills we estimated are only representative of the population of women working and not of the entire population of women This bias may affect some relevant policy implications For example if policy is successful in increasing the skill levels of women should we expect the returns that were affected by the policy to be more like those of the women currently participating or the ones who are not Because some of the factors related to productivity remain unobserved it is not easy to answer this question It may therefore be useful to estimate set of returns that can indicate if the estimated returns of women currently working are significantly different from those of the overall population of women We adopt standard Heckman selection model Heckman to obtain returns that consider selection in the labor market To avoid relaying only on distributional assumptions for identification we adopt an exclusionrestriction number of children affects her participation decision but not the wage paid to her Results are presented in Figure and show relatively small changes with respect to the baseline specifications reported in Figures and Still two small differences are worth mentioning First the point estimate of the return to ICT becomes higher for women than men However both in the baseline specification and in the selectioncorrection specification the differences in returns between men and women are not significantly different from each other Second the gap in favor Notice that in principle the same selection problem also applies to men but because high proportion of men participate in the labor market we follow the common practice of ignoring selection in the labor market for them In other words even if not all men participate in the labor market the small proportion of men who do not is unlikely to affect the overall estimates very much This assumption is common in the literature but it is not without limitations If it is true that firms cannot offer wage contracts contingent to the presence of children some evidence shows that the unequal distribution of household work between men and women may generate systematic and potentially causal association between wages and the presence of children of men in returns to STEM is reduced because the point estimate for women increases from to By looking at results by country reported in Figure of Appendix we can see that these minor changes are mainly driven by Chile In Chile controlling for selection increases returns to ICT from to and returns to STEM from to Another relevant change takes place in Bolivia where returns to STEM become significantly different from zero when controlling for selection With respect to heterogeneous returns correcting for selection does not qualitatively change the results The results are reported in Figure and should be compared to Figures and Overall they confirm the lack of significantly higher returns for agents working in the digitalintensive sector and reiterate that only men have significantly higher returns when they complete upper secondary education Finally estimates obtained by correcting for selection show that this is not the source of differences with respect to returns estimated in OECD countries OECD Selectioncorrection slightly increases the differences because it leads to slightly higher returns to ICT and STEM for women Robustness Analysis In this section we provide robustness analysis along three dimensions First we study how the results change when we replicate the specifications of the OECD we constrain all the coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns to skills Second we study how the results change when we control for sectors and occupations Finally we check if the results controlling for selection are affected by using different exclusionrestrictions in the selection model Results constraining all the coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns to skills are reported in Table This specification consists in running equation on sample pooling together men and women and then interacting the women indicator variable with the variable measuring the specific skill under consideration Our favorite baseline specification allows all the coefficients to be genderspecific because it allows for more flexibility This different constrained version lets only the return to skill be genderspecific as result returns to skills may capture some of the genderspecific impacts of the other covariates By focusing on the two skills with the strongest impact in the baseline specification ICT and STEM the estimation results in the constrained specification are essentially identical to ICT and show small difference to STEM If in the baseline specification returns to STEM are estimated to be those for women are percentage points lower returns on the constrained specification are estimated to be whereas those for women are percentage points lower This slightly lower gender gap in constrained specification is an indication that allowing for genderspecific returns on the other covariates and on countryfixed effects is useful for estimating returns closer to consistent values Results controlling for sectors and occupations are reported in Table As mentioned sectors and occupations are important controls given that each sectoroccupation cell may require and use the skills in the digital economy differently Conditioning on them may clarify if the differences in returns we observed are due to the sorting of men and women over these cells or to different returns within cells Because occupational choices are endogenous and withinsector differences may be affected by unobservable characteristics this analysis remains largely descriptive In other words the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of certain occupation The estimation results conditioning on sectors and occupation qualitatively confirm the main result in the baseline specification We estimate significant returns to ICT and STEM with no significant gender differences in the former but significant gender gap in favor of men in the latter Quantitatively both ICT and STEM returns are estimated to be lower when sectors and occupation controls are introduced For example ICT returns decreased from in the baseline specification to in the specification controlling for sector and occupation the corresponding values for men were and respectively These results indicate probably not surprisingly that portion of the returns to ICT and STEM is because individuals who possess those skills work in sector and occupation that pay relatively more in comparison to people with lower level of these skills More interestingly the gender gap in ICT returns is unaffected when we change the specification unlikethe gender gap in STEM returns In other words conditioning on the sector and occupation cell returns to STEM are estimated to be much greater than returns to STEM than in the economy as whole The results suggest that different choices of occupation and sector are not the main driver of the overall gender gap in STEM returns womens occupational choices visavis men decreasethe gender gap in returns present within sectoroccupation cells Results controlling for how different exclusionrestrictions affect our selection model are reported in Table In our baseline selection model we used the presence of children as the exclusion restriction varying very likely to affect the participation decisions of women However not only fertility decisions are endogenous but the presence of children may also directly impact wages and not only participation Still we are limited in terms of data availability on the exclusion restrictions we can use in the selection model Furthermore the number of children is the only variable available on all data sets However if we limit ourselves to the STEP countries we can use additional information Specifically we use information about whether the mother or father of the person answering the survey lives in the household This presence may be very influential on the labor market participation decision of women either because they can help in household production or because they need resources for their care We therefore built an indicator variable for whether the mother or father of the person answering the survey is living in the household We use it as an exclusionrestriction alone and jointly with the presenceofchildren variable Estimation results show very little sensitivity to the various exclusionrestrictions For example the overall STEM return in STEP countries is estimated to be about without controlling for selection When controlling for selection it is estimated to be just little lower ranging from when using only the presence of children as an exclusionrestriction to when using only the presence of grandparents to when using both PostEstimation Analysis Decomposing the Gender Gap The previous section presented estimates of the returns to skills and to other individual characteristics by gender Using these estimates it is possible to decompose the overall gender gap We have also run OLS regressions using the exclusionrestriction variables directly in the wage regressions We found that they are typically not significant while they always are in the participationdecision equation Although the exclusionrestrictions are not formally testable since we use them for identification this reduced form results lends some credibility to them in the portion due to differences in returns and to differences in endowments The most popular procedure to accomplish this is labeled in the literature as OaxacaBlinder decomposition It is simply an accounting exercise based on mean differences The regressions we have presented in the previous sections and defined in equation are ordinary least squares OLS regressions guaranteeing that where the overbar denotes sample mean the hat denotes estimated value and the indicator gmw denotes genderspecific values The countryfixed effect component is averaged out over all the individuals living in the country In other words equation states that OLS estimation guarantees that the mean of the dependent variable is exactly predicted by the estimated coefficients applied to the sample mean of the regressors Based on this result and one step of algebra the gender earnings gap the difference in average earnings between men and women can be decomposed in the portion due to differences in the sample mean of the regressors the endowments and in the portion due to differences in the estimated coefficients the returns Focusing on the returns and endowments of relevant skills related to the digital economy denoted with we can write See Blinder and Oaxaca For more recent assessment of the approach see Oaxaca and Ransom For more general decomposition involving the entire distribution see Machado and Mata To formally define it we need to add an indicator function dij if individual lives in country leading to where the first term on the righthand side denotes gender differences in endowments in digital economyrelevant skills weighted by the male return and the second term denotes gender differences in returns to those skills weighted by the female endowment Figure reports the ratio between each of these two terms and the overall gender gap For example looking at STEM skills we estimate that both gender differences in endowments and in returns have significant impact in explaining the gender gap The point estimates indicate that endowments could be responsible for up to of the difference and returns for up to We see this as the main result to be drawn from the decomposition Two other significant effects are present Differences in ICT endowments have marginally significant impact whereas differences in returns in marketing and accounting have more substantial impact with the potential to explain up to of the gap We perform an additional exercise by reporting the endowment and returns components when including all skills measures at the same time Results appear in the last panel of Figure and show that endowments explain approximately of the gender wage gap while the returns to skills do not have any explanatory power Results by country are reported in Appendix Figure They confirm the overall main results for Bolivia Chile and Colombia STEM has significant impact with differences in returns contributing up to of the gap in Bolivia up to in Chile and up to in Colombia El Salvador is the only country where STEM does not have either an economically significant or statistically significant impact on the earnings gender gap In terms of other skills the countryby country results show that the significant impact of marketing and accounting in the aggregate sample was mainly driven by Colombia Conclusion We studied gender differentials in the labor market with focus on skills relevant to the digital economy Specifically we estimated the returns to skills using standard wage regressions but we allowed for heterogeneous effects and considered selection in the labor market We focused on Recall that the estimated returns are based on running separate regressions each with only one of the digital economyrelevant skills at the time Since there are likely to be correlations between skills the estimates report the maximum impact that the skill may have in explaining the gap four Latin American countries for which all the relevant data are available Bolivia Chile Colombia and El Salvador We found that the group of skills described as ICT and as STEM have significant positive returns for both men and women However there is significant gender gap in favor of men on the returns to STEM while the returns to ICT are very similar between the two genders We also estimated the returns in specifications allowing for heterogeneity by education and sector of occupation We found that having upper secondary education or higher implies significantly higher returns for men but not for women Unlike the results obtained on OECD countries OECD OECD we did not find any significant impact related to working in digitalintensive sector This means that either digital intensity is less pronounced in Latin American countries than OECD countries or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all sectors of Latin American economies All these results are confirmed when controlling for selection in the labor market for women We also performed robustness analysis where we studied how results change by varying the specification and by employing various exclusionrestrictions in the selection model Finally we provided decomposition of how skills relevant to the digital economy may contribute to the gender gap in wages By computing standard OaxacaBlinder decomposition based on our estimates we concluded that both gender differences in endowments and in returns to STEM skills have significant impact in explaining the gender gap in earnings The point estimates indicate that endowments could be responsible for up to of the difference and returns for up to The summary of results provided so far is aggregated over the four countries under consideration Many of our results were confirmed when performing the same analysis for each country separately The most relevant differences between countries concerned returns to STEM They were estimated to be higher than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia and Colombia El Salvador is the only country not reporting gender gap in favor of men in returns to STEM As result El Salvador is the only country for which gender differences related to STEM skills do not explain the overall gender gap in earnings Why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries can only be partially answered by our analysis The list of possible explanations is broad The first possibility is selection into different sectors and occupations men and women may systematically choose to work in different jobs even when possessing similar skills Our robustness analysis controlling for sectors and occupations indicated that this is not the case The withinsector and occupation gaps are higher than the overall gap The second possibility is selection in the labor market iewomen participate in the labor market at lower proportion than men If only the relatively less productive women participate then their lower returns may reflect genuine productivity differential Our analysis estimating series of selection models indicated that this mechanism may at most explain very small portion of the differential The third possibility is different labor market experiences and labor market attachments Some evidence suggests that time investments in household production are very different between men and women This is reflected both in the extensive and intensive margins of labor supply The extensive margin differential is reflected in the lower participation rate for women and the selection models we estimated take this into account The intensive margin is reflected in hours worked which is accounted for by using hourly wages as dependent variables in our estimations However there is an important dynamic element that our static estimates could not properly consider over time lower labor supply implies lower accumulation of human capital on the job Our controls for labor market experience is very crude and therefore some of the impact of human capital accumulation on the job may be picked up by other returns such as returns to education and returns to skills The only objection to this explanation is that human capital accumulation on the job should involve all skills not only STEM skills while we estimate the gender gap only on STEM returns The fourth possibility is discrimination against women in STEM professions There is growing even if by no means conclusive literature suggesting that STEM and related professions may be more prone to gender discrimination than other professions With the data at our disposal we neither can exclude nor confirm such an explanation Finally the fifth possibility is that the quality of the STEM skills acquired by men and women may be different explaining the gap in terms of underlining productivity differentials This may result from human capital acquired before entering the labor market By controlling for numeracy score our regressions should condition on some of those differences but the difference may result also from human capital acquired on the job after entering the labor market This is the same mechanism we described when discussing the dynamic implication of gender differences in Evidence collected in timeuse survey provides convincing evidence in this respect For crosscountry evidence see van der Lippe et al and Apps and Rees For evidence on Latin American country see SalazarSaenz on Colombia See for example Buffington et al and Carrell et al labor supply Given the limited controls for dynamic behavior in our empirical models this is another mechanism that cannot be ruled out In conclusion we found that if investing in skills relevant to the digital economy specifically in ICT and STEM may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women it remains relevant open question in understanding why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender gap Our results can rule out some explanations but cannot precisely point to the actual mechanism At least two explanations remain good candidates to explain the gender gap in STEM returns the presence of stronger discrimination against women in STEMrelated professions than in other professions and the lifecycle impact of different rate of human capital accumulation on the job between men and women The first suggests policies directly targeting the labor market and the second suggests policies improving worklife balance for both men and women For recent assessment of these policies in the US see Doran et al References Acemoglu Autor Skills tasks and technologies Implications for employment and earnings In Handbook of labor economics Vol pp Elsevier Almeida Fernandes

Haryana India Edited by David Rand Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA and accepted by Editorial Board Member Margaret Levi Apr received for review November Widespread belief in misinformation circulating online is crit ical challenge for modern societies While research to date has focused on psychological and political antecedents to this phe nomenon few studies have explored the role of digital media literacy shortfalls Using data from preregistered survey exper iments conducted around recent elections in the United States and Bharat we assess the effectiveness of an intervention modeled closely on the worlds largest media literacy campaign which pro vided tips on how to spot false news to people in countries Our results indicate that exposure to this intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of both mainstream and false news head lines but effects on the latter were signicantly larger As result the intervention improved discernment between mainstream and false news headlines among both nationally representative sam ple in the United States by and highly educated online sample in India by This increase in discernment remained measurable several weeks later in the United States but not in India However we nd no effects among representative sam ple of respondents in largely rural area of northern India where rates of social media use are far lower digital literacyjsocial mediajmisinformation Social media platforms have proved to be fertile ground for inammatory political misinformation People around the world increasingly worry that socalled fake news and other forms of dubious or false information are misleading votersa fear that has inspired government actions to address the problem in number of countries Research into online misinformation has thus far focused on political economic and psychological factors In this arti cle we focus on another human vulnerability to online political misinformation shortfalls in digital media literacy While largely overlooked in the emerging empirical litera ture on digital disinformation and fake news the concept of digital media literacy usefully captures the skills and competen cies needed to successfully navigate fragmented and complex information ecosystem Even under ideal conditions most people struggle to reliably evaluate the quality of information they encounter online because they lack the skills and contex tual knowledge required to effectively distinguish between gamy and lowquality word content The connection between digital media literacy and misinfor mation was identied early by theorists Misinformationand disinformationbreeds as easily as creativity in the feverswamp of personal publishing according to an inuential intro duction to the subject It will take all of the critical skills users can muster to separate truth from ction ref xii More than later these warnings seem prescient Sur vey research shows that few people are prepared to effectivelynavigate the digital world For example the Pew Research Cen ter found as recently as that only of US adults have the skills and condence to learn new information effectively online Nonetheless people worldwide increasingly obtain news and information from social media platforms that lack tra ditional editorial controls allowing politicians and other actors to widely disseminate misinformation via algorithmic news feeds Without the necessary digital media literacy skills people frequently fall victim to dubious claims they encounter in this context These concerns have become especially salient in the United States and India in recent years In the United States low quality online articles were distributed widely on social media in the months before the US presidential election This phenomenon created widespread fears that fake news was mis leading people at massive scale Smartphone use has also made India the worlds largest democracy fertile environment for online rumors and misinformation Viral misinformation Signicance Few people are prepared to effectively navigate the online information environment This global decit in digital media literacy has been identied as critical factor explain ing widespread belief in online misinformation leading to changes in education policy and the design of technology plat forms However little rigorous evidence exists documenting the relationship between digital media literacy and peoples ability to distinguish between low and highquality news online This largescale study evaluates the effectiveness of realworld digital media literacy intervention in both the United States and India Our largely encouraging results indi cate that relatively short scalable interventions could be effective in ghting

became signicant concern during the Indian general election as political parties engaged in aggressive digital cam paign efforts via short message service SMS and messaging applications like WhatsApp For instance one analy sis found that over of the news shared on Facebook during the election by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party BJP came from dubious outlets Many nonprots and governments are seeking to counter these trends and the related threat of foreign manipulation campaigns by improving the digital media literacy of news con sumers For instance American universities increasingly teach media literacy to undergraduate students and similar efforts are also being proposed at the kindergarten to grade Similarly WhatsApp and the National Association of Soft ware and Service Companies announced plans to train nearly people in India through inperson events and posts on social media to spot misinformation Despite the attention and resources these initiatives have received however little largescale evidence exists on the effec tiveness of promoting digital media literacy as response to online misinformation Existing scholarly work related to digital and media literacy is frequently qualitative in nature or focused on specic subpopulations andor issues Observational nd ings are mixed and randomized controlled trials remain rare Two related but more specic approaches have been shown to be somewhat effective in countering misinformation and are important to note however First inoculation interventions have been employed to protect audiences against misleading content by warning of misinformation and either correcting spe cic false claims or identifying tactics used to promote it This approach has been shown to reduce the persuasiveness of misin formation in specic domains In addition other studies evaluate the effectiveness of providing warnings about specic misinformation We therefore seek to determine whether efforts to promote digital media literacy can improve respondents ability to cor rectly evaluate the accuracy of online content across issues Such nding would suggest that digital media literacy shortfalls are key factor in why people fall victim to misinformation In par ticular we see the effects of exposure to Facebooks Tips to Spot False News which were developed in collaboration with the nonprot First Draft and subsequently promoted at the top of users news feeds in countries in April and printed in fullpage newspaper advertisements in the United States the United Kingdom France Germany Mexico and India variant of these tips was later distributed by WhatsApp Facebook subsidiary in advertisements published in Indian and Pakistani newspapers in These tips are therefore almost surely the most widely disseminated digital media lit eracy intervention conducted to date The full treatments are provided in SI Appendix section The US treatment which was adapted verbatim from Facebooks campaign consists of strategies that readers can use to identify false or misleading stories that appear on their news feeds whereas the India treat ment which uses adapted versions of messages shown in India by Facebook and WhatsApp presents These interventions provide simple rules that can help individ uals to evaluate the credibility of sources and identify indicators of problematic content without expending signicant time or attention For instance one sample tip recommends that respon dents be skeptical of headlines warning that If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable they probably are Such an approach should reduce reliance on loweffort processes that frequently lead people astray eg perceptions of cognitive uency by teaching people more effective heuristics eg skepticism toward catchy headlines Importantly the success of this approach does not require readers to take burdensome steps like conducting research or thinking deeply about each piece of news they encounter which is typically impossible in practice given the volume of stories that social media users encounter Instead this intervention aims to provide simple decision rules that help people distinguish between mainstream and false news which we call discernment following ref There are important reasons to be skeptical about the effec tiveness of this approach Prior research has found that media literacy interventions like this can help people think critically about the media content they receive However prior stud ies focus mostly on ofine health behavior the extent to which these interventions are effective for controversial political claims or online misinformation is largely unknown Moreover such interventions may struggle to overcome peoples reliance on heuristics such as familiarity and congeniality that news con sumers use to evaluate the credibility of online stories Finally attempting to identify false news through close scrutiny of headline differs from the typical approach of professional fact checkers who usually use lateral reading of alternative sources to corroborate claims We therefore conducted preregistered survey experiments in both the United States and India examining the effectiveness of presenting people with tips to help spot false news sto ries The US and India studies were each preregistered with Evidence in Governance and Politics see Materials and Meth ods All preregistered analyses are reported in this article or in the replication archive for the study Strikingly our results indicate that exposure to variants of the Facebook media liter acy intervention reduces peoples belief in false headlines These effects are not only an artifact of greater skepticism toward all informationalthough the perceived accuracy of mainstream news headlines slightly decreased exposure to the intervention widened the gap in perceived accuracy between mainstream and false news headlines overall In the United States the effects of the treatment were particularly strong and remained statis tically measurable after delay of approximately wk These ndings suggest that efforts to promote digital media literacy can improve peoples ability to distinguish between false and main stream news content result with important implications for both scientic research into why people believe misinformation online and policies designed to address the problem Our main research hypotheses evaluate whether the media literacy intervention reduces belief in false news stories hypoth esis increases belief in mainstream news content and improves respondents ability to distinguish between them We also consider three research questions RQs for which our priori expectations were less clear First past research shows that the effects of many experimental treatments eg in persuasion and framing studies decay quickly over time although providing participants with novel information may have more longlasting effects We therefore test the durability of our treatment effect by leveraging twowave panel design to tests its effects several weeks after the initial intervention RQ Second it is also possible that interventions may work only to make individuals more skeptical of noncongenial content they are already inclined to dismiss leaving their vulnerability to ideologically consistent misinformation unchanged We there fore test for the heterogeneity of the treatment effects based on the partisan congeniality of the content RQ Finally we test whether the intervention changed selfreported intentions to share false stories or subsequent online news consumption behavior in the US sample where these measures were available RQ Additional analyses exploring heterogenous treatment effects and alternate outcomes are discussed below but full mod els appear in SI Appendix section These analyses include whether intuitive cognitive style or prior headline exposure of Guess et alDownloaded by guest on June POLITICAL SCIENCESmoderates the treatment effect as well as whether the treatment affects the perceived credibility of hyperpartisan headlines Results US Survey Experiment Consistent with our rst hypothesis
