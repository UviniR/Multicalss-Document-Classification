INTRODUCTION Developing countries are facing the impact of mental health pro blems while confronted with limited resources and inequities in access to mental health care The use of Internet and digital technologies has the potential to address these gaps facilitating the development of more equitablemodelsofcareinavarietyofcontexts Internet and digital technologies could be powerful strate

American rural area with high prevalence of mental disorders and marked socioeconomic an geographical inequities in access to health care Since the Chile has developed communitybased mental healt services throughout the country to reduce the gap between mental health needs and access to treatment The public health system which serves approximately per cent of the population including the most atrisk groups in Chile between the years and increased the amount of human resources for specialized mental health care and the number mental health centers especially in primary health care In addition in Chile introduced policy that guarantee access to and quality of care as well as nancial protection for prioritized diseases including four mental pathologies depression in people over the age of bipolar disorder addictions in people under years of age and rst episode of schizophrenia In this way Chile provides one of the rst examples of an evidencebased depression intervention being scaledupinresourceconstrainedsettings However after years of relatively successful mental hea lth policies mental health in Chile still presents serious deci encies andcontinuestobeconsideredagreatchallengeforpubliche alth There is still striking imbalance between government spending on mental health and the related disease burden in Chile Thus the treatment gap remains high only of those with diagnosis receive any type of mental health servi ce andtherearelongwaitinglistsforpsychologicaltreatme nts in primary health care settings This gap is unequally distributed among social strata Multiple socioeconomic and territorial inequalities persist with high concentratio of specializedmentalhealthservicesinthecapitalcity Digital technologies are highly utilized across all social strata in Chile This high level of digital connectivity has recently facilitated the development of emental health interventions in an eort to improve access to treatment

improving mental health among adolescents The program uses webbased platform and mobile application to cultivate virtual community It includes both informational and interactive features ranging from suicide prevention stra tegies eg chat with psychologist to components designed to increase interactions between participants and promote sens of belonging and connection During the intervention two

progressive development of emental health research Nine studies that used Internet and digital technologies to addr ess mental health are presented three RCTs three acceptability and feasibility studies and three ongoing studies without published results The interventions included are heteroge neous in terms of participants and contexts eg adolescents adu lts patients professionals rural urban aims eg collabo rative care treatment monitoring relapse prevention and modaliti es eg website online games This demonstrates the divers ity of interventions that can be made through digital technologie to meet dierent needs Despite this heterogeneity the majorit of the interventions reported in this study are meant to reduce he burden of depression the most worrying mental healthproblem inChile Studies have prioritized the use of digital technologies to assist vulnerable groups in lowresource settings especiall in primary care This is especially relevant for lowresource hea lth services located in rural hardtoreach areas where there no specializedmentalhealthcarenearbyRemotecollaborative care andtelepsychiatryinterventionsreviewedinthisstudysho wthat it is feasible to use technologies for collaborative care in his particular context with adequate acceptability and satisfa ction levelsamonghealthcareteamsandpatients The reviewed studies are addressing not only adult populations but also children and adolescents who are in critical period where many mental health disorders arise Implementing Internetbased interventions to prevent or trea mental health problems in this age group can be reasonable way of dealing with the severe scarcity of mental health care resources in developing countries considering that this age group is familiar with digital technologies The reviewed tudies show that Internetbased interventions are feasible in chi ldren andadolescentswithadequateacceptabilitylevels Despite the recent growth of this eld the number of conducted and ongoing studies is still low when compared to developed countries Most studies are mainly concentrated on the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions he few eectiveness studies RCTs show that the interventions supported by digital technologies are feasible but failed to demonstrate their eectiveness in reducing symptomatology Demonstrating signicant dierences between intervention and control conditions is hindered by low sample sizes that lead to low statistical power Therefore there is need to develop more eectiveness studies with larger sample sizes an substantial followup periods Likewise studies need to dev elop understanding on how interventions work for whom and why mechanisms of change they work Given that one of the main arguments for introducing Internetbased interventions their Frontiers in Public Health December Volume Article Rojas et al Improving Mental Health Through Technologies costsaving potential costeectiveness evaluations are lso of

et al under review study also concluded that it is necessary to involve the target users in the designoftheinterventioninordertoencourageparticipatio The studies reviewed consistently show gap between acceptability and usabilityadherence of interventions this regard future studies need to address challenges associat ed with high attrition in these programs In the CTA program in order to improve user retention the authors suggested adding more personalizedandinteractivecontentandmoreconcretetas ksfor users to perform during their interaction with it Furthermo re in the evaluation of this program Parada et al suggested using persuasive systems design approach Likewise in the study of Espinosa et al participants who had completed the intervention suggested diversifying the monitoring asses sments and having the possibility to interact with therapist from th treatment center where they underwent facetoface treatm ent Both Martnez et al under review and Espinosa et al suggested enabling peer communication ASCENSO and CTA studies showed that email does not seem to be good way to contact and monitor participants possible way to improve the usability and eectiveness of emental

University UK ABSTRACT Eorts have been made in recent years to ensure there is su cient capacity within nation states to respond to and combat Online Child Sexual Exploitation OCSE The UKled WeProtect Global Alliance initiative has outlined Model National Response MNRto which large number of nations have already committed OCSE like cybercrime is very often crime with international dimensions If we could start again knowing what we know now about OCSE what would model international response look like Does this help us identify gaps in the existing internationalresponse that can be opportunities for improvement This article maps an optimal international response to the problem of OCSE Drawing on and complementing the We Protect Global Alliance Model National Response MNR it highlights aspects peculiar to the international nature of OCSE and suggests areas for futureoperational coordination and researchARTICLE HISTORY Received February Revised May Accepted May KEYWORDS Online safety cybercrimechild sexual abuse policingpublic policy technologysecurity Setting the scene what is online child sexual exploitation OCSE The group of criminal activities today commonly referred to as online child sexual exploi tation may be most easily if at times arti cially categorised as contentrelated or contactrelated Contentrelated activities have traditionally focused on the production distribution and possession of what is often called child pornography in national legisla tive instruments and by the popular media but which is classi ed as child sexual abuse material by those working in child protectionChild Sexual Abuse Material CSAM may be broadly de ned currently as photographs or videos that depict children in erotic poses child nudity with focus on the genital area and children engaged in sexual activity be this with peers adults or alone Contactrelated activities meanwhile can be classi ed most simply as serious sexual oences against children such as rape and sexual assault While these ences are by no means new it is generally agreed that over the last years mobile phone and internet technologies have orded much greater opportunity than before for individuals to make contact with children for sexual purposes Baines Quayle and Koukopoulos UNODC This article considers international responses to the interrelated activities shown in Figure Chatham HouseCONTACT Victoria Baines OF CYBER POLICY due consideration has been given to some countries recent moves to criminalise sexual chat between adults and minors this is not included in the schema above due to an absence of international consensus on its criminal status What are the goals of combating OCSE Researchers have used number of approaches to assist in the formulation of response measures to child sexual exploitation Considering OCSE as crime problem naturally prompts responses whose chief objectives are crime prevention detection and control This is an approach with which law enforcement intelligence analysts and child protectionspecialists will be familiar Since the scope of this research is content and contact widelydeemed to be criminal response model focused on criminal justice and crime prevention is therefore an obvious choice growing number of researchers have proposed as an alternative the public health model which views OCSE as societal problem As Wortley and Smallbone explain the public health model provides for three levels of prevention Primary targeting whole populations Secondary targeting atrisk groups and Tertiary targeting those already identi ed as having problem Existing prevention measures such as online safety tools awareness programmes and removal of CSAM are populationbased strategies that sit rmly within primary prevention of OCSESupport services for those at risk of ending or victimisation would constitute secondary prevention ender treatment programmes and victim support tertiary prevention Considering the wide range of activities shown in Figure it seems helpful to develop responses that combine both public health and criminal justice approaches and to ensurethat speci functions and measures are aligned to the following highlevel goals Figure Online Child Sexual Exploitation activities BAINESProtect children Control ending Under these functional headings can be housed an array of responses from the elds of public health criminal justice and crime prevention For example protecting children can describe the work of law enforcement cials social workers and educators Controlling oending can be the work of prisons but also of therapists providing support to individ uals seeking to manage their sexual interest in children As the response to OCSE is cur rently organised at national and international levels some stakeholders are actively involved in both protecting children and controlling ending related approach that sees OCSE as commoditybased activity be this in the form of CSAM or ine contact with children and young people would set the goals in the context of economic theory as follows Reduce supply of children for online and ine sexual contact and of CSAM and Reduce demand for online and ine sexual contact with children and for CSAM This is closer to some of the models applied to organised crime which view illegitimate business structures as functioning in broadly similar fashion to legitimate business Thecomparison is sound in so far as CSAM is commoditized produced or distributed forpayment or as currency in itself and in as much as production and distribution may involve online networking of likeminded individuals OCSE conforms to the principles of supply and demand to some degree but there are dierent emotional ordances at work not least sexual grati cation in many but not all cases Application of the organised crime model is stretched particularly in those cases of oneonone sexual exploitation of child where there is no nancial element and no apparent attempt to further commoditise CSAM produced But even here we may posit that equipping children to avoid victimisation would help reduce levels of ending Closer parallels can be found in the online coercion of children and young people to produce further selfgenerated sexual content and the production of sexual content inreturn for inducements In either scenario the threat of public exposure or the promise of gain helps to check compliance with an ender wishes Each of the theoretical approaches discussed above can be used to inform the develop ment of ective responses to OCSE and to align with the two highlevel goals of protecting children and managing ending The international response model proposed in this article draws on them directly presenting an ideal against which existing policy response can be measured free from the constraints of established organisational structures The WeProtect global Alliance model national response MNR The WeProtect Global Alliance is the result of the merging of two international initiatives tocombat OCSE the UKled WeProtect launched in and the joint USEU Global Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Online launched in It is an international movement dedicated to national and global action to end the sexual exploitation of children online and now counts countries technology companies and civil society and international organisations among its members JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY The initiative sagship document is the WeProtect Model National Response MNR the intention of which is to help country evaluate its current response identify gaps prior itise national orts to ll those gaps and by establishing common set of aspirations for all countries enhance international cooperation It sets out desired capabilities for sig natory countries Policy Governance Leadership Research Analysis and Monitoring Legislation Criminal Justice Dedicated Law Enforcement Judiciary and Prosecutors Oender Management Process Access to Image Databases Victim Endtoend Support Child Protection Workforce Compensation Remedies and Complaints Arrangements Child Helpline Societal CSEA Hotline Education Programme Child Participation ender Support Systems Industry Takedown Procedures CSEA Reporting Innovative Solution Development Corporate Social Responsibility Media and Communications Ethical and Informed Media Reporting Universal Terminology It is not the intention of this article to subject the MNR to full critique not least because its professed scope of Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse is wider than online child sexual exploitation Nevertheless one can observe from the above that the MNR groups responses variously according to function governance communicationapproach societal criminal justice sector industry and individual stakeholder victim From methodological perspective it is therefore something of hybrid perhaps re ecting BAINESthe complexity of the issue and of the measures already being delivered in countries whose responses are deemed to be the most advanced or sophisticated By design the MNR makes recommendations for national sovereign capabilities But since the majority of OCSE has an international component it may be asserted that national capabilities alone are insu cient to combat OCSE ectively As the WePro tect Global Threat Assessment acknowledges Solely focusing on national level response will not meet the international challenges of this global threat Recognition of this fact is the rst step to developing more collaborative and therefore ective approaches to safeguarding and justice Accordingly this article proposes new model for responding to OCSE that outlines the optimal response functions with particular focus on the international level An optimal international response to OCSE Modelling method review was conducted of academic publications grey literature such as law enforcementthreat assessments and reports by nongovernmental organisations and open sourcematerial including public statements and media coverage From this were identi ed estab lished and emerging trends in OCSE proposed approaches to combating them progress todate and operational challenges This in turn enabled mapping of both the functionsrequired for an optimal international response Figure and the existing stakeholder environment Figure The free software SimpleMind was used to map the models Figure personify then circulated among professionals with specialist experience of combat ing OCSE in law enforcement industry nongovernmental and other international organ isations Review by this group validated the model and number of amendments were made based on their feedback The model Figure maps the functions identi ed as optimal for combating OCSE ectively in line with the toplevel goals of protecting children and controlling ending The choice of functionbased approach rather than one based on stakeholders capabilities is deliberate The aim is to envi sion an ideal response informed by what we know about OCSE in independent of the organisational structures hitherto developed to respond to the problem It makes the assump tion that even the proudest and most partisan of stakeholders can identify things that couldhave been done di erently or better had the various national and international responses to OCSE not developed rapidly in reaction to large and unforeseen increase in such crimes Consequently this research does not take as given that the existing structures for responding to OCSE are optimal even in those countries with the most extensive or sophisticated provision Discussion The model comprises single global set of responses to be delivered at national and international levels to varying degrees This approach has been chosen to maximise utility for all specialist stakeholders and nonspecialists alikeJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY Figure Proposed international model for responding to Online Child Sexual Exploitation BAINESMapping functions in this way highlights number of aspects worthy of further con sideration In the rst instance viewing existing policy responses through lens of the ideal allows for the identi cation of gaps and opportunities for improvement In the second numerous overlaps between functions make evident that none of them can operate in isolation For example victim identi cation is an activity of law enforcement in the course of criminal investigation but may also be part of an international crisis response in the event of live instance of sexual extortion of child The goal of controlling or managing ending sits across disruption therapeutic support criminal justice and awarenessprevention to varying degrees Technical measuresto prevent convicted enders or those exhibiting ending behaviours from accessing online services through which they can contact children legal approaches that impose oine restrictions and requirements in order to reduce opportunity and therefore risk behavioural therapy and live advice from helpline such as StopItNow may all assist an individual at risk of ending against children to manage their own impulses Law enforce ment initiatives such as the European Union PolicePeer may seek to divert suspected downloaders of CSAM towards support services by intervening directly on peertopeerlesharing platforms In order to be accurate and useful Insight Analysis will necessarily rely on intelligence and information from all of the other functions Prevention is fundamental theme of several of the toplevel functions and numerous response measures shown It inevitably dominates the awarenessprevention responseslisted especially target hardening in the form of safety programmes for children and their guardians and capacity building for educators and other practitioners coming into contact with children in accordance with the public health model of combatingoine child sexual abuse technical measures for example age veri cation can help to ensure children have access to ageappropriate online environments and contentwhere their risk of sexual contact with adults can be reduced and therapeutic providerscan also assist children in reducing their vulnerability to victimisation Some of the functions have less obviously international dimensions than others Thera peutic support will for the most part be delivered at national level but capacity buildingfor practitioners in this eld may well be provided by or under the auspices of international organisations Delivery of technical prevention and disruption measures at scale almost always has an international dimension not least when they are deployed on global online platforms The international dimension of responding to OCSE is most evident in the Criminal Justice and Crisis Response functions where government authorities in one countryrequire the timely assistance of entities in another Two scenarios will serve to illustratethe character and pressing nature of the challenges Criminal justice The victimisation of child in Country is reported to the local police In accordance withthe WeProtect Global Alliance MNR Country has national specialist law enforcementunit dedicated to the investigation of CSE Initial investigation reveals that the child has been encouraged to expose themselves online to an unknown person In order to identify this person police in Country need to request data pertaining to their registration onand usage of several online services typical scenario would be for request to be made to social media provider for the subscriber and login information for anJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY account This most often includes registration data phone and email identi ers attached to an account and IP addresses for recent activity If the provider is based in Country and the data is stored there domestic legislation will su ce to compel the production of the information sought in timely manner This is typically the procedure for requests to local Internet Service Providers ISPs for metadata concerning home internet usage If however the provider is located and the data stored in another country the legislationof Country has no extraterritorial force to compel the data production This has histori cally been the case for law enforcement agencies outside the US seeking data from large USbased online providers The process is further complicated where cloud storage may hinder attempts by authorities to identify the location of data at speci time Gillespie The importance of communications data to OCSE investigations is re ected in its inclusion in the regularly updated model legislation and global review of instruments produced by the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children Remedies exist in the diplomatic sphere most notably the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties MLAT agreed between countries for bilateral assistance in criminal investigations Butthe majority of these agreements were made before the mass adoption of internet tech nologies and the misuse of instant communication for serious crimes such as OCSE UNODC While some countries such as the US have exceptions that permit emergency disclosure in circumstances indicating threat to life or limb on the wholenational legislations either do not provide for or may strictly prohibit direct disclosure of personal data held in one country to government authorities in another Various initiatives are currently underway to modify individual agreements or inter national legislation At the time of writing the UK is seeking to conclude an agreement with the US which will permit UK law enforcement authorities to request personal data directly from US providers the European Commission has announced plans for EuropeanProduction and Preservation Orders to enable member states to request data directly from providers operating service in fellow EU member states and the recently enacted CLOUD Act empowers federal US authorities to obtain data held by US companies on serversoutside the US Crisis response The WeProtect MNR highlights the need for legislation that enables data to be requestedinternationally including from third countries but does not fully re ect the complexity inherent in that process nor the speed at which OCSE can now be committed and become lifethreatening Sexual extortion of children can rapidly progress from initial contact to crisis child in Country exposes themselves online at the request of an unknownperson That unknown person threatens the child that they will publish the material receivedor recorded unless more often more abusive material is produced or monies are paid within short time typically couple of hours day at most If the child has the courage to tell parent or guardian this may be reported to the local police In cases where the chief harm is causedby the publication of the CSAM authorities may prioritise prevention and disruption over identifying the ender Country has national specialist OCSE unit as recommended by the WeProtect MNR The only identi ers for the suspect relate to an account for video chat platform based in another country Country The alleged victim is in crisis and hasexpressed suicidal thoughts The most urgent priority is to locate the suspect account and BAINESremove the possibility for publication of the CSAM Information will then be sought with the aim of identifying and locating the suspect If the suspect is located in country other than Country where possible the information will be shared with authorities in that countryto assist in the suspect apprehension and prevent further victimisation For authorities responding to OCSE the above scenario is not uncommon As will be evident there are several possible points of failure that could result in direct physical harmto the child The child may not disclose but su er in silence the parentguardian may not report to the police local police may not understand the urgency of the situation the country may not have specialist unit with key contacts in other countries and online provi ders the online provider may not have the capacity or legal basis to respond to emergencyrequests from foreign authorities Where disruption and harm reduction are successful they rely more on interpersonal relationships than on tested or agreed process UNODC Practitioners and researchers alike have recognised the potential of sexual extortion for psychological damage selfharm and suicide Crisis intervention has historically been the remit of social workers and therapeutic providers and is key feature of the increasingly popular Barnahus interagency model for responding to child sexual exploitation andabuse But in hyperconnected world where children are encouraged to interface directly with others on global technology platforms rst responders may also be peers parents helplines hotlines educators law enforcement and online service providers all of whose actions may impact on the mental and physical wellbeing of child in potential crisis Thepublic health model requires community response and the internetmediated public is global community There is therefore an opportunity to establish an international and multiagency emergency response that reduces the immediate harm of OCSE for childrenin crisis enabled by an agreed operational framework and resourced for rapid action It should be emphasised that crisis response is also necessary for OCSE enders and potential enders Individuals struggling to control or come to terms with their urges to commit OCSE ences will often require urgent live support Adequate resourcing for help lines is therefore essential to prevent harm to enders as well as reduce ending Why has focus on crisis response largely been absent to date from strategies to combat OCSE possible explanation lies in the fact that both legal measures and research have historically been focused primarily on CSAM and not on the full range of OCSE ences Europol The requirement for criminalisation of nonimagebased OCSE activities such as grooming is comparatively recent development The Lanzarote Convention enacted in and the EU Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography are the landmark international instruments in this regard In some signatory countries are yet to ratify the convention and fully transpose the directive into their national legislations Continued policy focus on technical measures for eradicating CSAM is well founded aimed as it is at reducing supply and revictimisation improving practitioner resilience and coordinating responses But its emphasis on les rather than live scenarios involving children has not kept pace with the changing methods of victimisation There is further opportunity to recalibrate international responses to ensure they meet the goal of protecting children Phippen Legislative measures alone cannot ensure timely international response to OCSE emergencies Human capacity is required to maintain international relationships not only within national law enforcement authorities but also in the companies receiving emergency requests for assistance The major US tech companies publish transparencyJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY reports that include statistics on the number of data requests they receive from each coun trys law enforcement agencies These numbers do not necessarily include the number of times company is called upon to disrupt or prevent OCSE or the time taken to build relationships often with multiple law enforcement cers in every country policing OCSE Recent recommendations by the European Commission that EU member states desig nate Single Points of Contact SPOCs for data requests to US providers will doubtless bewelcomed by online service providers and this re ects the identi ed need for greater coordination in international evidence gathering including in relation to OCSE This is especially the case for smaller providers who may lack the capacity and resources to assist global law enforcement to the extent of the large global technology companies Insight and analysis The MNR identi es research analysis and monitoring of child sexual exploitation and abuse CSEA as desired capability Action to prevent and tackle CSEA is intelligence and evi denceled The nationallyagreed view is used to inform the development prioritisationand implementation of the country CSEA response and related policy and practice The ability to review progress and adapt responses to changes in the operating environmentis no less important at international level given the transnational nature of Online ChildSexual Exploitation Just as the MNR highlights that legal de ciencies in one country may lead to crime displacement so too do trends in victim and ender behaviours and also good practice in protective measures need to be shared globally and in timelyfashion to ensure consistent and ective responses across countries and sectors Advances in international research and analysis of trends in OCSE have to date been sporadic and largely sectorspeci Notable examples of international law enforcement analysis of OCSE include the Virtual Global Taskforce VGT Environmental Scan an assess ment of trends in OCSE based on the contributions of law enforcement specialists in VGT member countries and organisations First produced in for the World Congress III Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children it largely re ects trends as observed in law enforcement workloads and includes consideration of possible future developments demonstrating level of foresight not required by the WeProtect MNR In terms of international reach the VGT assessments are perhaps the most representative but they are representative only of the VGT members hip including EU member states via Europol They cannot be said to accurately re ect African law enforcement se eo fO instance since no African country is VGT ember Other research such as Europol sInternet Organised Crime Threat Assessment eects law enforcement assessment of OCSE in speci geographical regionFurther phenomenon or capabilitybased analyses add to our under standing including those of the various nancial coalitions on commercial OCSE the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on sexual extortion the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children on legislation ECPAT International and Interpol on CSAM and the Cana dian Centre for Child Protection sInternational Survivor SurveyWhat has been lacking is analy sis that synthesises these ndings into global assessment with regular updates There is therefore an opportunity for truly international and multistakeholder assessment of OCSE that enables all countries and sectors to anticipate risks and threats on regular basis In this respect research and analysis has an important role to play not only in reporting andlearning but also in the primary and secondary prevention of OCSE This is no small undertak ing given the number of countries to be surveyed Interpol member countries alone number BAINES The MNR recommendation for national research and analysis capabilities would perhaps go some way to lling these gaps and generating the necessary data if all WePro tect Global Alliance countries were to commit to their establishment As recent strides in the coordination of victim identi cation illustrate technology can assist the international coordi nation of the ght against OCSE Just as Interpol International Child Sexual Exploitation ICSE database now enables investigators hotline analysts and other authorities to focus on unidentied children by agging material already investigated by the international law enforcement community so too can technological tools automate at least part of the process of data gath ering and qualitative and quantitative intelligence analysis The WeProtect Global Threat Assessment is the most recent move towards lling this analytical gap Furthermore it highlights the need for consistent global assessment of the threat from CSEA and its impact and to keep up with the changing nature of such diverse complex and fastmoving threat Beyond general reporting of projected smart phone adoption however its foresight is currently limited Crosscutting challenges and enablers number of prerequisites underpin the delivery of the optimal international response to OCSE mapped in Figure International coordination International coordination is perhaps the most prominent theme of this research Theabove discussion of crisis response highlights the need for fasttime international and multistakeholder coordination At an investigative level international coordination ensures essential information exchange and evidence gathering often despite legalobstacles It also streamlines operational activity minimising duplication of ort and avoiding crosscontamination by multiple law enforcement authorities At the strategic level international coordination can target capacity building where it is most needed Gillespie and enable both measurement of impact and sharing of valuable insights The problematics of international coordination relate to ownership and leader ship When it comes to OCSE national sovereignty is not the only challenge As UNICEF notes The borderless nature of the Internet makes it hard for both national govern ments and intergovernmental agencies to speak directly to what has now become highly di use and widely dispersed set of interests Legislation Legislation is required speci cally at international level to ensure approximation or harmoni sation of criminal ences common understanding on jurisdiction and extraterritoriality and to provide for evidence gathering and information exchange amongst other aims As discussed above legislation can itself pose challenge in urgent situations where swiftinternational responses are required At strategic level instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child the Lanzarote Convention the EU Directive and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child set international standards in this regard to which communities and advocacy groups can hold governments to accountJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY presumption of partnership Mapping functions rather than stakeholders has revealed that the majority of the optimal international response activiti es rely on the contribution of more than one stakeholder and in some cases several For example while criminal investigation isthe natural preserve of law enforcement feedback contributors noted that non governmental organisations including hotlines for illegal material child helplines andeld missions play an active role in identifying enders and victims Accurate analysis of victim and ender behaviours will necessarily requ ire the sharing of information and intelligence between governments industry and nongovernmental organisations In acrisis response scenario involving the publication of CSAM law enforcement platformproviders hotlines and helplines may all be active in removing the immediate harm to child As Figure illustrates the international st akeholder environment for OCSE is complex In full recognition of the challenges of ownership at international level UNICEF has called for collective ort by policymakers law enforcement agencies social workers teachers parents and the private sector to systematically protect children Until now the public discourse in relation to OCSE has often characterised this collective eort as series of oneway relationships As Phippen observes the dominant policy response in some countries has been to look to technology to solve societalproblem This is echoed in media coverage of the relationship between some governmentauthorities and online platform providers where the tone is more often punitive than collaborative The question of progressing OCSE stakeholder relationships from cooperation to part nership is not merely semantic Cooperation as outlined in the MNR and currently practised by stakeholders in the ght against OCSE is predominantly transactional for example industry or hotlines reporting illegal material to law enforcement law enforce ment asking industry for data or to remove material nongovernmental organisationsreporting intelligence in the eld to the relevant parties Cooperation gives every stake holder role but not necessarily an equal voice True partnership in the ght against OCSE in which all stakeholders have part to play in shaping the response not just in delivering it would arguably engender not only greater ownership and investment from individual stakeholders but also more innovative solutions in the interests of protecting children and controlling ending The involvement of all stakeholders is also in the spirit of the public health model for crime prevention To this end following survey of practitioners in multiple sectors Davidson et al have identi ed the need for real joined up partnership between law enforcement and industry that is visible functional eective and seen as legitimate and the development of systematic policing and industry collaboration Communities and constituents To the stakeholders identi ed as professional contributors to the ght against OCSE must be added also the targets of these responses Smallbone Marshall and Wortley identify four essential targets for preventing child sexual abuse victims or potential victims enders or potential enders situations in which sexual abuse has occurred or is likely to occur and communities BAINESFigure Select stakeholder groups in the ght against online child sexual exploitation Note this map is not exhaustive and is intended to serve solely as an illustration of the complexity of the stakeholder environment Omission or inclusion on the map should not be interpreted as indicative of any weight or value of contribu tionJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY Article of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that In all actions concerning children whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions courts of law administrative authorities or legislative bodies the best interests of thechild shall be primary consideration Accordingly UNICEF advocates for childcentred approach to online child protection and there have been numerous callsfor law enforcement and criminal justice responses that are childfriendly Asndings of the EU Kids Online project have consistently demonstrated asking children whatbothers or upsets them online reveals diversity in how children feelabout OCSErelated experience in di erent countries and sociodemographic contexts often challenging par ental and policymakers perceptions of the problem Livingstone et al Support services for children and child participation in the development of policy and practice are key features of the MNR Not so evident in the models to date are the voices ofoenders and potential enders Approaching OCSE as public health problem rather than problem of public order requires listening to enders and potential enders what works what does not their particular challenges and methods in order to develop preventative measures that are ective because they are representative To date public discourse has shown itself to be intolerant if not hostile to OCSE enders and potential enders This is understandable but potentially counterproductive to the goals of protecting children and controlling ending and has in turn made such support ser vices as there are even more essential for the health and wellbeing of enders and potential oenders Altering the public discourse in relation to enders generally would seem to be important but particularly so in respect of juvenile ending and its prevention where there is recognised knowledge gap Acknowledgment of the intersection between target groups namely that child can also be an ender should lead stakeholders to ques tion further the mainstream media insistence on the demonisation of enders Technology Technical solutions play role in several components of the optimal international response to OCSE and are already used by several stakeholders including law enforce ment platform providers and hotlines for illegal content NetClean UNODC To date they have been deployed most extensively in the processes of detecting and removing CSAM and in the investigation of OCSE by law enforcement authorities where they assist in the prioritisation of cases and victim identi cation Hashing of known Child Sexual Abuse Material with unique signature for each image has enabled platforms to automatically identify and report attempted uploads This hasbeen seen as an important step forward for companies willing to demonstrate due diligence with the added bene that such measures aim to minimise revictimisation of chil dren and young people by reducing the ongoing circulation of identi ed material The practice is largely adopted by US companies in line with national statutory reportingobligation Hash sharing and related technologies also improve personnel resilience inindustry law enforcement and hotlines by reducing the amount of material that needs to be manually reviewed Given the identi cation above of gaps in relation to international crisis response insight and analysis and timely evidence gathering across jurisdictions it is reasonable to suggestthat automation of some tasks may improve responses in these areas BAINESPolitical will The international response to OCSE relies on adequate funding by nation states Without it individual countries risk becoming hotspots in the production and distribution of CSAM be this by live streaming online solicitation or other means as location for suspectsvictims or both number of countries around the world could already be said to be in this situation due to lack of resources Their lack of response in turn weakens the inter national community ability to combat the problem creating perception of safe havens and additional victims and suspects in other countries Support from international organisations in the form of ad hoc training or donated equipment can only ever be small part of country response to the problem This is key message of the MNR establishment of the desired functions outlined for signatory countries necessarily entails the provision of funding for national specialist law enforce ment units hotlineshelplines and so forth Logic suggests that political will shouldresult in the allocation of resources but in the eld of OCSE the relationship appears to be more complex There is currently no publicly available information on the progressof signatory countries towards implementing the WeProtect commitments It is evidenthowever that many signatory countries have made no obvious progress towards theestablishment of specialist law enforcement units youth awareness campaigns or thera peutic support for victims and enders Whether their basis is political charitable or focused on enforcement international organisations have role to play in lobbying for change political will and increasedresources This in turn can enhance coordination and reduce duplication of ort again ensuring that resources are distributed where they are most needed Concluding remarks OCSE is complex and dynamic phenomenon The optimal international response pro posed in this article and the subsequent discussion cannot hope to cover all aspects ofthe topic in the detail they deserve nor was this the intention of the research Rather it is anticipated that the relevant stakeholders will take forward the various items worthy of further consideration In deliberately choosing to map the gold standard for combating OCSE in all its forms at international level the research highlights opportunities for improvement in all countriesBased on assessment of the current state of ending and victimisation and contributions from stakeholders it is reasonable to assume that no one country would boast su cient law enforcement resources or ongoing therapeutic support for enders and victims From the international perspective the most obvious gaps to be transformed into opportunities are in Establishment of procedure for fasttime response to OCSE events in which childrenand young people experience crisis Streamlined cooperation and information exchange in the realm of criminal justice and Regular insight and analysis that future proofs OCSE responses as far as possible In terms of general global strategy the author has asserted that greater international coordination and true partnership across stakeholder groups have the power to createJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY more ective and innovative countermeasures whose secondary impacts are foreseen Mapping of currently observed and emerging OCSE activities in particular has cast light on interdependencies between them These in turn suggest that an optimal internationalresponse is one that approaches OCSE holistically rather than focusing on single aspect or activity and as both crime problem and public health issue The author is duty bound to acknowledge that the discussion in this article is inevitably coloured by her own professional experience combating and analysing OCSE in law enfor cement and industry and working closely with nongovernmental organisations Every attempt has been made to ensure that the perspectives of all relevant stakeholder groups were included in the research not least by soliciting feedback on the optimal international response It is hoped that this article will prompt further stakeholder and public debate on how OCSE is tackled globally Notes Throughout this article and in this section in particular attention has been paid to the termi nology used to describe activities deemed to be Online Child Sexual Exploitation Reference has been made to the terminology guidelines produced by ECPAT

devel opment from the onwards were topdown decontextualised and technologically determinist One of the assumptions on which they were premised was that dissemination of information alonecan lead to substantial change and more specifically that technical innovation can radically trans form remote rural communities in developing nations by pulling them towards Western urbanised modernity and comparable economic prosperity Manyozo When largescale expensive development interventions consistently failed to provide these intended results instead exacer bating economic and social inequalities in their target areas the premise and foundation of their design and implementation were questioned Escobar Friere Melkote and Steeves While some critiques of modernisation rationales and practices for using mass media such as television have gained purchase among media and development practitioners resulting in theemergence of more participatory approaches Kleine Hollow and Poveda many of the assumptions of the modernisation paradigm persist In relation to children and young people expectations regarding the promise of ICTs are often at their highest building on the hugely appealing rhetoric of the digital native Banaji Brown and Czerniewicz Many policymakers and practitioners hope that the proliferation of ICTs and digital media in developing countries can expand the participatory potential of communicationfor development CD programming But others argue that the rhetoric around ICTs has provided anew and alluring guise for technocentric modernisation thinking in development Mazzarella and is becoming ever more entrenched as the notion of digital imaginary Third and Collin gains purchase Given this contested context this article addresses two overarching questions What does the available evidence reveal about adolescents access use and everyday contact with media and digital technologies in low and middleincome countries including about devel opment programmes use of digital media to target adolescents Does the available evidence also indicate how problematic practices and modernising assump tions of development projects using digital media with adolescents in low and middleincomecountries could be addressed and transformed These questions concern the intersections among several domains of knowledge ICTs and digital media and adolescence both domains heavily led by research in the Global North and CD and ICTD programmatic interventions in low and middleincome countries LMICs Each is contested even with regard to terminology In this article we identify the central terms debates and findingsthat have shaped these fields in the past decade and examine the gaps between what is known about adolescents everyday mediadigital usage in LMIC contexts and the messy realities of devel opment interventions using ICTs with adolescents To answer our research questions we draw on rapid evidence review of the literature on ado lescence media use ICTs and CD interventions in range of low and middleincome countries see Livingstone et al in press undertaken as part of the Overseas Development Institute longitudinal research project Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE We include material from subDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE Saharan Africa South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa MENA with some insights from Latin America and EastSouth East Asia The experience of undertaking this review in itselfbrought us face to face with intellectual and political tensions between the perspectives of scholars and practitioners familiar on the one hand with international development discourses or on the other hand with digital media and ICTs or again with childhood and adolescence Methodology We searched databases for research published from to The original focus was on girlsaged but this was widened to include girls and boys aged when initial searching revealed paucity of research on young girls and ICTs For reasons of quality control priority was given to research published in peerreviewed journal but recognising that much of the research in this field derives from NGOs government reports and industry sources we also included nonpeerreviewed grey literature and unpublished reports Our search terms were internet OR online OR digital OR mobile phone OR app OR comput OR cell phone OR ICT OR social networking OR platform OR broadband OR connect AND child OR young OR youth OR teenage OR adolescen OR minor OR kid OR girl OR boy OR student AND developing countr OR low and middle income countr OR low income countr OR middle income countr OR Africa OR Asia OR MENA OR Middle East and North Africa ORMiddle East OR North Africa These were tested on preidentified databases with the results limited to English and to the period This resulted in total of studies which was supplemented by consulting international experts of whom replied as shown in Table The total of studies represents the cumulative total of hits on each database prior to the exclusion of duplicates Some expert recommendations were also captured in the database searches The overlap and duplicates between the expert recommendations and database searches were removed The studies were then screened on thebasis of titles and abstracts to judge their relevance to the inclusion criteria about children media tech nologies development and LMICs which led to streamlined batch of studies The majority of the results that were excluded pertained entirely to adults or university students over the age of This canbe explained by the different definitions of adolescence in different countries Despite the filters and the search terms many results still pertained to countries in the Global North some of these results were retained where they provided useful insights on the digital media uses of adolescents from marginalised populations in those countries and could thereby provide an indication of access and uses and practices of digital media of adolescents from underserved communities The studies were screened down to studies by reviewing the sections on methodology and study design of eachfull text article in order to check their compatibility with the inclusion criteria We included few studies from highincome countries HICs on the grounds that they captured transnational phenomena or relevant conditions for digital media use in LMICs We read and codedfull texts of these studies according to type of study type of data design of evaluative studies geographical distribution and income classifications as applied by DFID UK We coded each study thematically in terms of focus on digital access skills and practices opportunities online risks andmediation by parents educators and peers Finally we selected the studies employing

relevant research designs and evaluated their findings by means of standardised analytical template that identified the research questions placegeographical location method includingsample and age group claimsfindings study evaluation and critical and discursive comment on epistemology framing of ICTs and adolescence We complemented the resulting insights with selected case studies of ICTrelated programme interventions targeted at the capability developmentof children in LMICs We note in reflecting on this process that it was disappointing to find so little empirical research on children and adolescents experiences of ICTs in LMICs given the optimistic hyperbole in many inter national policy statements regarding their being supposedly at the forefront of adoption and creative appropriation It was also disappointing to find ourselves documenting as below the limitations in conception design and quality of the available research far more often than we could celebrate inspir ing studies or programmes with insightful implications for future research and good practice Despite the wealth of sophisticated literature on children in education studies and childhood studies see Ennew we suspect this situation reflects the relative invisibility of children experiences for development researchers and policymakers it being easier to impose adultcentric assumptions than to engage seriously with children themselves It may also reflect the sense endemic in the study of ICTs in development that technology and indeed children uses of it is chan ging too fast for indepth investigation or especially longerterm evaluation of interventions Last it was often the case that although study was included in our review for its relevance to ICTs for the researchers or practitioners involved the ICTs were often blackboxed as merely convenientand uptodate means of distributing resources so that the specific relation between children litera ciesincontext and the affordances of the ICTs deployed would go unnoticed Unseen children messy realities beyond the official statistics Given that children up to years old comprise one third of the population in less developed countries UN it is surprising but indicative of children low status that neither the Inter national Telecommunications Union nor any other source eg UNICEF is able to document children internet access in terms of official statistics for more than handful of countries Best available estimates suggest that children are also around one third of the world internet users Livingstone Carr and Byrne going online roughly in the same proportion as adults albeit fewer when very young and up to twice as much as adults when adolescent ITU This makes it impossible to break down the category of children in terms of gender age household income or any other factor although for adults often misleadingly described as individuals orthe population plenty of sources document persistent forms of inequality within as well as between countrieseg GSMA ITU World Bank It is also of course difficult to break down the cat egory of ICTs using official statistics ICTs take different forms including online networked mobile and also more established media radio television film press and so on all of which areincreasingly accessible via online platforms online itself includes diverse internet services includ ing information gaming social media streaming and other services But even if the statistics were available qualitative research reveals the many reasons why bald percentages should be scrutinised qualified and contextualised It charts the manifold ways in which access and use depend on resolving host of challenges associated with electricity connec tivity cost digital skills social acceptability spatial privacy and adult permission at the communityand individual levels as well as with commercial viability investment and government regulation at the level of the state or region Chigona Kamkwenda and Manjoo Hilbert For many children access is absent limited sporadic or otherwise problematic and it varies by age gender socioeconomic status caste and other important sources of inequality Banaji Bosch For example in their sizeable multimethod study of to yearolds mobile phone use in Ghana Malawi and South Africa Porter et al found that mobile phone ownershipusageDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE varies according to the income level of each country with Malawi scoring the lowest followed by Ghana then South Africa There is the same pattern across locations in each country with theremote rural being the lowest Distinctively certainly by comparison with children experiences in much of the Global North many young people across Africa obtain work and live off resources provided by social contacts kin and friend ship networks are crucial in this respect This requires careful nurturing of social relationships over time and mobile phone contact is extremely valuable Porter et al Porter et al sndings caution against the assumption of linear progression between the spread of ICTs and mobile devices across the globe and access as optimistically assumed in industry and policyreports eg GSMA They demand recognition of the crucial distinction ever less meaningful in the Global North between access and use In their research most young people did not own personal phones and so had to ask for or borrow them most commonly from afamily member with phone ownership sometimes facilitated as gift from urbanbased family members But such phone ownership can be transient since young people phones are also sold to obtain daily essentials when in need Moreover borrowing is in ected by family status eg foster status household resources and livelihood patterns and intergenerational relationships Forexample restrictions on borrowing are widely reported in Ghana and Malawi Porter et al and also in India Banaji Even when access is feasible care should be taken in presuming use In their smallscale compari son of two cases with South African youth one with lowincome older urban teens and one with younger boys from an affluent suburb Walton and Pallitt provide nuanced sense of digital media in everyday life For the poorer adolescents it emerged that poverty constrains mediause in key ways One boy listened to his neighbour music through the wall and he rationed daily game playing to minutes to save his phone battery as he pays to charge it It seems too that he only used some phone functions again to save money Another boy used such an old phone that his peers ridiculed him so he tried to use it in ways that his friends wouldn notice eg on silentvibrate to avoid being shamed Furthermore the boys in this study selected their games because they were free or very cheap and they were ingenious in locating freecheap downloads and in avoiding com mercial tactics to steal their prepaid airtime The older teenage girls too had developed strategies to manage their stringent lack of resources for instance deleting their games to make phone space for messages from boyfriends saved to cherish intimate memories Between the older boys and girls local instant messenger app permitted playful and flirtatious interactions offering way toshow off by competing to collect contacts Walton and Pallitt observe that gaming is popular local appropriation of mobile phones Unlike expensive console games they do not require specialised hardware or negotiations with other household members Significantly this led them to explore how game literacy permits young people to articulate and reappropriate their lived experi ences of gender class and ethnicity with energy and creativity although the consequence is thereproduction of existing inequalities for example boys using gaming to reassert the value of mascu line subcultures and the exclusion of girls from this Good intentions backfire struggles to deploy ICT to overcome inequality Particularly problematic as amply illustrated in our corpus of research studies are those policy andprogrammatic interventions which focus on access alone as the solution to inequality without due attention to context and consequences intended and unintended For example Hansen et al examined whether provision of laptop for educational purposes enabled the cognitive development of to yearolds in Ethiopia comparing them after six months of use to children without such provision Perhaps surprisingly there were no systematic increases in student perform ance due to laptop use But this overall finding was on more detailed examination qualified by finding that use of laptops did benefit the performance of students on measures of abstract BANAJI ET ALreasoning in higher grades but not in lower ones possibly because the older children used the laptops more and for more activities In other words providing access without attention to preexist ing skills and social contexts can result in exacerbating rather than ameliorating inequality While this problem is known in ICTD circles the troubling case of One Laptop per Child being the most telling instance James recent literature remains replete with studies that see mingly discover anew that merely providing access is unlikely to deliver intended goals quite the contrary benign interpretation suggests tha this reflects insufficient knowledgesharing among the different expert fields that infor intervention programmes the dual myths of potent new technologies and digitally savvy children holding sway for many even when evidencecontradicts them less benign interpretation points to the political and economic interests behind interventions focused on the highly visible and newsworthy distribution of expensive and shiny technologies while underinvesting in muchne eded accompanying programmes for literacy and training and saliently failing to consult the views of the supposed beneficiaries especially whenthese are merely children Sometimes it simply seems beyond the scope of study to examine why wellintended interven tion fails For instance consider Pfeiffer et al puzzlement when providing to year olds in urban Tanzania with health information They found that even though the adolescents weremediasavvy almost none of them made use of sexual and reproductive health information on the sites targeted at youth Instead they went into search engines such as Google where they entered keywords and screened the websites that came up similar instance is Nwalo and Anasi study of adolescent girls access to and use of reproductive health information in Nigeria they found that interpersonal means of communication and mass media were the sources through which the respondents accessed reproductive health infor mation notwithstanding the availability of more reliable indepth and con dential information online While these studies presumed that digitally savvy young people would bene if resources were simply provided for Gouws Banaji and Brown and Czerniewicz the digital native discourse has more pernicious consequences in compounding existing inequalities by directing learning resources uncritically towards those who are already at home in digital environ ments even though they are often already privileged This is not to argue against the importance and value of support for digital resources and skills but rather to urge attention to empirical research on how such resources and skills are distributed unequally and then to ask critical questions aboutwhich should be fostered with whom and to further which or whose goals To counter the problematic emphasis on access alone Larghi et al frame their study of Argentinian teenagers in terms of the digital divide distinguishing the firstorder digital divide inaccess to hardware and connectivity as function of age gender and social class the second order digital divide in digital media appropriation within families and the development of digital skills and literacies and the thirdorder digital divide in terms of actual practices of use andthereby the benefits that might accrue In the Global North attention to the firstorder divide is fading as access becomes taken for granted although the importance of the second and third order divides remains important In the Global South all three are important demanding distinctbut interrelated research on access social contexts and consequences of use But addressing such challenges demands nuanced and contextualised research For instance Lemphane and Prinsloo ethnographic comparison of the digital literacy practices of to yearolds living in wealthy white and poor black slum households outside Cape Town South Africa acknowledged the ways in which these resources have become part of rhetoricof progress and modernity in order to grasp how and why provision of digital tools entrenched ratherthan overcame social and economic inequalities digital media were at least partially complicit in widening of the gap to the extent that the differential uses and availability of resources across social classes produce different imaginings of self social ambitions andDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE investments and differing ways with social semiotics Such differences translate into and contribute to the main tenance of social inequalities in school settings that coincide with language and social class divides In short in the context of South Africa where English is the language of privileged white elite merely going online was implicated in reinforcing hierarchies of power While the privileged Bolton children are learning to think of themselves as legitimate participants in local online globally connected middleclass English languagebased culture the poor Mahlale children are acquiring linguistic resources that are localised indexical of their subelite status and not associated with success in school ingLemphane and Prinsloo Lemphane and Prinsloo are critical of calls for digital outofschool interventions that use mobile phones or multiplayer games but pay little attention to the way in which limited access and unsympathetic surroundings lack of food time parents with little interest in digital media can frame and alter poor nonwhite children experiences of pleasure and learning online As one of the few studies designed to examine these differences in qualitative and comparative ways Lem phane and Prinsloo work suggests template for other future studies in different locales In other words if insights from wealthy homes are to be applied in less privileged contexts considerable criticality and adaptation will be vital Countering adultism the importance of childcentred contextualised and participatory approaches InGirls Speak Out based on fasttalk process with girls aged from countries in Asia West Africa and Latin America across mix of rural and urban locations de Pauw see also Raftree and Bachan found that on the one hand the girls faced substantial problems including teen pregnancy child labour health risks poor sanitation and sexual violence but they nonethelesshave big dreams for their future careers and see education as the foundation for their success in life Asked specifically about ICTs they were eloquent about both the difficulties of access adding new insights on for instance how domestic chores took up all their time and how boys edged them away from the computers in school while cybercafs could be site of sexual harassment and also theopportunities they hope for They talked about valuing ICT to research issues they care about includ ing their rights community development physical and mental health information economic oppor tunities news gaining job skills or finding work They wanted to share experiences discuss problemsor use ICTs for activities related to awarenessraising campaigning civic engagement and student mobilisation Girls proposed solutions to increasing their access to ICT are also noteworthy they highlighted the need to address genderbased inequalities injustice and stereotypes both in general and inrelation to technology They thought it would be necessary to educate parents teachers and com munities on the importance of girls access to digital media as well as to make access to ICTs better Girls were also interested in ICTs being better integrated in the curriculum having technology content and curricula in their own languages and in more opportunities for peertopeer learning Yet in our rapid evidence review we found few studies exploring these topics or seeking ways toempower girls in the ways they themselves wish for good example of an initiative seeking to empower adolescents to discuss the issues that concern them while informing local governance policies is UNICEF mobilebased platform UReport This text messaging communication platform was launched in Uganda in Kleine Hollow and Poveda as local initiative allowing young people to contribute ideas to governance and decision making processes that impact on their local communities Users have an average age of and those who sign up share opinions on topics ranging from job skills to disaster management UNICEF and respond to questions sent out by UNICEF staff twice week These are then aggre gated and shared with media and policymakers Since its inception UReport has spread to several other countries and has reportedly reached million active users UNICEF Although in some BANAJI ET ALcountries the platform is also used by policymakers crucially for our argument evidence that young people voices expressed on the platform have any impact on or response from policymakers is slim in the evaluations and children are not included either in evaluation or policymaking In another case the Kenyabased nonprofit organisation AkiraChix partnered with large develop ment organisations and the corporate sector to address the underrepresentation of women and girlsin ICTrelated fields Its programmes target girls of different ages and backgrounds and include kids camps weeklong intensive boot camp training sessions for high school girls and yearlong trainingin programming design and entrepreneurship for young women from underprivileged backgrounds followed by placements in different tech organisations at the end of the programme Since young women trained by AkiraChix have gone on to get internships jobs or to start their own businesses AkiraChix nd The programmes raise the capabilities of these young women equip them with employability skills open up opportunities of possible career in ICTs and bring them into contact with highly skilled women ICT mentors all of which are in themselves huge opportunities However the intensive effort required to reach this relatively small number ofgirls over several years makes such an initiative difficult to sustain or implement at scale Other challenges and criticisms also exist One is that the widespread fascination with digital tech nologies risks that the focus and analysis becomes mediacentric losing sight of the bigger picture ofthe contexts and meanings of children lives within which digital media may or may not find their place and contribute constructively or otherwise This problem seems particularly evident in thefield of health and information seeking where the convenience and confidentiality of digitalmedia is particularly appealing to practitioners There is little doubt that adolescents want such infor mation Global Kids Online found that around fifth of to yearolds and of to year olds in South Africa looked for health information online at least every week Byrne et al But initiatives often promote narrow adultdefined forms of information rather than responding to adolescents interests or they provide generic access to the internet with little check on the types of information gleaned in terms of accuracy or relevance No wonder they chart lessthanhoped for success while their target audience sought the required information from peers parents or the morefamiliar mass media Livingstone et al in press Relatedly and keen to benefit from the fact that adolescents access to digital media is growing significantly in many low and middleincome contexts Mitchell et al recommend not an eitheror approach but rather that education programs delivered facetoface such as in school or religious settings could be enhanced with SMS reminders and additional information about program content An example of programme designed for flexible delivery is the World Starts with Me WSWM computerbased interactive sex education programme developed in for secondary school students aged in Uganda and implemented in over schools since Rijsdijk It aims to promote sexual and reproductive health by educating young people to make independent decisions about sexual practice The programme supports the efforts of Ugandan educators to inte grate ICTs into the school curriculum Evaluation of the WSWM programme involved quasiexperimental design including pre and posttest intervention and comparison groups and was conducted using schoolbased selfadministered questionnaire Outcomes varied based on the way the WSWM programme was implemented at each school but overall students from the intervention group who had considerable exposure to the programme completed at least the first out of lessons had better outcomes on several indicators including awareness of pregnancy pre vention methods intention to delay sexual intercourse and to use condoms and selfefficacy indealing with sexual violence Yet the evaluation also found that the limited number of available working computers sporadic lack of electricity and insufficient teacher training were major implementation problems faced by most of the schools In her ethnographic account of children in Western India Banaji urges research policy and practice to look behind the hitech fetish Only then too can one recognise how children use and value or not ICTs in practice for instance seeing that knowledge and skills in apps games scams jokes and memes constitutes one evident facet of media literacy Banaji OtherDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE qualitative studies tell similar story of creative reappropriations in the face of highpressure norma tive expectations from adults regarding children ICT use PathakShelat and DeShano explain how Indian families in rural areas and small towns experience clash of expectations between how digital media technologies are promoted and how they are experienced our emphasis Thus while families explicitly associate digital media with work educational opportunity andinformation this perception seems to come from the media and other external sources rather than directly from personal experiences with new media technologies because when they talked about their own practices playing games on computers and cell phones was the most frequent response This is not entirely matter of children preferences digital technologies are marketed as youth oriented technologies giving power to youth youth agency but we observed web of school and par ental controls surrounding their use Other studies critique the tendency to underestimate children capabilities to negotiate and navi gate digital environments For instance systematic formal educational initiatives to teach younger children about the complex risks and opportunities in digital environments in lowincome communities of the Global South are few and far between and significantly hampered by norms governing the discussion of sexuality pornography and other sexual content with children Further focusing on young people living in marginalised contexts in South America Europe and Australia Snyder andPrinsloo argue that subtle cultural disjunctures between school home and community often mean that knowledge and experiences about ICTs health or sexuality gained in one site donot transfer or are not recognised and valued in another Yet Cook et al challenge the wide spread tendency to infantilise children as incapable of understanding the risks involved their study showing that not only are some children aware of the risks but they deal with them on daily basis Conclusion ICTs are often intended and even assumed to act as an enabler or facilitator of equity and partici pation but often they do not Given the paucity of evidence about adolescents digital media uses between and among regions in LMICs international development policy informing programmes tar geting adolescent capability development need to be critical and cautious in how ICTs are harnessed to promote child rights While ICTD interventions have some limited successes eg ITU Sachs et al their engagement with issues pertaining to adolescent capability development and child rights is particularly wanting Our review suggests problematic divergence between what adult stakeholders expect children particularly those from lowincome areas to do with digital media andwith what they actually do as well as between development interventions assumptions about the potential and the realities of many children access to skills with and interest in ICTrelated interven tions Too often interventions have tended to focus on the supply side while ignoring dynamics thatstructure demand and use and therefore condition practices they thereby risk perpetuating hierar chies of gender and agerelated power In this article we have tried to highlight promising studies of interventions respecting the good intentions of many of those working to improve children lives through the use of ICTs However few if any cases show evidence of longlasting social change even though it is crucial that development interventions are sustained beyond the rudimentary achievement of programme objectives in order tolearn the significance of ICTs for adolescents capability development especially their potential to con tribute towards social justice by expanding the equity participation and agency of young people indetermining their futures Most worryingly some fear that through the fascination with ICTs the global corporate players through new gadgets schemes and advertisement as well as the government through rhetoric and development schemes are raising normative expectations to be part of global markets that are impossible to meet in their rural location with infrastructural limitations PathakShelat and DeShano emphasis added BANAJI ET ALIn one study to yearold students in urban Brazil concluded that they had grown up under the inuence of the Internet and under the logic of cultural consumption associated with it Ferraretto et al This logic was barely addressed in the literature reviewed and yet ICTs are usually proprie tary leaving programme providers dependent on the terms of service of the ICT provider cost data security user privacy commercial exploitation of data etc Further ICTs are regulated by statebodies either directly or through corporate franchises and quite often in restrictive manner involving censorship and can be used as tools for surveillance Chattopadhyay It is therefore important to ask critical questions in the face of growing enthusiasm for the use of ICTs within program matic interventions in LMICs Banaji Kleine Hollow and Poveda We have shown how maximising the positive potential of ICTs requires grounded understanding of how technology interacts with social political and economic factors important for developmentBanaji World Bank While this conclusion is already established in the field of ICTD it seems that each generation of researchers policymakers and practitioners must rediscover suchfindings if they and we are to sustain critical lens on the muchhyped and yet reasonably hopedfor prospects for new forms of online learning and information for the exposure or protection of children from online risks and in relation to children rights to participate in community leisure civic and political realms Livingstone and Bulger Such efforts must include attention to the lifeworld and its preexisting inequalities also to find participatory strategies to recognise the particular meanings and practices that shape the lives and concerns of the children who are after all the intended beneficiaries Given the continued innovation and adoption of ICTs and digital mediaacross LMICs it is no longer possible to conceive of development without ICTs At the same time the role of ICTs needs to be critically assessed rather than assumed and evaluated alongside the nondigital development opportunities relevant to children and their life contexts Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE

study examined the cyberbullying experience and coping manners of adolescents in urban Vietnam and explored the mediating effect of different support to the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues Methods crosssectional study was performed on students at four secondary schools Cyberbullying experience coping strategies psychological problems and family peer and teacher support were obtained Structural equation modeling was utilized to determine the mediating effects of different support on associations between cyberbullying and psychological problems Results There were and of students who reported that they experienced and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last months respectively Among the victims only tried to stop the perpetrators Meanwhile the majority of observers belonged to the Intervene group who tried to report cyberbullying acts or help victims Family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among adolescents Conclusion The month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban adolescents aged was low However current coping strategies against cyberbullying were not sufficient Family support is an important factor that should be considered for designing interventions to mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health of adolescents Keywords cyberbullying social support psychological health structural equation modeling adolescentNgo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article INTRODUCTION Cyberbullying has been welldocumented as global public health problem Cyberbullying includes acts such as posting publicly available information on the Internet being called or receiving messages that threaten or being harassed on the Internet and others Patchin and Hinduja Compared with traditional bullying cyberbullying can occur every time and everywhere and the identity of the perpetrator may not be disclosed Patchin and Hinduja Therefore cyberbullying may be more frequent and have more serious consequences for the victim Studies show that cyberbullying significantly affects adolescents such as increasing the risk of depression anxiety and suicidal ideation Klomek et al Schneider et al Nixon Fahy et al Pabian and Vandebosch Yuchang et al as well as causing physical and psychosomatic problems such as difficulty sleeping headache and loss of appetite Beckman et al Schneider et al SchultzeKrumbholz et al Kowalski and Limber Cyberbullying is also associated with the onset of substance use traditional and cyberbullying perpetration and delinquency Mitchell et al Wong et al Chan and Wong Estvez et al These consequences have been observed in all perpetrators victims and observers of cyberbullying Beckman et al Wong et al Panumaporn et al Cyberbullying among adolescents is prevalent phenomenon across nations prior taxonomic review showed that to of adolescents experienced cyberbullying at least once in their lifetime Aboujaoude et al and this rate tends to increase with increasing Internet and social media accessibility Hamm et al In the United States the rate of adolescents who were victims of cyberbullying was from to Selkie et al study conducted in seven European countries showed that of adolescents aged years were victims of cyberbullying Athanasiou et al In the Asian region review in Chinese populations revealed different prevalence of cyberbullying victimization in adolescents ranging at in mainland China in Taiwan and in Hong Kong Chan and Wong In Korea adolescents were cyberbullying victims Lee and Shin Coping strategies when having cyberbullying experience may vary and can be classified into four groups directly reacting against cyberbullying acts such as retaliation or constructive feedback ignoring the cyberbullying behaviors such as avoidance or doing nothing seeking support from other sources such as parents friends or teachers and utilizing technological solutions such as blocking senders Perren et al study in Hong Kong indicated that older male adolescents were more likely to have an active approach to cope with cyberbullying such as informing to adults parents or teachers while adolescents having limited experience with their schools tended to have avoid eg ignore the cyberbullying behaviors approaches Chan and Wong Another study in Czech adolescents found that technological strategies were the most common following by avoidance and finding support Machackova et al The proliferation of cyberbullying requires accelerating efforts to explore approaches to prevent and mitigate its consequences Global studies showed that social support is an essential component in protecting adolescents from the consequences of traditional bullying KochenderferLadd and Skinner Davidson and Demaray Rothon et al Social support refers to instrumental support such as providing the victim with helpful solutions or resources or emotional support such as spiritual encouragement belongingness or value recognition House et al Kerres Malecki and Kilpatrick Demaray In literature many studies have shown that family and friends support can play an important role in protecting adolescents from becoming victims of cyberbullying Price and Dalgleish Fanti et al Hellfeldt et al In addition adolescents who are of school age can get help from teachers Previous research has shown that victims and perpetrators of cyberviolence possibly knew each other at school and parents friends and teachers are important sources of information and support for teens dealing with cyberbullying Slonje and Smith Although many studies showed that social support helps to prevent cyberbullying among adolescents its effectiveness in minimizing the psychological consequences of cyberbullying among victims or observers has been in debate An earlier study found that support from friends alone was effective in reducing psychological problems among victims of cyberbullying Holt and Espelage Another research found that both support from family and friends played an important role in preventing victims from the mental consequences of cyberbullying Rothon et al These results concluded that social support held the potential for minimizing the cyberbullyingrelated psychological problems in youths However the evidence for this effect in different population groups such as victims perpetrators or observers is limited In Vietnam evidence about cyberbullying among adolescents as well as the impact of social support on cyberbullying is currently limited Only one previous study was conducted on adolescents and youths aged in Hanoi Vietnam to measure the cyberbullying experience in these groups Chi et al By using the modified Patchin and Hindujas scale this study found that of sample had experienced cyberbullying at least once with being called by names as the most typical form Chi et al The common responses to cyberbullies included ignoring cyberbullying behaviors and not telling family or teacher Chi et al To date none of the studies were conducted about the mediation effect of social support on mental disorders in adolescents who were victims or observers of cyberbullying Therefore our study was conducted to examine the experience of adolescents aged in urban Vietnam determine how they coped with this issue and explore the preventive mediation effect of social support to the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues MATERIALS AND METHODS Theoretical Framework In this study we employed stress buffering hypothesis Cohen and Wills which perceived social support that could mediate the relationship between stressors ie cyberbullying in Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article this case and their negative consequences ie mental problems In other words higher level of social support could more weaken this relationship Cohen and Wills in their study suggested that social support could diminish peoples perceptions about the threat of given stressors or offer coping options or other necessary resources to individuals against the stressors Cohen and Wills Via literature review we hypothesized that support from family peers and teachers might play buffering role in mediating the effect of cyberbullying experience on the mental health of adolescents Holt and Espelage Rothon et al Therefore we examined the direct effect of cyberbullying experience on adolescents mental health as well as the indirect effect of social support in buffering relationships between cyberbullying and mental health Study Design Data of this paper were collected through crosssectional study conducted in Hanoi Vietnam from January to September Four secondary schools were randomly selected in this study from list of secondary schools in Hanoi The school principal and teachers were approached by the research team and informed of the research content The questionnaire used in this study was submitted to them for approval before implementing data collection Participants included students aged years attending four selected secondary schools and they as well as their parents and teachers agreed to be enrolled in the study This study used formula to estimate population proportion with specified relative precision to calculate the essential sample with according to previous research in Hanoi Vietnam Chi et al confidence level relative precision The sample size needed for school was students or students schools An additional sample size was added to prevent participants from dropout or nonresponse resulting in students or students per school being invited to respond to questions about cyberbullying multistage sampling method was applied First the research team randomly selected two classes in each grade of each school resulting in classes being selected for the sample Next in these classes students were randomly selected to participate in the cyberbullying survey There were students who did not agree to participate leading to total of students response rate of These students along with their parents or guardians were provided written informed consent with brief information about research objectives eligible criteria research process and benefits and requirements during study participation This research protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of Hanoi Medical University Code NCSHDDDDHYHN Data Collection and Measurement Students participating in this study were asked to complete an anonymous survey questionnaire The research team directly distributed the questionnaires to students During the survey parents teachers and unselected students did not present at the site of the survey to avoid their influence on the participants responses Each student spent min completing the questionnaire structured questionnaire was used for this study The content of the questionnaire was developed under the guidance of child violence experts The questionnaires were pretested on adolescents to ensure understandability expression and logic which aimed to avoid misunderstanding or confusion to study participants Variables Cyberbullying ExperienceBystander and Coping Strategies In this study we used the Cyberbullying Test instrument to identify the individuals experience and observation of cyberbullying Garaigordobil Originally this tool asked participants to answer items about cyberbullying acts in three roles items per role perpetrators victims and observers Examples of items in the instrument included the following Have they ever sent you offensive and insulting messages by cellphone or Internet Have you ever received offensive and insulting calls on your cellphone or by Internet Skype Have you ever been assaulted to tape the assault and hang it on the Internet Each question had four options about from never to always In this study we used only two parts of the instrument for victims and observers or bystanders Moreover in the pilot we observed that it was difficult for our participants ie secondary school students to respond to the questions with these four options Thus we decided to ask them serial of yesno questions to determine whether they experienced cyberbullying acts as victims and observers in the last months This recall duration was applied to minimize the potential recall bias Participants were categorized into Cyberbullying experience or Cyberbullying observation if they reported yes for at least one cyberbullying act The Cronbach alpha values of Cyberbullying experience and Cyberbullying observation items were and respectively In this study for people experiencing cyberbullying we asked them to recall the impacts of these cyberbullying acts coping strategies against cyberbullying supporters when facing cyberbullying and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying experience Meanwhile for those ever observing cyberbullying acts participants were asked to report their reactions toward these behaviors These reactions were classified into three groups Intervene Ignore and Join in Intervene included oppose acts of cyberbullying try to help or comfort the victim and report online violence to people able to help the victim eg teachers and parents Ignore included leaving cyberspace Join in included Encouraging cyberbullying behaviors and Enjoys cyberbullying acts and wants to learn more but does not participate or promote publicly In addition we asked them to explain the reasons if they did not report the observed cyberbullying acts We also asked all participants to express their attitude toward cyberbullying by asking them question What extend do you agree or Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article disagree with cyberbullying The students rated their attitude with an point Likert scale from Totally agree to Total disagree Psychological Problems To evaluate the psychological problems the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale Items DASS was utilized This instrument included items regarding depression seven items range score anxiety seven items range score and stress symptoms seven items range score in the last days Le et al Examples of items in the instrument included the following found it hard to wind down stress domain was aware of dryness of my mouth anxiety domain and could not seem to experience any positive feeling at all depression domain Lovibond and Lovibond Participants responded to each item on fourpoint Likert scale from Did not apply to me at all to Applied to me very much or most of the time Le et al higher score in each part indicated higher severity of this psychological problem The Vietnamese version of this instrument had been validated elsewhere Le et al The Cronbach alpha of this instrument was Social Support Support from family two items peer two items and teacher three items was measured by using seven items as below My parents do not understand me or care about my feelings My parents do not listen to me or do not pay attention to the problems have My classmates are very friendly My classmates respect me and listen to my opinion My teachers help me when Im sad or having problems My teachers take care of me and support me in achieving the best results My teachers respect me and listen to me Students rated each item on fivepoint Likert scale from Totally disagree to Totally agree The score of each domain was computed by dividing the total scores of items in this domain by the number of items Scores of questions and were reversed before computing the score of parental support The score of each domain was from to with greater score meaning higher level of support The Cronbach alpha of this instrument was Sociodemographic Characteristics In this part we collected data about age gender malefemale and type of family nuclearmultigenerationsothers Statistical Analysis pvalue of was used to detect statistical significance Stata software was used for analyzing data listwise deletion approach was applied to handle missing data Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables of interest Statistical tests including chisquare and MannWhitney tests were used to examine the difference between sociodemographic characteristics social support cyberbullying attitude and psychological problems between cyberbullying experience nonexperience and cyberbullying observationnonobservation Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with cyberbullying experience yes no model and cyberbullying observation yes no model Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics age gender and types of the family support from familypeerteachers cyberbullying attitude cyberbullying experience for model and cyberbullying observation for model Moreover among those ever observing cyberbullying acts in the last months we performed the multivariate logistic regression models to determine factors that were related to Intervene yes no model or Ignore yes no model behaviors Independent variables for models and included sociodemographic characteristics age gender and types of the family support from familypeerteachers cyberbullying attitude and cyberbullying experience We did not perform the regression analysis for the Join in outcome because only nine students had these behaviors which might not be large enough sample size for the analysis Finally structural equation mold SEM was used to examine the mediation effects of family peer and teacher support on the relationships between cyberbullying experience observation and psychological problems The roles of cyberbullying cyberbullying experience and observation were coded as binary variables yes no while the depression anxiety and stress variables were treated as continuous variables The mean and varianceadjusted maximum likelihood

model fits Kline Ethical Approval Given highly sensitive information collected from adolescents we performed the following actions to ensure the rights and benefits of participants First we provided an information package to students and their parentsguardians before the survey implementation This package had detailed information about the purposes of the study study designs eligible criteria rights and benefits of study participants It was also emphasized in the information package that the participation of students was voluntary and that relationships between the students and teachersschools would not be affected in any way if they did not participate in the survey No individual data were collected to protect students privacy thus it was impossible to reidentify the participants based on the current dataset Students and their caregivers were also informed that they could skip any questions that they felt uncomfortable or they could withdraw from the study at any time We offered the helpline in the Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article information package for students who needed help to address cyberbullyingrelated issues Contacts of the principal investigators and coordinators of this study were provided to answer all questions raised about the study RESULTS The characteristics of participants are presented in Table Among secondary school students the mean age was SD years There were and of students reporting that they experienced and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last months respectively No difference was observed regarding gender age and type of family between those with and without cyberbullying experience Meanwhile the rate of females in the cyberbullying observation group was significantly higher than that in the noncyberbullying observation significant age difference was also found between these two groups Table also reveals that people who experienced cyberbullying showed significantly lower levels of attitude against cyberbullying and lower levels of perceived family and teachers support but higher level of perceived peer support and higher depression anxiety and stress scores than did those not experiencing cyberbullying These differences were also observed between participants with and without cyberbullying observation except for the level of cyberbullying attitude Figure illustrates the month rate of each cyberbullying behavior in terms of experience and observation Stole password to prevent access to blogemail was the most common behavior when and of participants ever experienced and observed this behavior respectively Received offensive insulting messages on cellphoneby Internet and Slandered through the Internet telling lies or spread rumors were the second and third most common acts Among participants experiencing cyberbullying as victims Table indicates that of students felt anxiety and fear and did not want to be close

students were classified into Ignore and Join in categories respectively one student could do more than one act toward cyberbullying observation Being afraid of having limited use of the Internet if they reported cyberbullying behaviors thinking that adults did not understand or believe and thinking that adults could not do anything for victims were the three most popular reasons for not reporting the cyberbullying behaviors among observers Table Table shows associated factors with cyberbullying experience and observation Cyberbullying experience was only found to be associated with cyberbullying observation OR CI Meanwhile being female and of higher age were positively related to cyberbullying observation whereas having higher level of support from family OR CI was negatively associated with the cyberbullying observation In regression analysis only cyberbullying attitude was found to be associated with intervene behaviors OR CI Participants having higher level of peer support were more likely to ignore the cyberbullying acts OR CI while those having higher level of teacher support were less likely to ignore these acts OR CI Table The SEM is illustrated in Figure The goodnessoffit indices were acceptable with RMSEA CFI and SRMR The model shows that only cyberbullying experience showed significantly positive direct effect on psychological problems The cyberbullying experience group was significantly related to family and peer support while the cyberbullying observation group was only significantly associated with family support Only family support showed to be negatively associated with psychological problems whereas peer and teacher support showed positive relations with psychological problems Table determines the mediation or indirect effects of different types of support For both cyberbullying experience and observation only family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among our participants Regarding cyberbullying experience the indirect effect of family support accounted for of the total effect and of the direct effect Meanwhile regarding cyberbullying observation this indirect effect accounted for of the total effect and of the direct effect DISCUSSION Our study contributed to the current literature about the experience and coping strategies of adolescents toward cyberbullying and the potential effects of different support to mitigate the psychological consequence of cyberbullying Our study suggested low rate of cyberbullying experience and observation in secondary school students as well as high risk of psychological problems among those experiencing cyberbullying Moreover family support was an important protective source and helped mediate the relationship between cyberbullying and psychological problems The rate of adolescents involving in cyberbullying as victims over the past months in our study was low according to the selfreport information from the participants This rate was much lower than previous research in Hanoi Vietnam which showed that of adolescents aged were FIGURE The month rates

Our result was equivalent to previous study in the United States with of adolescents who studied grades to being bullied online in the past months Kowalski and Limber Overall the estimated prevalence of cyberbullying varied significantly between different studies and countries due to the difference of cyberbullying definition time frame and methods of measurement Berne et al Selkie et al Brochado et al which results in the problematic study comparisons Indeed using the Cyberbullying Test which was valid scale to measure cyberbullying Garaigordobil was advantageous to our study compared with other prior research This measure contains cyberbullying behaviors enabling us to capture more comprehensive aspects that participants might suffer or observe during the recall period than other previous studies Hellfeldt et al Livazovi and Ham Chi et al Panumaporn et al Notably our results showed that though the impact of cyberbullying was significant the proportion of participants taking specific actions against cyberbullying was not high In addition to the impact on academic performance there was high proportion of individuals who experienced cyberbullying suffering the negative psychological effects such as anxiety fear and even suicidal thoughts This was similar to previous studies showing the serious consequences of cyberbullying on the lives of victims Schneider et al Nixon Nonetheless the findings showed that only nearly of the victims tried to stop this act of the perpetration and TABLE Impacts reactions supporters and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying

Psychology April Volume Article tried to leave cyberspace We also observed that victims only shared with friends about the issue of cyberbullying but did not share it with parents or teachers The most common reasons for not sharing with parents or teachers were because the adolescents were afraid that the adults did not believe or the adults will not be able to do anything for the adolescents Another reason was that the victims wanted to solve this problem themselves In previous study in Vietnam it was found that ignoring this behavior and blocking the perpetrators account were the two most common measures and respectively Chi et al However problems caused by cyberbullying were not easy to deal with because these behaviors can occur at any time and can reach large numbers of audiences in short period of time Patchin and Hinduja causing feeling of stigma and isolation among victims Bossler et al Burton et al and in turn worsening the consequences of cyberbullying Therefore equipping adolescents with appropriate coping strategies against cyberbullying is essential and should be prioritized in school and family Our study also examined the rate of cyberbullying observers among adolescents and identified how they reacted to cyberbullying behaviors As expected we found that the majority of observers were in the group Intervene who responded to the cyberbullying acts by reporting these behaviors or helping victims This result was similar to the study in Thailand showing that most observers belonged to the Intervene group Panumaporn et al However our study was different from study results in Belgium where the authors show that most adolescents belonged to the Ignore group when observing cyberbullying behaviors Van Cleemput et al We assumed that the cultural factors might be attributable to this difference While the Western culture highlighted individualism the Asian culture emphasized the role of collectivism which might motivate them to help others when they faced problems Sittichai and Smith On the other hand similar to the victim group the main reasons that participants in the observer group did not report violent cyber behavior included being afraid of limited Internet use and believing that adults were unable to address this issue This result suggested huge gap in the relationships between parentteacher and adolescents especially among cyberbullying victims or observers Interestingly results of the multivariate models indicated an opposite trend between peer and teacher support when higher peer and teacher support were associated with higher and lower likelihoods of being Ignore people This phenomenon could be justified that adolescents peers might not perceive this issue as problem as adults did ie parents and teachers Slonje and Smith TABLE Associated factors with different types of cyberbullying observation CharacteristicsIntervene Ignore OR CI OR CI Gender female vs malea Age vs yearsa years years years Type of family

covariance between mediators and dependent variables Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article Moreover even when youth perceived the impacts of cyberbullying they could not provide adequate support due to the lack of knowledge and resource needed Therefore instead of recommending interventions on the issue they were more likely to advise to ignore cyberbullying behaviors It should be noted that the attitude against cyberbullying played an important role among adolescents in the Intervene group This finding was consistent with previous studies on both cyberbullying and traditional bullying ang and Kim Panumaporn et al Therefore campaigns to motivate adolescents to intervene in cyberbullying are critical to diminish this behavior and its impacts The findings of this study echoed previous evidence showing that cyberbullying experience was associated with psychological problems Beckman et al Schneider et al Nixon Wong et al Panumaporn et al Moreover our study underlined the protective mediation effects of category support on the association between cyberbullying experience and observation with psychological issues Unlike traditional bullying where parent friend and teacher support helped to mitigate the impact of bullying acts on victims lives and mental health Price and Dalgleish Fanti et al Hellfeldt et al in our study friend and teacher support did not buffer against the psychological problems among cyberbullying victims andor observers In literature adolescents are concerned that sharing their experience with the teacher was an ineffective strategy Price and Dalgleish and reporting the problem to their parents could hinder their freedom in Internet use Hoff Dianne and Mitchell Sidney However in previous survey in Sweden parent and teacher support was found to buffer against depressive and anxiety symptoms in cyberbullying victims and bully victims Hellfeldt et al Another longitudinal study found that adolescents who were victims of cyberbullying had lower levels of depressive symptoms if they had family support Machmutow et al As discussed above we believed that parents could offer appropriate emotional support to help adolescents in controlling the psychological distress caused by cyberbullying behaviors Livazovi and Ham Moreover they may be more likely to perceive accurately the problem of cyberbullying while friends might not fully recognize the trouble of cyberbullying involvement resulting in the provision of inadequate support Slonje and Smith This result is critical since most of the victims in our study sought help from friends rather than their parents Thus parents should be proactive in building strong bond with their children Nixon Slonje et al On the other hand our finding partially affirmed that peer support might not be the best focus to address cyberbullying and its consequence Hellfeldt et al However further longitudinal studies should be performed to test the effect of peer support on buffering the relationship between cyberbullying and psychological impairment in different contexts The current study indicated several implications First educational campaigns should be performed to raise adolescents parents and teachers awareness and attitude toward cyberbullying motivating them to become involved to intervene and prevent cyberbullying behaviors The contents of these interventions should include knowledge and practices on cyberbullying communication and Internet use skills and prosocial behaviors empathy and coping strategies with cyberbullying Hutson et al Regular training sessions should be performed to help adolescents in acquiring skills and abilities to actively cope with cyberbullying help other victims and prevent them from joining in cyberbullying Previous studies found that active strategies to cope with cyberbullying victimization were effective to address the cyberbullyingrelated issues Ybarra et al Riebel et al Chan and Wong Second according to the study leaders in schools and communities should implement activities that increase parents roles in addressing cyberbullying and its consequences among adolescents Positive parentchildren relationships could encourage adolescents to find support when dealing with difficult situations Chan and Chui Chan and Wong Finally given that cyberbullying is an emerging problem but school regulations for this issue do not exist in Vietnam current policies should consider this type of bullying and its impact especially among adolescents Interpretation of the study results should be done cautiously with the following limitations First given that cyberbullying is sensitive issue relying on only selfreports from participants may underestimate the actual rates of cyberbullying in adolescents In literature approaches that used information from multiple sources such as peers and teachers would be recommended Brochado et al Further studies that involve multiple reporters to measure the prevalence of TABLE Standardized indirect effects of cyberbullying experience and observation on psychological wellbeing outcomes via

which limited our ability to establish the causal associations Thus conclusions about the associations and effects in this study cannot be definitely drawn Future studies should use longitudinal designs to investigate the influence of cyberbullying and social support on psychological wellbeing in middle school adolescents Third the rate of cyberbullying experience and observation was low resulting in small sample size for statistical tests Moreover we used modified instrument to measure cyberbullying experience rather than use the original one which might underestimate or overestimate the rate of cyberbullying victimization and observation Finally other characteristics such as traditional bullying exposure the Internet or social media use and cyberbullying perpetration were not fully investigated These factors were found to be associated with cyberbullying victimization in previous work Beckman et al Athanasiou et al Chi et al Hence further studies should be elucidated to measure these relationships between these factors and cyberbullying experience CONCLUSION Our study suggested that the month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban adolescents aged in Vietnam was low However current coping strategies against cyberbullying in this group were not sufficient Family support is an important factor that should be considered for designing interventions to mitigate the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health of adolescentsDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by

cutting risks Practitioner reflections The new CORE classification Conclusion References About the authors Key insights Risk classifications guide practitioner and policymakers in their work and in communicat ing their results EU Kids Onlines Cs of online risk is used widely as classic point of reference for stakeholders internationally It is time ly to update th is classification given the variation in its use the emerging risks in the digital environment and our growing understandi ng of childrens experiences of online risks of harm As part of our CORE work on theories and concepts we reviewed existing classifications of online risk to childre by UNICEF the International Telecommunication Union ITU Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Council of Europe CoE and others consulted European practitioners of child internet safety from Insafe and INHOPE to build on their experience This report propose new CORE Cs classification recognis ing that online risks arise when child engages with andor is exposed to potentially harmful CONTENT experiences andor is targeted by potentially harmful CONTACT witnesses participates in andor is victim of potentially harmful CONDUCT is party to andor exploited by potentially harmful CONT RACT The Cs classification also distinguishes between aggressive sexual and value risks as this is helpful in retaining balanced view of the range of risks that children can encounter We note that risks to the values that shape See evidenceeuunderstanding children online theories concepts debates childhood and society are increasingly prominent In addition to the Cs the new CORE classification recognises im portant cross cutting risks notably to childrens privacy health and fair treatment Keeping in mind that childrens online opportunities are paramount and that host of individual and societal protective and vulnerability factor mediate between risk and harm we hope that the new classification is insightful for research policy and practice that contribute to realising childrens rights in relation to the digital environment UN Understanding online risk In the CORE roject our work on theory examines the key concepts that frame the field of research policy and practice The aim is to bring together diverse perspectives and interrogat their underlying assumptions in order to contribute to the collective ambition of understanding the experience and consequences of growing up in digital world comprehensive understanding of childrens engagement with the digital environment requires balanced consideration of both risks and opportunities recognising the full range of childrens rights in digital world UN Within this broader frame Livingstone isk is one of the key concepts identified for investigation by the CO RE Consortium and is the focus of this short report In fast changing digital eco system the nature of risk is continually evolving sometimes exposing children to emerging risks well before adults know how to mitigate them Risk has been defined as Uncertainty about and severity of the consequences or outcomes of an activity with respect to something that humans value Aven Renn The clash of possibly severe outcomes with human values inevitably raises concerns and the digital environment in which children are often very active adds heightened uncertainties into the mix No wonder that online risk is one of the most contested areas of childrens digital experience concerning many stakeholders and posing pressing challenges for research policy and practice These challenges include understanding childrens exposure to different types of online risk and how regulatory technica social or individual interventions can be effective in developing strategies to cope with risk mitigating or minimising any harmful consequences From the outset it is vital to distinguish between online risk and harm Conceptually risk is the probability of harm while harm ncludes range of negative consequences to the childs emotional physical or mental wellbeing Livingstone For example xposure to pornograp hy poses risk to child but it is not certainty that there will be harmful consequences Harmful outcomes depend on the nature of the risk whether it is more probable or more severe in its consequences and on the design regulation and managem ent of the digital environment privacy settings moderation services access to helplines etc They also depend on the child and their circumstances because what is problematic for one child might not be so for another Such differences reflect societal factors norms and regulations political priorities economic investments education and family systems etc as well as the individual protective or vulnerability factors that differentiate among children including age gender digital skills resilience personality socio economic situation and family context It is paramount that our understanding of online risk is evidence based prioritising robust research conducted with and in relation to children Our understanding should also be informed by childrens own views and experiences nd those of practitioners responding to child online risk and safety problems rather than assuming or imposing vision grounded in adult normative expectations or popular anxieties See OECD UNICEF Smahel et al In this short report we critically examine how online risks have been classified in order to develop better understanding of childrens online experiences and their potential or actual real world consequences After discovering how existing classifications have been adopted in the work of various stakeholders we ropose new classification of online risk to children to meet the challenges of changing digital environment and the practical imperatives of policymakers and practitioners This new classification highlights four dimensions related to the positioning of the child in the digital environment and shows how these intersect with three dimensions regarding he nature of the risk It also recognises the cross cutting dimension of priva cy discrimination and health risks The Cs of online risk comprehensive classification of online risk was proposed by EU Kids Online in Staksrud Livingstone Staksrud et al funded by the European Commissions EC Safer Internet Programme now the Better Internet for Kids Programme It was originally developed to answer the often asked questions regarding What risks are we talking about and Why should policymakers take action It sought to disaggregate risks and raise awareness of the wide array of risks affecting children including but also going beyond the main emphasis on pornography grooming and cyberbullying that dominated the agenda at the time Taking ch ildcentred and evidence based approach EU Kids Onlines classification identified two dimensions of risk the positioning of the child in relation to the digital environment as recipient of mass produced content participant in adult initiated activ ity and an actor in peer topeer exchanges and the nature of the risk aggressive sexual values and commercial This classification took strongly child centred approach It highlighted that children should not be treated as solely vulnerable victim or protected at all costs including at the cost of their online opportunities The idea was to recognise childrens agency as actors in digital world but without holding them unduly responsible for risks online or especially for the at times harmfu effects on their wellbeing or that of others As will be seen later the revised CORE classification recognises the childs perspective and agency but also the power of societal and digital infrastructures to shape the childs experiences and outcomes The original classification was tested using data from EU Kids Onlines two wave European survey with internet using children aged conducted in Livingstone et al and Smahel et al It has been incorporated into the Global Kids Online model and its surveys of children in countries Livingstone et al Taken together these projects have generated cross nationally comparable data from children in more than countries providing an evidence base to inform olicy priorities and establishing baseline against which socio technical change and policy interventions have been positively evaluated Morton et al Figure shows the classification with exemplar risks in the cells Figure The EU Kids Online original Cs classification of online risks Livingstone et al Adopting the classification The Cs classification became classic point of reference since much cited by the policymakers and practitioners working to maximise childrens online opportunities and minimise their risks of harm To trace its use we conducted search for mention of co ntent contact and conduct risks online and among reports and documents by relevant organisations We found that the Cs of online risk See also and In keeping with EU Kids Onlines commitment to balance risks and opportunities parallel classification was proposed for opportunities although it was little noted Livingstone et al have informed the work of range of key actors albeit not always with direct source including UNICEF the European Commission EC the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development the International Telecommunication Union ITU the ICT Coalition ONeill Croll and ot hers ONeill Dinh Green et al One use is to classify the plethora of problems reported by children who call helplines Supported by the ECs Better Internet for Kids programme the We did not find classifications in the work of ECPAT Intern ational the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights FRA GSMA INTERPOL Child Helpline International CHI CEO Coalition European Network of Ombudspersons for Children or UNESCO Content Receiving mass produced content Contact Participating in adult initiated online

copyright infringement work of the Safer Internet Centres SICs provide helplines across Europe Helplines provide information advice and assistance to children young people and parents on how to deal with harmful content harmful contact such as grooming and harmful conduct such as cyberbullying or sexting ONeill Dinh Relatedly the ECs self regulatory initiative the Alliance to better protect minors online called on businesses to tackle existing and emerging risks that children and young people face online including harmful content eg violent or sexually exploitative content harmful conduct eg cyberbullying and harmful contact eg sexual extortion UNICEFs flagship annual publication The state of the worlds children focused in on children in digital world and also used the classic EU Kids Online classification recognising that while it is vital to address online risk some degree of risky opportunities can afford children the chance to learn and become resilient depending on their maturity and circ umstances UNICEF Undoubtedly wh at has proved most valuable are the definitions of the Cs as illustrated in Figure It is noteworthy that most uses of the classification refer to just one of the two dimensions the child in relation to the digital environment and discuss content contact and conduct Thus they often omit the second dimension the nature of the risk aggressive sexual values commercial and perhaps in consequence the exemplar risks highlighted and researched by EU ids Online among other researchers Stoilova et al Without the second dimension however commercial risks became somewhat neglected leading to calls for revision of the original risk classification given rising evidence of the importance of com mercial online risks to children See single marketenalliance better protect minors online This framing is problematic in eliding risk and harm because it is precisely in the gap between them that Figure The Cs of online risk UNICEF Content risks Where child is exposed to unwelcome and inappropriate content This can include sexual pornographic and violent images some forms of advertising racist discriminatory or hate speech material and websites advocating unhealthy or dangerous behaviours such as self harm suicide and anorexia Contact risks Where child participates in risky communication such as with an adult seekin inappropriate contact or soliciting child for sexual purposes or with individuals attempting to radicalize child or persuade him or her to take part in unhealthy or dangerous behaviours Conduct risks Where child behaves in way that contributes to risky content or contact This may include children writing or creating hateful materials about other children inciting racism or posting or distributing sexual images including material they have produced themselves Contract risks the fourth Digital technologies have developed significantly since the original typology was created and the online ecology affords new opportunities but also new risks for children particularly in relation to commercialisation and datafication To respo nd to these changes and to reintroduce more prominently commercial dimensions of online risk fourth variously labelled contract commercial or consumer has been suggested In redevelopment of the EU Kids Online classification the fo urth is conceived not as commercial risk but as contract risk that directly or indirectly connects children and digital providers This reflects the dramatic rise in the commercialisation of childrens personal data arguably resulting in the atafication of children themselves Mascheroni With the Cs EU Kids Online has proposed not only classification but also digital ecosystem of online risks in which children are variously positioned and in which the different risks interact in increasingly many empowering and safety interventions focus their efforts eg digital literacy complex ways This informed the CoEs Handbook for policy makers on the rights of the child in the digital environment Livingstone et al as shown in Figure Figur The EU Kids Online Cs model of online risks Livingstone et al adapted from Hasebrink et al Most bviously contract risks arise when the child accepts including unintentionally involuntarily or unknowingly the Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions of commercial provider of digital products or services Such contractual arrangements can bind the child in ways that may be unfair or exploitative or which pose security or safety or privacy risks of which they may be unaware or over which they have little control or means of escape Related risks arise because of the data processed by public and third sector organisations as well as through host of public private partnerships Stoilova et al The Broadband Commission observes that children have no way of understanding what they were signing up for when they installed the app or logged on to the site Services and obligations that are designed for adults must be age limited so that children cannot sign up to them without guardians permi ssion While online children also risk spending money without permission of parents or caregivers and having their data harvested This data may be given by or taken rom childrens digital activities as well as inferred or assumed about them or about others connected with them through profiling operations The fast growing data ecosystem now provides an infrastructure not only for commercial transactions impacting children but also for the digital Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development In short ontract risks arise when children use digital services as well as when they are impacted by digital transactions conducted by others in other ways eg through institutional uses of digitised databases that include the childs profile or algorithmic processing of personal data relating to the child or others connected with them see ONeill Rights Foundation In naming this category of risks contract risks we note the legal difficulties linked to contracts involving children as well as the fact that users of all ages can be unaware of the contractual nature of their relationship with digital service providers We also note that the contract that occasions risk may not be with the child but with their parent or school or indeed between service provider and third par ty among other possibilities in the complex digital ecosystem Nonetheless on balance we propose that the label contract is helpful in pointing to mix of marketing data processing and other contractual risks that merit specific attention most products and services that afford content contact and content risks The result is that the types of risk are increasingly interlinked as are the solutions eg data protection regulation can prevent some interperson al or social forms of online harm Stoilova et al but not all of which are commercial and some of which are still emerging Cross cutting risk Even with the fourth there are dimensions of online risk that might not fit neatly into these categories UNICEFs State of the Worlds Children participatory workshops UNICEF revealed that children report concerns about risks that do not fit well with the classification such as technological problems and parental intrusion in their online lives In its draft Recommendation on children in the digital environment the OECD observe that the nature of existing risks have significantly changed and number of new risks have emerged Technological developments and new business models have contributed to the change in digital devices and services which in themselves have also contributed to the evolving risk landscape OECD Do we need to go beyond the Cs and add new and cross cutting elements Recognising that digital service providers need to know which risks are of greatest concern so that they can innovate in safety by design and building on multi stakeholder consultation Rights Foundation the OECD recently propose that some risks are seen as cross cutting in nature such as those related to privacy advanced technological features eg Internet of Things IoTs artificial intelligence AI biometrics predictive analytics health and wellbeing Note that the ECD builds on the EU Kids Online classification although it defines the fourth as consumer risks The second dimension of the figure lists risk manifestations or examples of ways in which children might encounter potential harms online although it does not organise them further This is shown in Figure Figure Children in the digital environment revised typology of risks OECD The OECDs proposed category of consumer risks includes four manifestations marketing risks commercial profiling risks financial risks and security risks Practitioner re flections To discover how practitioners working in the field of child online protection classify risks and whether they consider that revisions to the Cs are needed in October we conducted an online workshop with members from the Insafe and INHOPE networ ks from over countries The consultation sought to Identify familiar and emerging online risks affecting children across Europe and to see whether these are common across or specific to different contexts or countries Consider whether classifications of online risk are adopted in practice and useful and if so what purpose they serve and what the strengths and shortcomings of the avail able classifications are Insafe and INHOPE members contributed series of reflections on the risk classification and its possible development After lively discussion there was widespread agreement that risk classifications are useful for practitio ners Practical purposes of the classification of online risks include Identifying the range and diversity of risks including identifying emerging risks Making comparisons and capturing trends across risks and across timecontexts Systematically ommunicating results and priorities to expert policymaker and lay audiences Highlighting the need for resources budget and training Classifying the types of risks reported via input from helpline and complaints mechanisms Targeting planning interventions and awareness raising campaigns See Mapping evidence to risk categories and identifying evidence gaps In practice some organisations will always generate their own classifications for instance when working bottom up from helpline calls to track local trends while others will not need to classify risks in their work Overall however he consensus was that it is valuable to have shared approach to answering questions such as What do we mean by online risks and Which risks are emerging or Which should be prioritised and How is my country doing compared with others For researchers the classification is useful in providing common terminology by which to report and review findings and for mapping where evidence is sufficient and where there are pressing gaps As for practitioners researchers also repeatedly find that risks intersect bridging offline and online experiences and compounding adverse outcomes for the more disadvantaged or vulnerable children But we can only report such complex relations among risks if we first identify those risks so the classification remains useful It was also generally agreed that to be useful risk classifications should prioritise Flexibility the lassification has to be broad and flexible so that new risks can be added when needed or when we need to refer to different groups of children or address stakeholders Clarity the risks should not overlap with each other and they should map readily onto the reports from children or practitioners about problematic experiences Recognising that this is complex domain the call was also to avoid oversimplification recognising hybrid threats that could be classified in more than one domain eg identity theft could be linked to contact conduct or contract risks depending on the circumstances online pressures relating to body image can have both sexual and value dimensions see Figure Examples to be readily understood and applicable to the practical work including real For detailed findings see Livingstone et al world examples in the cells of the classification table is important While it is recognised that the examples provided cannot be comprehensive they should map onto the actual problems reported by children or encountered by practitioners They should also resonate with audiences parents policymakers etc when riskrelated work is made public Two structural changes to the online risk classification were recommended Inclusion of the fourth this is needed and it was widely thought that the term contract is more inclusive than commercial or consumer risk in recognising that risks can arise when the child is party to contract with public and third sector organisations as well as commercial bodies especi ally with the prevalence of public private partnerships in complex digital ecologies Cross cutting risk the recognition of risks that cut across several or all of the Cs was also agreed although much debated Again this arises because of the complexity of the digital ecology and also because risks are interrelated and they can affect multiple dimensions of childs experience The effects on childrens health eg health risks linked to excessive screen use were raised by multiple contributors So too were the array of privacy risks experienced by children online many of which arise from data processing and so can be classified as contract risks but that can also arise in relation to content and through interpersonal contact and conduct Even fter discussion different views remained regarding Country specificities should the classification differ by country and context to recognise different legal regulatory and cultural factors that shape childrens exposure to risk It emerged however that pan European commonalities are more notable In this regard the risk manifestations in the OECD classification were found to be difficult to interpret both because they are abstract and yet overlappin and because the legalillegal boundary varies by countrypolicy context Relatedly the idea of cross cutting technological risks was not taken up possibly because all online risks have technological dimension or because the examples given in the OEC typology than country differences and are often more worth of attention given the benefits of sharing insights and best practice across countries and in working towards common solutions Extending the classificati on with fifth range of possibilities was suggested including that the classification could identify the consequences of risk such as health or wellbeing or other abuses of childrens rights andor distinguish illegal criminal from harmful risks However his discussion threw up the many differences not only by country eg in which online risks are illegal but also organisational sector type and purpose It was agreed therefore that although Cs may be useful on occasion this should be left to each country or organisation to determine for itself The new CORE classification We propose new essence classification of online risk learning from the above experiences and from interview with the CORE Consortium Risk is recognised as relational emerging from the dynamic interaction between the childs agency and the agency of others opera ting in the digital environment including through automated processing such as algorithms and as embedded in digital design and operation The Cs of online risks of harm are content contact conduct and contract risks as explained in Figure The classification has the merit we suggest of order and clarity We believe it to be fit for purpose recognising the multiple positions that children may occupy in an increasin gly significant and powerful digital environment including continually emerging online risks It is orderly and clear and it provides practitioner tested exemplars of key risks including those that have become familiar in recent decades and those that re emerging and new The introduction of contract risks as the fourth incorporates risks previously labelled commercial are linked most closely to contract risks or again to privacy or discrimination This framing of the Cs overcomes the previous potential for misunderstanding eg the implication that child may participate willingly in contact abuse or hat they are mere receivers of content rather than also actively seeking it Figure The CORE Cs of online risk Content risks The child engages with or is exposed to potentially harmful content This can be violent gory content hateful or extremist content as well as pornographic or sexualised content that may be illegal or harmful including by being age inappropriate Content online may be mass produced or user generated including by the small fry and it may be shared widely or not Contact risks The child experiences or is targeted by contact in potentially harmful adult initiated interaction and the adult may be known to the child or not This can be related to harassment including sexual stalking hateful behaviour sexual grooming sextortion or the generation of sharing of child sexual abuse material Conduct risks The child witnesses participates in or is victim of potentially harmful conduct such as bullying hateful peer activity trolling sexual messages pressures or harassment or is exposed to potentially harmful user communities eg selfharm or eating disorders ypically conduct risks arise from interactions among peers although not necessarily of equal status Contract risks The child is party to andor exploited by potentially harmful contract or commercial interests gambling exploitative or age inappropriate marketing etc This can be mediated by the automated algorithmic processing of data This include risks linked to ill designed or insecure digital services that leave the child open to identity theft fraud or scams It also includes contracts made between other parties involving child trafficking streaming child sexual abuse Cross cutting risk Some risks relate to most or all of the four categories and can have multiple manifestations across the different dimensions aggressive sexual values These include online risks relating to privacy physical or mental health inequalities or discrimination Hence the new classification now distinguishes three dimensions in relation to the nature of the risk aggressive sexual and values It is noteworthy that interest in value related isks eg misinformation radicalisation self harm algorithm bias has grown in recent years now attracting as much attention and anxiety as aggressive and sexual risks Finally the new classification recognise three types of cross cutting risk to childrens privacy their health and their fair treatment and equal inclusion in digital world These risks we suggest can occur in relation to any and all of content contact conduct and contract risks see Figure Importantly it should be noted that although some risks are particularly cross cutting in nature many of the online risks to children intersect and hybridise depending on the circumstances and more so as the digital environment evolves Hence the classification and its exemplars ar offered here as way of organising and opening up further investigation rather than as implying that risks are simple or disconnected Figure The CORE classification of online risk to children Conclusions We hope this new classification serves constructive purpose for researchers policymakers and practitioners working to minimise or manage online risks to children rights and wellbeing The classification offers the foundations of better understanding of online risk to children and it can underpin the work of different stakeholders Policymakers can use it to identify what risks matter and why what evidence supports them and how they fit within or fall outside existing regulatory frameworks Parents and the public can use it to learn what can be done about the different risks and what to look out for Researchers can use the categorization to develop comprehensive definitions and We sought to future proof the classification by describing risks in broad terms rather than focusing on very particular or time bound risks although we measures of online risk and to organise compare and report findings Practitioners can use it in their work to classify and understand the problems reported to them to communicate with different audiences and to manage and bid for resources The classification will need careful framing for different udiences so more work needs to be done on implementation Moreover as society and the digital environment continues to change the classification will need revisiting in the future It should be noted that our focus has been on children online leaving others to attend to the important risks of not being online digital exclusion struggles for access and connectivity lack of digital skills and so forth We did not focus on the factors that account for wheth er when or why some children are more likely to encounter particular online risks than others nor the protective or vulnerability factors whether appreciate they arouse concern eg sharenting influencers deep fakes viral challenges concerning children their circumstances the digital environment or its regulation and management that account for harmful outcomes Again this has been amply addressed elsewhere It is also important to see risk as only one of the dimensions of childrens online experiences alongside opportunities and among many factors that intersect to influence childrens outcomes Livingstone Indeed while the digital environment affords children range of risks it also offers many opportunities to benefit and this merits parallel analysis If society becomes overprotective it can inadver tently undermin the very opportunities for which society provides children with internet access We will address the Cs of online opportunities in our future work OECD

has negative impact on sleep daytime functioning and mental health in adolescents We examine the prospective associations between digital media use and subsequent suicidal and non suicidal self harm Methods Shandong Adolescent ehavior Health Cohort SABHC is longitudinal study of adolescent behavior and health in Shandong China Participants included for the analysis were SABHC adolescents who were initially assessed in and were reassessed in selfadministered structured questionnaire was used to measure digital media use ie television watching internet use and mobile phone use on weekdays and at the weekend mental heal th and self harm Results Multi variable logistic regression analyses howed that daily internet use hours on weekdays odd ratio OR confidence interval CI and hours at the

daily mobile phone use hours on weekdays OR CI and hours at the weekend OR CI were associated with increased risk of recurrent nonsuicidal self injury Limitations All data were selfreported and had no information about digital media consumption Conclusions Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be significant risk factor of selfharm suggesting that limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial to reduce risk of self harm Key words Digital media suicide attempt selfinjury adolescents cohort study Introduction Selfharm refers to intentional self poisoning or self injury irrespective of type of motive or the extent of suicidal intent Hawton et al including suicide attempt and nonsuicidal selfinjury NSSI Selfharm among you th is prevalent with to of adolescents having attempted suicide or afflicted selfharm Hawton et al Kann et al Liu et al Although most selfharms are low in lethality they are associated with clinical and functional impairment and are significant predictor of future elfharm and suicide Gould et al Hawton et al It is therefore essential to identify modifiable risk factors to develop effective intervention programs for youth self harm prevention In the modern society digital media transmitted over the internet computer network mobile smart phone tablet and or television TV has become an essential source or communication socialization and education Internet use in the world has increased considerably over the past few decades especially among youth Kaess et al According to Per Research Center of teens in the US report going online daily including who say they go online almost constantly Lenhart et al Digital media use has mixed effect on pediatric population well being with evidence of increased self esteem and perceived social support alongside harmful effects such as increased exposure to graphic content cyber bullying and risk of developing online addictive behaviors Best et al Kaess et al Tonioni et al Excessive digital media use may have detrimental impact on adolescents psychosocial development and mental health Kaess et al school performance Liu et al sleep disturbances and multiple risk taking behaviors such as disordered eating and substance abuse Levenson et al Park et al High profile cases of cyber bullying and suicide over the past decade ester et al and reports of suicide clusters facilitated by social media Robertson et al have caused an increas ed attention to better understand the association between internet use and self harm suicide Recent studies have demonstrated significant associations between pathological internet use or nternet addition and self injury Lam et al and suicidal behaviors Kaess et al Lin et al Marchant et al It has also been reported that rates of internet use were higher among adolescents who self harm than their peers who not use the internet as much Daine et al study examined the social dynamics surrounding media reporting on suicide in suicide prone community Poplar Grove USA with an enduring adolescent suicide problem and found that suicide deaths that were covered by digital media triggered significant cognitive dissonance which may generate opportunities for peer role modeling of suicide Mueller Celebrity suicides that generate large reaction from users on Twitter can also increase suicide isk Ueda These findings suggest that excessive digital media use may be significant risk factor of selfharm recent review of the association between social media internet us and suicide attempts in adolescent includes nine cross sectional studies published between and and concludes an independent association between problem atic use of social mediainternet and suicide attempts in young people Sedgwick et al However to our best knowledge most previous studies are cross sectional so that the direction of causality if any remains unclear as such further evaluation through longitudinal studies is warranted and they have been focused on pathological internet use or internet addiction Lam et al Liu et al Park et al and their findings are not consisten To address th ese limitations we conducted longitudinal study ith large community sample of adolescents in China to examine the prospective association between digital media use television watching internet use and mobile phone use and subsequent selfharm including suicid attempt and NSSI over year follow up Method Parti cipants and procedure Shandong Adolescent Behavior Health Cohort SABHC is longitudinal study of adolescent behavior and health in Shandong China total of adolescent students participated in SABHC baseline survey Detailed sampling and data collection have been published elsewhere Liu et al Liu et al In brief participants were sampled from middle and high schools in counties of Shan dong province with consideration of representativeness of the schools across the counties prior study collaboration convenience and budget for at least waves of data collection The study was approved by the research ethics committee of School of Public Health at Shandong University China We obtained permission to conduct the study from all the target schools and informed consent from participants before baseline survey Figure shows SABHC study flow chart The aseline survey was conducted amongst th graders in Nov ember December of Liu et al Liu et al Liu et al selfadministered structured adolescent health questionnaire AHQ was used to assess suicid attempt NSSI mental health digital media use and psychosocial factors Chen et al Liu Liu and Tein Liu et al Trained public health workers or master public health students administered AHQ to participants in their classrooms during regular school hours Before filling out the questionnaire participants were instructed to read the instructions carefully and were informed that the survey was anonymous their responses were blind to teachers and their participation was voluntary without any penalties for nonparticipation It took about minutes to complete the survey All th and th graders were not followed up because they were preparing for high school and college entrance exams respectively According to our study design th th and th graders at baseline were resurveyed one year later in The final analysis included participants who were initially assessed in and were reassessed in Measures Selfharm Selfharm was assessed using questions about suicide attempt and NSSI Suicide attempt was measured with the question Have you ever tried to kill yourself in your whole life for lifetime suicide attempt and Did you try to kill yourself during the past year for last year suicide attempt NSSI was measured with the question Have you ever tried to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself in your whole life for lifetime NSSI and Did you ever try to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself during the past year for last year NSSI If respondent answered yes on the question he or she was considered to have the behavior These questions have been used in our studie to assess suicidal behav ior and NSSI in Chinese adolescents Liu Liu et al Digital media use Three types of digital media exposure at baseline were surveyed including TV watching internet use for entertainment or ideo game playing and mobile phone use Respondents were asked the number of hours per day on weekdays and at the weekend that they had spent using each media in the past month which should be very different in weekdays at school and weekdays at home and may have diff erent effects on sleep and mental health Liu et al The following questions were specifically asked On an average school day how many hours do you watch TV On an average school day how many hours do you use the internet for entertainment or video game playing On an average school day how many hou rs do you use mobile smart phone On an average weekend day how many hou rs do you watch TV On an average weekend day how many hours do you use the nternet for entertainment or video game playing and On an average weekend day how many hours do you use mobile smart phone Covariates The following covariates were selected in the current study based on literature Hawton et al Kaess et al Liu and Buysse Liu et al andor if pvalues were less than in the univariate analysis for the ssociation between digital media use and self harm Lauw et al Anxio usdepressive symptoms The Chinese Youth Self Report YSR of Achenbachs Child Behavior Checklist was used to measure anxiousdepressive symptoms Achenbach Liu et al The YSR anxiousdepressed subscale consists of items that are rated on point scale not true somewhat or sometimes true and very true or often true The Cronbach alpha with the present sample was for the subscale For the present study items concerning elfharm were dropped when calculating the subscale score Impulsiveness The Eysenck impulsiveness scale was used to assess adolescents impulsivity Eysenck et al The scale is composed of items with modified response format from never or rarely sometimes often to always Example items are Do you often get into trouble because you do things without thinking and Are you an impulsive person The Cronbach alpha was with the current sample Other dolescent covariates were age gender chronic disease insomnia symptoms cigarette smoking and alcohol use Family factors included father education primary school middle school high school professional school or college or above family history of suicide or attempt selfreported family economic status excellent good fair poor or very poor and interparental relationship excellent good fair poor or separateddivorced died Statistical analysis Based on the history of selfharm at baseline and at year follow up participants were categorized into groups never self harm baseline self harm only recurrent self harm and new selfharm Chisquare tests were used to examine the differences in self harm across digital media use TV internet and mobile phone on weekdays and at the weekend Univariate and multi ple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between individual media use on weekdays and at the weekend and recurrent self harm and new self harm respec tively In the multivaria ble models covariates were adolescent factors anxiousdepressive symptoms impulsiveness age gender chronic disease insomnia symptoms cigarette smoking and alcohol use and family factors father education family history suicide or attempt self reported family economic status and inter parental relationship Primary statistical analyses were performed or selfharm Secondary analyses were performed for suicide attempt and NSSI respectively All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version Armonk NY IBM Corp Results Sample characteristics Of the thth graders and th graders who participated in the baseline survey were re survey ed at the year follow up and were included for the analysis The primary reason for loss to follow up was that some participants went to different classesschools However aseline adolescent and family demographic characteristics including age gender smoking drinking family history of suicid father education and occupation and family economic status were similar between participants who were re survey ed and those who were expected to be re survey ed all Of the participants mean age was years SD at baseline and half were males Table presents detailed sample characteristics at baseline Digital media use in Chinese adolescents On weekdays the mean time of digital media use at baseline was hours min day for watching TV hours min for internet use and hours min for mobile phone use respectively At the weekend the time of digital media use at baseline substantially increased hours min day for watching TV hours min for internet use and hours min for mobile phone use In other words watch ed TV used nternet and used mobile phone for at least hour day on weekdays watch ed TV used internet and used mobile at least hoursday at the weekend Table Selfharm at year follow up At year follow up participants engaged in self harm with for new self harm and for recurrent self harm As shown in Figure the incidence rates of new NSSI and suicide attempt ere and respectively and the incidence rates of recurrent NSSI and suicide attempt ere and respectively Associations between digital media use and self harm Table shows baseline digital media use on weekdays and at the weekend by selfharm On weekday internet use and mobile phone use were positively associated with self harm both At the weekend watching TV internet use and mobile phone use were all positi vely associated with self harm all Table shows crude and adjusted odds ratios of selfharm at year follow up associated with each digital media use Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that internet use hoursday on weekdays OR CI and hours day at the weekend OR CI mobile phone use hours day on weekends OR CI and hoursday at the weekend OR CI were significantly associated with increased risk of recurrent self harm after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates For NSSI baseline internet use hoursday on weekdays OR CI and hours day at the weekend OR CI mobile phone use hours day on weekdays OR CI and hours day OR CI and hoursday at the weekend OR CI were significantly as sociated with increased risk of recurrent NSSI after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates Table For suicide attempt baseline internet use hoursday on weekdays and hoursday at the weekend were significantly associated with fold increase in risk of new suicide attempt OR CI and an approximately fold increase in risk of recurrent suicide attempt OR CI respectively Watching TV at baseline was not independently associated with either subsequent NSSI or suicide attempt Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study to prospectively examine the association between digital media use and subsequent selfharm in large sample of Chinese adolescents Our major findings are internet use hoursday on weekdays and hours at the weekend were associated with an increase risk of recurrent self harm at year follow up after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates mobile phone use hoursday on weekends were associated with increased risk of recurrent self harm or suicide attempt internet use hours day on weekdays and hoursday at the weekend were associated with increase risks for new suicide attempt and recurrent suicide attempt respectively On average in American yearolds spent hours minutes per day on screen whilst yearolds spent hours minutes per day on screen Rideout According to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health children and young people from the UK aged years old on average spent hours on computer laptop tablet hours on their phone and hours watching TV on typical day Viner and Firth Compared to Western adolescents the averages of minutes of TV internet use and mobile phone use are lower in adolescents in China possibly due to authoritarian parenting health homework restriction or limited permit of using mobile phone at school and at home Despite relatively shorter time of digital media use in Chinese adolescents than Western peers our findings support the positive association of self harmsuicidal behavior with internet use particularly with internet addiction high levels of internet use and websites with self harm or suicide content Marchant et al Although the mechanis between digital media use and self harm is not yet clear there are several potential explanations First excessive digital media use andor internet addiction are associated with mental health problems such as depression hostility aggressive behaviors and ADHD symptoms Ko et al Lin et al Yen et al Liu et al all of which can increase risk of selfharm Liu et al Liu et al Second internet use or ocial media exposure may cause cyber bullying or peer harassment leading to depression decreased self worth hopelessness and loneliness all of which are precursors to suicidal behavio Hinduja et al John et al OKeeffe et al For example recent study of cyber victimizat ion across seven European countries found that cyberbullying is linked to higher use of social network sites in adolescents aged years Athanasiou et al In addition the feeling of lack and dissatisfaction when scrolling through newsfeed often results from constant lifesuccess comparisons eg comparing individuals true reality to their peers idealized eg perfectly Wechat or Instagr amed realitiesThese may result in having devastating consequences including self harm Third sleep insufficiency and sleep disturbance have been demonstrated to be associated with self harm Liu Liu and Buysse Liu et al Excessive digital media exposure may cause sleep loss and sleep and circadian rhythms disturbance Cain and Gradisar Chang et al Higuchi et al Fourth many adolescents may use the internet to look for information about sensitive top ics such as mental health and behavioral problems safe sexual practices or contraception and seek help online Collins et al Srivastava et al For example results suggest that there is substantial amount of sexual content in teen chat rooms both constructed by teens names utterances and present for teen users to be exposed to as observers Internet sites and activities that resemble chats may include discussions among participants in online video games posted comments on YouTube and comments on social networking sites Collins et al Research has shown that having sexual screen name or talking with peo ple known only online about sex and using chat rooms were asso ciated with higher likelihood of selfharm Mitchell and Ybarra The content and veracity of information found online can be harmful such as information about painstress release via self scathe and how to injure self or suicide Belfort et al Viewing images and reading information about self harm in digital media can normalize self harming behavior and discourage seeking professional help Daine et al and pencil lead to physical self harm and suicidal ideation Patchin and Hinduja Fifth recurrent self harm or new suicide attempts can be prompted by viewing selfharm related stories in digital media Zahl and Hawton Furthermore excessive digital media use may cause fatigue and cognitive functioning impairment poor judgement and impulsive behavior all of which in turn can lead to suicidal and nonsuicidal self harm de Cates et al Liu et al Further research is warranted to examine the psychosocial pathways and biological mechanisms including mediators and moderators between digital media use and self ham in adolescents It is interesting to note that atching TV was not independently associated with subsequent self harm This difference may be due to the inherent nature of watching TV versus the use of internet or smart phones Watching TV does not require interacting with others whereas using the internet and smart phon es does eg cyber bullying constant lifesuccess comparisons On the other hand TV programs may be more educational entertain ing enjoyable and less violent and sexual than contents in the internet or website Clinical and public health implications In the technologically driven digital era the use of digital media will undoubtedly continue to rise In the of adults and of teens ages have access to the Internet and Facebook is currently the most commonly used online social network Lenhart et al Perrin According to the th Statistical Report on Internet Development in China the number of Chinese netize ns reached million mobile Internet users reached million and the percentage of Internet surfing via mobile was as high as CNNIC Thus mobile phone is not only used for phone call but it is more likely used for internet and social communication Although digital media can provide wealth of information and resources that teens can use to learn socialize and communicate with peers and maintain their own health digital media also has negative impact on teens psychosocial development and health OKeeffe et al Our study demonstrates that excessive digital media use as associated with subsequent self harm Preventive strategies for self harm and comprehensive intervention programs at school family clinical practice and society levels are warranted Intervention programs should be designed to prevent excessive digit al media use and internet addiction and to educate adolescents to avoid unhealthy violent and sexual information when surfing the internet to improve adolescents mental health and reduce risk of self harm In the pediatricadolescent medicine practice se tting clinicians should engage in assessment and discussion about internet use especially for adolescents who have engaged in suicidal and non suicidal self harm or have mental health issues Marchant et al Strengths and limitations This study has several strengths First this is longitudinal study to examine the prospective association between digital media use and selfharm in large sample of adolescents Second participants were sampled from multiple counties and schools to be representative of adolescent student in the region Third the response rate of was acceptably high Fourth weekday and weekend use of digital media was examined separately Fifth multiple adolescent and family variables were statistically controlled for when examining the association between digital media use and self harm Furthermore it is particular ly important to examine suicide attempt and NSSI respectively Despite the strengths of the study hese findings need to be interpreted with considering the following limitations First all data were collected by self report which may have led to biased reporting of selfharm and digital media use However given that many individuals who have suicid attempt or self injury may never seek medical help or result in hospitalization self report ed measures remain valuable source of information about elfharm Hawton et al Owens et al Objective measures of digital media use or diary are desirable but self reports remain as the typical method in large scale epidemiologic al studies Second data on the content of digital media consumption were not collected It is not possible to distinguish the effects of the contents such as cyberbullying sexting and selfinjury encouraging that may lead to self harm Third internet addiction or pathological internet use is prevalent and is associated with mental health problems and suicidal behavior in adolescents Lin et al Marchant et al Tonioni et al Although excessive digital media use is symptom of internet addiction the impact of excessive digital media use and internet addiction on mental health and selfharm may be different Fourth although this sample is large it may not be powerful enough for examining the association between digital media use and suicide attempt because the incidence of suicide attempt was low Conclusions Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be significant risk factor of self harm Our study suggests that limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial to reduce risk of self harm References Achenbach TM Manual for the Youth Self Report and Prole Department of Psychiatry University of Vermont

and boys working in the sector can be found in the accompanying report and crossborder sex work between India and Nepal is explored in this brief Overview While digital technology can help adolescents promote their rights access information and participate in society it also comes with risks of exploitation and abuse There is dearth of information on how adolescents working in the adult entertainment sector AES use the digital technology and its impact on their wellbeing This brief aims to bridge the information gap to safeguard vulnerable adolescents working in the AES from the negative impacts of technology use and help them to leverage technology for their protection The scale of the challenge Understanding how vulnerable adolescents use technology and what impact it will have on them will be important in helping build adolescents capabilities There is dearth of data on this for Nepal and this report aims to fill that gap by discussing technology use amongst adolescents working in the Adult Entertainment Sector sector where these adolescents are highly vulnerable to physical sexual economic and emotional violence Key recommendations NGOs should make more use of social media and digital technology to raise awareness among adolescents in Nepal about career counselling and risky jobs such as in the adult entertainment sector Digital literacy interventions for girls and boys in schools and for those working in the adult entertainment sector would reduce the risk of online exploitation Programmes should use social media to target hard to reach girls and boys in the AES and develop longterm cost effective interventions NGOsINGOs and the government should revise their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online sex work is captured

November Methodology This brief is based on data from life history indepth and key informant interviews as well as focus group discussions and case studies The participants included girls and boys engaged in the AES people of all ages from their home towns key informants and boys working in hotels India only The interviews took place in Nepali districts Sindhupalchowk as the home town Kathmandu Jhapa and Sunsari as destinations for work in the AES in Delhi in India for crossborder AES work and at points on the India Nepal border in Jhapa Associated AES websites social media Phulchowki Media and YouTube videos were also analysed The study follows the Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE conceptual framework which examines issues through context lens the family household community state and global contexts in which adolescents are situated see Box Literature review and background information Why is focus on adolescents important for Nepal Adolescents aged years make up of the worlds population UNICEF and of Nepals million citizens UNFPA There are male and female adolescents in Nepal NPCS and CBS Despite its young population citizens of working age currently outnumber dependents in Nepal due to falling birth and mortality rates This demographic dividend which began in has created window of opportunity for growth and sustainable development that will continue until Amin et al see Figure Nepal has one of the fastest ageing rates in the world and will be classed as an ageing society by and as an aged For details on the conceptual framework please refer to GAGE

labour force survey Kathmandu Nepal Planning Commission Secretariat and Central Bureau of Statistics Where people aged account for more than of the population Where people aged account for more than of the populationsociety by UNFPA There are currently enough people of working age to support the older population but this is expected to change over time In there were people of working age for every older person by this will halve to just people Amin et al The working population will also need to support early groups such as people with disabilities and vulnerable indigenous groups The government wants children and adolescents to be far more productive than todays adults by the time they enter the workforce ibid and views adolescents as central to the countrys development agenda national youth policy MoYS outlines why investment in the capabilities of adolescents is going to be critical in the coming decades adolescents alive today will need to be selfsufficient in retirement as the younger population will be too small to support them as life expectancies increase adolescents will need to plan for longer retirement Box The GAGE programme GAGE is nineyear mixed methods longitudinal research programme exploring gendered experiences of adolescents Information technology follows lives of adolescents in six focal countries in three regions of the world Ethiopia and Rwanda in Africa Bangladesh and Nepal in Asia and Jordan and Lebanon in the Middle East GAGE aims to fill the vast evidence gap on what works to enable poor adolescent girls to emerge from poverty and fasttrack social change for themselves their families and communities and their countries GAGEs research addresses two broad questions What do adolescents lives look like as they evolve over the second decade of life and how are their experiences gendered What impact have change strategies eg through programme interventions had on adolescents development adolescents will need to contribute more throughout their lives to support the ageing population the age group will become the largest group in years and will increase rapidly thereafter Technology use among adolescents in South Asia

Richardson et al Apart from three studies conducted recently by the Freedom Fund the use of digital technology in the AES and its implications for programming in Nepal has not been explored in any depth Most programmes fail to recognise the impact of digitalisation and focus solely on the establishmentbased AES Understanding technology use is critical to ensuring policies and programmes address issues faced by girls and boys in this rapidly changing industry Studies have included cases where children involved in the AES in Nepal have been asked to take photos and videos by their clients Sath Sath CWIN and ECPAT The internet also gives children access to pornographic images videos Additionally middleaged men send young girls and boys nude images on Facebook indicating online sexual exploitation of children Sath Sath The same study finds that menboys create fake profiles and online identities to establish relationships with girlswomen and lure them into sharing intimate pictures in order to blackmail them for money and sexResearch findings How adolescent girls use digital technology for work in the AES The majority of girls reported using social media for work although some prefer facetoface contact due to fears of online abuse Common apps include Facebook Messenger YouTube and imo while the use of Viber and Instagram according to key informants is increasing among young girls entering the sector There is general belief that being active on social media attracts more clients Little girl therefore share music videos photos and public posts to increase followers and while Facebook does not allow explicit content they also post sexual content Girls mostly own modern digital phones or smartphones laptops tablets and other devices were not commonly owned Apart from company profiles on Facebook girls post personal music videos photos TikTok videos or public group messages to increase followers Aside from those working in Dohari girls reported having two mobile phones and two Facebook accounts one for work and the other for family and nonwork friends Girls working in Dohari have only one account and the account is in their real name as they are on the lookout for contacts in the music industry to enhance their careers Girls who engage in the crossborder AES use Messenger to stay in contact with clients in India when they are working in Nepal Relationships with Nepali clients who travel for foreign employment are maintained through Facebook Viber and imo Maintaining contact ensures they send gifts and money remain loyal customers and engage their services when they come to Kathmandu While technology has not entirely dismantled establishmentbased AES venues it does offer alternative ways for girls to work and connect with clients This applies to commercial sex work as well Female migrants who travel for foreign employment also use apps that connect domestic workers to customers and integrate social sites like Facebook and Instagram to find clients for sex work have heard it internationally from journalists not in Nepal but there is an application called SALES where the middleman provides women domestic worker or even CSW to clients Key informant interview Kathmandu In their free time girls use the internet and their phones to keep in touch with family and friends back home as well as new friends in the urban areas where they work The girls watch videos on YouTube to improve their singing and dancing skills so that they can perform better at work They also reported making prank calls to random boys for funHow boys middlemen and employers use digital technology Boys who work in the AES do not have to attract clients as their jobs in the AES are usually in cooking security and administrative and financial work of the establishments Even if boys work as dancers and singers such as in Dohari and dance bars they are not pressured to bring in clients like the girls For details see our accompanying report They therefore use Facebook for personal communication Middlemen and employers use social media and digital technology to recruit new girls and move them between employers and clients including for crossborder international adult entertainment work The middlemen who supply girls communicate with them through social media to offer them jobs As they earn higher commission for younger girls they are constantly incentivised to recruit young girls into the industry They do this by adding village girls on Facebook communicating with them regularly and luring them to urban areas to work in the adult entertainment industry Employers also use digital technology to live stream videos and post photos of celebrities models and artists to attract girls and boys to work in the industry and clients to their establishments Employers use technology to move girls between cities in Nepal to respond to the demand for fresh faces After girl has worked in city for few months the middleman or employer will connect her to client middlemen and employers in another city and send for replacement All these arrangements happen over the phone The same process is used for moving girls to India We also found that girls will invite their friends if they find the work is good in new location After few months they often move together to work in another hub Internet access among girls and boys working in the AES Access to the internet is mixed Although WiFi is often free at their place of work boys and girls are usually only allowed to use the internet to contact clients As explained above boys are usually not engaged in entertaining clients but have security and management roles and as such their use of the internet is not seen as necessary for bringing in customers unlike for girls Hence employers are strict about not letting boys use internet during their working hours For details see our accompanying report When not at work girls and boys either buy monthly data pack or use passwords to the Wifi given by fellow tenants They cannot afford unlimited home internet subscriptions Dohari are duet houses where groups of girls and boys sit opposite to one another and the lead sings duets The songs are flirty and conversational and are composed during the performance itself as an answer to the remark of the opposite group who takes the lead in singingOur employer will scold us if we use phones during work Boys mostly go to the restroom to use internet and mobile Once inside the restroom they play games on the mobiles or use Facebook Focus group discussion with boys working in dance clubs Kathmandu How girls in the AES communicate with clients Initial client conversations commonly take place via text message while illiterate girls use Messenger and imo Once the girls have met the clients few times they will video call or chat with them over Messenger It is common practice to have two SIM cardsphone numbers one personal the other for business to avoid family members hearing about their work Yes am afraid that parents will know about me When my husband comes to Kathmandu change my number have been using two SIM cards one is for my clients and the other one is for my family Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Kathmandu Clients forcing girls to share their phone numbers is common challenge for girls Employers also encourage girls not to refuse the clients Girls only share work numbers with trusted clients that they have met few times in case they end up harassing them or being impolite If they do not trust them but they are good source of income regular pay well important to the employer girls will offer to call them instead of sharing their numbers The contacts of trustworthy clients are saved to avoid fake and unwanted calls and their other nonwork number that is used to contact family members is not shared with clients even if they ask for it Yes am afraid that parents will know about me When my husband comes to Kathmandu change my number have been using two SIM cards one is for my clients and the other one is for my family Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work KathmanduI give them my number if the person seems nice If the person and his behaviour dont look nice dont give Interviewer Can you identify by looking Can you know their behaviour How do you know Some people are softspoken while some are very aggressive The aggressive people try to force us while the people with good habit will obey us Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Girls working in the AES establishments and freelance primarily use Messenger to communicate with clients As with mobile phones initial contact happens via text Once comfortable the girls switch to voice and video calls Girls with low literacy use Messenger voice calls When communicating via social media clients often request sexualised video calls involving flirting or the performance of sexual acts or private pictures Most girls were cautious about accepting calls or sharing sensitive content unless it was with regular trusted client However those who are open to sharing such contents perceive this as necessary to keep clients happy for their own financial benefit They also feel it is good for work and part of their duty to employers to accept such requests He asks me to send pictures and then send He sends his picture We then start to comment on each others picture Interviewer Do you do video call Yes do Interviewer Doesnt he ask you to show him your private pictures No he has not asked for that yet Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work JhapaGirls entering the AES who have completed secondary school tend to use imo and Viber instead of Facebook They believe these apps are safer as clients cannot contact them unless they have their number On Facebook one does not necessarily need phone number to call However if the clients have their numbers they can call them over Viber or imo unless the girls block them use Facebook and there are numerous people calling me on Messenger So usually prefer Viber and imo because strangers cannot directly contact without my phone number On Facebook the boys sometimes sent pictures of their private parts Focus group discussion with girls engaged in freelance sex work Sunsari Use of imo groups The study finds that imo groups are location specific Kathmandu Girls and Boys and Rodhi ghar Butwal duet singing house Butwal interest based lets chat with couple Indonesian and Philippines girls and Dohari or random Everyones dear and fun group Anyone can join these groups Some are international while others have only local members Fake accounts were active in all the imo groups looked at review of the messages in group chats finds that conversations are flirty usually have double meanings and include the exchange of sensitive and sexual images Any user can start private chat from group chat Requests for private chats with girls are common It seems that clients make contact with girls through groups and then move on to private chats to negotiate sex meeting timeplace and payment The study finds that imo groups used by sex workers appear to have been created by girls as administrators However key informants were of the opinion that men or boyfriends who work as middlemen often open and operate the groups using girls name Invitations are sent to boys who in turn invite their male peers increasing the size of the group Typically an administrator will connect group to several other groups to expand their networks and connect users to new groups give them my number if the person seems nice Some people are softspoken while some are very aggressive The aggressive people try to force us while the people with good habit will obey us Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa usually prefer Viber and imo because strangers cannot directly contact without my phone number On Facebook the boys sometimes sent pictures of their private parts Focus group discussion with girls engaged in freelance sex work SunsariYouTube and online TV channels Our analysis of YouTube channels owned by girls working as freelance sex workers finds that girls upload video interviews photos and contact information to publicise their work and attract new clients Online TV channels such as Pulchowki Media also provide links to sex work The channel was closed and the owners arrested in for paying girls for highly sexualised scripted interviews The government has also closed YouTube channels which show restricted pornographic content Positive impacts of digital technology on sex workers For girls and boys working in Dohari social media gives them exposure and way to showcase their talent They join professional groups like National Dohari Association on Facebook to connect with people who might progress their careers They believe that this opens avenues to participate in Dohari programmes in other cities or abroad Similarly girls feel that YouTube has helped them improve their dancing and singing skills through watching new films helping them perform better at work In Jhapa we found freelance sex workers from relatively wealthy families who were influenced to enter into sex work through friendship circles used technology to exclude middlemen once they had established relationships with few welloff clients This gives them the freedom to choose clients as well as increase their earnings First the girls meet groups of clients through hotel staff or middlemen who work in hotels One they have worked with group they then make personal arrangements instead of using middleman with selected clients This can increase their income considerably as expressed by one girl make around lakhs in month if save Interviewer In one month You make that much money In the job Yes Interviewer Do you go around Figure typical active imo group linked to the AES by age group Source AnitaGhimireNISER Box Case study NGO uses social media to reach sex workers In Jhapa and Sunsari NGOs are updating their engagement strategies and using technology to reach girls who may otherwise have been excluded from programmes Here NGOs are using social media to target women and girls with health and awareness campaigns Sahara Nepal national NGO based in Jhapa that works with vulnerable groups noticed decrease in establishmentbased sex work that women and girls were soliciting in digital spaces In response they trained staff to identify and join social networks used by sex workers Once established within the networks they shared messages on sexual and reproductive health and rights alternative livelihoods programmes and HIV prevention and testing They start with web messages and subsequently provide information via webchat Sex workers who previously did not want to identify themselves now come to dropin centres Based on insights from joining these networks Sahara Nepal offered HIV testing in the community to enable sex workers to be discreetly tested in their own home This resulted in considerable increase in people accessing HIV tests and key informants feel that this has reduced the gap between the estimated and actual numbers of people living with HIV in Nepal No its through the contact So the thing is at first came in contact with one hotel where used to do business with people per day collected guest from that process Before they used give to the broker and to us Now with the same guest get or Interviewer How do you do it yourself Through your mobile Yes Interviewer How do you make contact Can you please tell me in detail tell them that am available outside the hotel They take my number and call me later Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Some girls have used mobile phone to escape trafficking forced sex work by calling the police According to key informants girls also use phones to call their contacts in NGOS for help if the police arrest them or treat them badly Negative impacts of the internet and technology on sex workers The study finds social media has several negative impacts particularly for girls According to key informants it widens girls social circles connecting them to new peer groups who lead them into sex work Similarly social media has made it cheaper and easier for middlemen to reach out and befriend girls assess their lives see if they are destitute and lure them into sex employment Social media makes it easier for men to track girls down online They find out their names in Dohari restaurants or dance bars when they perform on stage Unlike other girls performers in Dohari in particular use their real names on Facebook so that music producers can easily find them They subsequently feel forced to accept unsolicited friendship requests from men for the sake of business or pushed by their employers This opens up avenues for abuse by clients including unwelcome calls messages and pornographic content Similarly in adult entertainment venues girls are under pressure to attract as many clients as possible Even if they initially resist we found they end up sharing numbers and social contacts making them vulnerable to future online abuse Social media also gives clients continuous access to girls Respondents said that clients send pornographic videos out of working hours They feel pressured to respond even if they are not working and spending time with family Some girls were followed by clients even after they had left the sector to get married and eventually the marriages ended when the husbands and their families came to know about their previous engagement in the AES Access to technology has changed the needsaspirations of clients as well as the range of services they expect For example clients used to only have contact with girls inside establishments Now they expect them to always be available including during outofwork hours As girls are not allowed to use their phones at work this can create tension with regular clients who feel ignored They become hostile send vulgar images and videos or threaten them via instant messaging services We also found that social media increases the risk of exploitation from intimate partners Boyfriendshusbands use social media to coerce girls into sex work and extort their earnings According to the girls their partners open accounts in their name and negotiate with clients forcing them to provide the agreed services This can be under harsh conditions such as sex with multiple people at the same time Girls often only become aware of these accounts much later and thus also suffer the emotional violence of betrayal by people close to them Some girls feel freelance sex work and advertising online is dangerous and could risk exposure They find it safer working in establishments like hotels and using middlemen who offer protection and negotiate with clients on their behalf didnt give him my number even though he was regular customer If he wants to meet me he can come here but dont want to take risk meeting him outside If meet him at the hotel the owner is responsible if something happens to me but if meet him outside who will be responsible Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Girls who leave the sector are constantly afraid that their boyfriends or husbands will find out about their former work in the sex industry using the internet Key informants said that for single mothers the fear that their children and the parents of their childrens partners will find out about their sex work is strong motivation to change jobs Technology makes it possible to find out someones work history long after the event major fear among women who have left the sector Before they used give to the broker and to us Now with the same guest get or Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work JhapaThey women who have now left the sector say things like Now my daughter is married worked as sex worker so could bring them up What will happen to her life if her inlaws find that her mother was doing such work So left the sector Key informant interview Jhapa Boys who engage in substance abuse also use social media to exploit girls Key informants who helped file cases against violent partners shared that boys who abuse substances entice girls into relationships via social media to extort money for drugs They film sex videos with the girls and threaten to post them online or expose their work as sex workers boy made video of my friend He hasnt posted it on Facebook yet She was telling that he has clicked her pictures too Interviewer Why do they make videos What type of people are they Are they married people The drug addict boys make that videos Interviewer What do they do with the videos Do they blackmail girls or what do they do Yes They do so to get money Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa In Kathmandu girls working in establishments said that they are forced to share explicit images to attract clients to the establishment Those engaged in freelance sex work also send images to attract and keep clients In Jhapa and Sunsari where all respondents were freelance sex workers sharing pictures and doing video calls seems to be common This might make girls more vulnerable to abuse by middlemen and clients Some girls who have attended NGO trainings talk about their right to privacy and said they refuse to send videos to clients We can see therefore that girls have certain amount of power and control in their negotiation with clients However we are not sure if in practice girls can keep up with the pressure from clients and their own financial needs This is may be result of awareness training and female empowerment interventions We tell the clients in very straightforward manner that it is not the place to take selfies and we would not allow it After that if they want to spend time with us they can or else just leave client was taking video in his mobile Instantly went near him and seized his mobile then slapped him Indepth interview with girl engaged in sex work Jhapa client was taking video in his mobile Instantly went near him and seized his mobile then slapped him Indepth interview with girl engaged in sex work Jhapa Antitrafficking checkpoint at NepalIndia border NISERConclusions and recommendations As in other parts of the world technology is increasingly being used in Nepals adult entertainment industry and is changing its structure and how the AES is organised mediated particularly in relation to sex work All girls and boys working in the sector have access to mobile phones and the internet Facebook Messenger and imo are the most commonly used apps while younger and more educated workers increasingly use Viber Instagram and YouTube Technology has changed the nature of client interaction opened up new avenues for girls who are looking to enter the industry and has facilitated crossdistrict and cross border sex work It is also used outside of work to keep in touch with family and friends Girls typically have two SIM cards and two Facebook accounts to keep their families from finding out about their work The positive effects of technology for sex workers include the decreased influence of middlemen and greater decisionmaking powers and sometimes income Girls use technology to limit exposure to abusive clients and dangerous situations Programmes have also started using technology to target freelance sex workers who tend to be hard to reach On the negative side it has made the recruitment of adolescents into sex work cheaper and easier exposed adolescents working in the sector to pornography opened up avenues for middlemen and sexual partners to exploit girls and has made it difficult for girls to establish family life once they have left the industry The research also finds that technology pushes more adolescents into sex work as middlemen have increased access to girls online In addition girls and boys become curious about joining the sector after seeing online ads and live videos produced by adult venues Technology has not totally displaced establishmentbased sex work but it has expanded the scope of the adult entertainment sector and the volume of sex work Recommendations for donors civil society and NGOs include the following As technology use is widespread it can be leveraged to raise awareness of the risks associated with entering the adult entertainment sector and promote alternatives such as encouraging young girls to stay in education or take vocational training Digital literacy classes for girls and boys working in this sector as well as those in school would help raise awareness of the risk of exploitation online and promote safety precautions Programmes should use social media to target hard to reach sex workers who are at increased risk from clients middlemen and partners ie those who do not work in establishments are not unionised and are not linked to NGOs Lessons should be taken from programmes already engaged in such activities NGOsINGOs and the government should revise their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online sex work is captured Their interventions should also shift from targeting girls who work in establishments to account for the growing trend of girls working on freelance basis using personal contacts NGOs have expressed the need for longterm commitment and resources for successful reintegrationrehabilitation of former sex workers Technology could provide lowcost dissemination and programming solutions to maximise existing resources Current training programmes are overly focused on running beauty parlours and tailor shops These should be broadened to cover other skills such as hotel management driving and mobile phone and TV repairs to provide instant jobs and encourage young people to find alternatives to

['ERA Forum ARTICLE Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual exploitation and abuse Ethel Quayle Published online September The Authors Abstract European law has recognised the need for international crossdisciplinary collaboration to both identify locate and safeguard victims and prevent investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse OCSEA However there is evi dence that these crimes are continuing to increase and develop in step with techno logical advances Changing the behaviour of both perpetrators and victims is both challenging and expensive and there is little evidence of what works to reduce these crimes In this paper an argument is presented that changing the environments which support OCSEA is necessary if we are to detect and manage these crimes and more importantly prevent them Keywords Child sexual abuse Internet Affordances Prevention Introduction In report commissioned by the Council of Europe it was noted that Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse OCSEA does not respect national jurisdictions and that there was need for national and international crossdisciplinary collaboration to identify locate and safeguard victims and prevent investigate and prosecute these crimesIt was also recognise that any such cooperation would require the abil ity to respond to technological change and the corresponding changes in offender doings Perhaps the most important international law instrument dedicated to the Carr BE Quayle Professor of Forensic Clinical Psychology COPINE Research Clinical Health Psychology School of Health in Social Science University of Edinburgh Teviot Place Edinburgh UK Quayle rights of the child is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child CRCwith Article of the CRC requiring states to protect the child from all forms of sexualexploitation and sexual abuse It also makes specic reference to preventing the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials The OptionalProtocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children Child Prostitution and Child Pornography OPSC which followed covered many forms of sexual abuse and exploitationand specically referred to child pornography Article of the OPSC denes child pornography as any representation of whatever means of child engaged inreal or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts ofa child for primarily sexual purposes which provided wider denition that other international instruments Gillespie has argued that the region which has paid the most attention to the issue of child exploitation and in particular child sexual abuse mate rials CSAM is Europe with both the Council of Europe and the European Unionenacting international instruments that specically relate to the issue of the sexualexploitation of child including through child pornography The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Children against Sex ual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse CETS Lanzarote Convention and the Convention on Cybercrime CETS Budapest Convention provide comprehensivebenchmarks for both criminal law and procedural law standards to prevent and combat OCSEA They build on the international standards set out by the UNRC and the OPSC designed to protect children Articles to of the Lanzarote Convention and Article of the Budapest Convention set out the substantive

and communication technologies does not necessarily result in meeting in person It may remain online and nonetheless cause serious harm to the child The sexual offences which are intentionally perpetrated during an online meeting through communication technologies are often linked to the produc tion possession and transmission of child pornography pOf some importance here is that the assumption of harm which underpins most legislation largely relatesto the production of CSAM and until recently there has been little research that has explored the additional harms that come through the possession and distribution of this material In joint initiative by the EU and the United States in countries from around the world signed up to Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse On line They committed to key policy targets that aim at larger number of rescued victims more effective prosecution and an overall reduction in the number of childsexual abuse images available online The Global Alliance subsequently merged with the UKs WeProtect initiative to form the WeProtect Global Alliance to end child sexual exploitation online which brought together over governments global technology companies and leading international and nongovernmental organisa tions to protect children from sexual exploitation online The Global Alliance produced Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse CSEA Model National Response to provide guidelines and support on how to achievethe commitments The Model was intended to enable country to assess its current response and identify gaps prioritise national efforts to ll gaps and enhance inter national understanding and cooperation Its purpose is not prescriptive but aims to describe the capabilities needed for effective child protection highlight good practice from countries that are already delivering these capabilities and signpost organisa tions that can provide further guidance and support to countries seeking to develop or enhance their existing capability This tool is an interesting development as it bringstogether in an accessible format international frameworks as well as the substantial contributions made by organisations such as the United Nations ECPAT and ICMEC Scale of the problem In September the New York Times noted that in the previous year technol ogy companies reported to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Chil dren NCMEC over million photographs and videos of children being sexually abused This was more than twice the number reported in the previous yearThe Lanzarote

et al Pashang et al Keller MH Dance GJX Quayle article made reference to research completed in in collaboration with NCMEC which stated that online sharing platforms have accelerated the pace of CSAI child sexual abuse image content creation and distribution to breaking point whereNCMECs manual review capabilities and law enforcement investigations no longerscale This study used anonymised metadata associated with the NCMEC reports related to suspected CSAI that were received from March when NCMECs CyberTipline was created until September NCMEC reports come from the US public and many US ESPs electronic service providers and over million such reports occurred in the year approximately one millionper month compared to the reports in its rst ten years of operation While meaningful estimates of these crimes are highly problematic it has been argued that there are essentially four ways in which onlinefacilitated child sexualabuse OCSA can be measured by counting the number of offences committed thenumber of perpetrators the number of victims and the number of images that havebeen viewed downloaded and exchanged However these authors note that quan tication based on each of these four measures inevitably produces very different gures partly because they are attempting to count different aspects of OCSA However there is converging evidence that sexual imagerelated crimes against childrenare increasing although recent metaanalysis of the prevalence of online solicitationamongst youth one specic form of online child sexual abuse would indicate thatone in nine young people experience online solicitation although prevalence rateshave decreased over time Cybercrime Online child sexual abuse OCSA can be positioned as cybercrime in which technology plays role across broad spectrum of activities The denition of cybercrimehas been described as highly contentious as while many people agree that cybercrime exists they are not really clear what it is In this respect cybercrime has developed from earlier concepts of computer crime and ecrime and has broadened to cover many different forms of criminal activity The European Crime Prevention Networkhas also argued that there is current absence of any consistent deni tion and even within specic legislative documents cybercrime is used in differentways For example the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention uses broad criminalisation headings in its denition of cybercrime including offences against thecondentiality integrity and availability of computer data and systems computerrelated offences contentrelated offences and copyrightrelated offences Bursztein et al Wager et al Madigan et al Wall DS EUCPN Cybercrime theoretical overview of the growing digital threat In EUCPN Secretariat eds EUCPN Theoretical Paper Series European Crime Prevention Network Brussels Council of the European Union Convention on Cybercrime Budapest November Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual Many researchers and practitionersuse cyberdependent crime and cyber enabled crime or cyberassisted crime to classify different forms of cybercrime Atone end of the cybercrime spectrum there is cyberassisted crime in which the Inter net is used in its organisation and implementation but which would still take place if the Internet was removed eg potential offender using online social media to locatea child who is sexually assaulted offline At the other end of the spectrum is cyber dependent crime which exists because of the Internet such as DDoS distributed denialofservice attacks or spamming Differentiating between cyberassisted crimeand cyberenabled crime is at times very difcult but it would appear that the boundaries between cybercrime and traditional forms of crime have never been clear cut and are becoming increasingly blurred due to the level of hyperconnectivity in to days highly digitised and networked world The ubiquitous use of the Internet and smart mobile devices in peoples everyday lives the wide adoption of cloudbased services by industry and government and for example the advent of the Internet of Things IoT the Internet of Everything IoE and CyberPhysical Systems CPSshave led to the widely accepted belief that almost all criminal activities include somecyber elements As consequence digital forensics sometimes called cyber foren sics have become an essential part of almost all crime investigation processes for law enforcement around the world The United Nations Ofce on Drugs and Crimealso argues that there is no international denition of cybercrime or cyberattacks but while they use the cyber enabledcyberdependent dichotomy they add further speciccrime type online child sexual exploitation and abuse which includes abuse on the clear internet darknet forums and increasingly the exploitation of selfcreated imagery via extortion known as sextortion Quayle expanded these crimes to include the production dissemination and possession of child sexual abuse images known in many jurisdictions as child pornography online grooming of children for sexual purposes sexting sexual extortion of children sextortion revenge pornography commercial sexual exploitation of children exploitation of children through online prostitution and live streaming of sexual abuse Other authors have dened OCSA as sexual abuse of children involving force or enticement to take part in sexual activities where the online environment is involved at any stage of the offenceThis includes the production preparation consumption sharing dissemination or possession of childsexual abuse material and the solicitation of children for sexual purposes of childrensometimes called grooming whether or not it results or is intended to result in contact offence In high to middle income countries technology now mediates al most all human activities in some ways including those of children which makes McGuire Dowling Sarre et al Miraz et al EUROPOL Internet organised crime threat assessment Available at europaeuinternetorganisedcrimethreatassessment UNOCDC Cybercrime Available at Quayle MayChahal Palmer Quayle an analysis of clear distinctions between ofine and online abuse difcult Digital technologies are embedded in our everyday practices and form an intrinsic part of private and public experiences Yet whilst creating opportunities for children to act asreceivers participants and actors in the digital world the Internet also creates spaces of social interaction which hold the potential for exposure to online risks including sexual risks such as abuse and exploitation Cybercrime migration What is important to note is that while there is converging evidence in some coun tries to support falling rates of nontechnologymediated child victimisation includ ing child sexual abusethis does not appear to be the case in relation to some forms of OCSA It is easy to speculate as to whether there is relationship between the decrease in ofine CSA and an increase in OCSA and whether there has been migration from one to the other It is however much more difcult to evi dence this Probably the largest number of convictions for cyber sexual crimes relate to possession of CSAMand this may relate to the forensic evidence available for law enforcement to secure convictionMany if not all people charged with pos session will have permanent product of that crime available to law enforcementpictures and videos depicting child abuse and exploitation that meet the criteria in that jurisdiction for illegality It might be argued that this as opposed to the evidence re quired for prosecution of contact offence against child will increase the number of successful convictions However though not without its critics the cybercrime hypothesis has been used to account for reduction of crime in other areas MirLlinares and Moneva present two hypotheses which they argue highlight the essential role of cyberspace as an environment that has shifted criminal opportunitiesfrom physical to virtual space and which ultimately reects on crime trends The rst hypothesis provides evidence that the more time spent at home by many young people engaging with for example video games and other online activities could have had an impact on the drop in juvenile crime Their second hypothesis states which has relevance for this paper that the appearance of cyberspace has led to ashift in opportunities from physical place to cyberspace This seems particularly per tinent in relation to online grooming or sexual solicitation For example survey of law enforcement indicated that social networking sites SNSs were used to initiate Finkelhor Jones Laaksonen et al Dunne et al Shields et al Wolak et al Walsh et al Farrell Birks MiroLlinares Moneva Mitchell KJ et al Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual sexual relationships to provide means of communication between victim and of fender to access information about the victim to disseminate information or pictures about the victim and to get in touch with the victims friends SNSs might be said to afford opportunities for offending In similar way what has been noted in offendersamples is the ease that online sexual behaviour can take place often prompted bythe easy exchange of photographs text or the presence of web cameras without anyphysical contact or the risks that would be associated with it Affordances Positioning OCSEA as cybercrimes forces us to think about the context in whichthese abuses and exploitations take place This potentially may offer ways of preventing or managing these crimes and moves us away from focus on the characteristicsof offenders or their victims and how it may be possible to effect changes in their behaviour In the context of young peoples mental health and digital environments it has been suggested that digital technologies have their own affordances which arelisted as persistence replicability scalability and searchability The affordances of digital technology in conjunction with the capabilities of online and networked technology such as social media allow digital information to be easily copied replica bility easily shared with large audiences scalability easily recorded and archived persistence and easily accessed by others and found in the future searchabilityLivingstone argues that these affordances are the result of complex networked infrastructures invented and implemented by people working under huge pressure and at speed in largely commercial in stitutions with global ambitions That means the needs of vulnerable young people may come very low down in their list of priorities How far researchersclinicians and other practitioners can wrest back control to ensure digital networks meet the best interests of young people is as yet unknown though surelya struggle worth the effort This has been explored in the context of revenge porn nonconsensual inti mate image distribution where it is argued that replicability and scalability haveincreased the ease with which such an act can be committed and the ease with whicha nudesexual image can be distributed to large audience Persistence and search ability have also augmented impact of this act in some cases by allowing this content to be located by others and to potentially affect victim at some point in the future However Dodge is critical of the decontextualised ways in which for example the judiciary have universally used these digital affordances to justify harsh sentences andthis is further explored in discussion of affordancesinpractice which stresses the Quayle et al Boyd Livingstone Dodge Quayle idea that affordances are not intrinsic properties that can be dened outside their sit uated context of usage but ongoing enactments by specic users that may vary acrossspace and time The term affordance is used throughout this paper and this warrants further dis cussion For Gibson affordances referred to the possibilities that an object offers foraction where the properties of the object emerge through the interaction betweenactors and those objects This is not only related to the physical properties of the object but also to social norms and rulesThe concept was further developed in re lation to humancomputer interaction where it was argued that an affordance shouldnot be understood as property but rather as human relationship It is therefore not static feature of an object and whether an affordance exists depends entirely on the relationship between the actor and the property Norman argued that the concept ofaffordances does not imply that online practices are determined by technology butrather by how people use it Therefore affordances are not static features of tech nology but have number of potential actions associated with them An affordance exists once user has perceived it and perceived the potential actions associated withit For example oice over Internet Protocols such as Skype have not only beenused by many people to keep in touch with geographically distant family members but also to facilitate the live streaming of sexual abuse of children There are reportsof live streaming in South Asia with victims described as deprived children who arecoerced into live streaming of sexual abuse from computers provided by employers against their will However live streaming has also been reported in highincome countries such as the UKLive streaming provides realtime access to events for participants who are not actually engaging in the activity themselves The UKs National Crime Agencys strategic assessment of serious organised crime suggested that the practice of live cyclosis is one example of how offenders can simultaneously create indecent images of children IIOC online view IIOC and commit contactabuse by proxy overseas case study on Periscope live streaming platform provides forensic examination of the technical and legal challenges for the investi gation of live streaming of sexual abuseThis is good illustration of how actors may use technologies in creative and unpredictable ways Costa Gibson JJ Meredith Norman DA

at Horsman Jarzabkowski Kaplan Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual It has also been argued that the Internet creates affordances that facilitate innova tive ways of committing old and new crimesand Jerde suggests child sexual abuse material CSAM as an example of crime that uses Internet affordances to circum vent law enforcement techniques deployed around national borders to avoid detec tionp further study in the context of cyberbullying on social networking sites SNSs used affordance to refer to the mutuality of actor intentions and technology capabilities that provide the potential for particular action This relational view of affordance is seen as advantageous for understanding technology use becauseit allows us to consider the symbiotic relationship between the capabilities of thetechnology and the actors goal and actions It has been argued that the actualisation of affordances occurs when an actor takes advantage of one or more affordances of SNSs to achieve immediate concrete outcomes that support their goals The focus istherefore on contextualised actions that technology makes qualitatively easier but which may be specic to that relationality and which potentially move researchersaway from the certainties of separate technology attributes and actors attitudes Technological affordances and CSAM Technological affordances have also been considered in the context of an interaction between design and usage and an example of this is privacy settings whereaffordances shape practice in that privacy settings distinguish between public private or partially private communications However as previously noted users also shape affordances for example young people setting up multiple proles on SNSs toproject different selves to different audiences Earlier work in this area suggested thatwe can also identify social affordances that refer to interactions between how users respond the social context and social networks However it has been argued that other people provide the richest and most signicant environmental affordances One nding of interest in relation to online grooming of children is that technological affordances are related to the motivations people have for using them It is notonly important to think about what these action possibilities are but when and forwhom they might happen For adolescents this may relate to the developmental taskof exploring sexuality afforded through the ability to create sexual media the on line applications that support this eg WhatsApp Instagram and the peer and adult engagement with this digital content Of importance it has been noted that new technologies reshape public life but teens engagement also recongures the technologyitself In the context of technologymediated CSA consideration of the reciprocity of Robey et al Jerde Chan et al Earl Kimport Majchrzak et al Staksrud et al Wellman et al Kaufmann Clment Quayle this engagement needs to be widened to include another set of actors those moti vated by sexual interest in children Crime opportunity theoryand the affordance perspective has been used to de velop metaframework to inform an understanding of SNS bullyingSpecically crime opportunity theory argues that two primary components contribute to crimebeing committed likely perpetrator and environmental conditions that offer criminogenic opportunities In this context using an affordance perspective into crime opportunity theory helped explain how social media allows perpetrator to evalu ate whether environmental conditions would facilitate SNS bullying activity In theirempirical study they proposed two SNS environmental conditions that offered criminogenic opportunities for likely offender to engage in SNS bullying These were the presence of suitable targets and the absence of capable guardianships The af fordances that facilitated the identication of suitable targets and which have relevance for technologymediated sexual abuse offences were accessibility informationretrieval editability and association The rst two of these accessibility and infor mation retrieval are particularly salient for OCSA crimes Accessibility affordance allows perpetrator to transcend time and spatial constraints to reach potential targetsand provides the opportunity to connect with an unlimited number of users includingpeople who are known and also unknown leading to an environment where suitable targets can be identied and accessed Information retrieval affordance refers to the extent to which user believes that an SNS offers the opportunity to obtain information about user on that platform This allows likely offender to access materialcreated by potential target which provides information about the background pref erences and daily activities of that individual These authors note that SNS updates often include new features that encourage users to continuously create and share information on these platforms Earlier work had also used these frameworks to understand CSAMrelated crimes Their starting point was routine activity theorywhich identied three minimal elements for criminal action likely offender ii suitable target andiii absence of capable guardian Focus on access to suitable target as with themetaframework developed in relation to bullying drew attention to the context in which potential criminal activity takes place which can be modied or changed This moves the focus away from the likely offender and the likely circumstances bothdistal and proximal that might have inuenced their behaviour to the possibility ofchanging the environment in way that increases or supplements the availability of capable guardianship It distinguishes between the inclination to offend and the ac tual offence Analysing criminal activity which is both particular and grounded inits situational context should therefore relate to the context and circumstances of aparticular situation In the context of CSAM the absence of capable guardian seems particularly pertinent In November the BBC news reported along with other agencies the Felson Clarke Ibid Taylor Quayle Cohen LE Felson Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual decision by Facebook to encrypt all of its messenger services The endtoend en cryption on Facebookowned WhatsApp will be extended to Facebook Messenger and Instagram with Mr Zuckerberg CEO Facebook acknowledging there wouldbe tradeoff that would benet child sex abusers and other criminals While there is limited evidence for the purposeful use of encryption by offenders to conceal online sexual activities against minorstools such as WhatsApp which have end to end encryption protect the data during transmission and storage by default This also means that the applications used by organisations such as NCMEC and theInternet Watch Foundation IWF to detect and remove CSAM content such as Pho toDNA may no longer have the same efcacy PhotoDNA creates unique digital signature hash of an image which is then compared with hashes of other photos to nd copies of the same image When matched with database containing hashesof previously identied illegal images PhotoDNA helps detect disrupt and report the distribution of child exploitation material Paradoxically encryption by default may provide an environment which perpetuates the sense of privacy and anonymity associated with such applications recent study albeit within different context concluded that new app developers need to be mindful of the affordances of the prod ucts they developand in terms of online child protection this may be crucial Criminogenic qualities of the Internet Recently there have been number of studies examining the criminogenic qualities of the Internet It has been argued that situations vary in their criminogenic qualities producing or leading to crime from those that challenge offenders by re quiring them to create opportunities through those that provide easy temptations to those that actively provoke crimeImportantly Wortley considers the interaction between criminogenic environments and the criminogenic disposition of the likely of fender The latter has its roots in an offender typology which is based on the strength of criminal dispositions and the different roles played in their crimes by the imme diate environmentIn this typology antisocial predators may actively seek out criminal opportunities and use situational information to make rational choices about the risks and benets of committing an act Mundane offenders engage in lowlevel crime and seem to demonstrate poor selfcontrol and succumb easily to the oppor tunities offered in given situation The nal category provoked offenders are less

Clarke RV Quayle likely to have criminal record but react to an array of situational conditions some which may be internal and others environmental Related to this Seto described motivationfacilitation model of sex offending which examined the relationships be tween paraphilic traits predispositions state factors which facilitate acting on thesepredispositions and situational factors access and presence of capable guardian This was examined in the context of CSAM offenders and concluded that many of these individuals are motivated to engage in sexual behaviour with children as they have paedophilic or hebephilic sexual interests but that they demonstrate high levelsof selfcontrol or low in facilitation factors This leaves them less likely to commit acontact offence but this in the context of access to Internet technologies is not suf cient to inhibit acting on the opportunity to commit CSAM offences These offenders have also been found to have greater access to technology but less access to childrenthan contact offenders These issues are also examined in Brewer et als study on adolescent delinquency and the criminogenic features of digital technologyThese authors argue that the Internet exhibits features that make it uniquely criminogenic to ofine environmentsThe Internet as distinct place is said to deterritorialize encounters which are no longer limited by geography and can take place in synchronous or asynchronous time which enable identity and motives to remain concealed They suggest that Users caneasily move from point of predictable use eg targeted information searches to apparently random and unpredictable discoveries of information images and points of view due to the multiple hidden linkages between websites and services that are often driven by commercial considerations Algorithms may also direct ornudge users to certain content or services based on past individual or collective activity It has been argued that these algorithms can be specically designed to capitalize on cravings and curiosities and they may well have affordance qualities topical example of this relates to YouTubes video recommendation system which displays on sidebar what is up next for the viewerThese are ranked according to the users history and context and newer videos are generally prefer enced publication in the New York Times reported that YouTubes algorithm was encouraging people with sexual interest in children to watch videos of partiallyclothed minors often after viewing videos with sexual content These videos wereoften domestic and showed children at the swimming pool or on vacation but their report claimed that there was evidence that for some of the people watching them they were serving different and

deterrence of online child sexual ber of videos appearing on the device are personalized and engaging for the user Our viewing history will determine what we are nudged to view and potentially for number of individuals will increase the likelihood of viewing content that may approximate sexually inappropriate or illegal content It has been suggested that there are qualities of the Internet either in association with facilitating conditions personal or environmental or otherwise that in themselves made accessing and possession of CSAM more likely and in essence operate as event factors that relate to the commission of this particular crime This ar gument was framed within an analysis drawing on situational crime control modelwhich emphasises the signicance of precriminal situations and opportunity Taylor drew parallels between terrorist activities and CSAMrelated crimes and arguesthat some forms of user interaction with the Internet suggest the Internet may have criminogenic qualities Firstly the distributed nature of the Internet and the corre sponding lack of control over content is factor in increased availability of illegal orundesirable material Secondly the way that distributed complex global microstructures develop effectively increases opportunity for access to that content Alongsidethis criminal conspiracies can deliberately and intentionally use both content and opportunity to engage with and draw in otherwise uncommitted people Practice implications for prevention Changing individuals likely offenders and likely targets is both challenging and expensive Over the last years there has been development of number of internet safety and education programmes to increase positive adolescent behaviour andsafety online but their ndings from systematic review of related studies suggested that there is still need for reevaluating how internet safety education is delivered in the future In further publication content analysis of four Internet Safety Ed ucation Programmes for children indicated that most were not incorporating proveneducation strategies and lacked any strong evidence base although more recent study does advocate for the alignment of such programmes with clearer evidence baseThey also challenged whether messages would be better delivered through broader youth safety prevention programs versus standalone lessons Interventionprogrammes that target online offenders have shown equivocal evidence For example the UKaccredited treatment programme iSOTP was assessed following completion of pre and postpsychometric assessments by convicted offenders and in dicated improvements in socioaffective functioning and decrease in prooffending attitudes An evaluation of the psychoeducational programme Inform and Inform Covington et al Taylor Quayle Taylor Max Jones LM et al Jones LM et al Finkelhor et al Middleton et al Quayle Plus developed in the UK by The Lucy Faithful Foundation suggested that data from eleven groups indicated that participants felt enabled to face up to being arrestedandor convicted helped them develop greater understanding of their offending be haviour and how to establish nonoffending life However an Impact evaluation of the UK prisonbased Core Sex Offender Treatment Programme between and indicated that more treated sex offenders committed at least one child image reoffence during the followup period when compared with the matched comparison offenders who had received no treatment compared with It appear likely that changing the contexts in which sexual crimes take place may offer greater opportunity to effect change Wortley comments that the most common model of situation prevention is opportunity reduction which involves ma nipulating the immediate environmental contingencies so as to increase the perceivedcosts of offending He applies this to the problem of CSAM through an examina tion of three opportunityreduction strategies reducing perceived rewards increas ing the perceived effort and increasing the perceived risks Reducing the rewards ofCSAM may involve removing or denying access to content that is targeted by offenders through for example regulatory control of content by Internet Service Providers Disruption tactics such as blocking efforts by Google and Microsoft resulted in drop over months in webbased searches for abuse images compared withno blocking activities from Yandex There are some positive indicators in rela tion to Internet monitoring moderation and reporting of tough content or be haviourOne example is the development of web crawler Arachnid by the Cana dian Centre for Child Protection to detect images and videos based on conrmed digital ngerprints of illegal content and combat the proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the Internet They report that the automated crawler helps reduce the on line availability of child sexual abuse material through its identication and issuingof notice to the hosting provider requesting its removal As of November over million images were identied for analyst review and million notices were sent to providers Of these of related to victims who are not known to have been identied by police Such disruption tactics reduce the number of im ages available through simple searching which is important as the presence of easily available CSAM and high levels of Internet use are risk factors in Internet offending Increasing the perceived effort of accessing CSAM involves making it more difcultfor offenders to gain access to content which means they have to expend more effortA publication by the Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Content presents collation of approaches that have been proved successful in deterring or detecting illegal or illicit use of mobile payment services used to access CSAM It is also Gillespie et al Mews et al Ibid Steel Quayle Koukopoulos Project Arachnid Available at Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Content Preventing mobile payment services from being misused to monetise child sexual abuse content Available at disruption and deterrence of online child sexual likely that increasing perceived risks may be achieved through proactive policing One example of this is provided by the EUROPOL initiative PolicePeer which involves law enforcement informing people trying to access or share CSAM on PPnetworks of the risks that they are taking and offering information as to where theycan get help In similar vein attention has been drawn to the particular context in which access to CSAM occurs which rmly locates the behaviour within the factors that inuenceit These have been summarized as the signicance of high affordance cues givingaccess to images immediate and highly salient reinforcement on achieving accessto images perceived absence of capable guardianship and surveillance in generalsense as far as the Internet is concerned and in specic sense in terms of the privacyassociated with Internet use insensitivity to immediate negative qualities resultingfrom both motivational factors and the strong affordance qualities of screen basedcues Three kinds of crime prevention initiatives have been identied which may be of value in helping to place this into context primary prevention focused on stopping crime before it occurs secondary prevention directed at people thought tobe at high risk of committing an offence and tertiary prevention focused on knownoffenders These categories were used to explore prevention efforts in relation to CSAM using two additional crime prevention categories reducing provocation and removing excuses Removing excuses for example through informing target audiences of the illegality of CSAM and its associated harms to children through media campaigns have provided evidence that these represent an effective way to reacha large audience and transmit the messages that there are signicant consequencesto viewing CSAM individuals have personal responsibility in controlling their behaviour and that help is available In this respect campaigns appear to be an appropriate strategy for deterring people from viewing CSAM

theaffordances offered by online social media may present signicant risk factor forsome children Three factors play an important role in this complex and dynamicscenario potential perpetrators and

FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE UNICEFUNINOORANI INTRODUCTION Digital information technologies and social media platforms have become important means of communication used by UNICEF and its partners The physical distancing requirements during the COVID pandemic have further strengthened reliance on mass media social media and mobile technology as way of reaching and engaging with intended audiences Even where access to digital resources remains limited country programmes are launching innovative approaches to continue social and behaviour change activities despite the physical distancing challenge combining new and more traditional communication methods This guidance note is designed to support country programmes to conduct quality evidencebased meaningful and measurable engagement for prevention of harmful practices programming even when interpersonal communication is not possible In particular this note will nOutline commonly used digital communications resources and their functions nProvide insights into information that can help design andor refine behavioural and social norms programming for digital approaches nHighlight series of tips for conducting effective digital engagement activities nOutline complementary channels to enhance the reach of digital approachesThe physical distancing requirements during the COVID pandemic have further strengthened reliance on mass media social media and mobile technology as way of reaching and engaging with intended audiences COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE nReview areas for monitoring and evaluation of digital activities nPoint readers to relevant risk communication and community engagement RCCE resources nSummarize key considerations for choosing digital approaches DIGITAL COMMUNICATION RESOURCES BY FUNCTION With continual advances in the digital sphere more options emerge for engaging remotely with intended audiences Table aims to give readers an overview of commonly used digital platforms and the functions they can perform more detailed description of each platform can be found in Appendix The choice of digital engagement options will depend on the country context and communication ecosystem Developing plan for digital engagement requires an understanding of the social political and economic context as these often define access and use of digital resources by intended audiences Mapping the digital landscape including identifying channels resources and communication spaces as well as identifying communities with limited access to digital and media channels can help define comprehensive strategy where digital and traditional approaches intersect to ensure greater reach Table provides list of remote mobile and digital engagement options noting the requirements for implementing them and their suitability for twoway communication This information is intended to help programmes identify the most suitable approaches for their individual context Even where access to digital resources remains limited country programmes are launching innova tive approaches to continue social and behaviour change activities despite the physical distancing challenge TABLE FUNCTION FUNCTION BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF POSSIBLE USES Gather social data Polling and surveys such as RapidPro UReport GeoPoll IPSOS ODKOnaKobo and Viamo can be used to quickly assess important elements such as knowledge attitudes perceptions perceived expectations intention and behaviours of communities regarding harmful practices These tools can also be used to identify information gaps Tools that provide data visualization options such as Magicbox and Power BI can help better present information to facilitate evidencebased decision making by packaging feedback to allow for real time monitoring Share information and promote services Messages around harmful practices can be disseminated across UNICEF Government and partners websites and social media platforms mass media and mobile networks These platforms can also be used to advise the public of available services including trusted information sources and helplines Facilitate dialogue and engagement with intended audiences Digital platforms can be used to facilitate twoway communication and dialogue with intended audiences eg adolescents parents influencers service providers RapidPro platforms can support and set up additional tools such as the Internet of Good Things IOGT Chatbots UReport and Viamo to provide an interactive space for dialogue and engagement around specific content Selection of the appropriate platform will depend on the needs infrastructure capacities of intended users and context Social media and messaging platforms such as Viber WhatsApp Facebook Messenger and Facebook groups as well simpler SMS technology can be used to disseminate correct information and solicit feedback Interactive Voice Response IVR such as Viamo Echo and Orange Voice Pro can be effective in low literacy settings to share information and solicit feedback Support training and capacity building Existing digital platforms and resources can be used to support key workers by sharing essential information and training packages providing them with resources and digital solutions to enhance their reach to intended audiences Remote training and virtual instruction can be provided to community and faith leaders mobilisers mentors and peer educators through platforms such as RapidPro Chatbots UReport the Internet of Good things and Viamo Tracking and addressing sentiment and misinformation Digital engagement resources such as callcentres social media platforms and digital engagement solutions can be harnessed to gather information on the dominant sentiment about given topic eg harmful practices COVID education gender Social mobilizers peer educators mentors and partners can be capacitated as users of social media to conduct social listening and to track and address misinformation Social media platforms can be used to promote referral to trusted sources of information and services Adapted from UNICEFs Digital Community Engagement Strengthening Polio CD Strategies Concept Note UNICEF June COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT AND HARMFUL PRACTICES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID PANDEMIC When it comes to harmful practices and the COVID pandemic it is important to recognize how the pandemic and the restrictions imposed are affecting peoples behaviours including those related to harmful practices For instance there is evidence that in parts of the world child marriage is on the rise as families try to cope with financial burdens brought about by the pandemic while in some communities the female genital mutilation FGM season is being anticipated to take advantage of schools closure and disruption in protection systems Programmes need to devise ways to keep abreast of how the pandemic is affecting peoples thoughts beliefs attitudes feelings motivation and intention around FGM and child marriage Such information as well as information on the communication landscape and available digital options can be gathered via rapid desk review and rapid assessments Together these will shed light on important elements for behaviour and social norms change programming such as identifying key audiences and influencers which may have changed as result of the pandemic determining appropriate channels to reach them both on and offline and tailoring messages and content to the new situation GATHERING INFORMATION TO HELP DESIGN AND REFINE BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIAL NORMS PROGRAMMING rapid desk review should look at media habits of intended audiences trusted and utilized information sources and credible spokespersons In exploring digital media habits remember to look at mobile device ownership and access noting the distribution of smart phones versus lowend devices such as feature phones network strength availability speed popular data packages and utilization of any lowbandwidth applications such as Facebook Lite or applications that are available free of data charges through Mobile Network Operator partnerships such as Free Basics by Facebook RAPID ASSESSMENT AND SURVEYS These will give you insights into if and how peoples perceptions attitudes intentions and intended behaviours are changing Assessments should be conducted both with your intended audiences as determined by the desk review girls boys women parents and other relevant community members and with key stakeholders such as community and faith leaders current and former excisors social workers women and youth leaders and other individuals who are likely to have good understanding of how TABLE COMMONLY USED DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS REMOTE ENGAGEMENT OPTIONWAY COMMUNICATIONNETWORK BANDWIDTH

community Consider conducting the assessment at regular intervals every to months during the pandemic to monitor any changes and adapt interventions accordingly REMOTE SURVEY OPTIONS These will be necessary when physical distancing measures are in place Table provides list of possible options of commonly used applications You can find an example of how IVR has been successfully used in Ghana to assess media exposure and behavioural determinants in this monitoring and evaluation note Wherever possible prioritize solutions that do not require data bundles in order to reach the widest audiences IVR USSD and SMS via RapidPro or other solutions are generally preferred to social media applications such as WhatsApp Viber and Facebook Messenger For ideas on how to conduct remote assessments you can refer to this summary of methodologies in the era of social distancing and review this guidance on SMS and IVR surveys You should also be aware that while digital and mobile platforms allow you to gather data they remain inaccessible to many You can refer to Box for some considerations on how to keep your surveys inclusive To capture information that can help shape your behaviour and social norms change programme and integration of digtial compoments your surveys should aim to ask questions that shed light on the following three areasPRACTICES BEHAVIOURS AND DRIVERS nIf and how the prevalence of harmful practices is changing during the pandemic nWhat families think and feel about engaging in harmful practices during the pandemic nWho engages in the harmful practices nWho in the household decides if the girl marries andor undergoes FGM nWhy respondents think it is important if at all to engage in harmful practices at this time nWhether familiesrespondents intend to engage in the practice now NORMS nWhether respondents believethink that majority of community members will engage in harmful practices during the pandemic nWhether respondents believethink they are expected to engage in the harmful practices at this time by those who matter to them INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL NETWORKS nHow respondents employ their time during periods of confinement nThe people respondents communicate engage with regularly in these times nThe spokespersons who are most trusted in the communityamong your intended audiences nThe trusted and utilized sources of information in these times especially around harmful practices BOX CONSIDERATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE REMOTE ASSESSMENTS Wherever possible prioritize solutions that do not require data bundles in order to reach the widest audiences IVR USSD and SMS via RapidPro or other solutions are generally preferred to social media applications such as WhatsApp Viber and Facebook Messenger Where access to mobile phones is limited ask local leaders to conduct the assessments with community members They can do this by using tablets provided by your organization or paperbased questionnaires that can then be collated by the programme Local leaders can also help people with impairments to complete the survey Encourage them to approach people with disabilities in their community so that their views are also reflected in your assessments Where lockdown orders do not allow for direct interactions try to include the views of the most marginalized by asking questions about their needs to groups and leaders who represent them Translate the questionnaires and assessments in relevant languages paying particular attention to the languages spoken by women and by vulnerable and remote communities Please refer to the Resources section at the end of this note for more ideas on inclusive approaches COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE nRespondents media habits in particular their digital media habits and who their online influencers are nRespondents network access data access device sharing practices and phone type Information gathered from these rapid assessments will provide insights into how the pandemic is affecting peoples engagement with harmful practices and help you shape and adapt your programme and digital engagement activities accordinglyTIPS FOR CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT Digital and online modes of engagement allow users to connect virtually share content and ideas and engage in discussions with unprecedented reach usability and immediacy They represent channel that can complement and enhance communication interventions for behaviour and social change The tips summarized in Box will help you make the most of your digital approaches ensuring they are evidencebased and promote meaningful engagement with intended audiences LINK YOUR DIGITAL EFFORTS TO YOUR PROGRAMMES THEORY OF CHANGE When you devise your programmes theory of change you need to consider behavioural determinants beyond the individual level and include contextual environmental and interpersonal factors too Your digital approaches should align to your existing theory of change and reflect the findings from the desk review and rapid assessments described above You can find links to behavioural theories in the reference section at the end of this note TAILOR ACTIVITIES TO YOUR INTENDED AUDIENCES HABITS AND PREFERENCES It is crucial that you meet your intended audiences where they are For this you will need to understand their media and technology access and use including information about devices channels media sources influencers popular data packages BOX TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT Link your digital efforts to your programmes theory of change Tailor activities to your intended audiences habits and preferences Reach both girls and boys Provide opportunities for audiences to interact with your digital content Build trust and use credible champions Develop engaging concise content Pretest your concepts Think carefully about language and literacy Factor in costs and data limitations Promote your digital platform Budget for moderation and management of content and comments Avail capacity to respond to additional demand generated Put digital safeguarding in place Make plan for feedback to your users Adapted from iMedias Digital and Social Media for Social and Behaviour Change Communication UNICEFUNIBONGYEREIRWE COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE network strength and other elements that are related to whether and how they access and use digital devices programmes and platforms The assessments described above will shed light on many of these areas REACH BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS To address norms within the community as whole your digital interventions should not exclusively focus on girls Gender norms interventions for example should also engage boys and men You can see an example of how men have been engaged against harmful practices in Box and refer to UNFPAs and UNICEFs technical note on partnering with men and boys to end child marriage in the Global Programme to End Child Marriage for more information on this topic PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR AUDIENCES TO INTERACT WITH YOUR DIGITAL CONTENT Digital interventions can be designed flexibly to include interactive components twoway communication opportunities for feedback and timed messaging to engage users in targeted ways Buildin opportunities for engagement such as closed discussion groups virtual counselling testimonials challenges and feedback that are adapted to the needs and digital media habits of your different audience segments For examples of innovative digital engagement you can read about mobilephone based hygiene and sanitation promotion in Somalia and the use of how adolescent girls in Mozambique are empowered through SMS Biz Cocreating activities with your intended users is an effective way of engaging them while ensuring that your activities resonate with them You can provide opportunities for them to input into the design process either virtually or in person through workshops or sprint design events For practical example of how to cocreate with your audience read here about how UNICEF Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office cocreated UPSHIFT with adolescents programme aimed and empowering young people to become social innovators and entrepreneurs through leading approaches in youth development and private sector tools BUILD TRUST AND USE CREDIBLE CHAMPIONS The use of trusted and credible influencers spokespersons and champions is wellestablished practice in the field of social and behaviour change including within the digital sphere Select your spokespersons based on the findings from your initial assessments and test whether they really are credible popular influencers that resonate with your intended audiences and your programme Examples of such champions include national and local celebrities political figures government agencies international or nationallocal nongovernmental organizations and even fictional characters developed exclusively for your intervention DEVELOP ENGAGING CONCISE CONTENT The content you develop should command attention and encourage users to engage with it For this it needs to be appealing and concise Use an eyecatching headline of no more than eight words suggested number of words for highest clickrate and prepackage your content so that it is easily sharable When using images remember that lowend devices have low screen resolution and digital images should therefore not include text in them Text should be formatted around the images This will also increase the application opportunities of content across platformsThe use of trusted and credible influencers spokespersons and champions is wellestablished practice in the field of social and behaviour change including within the digital sphere BOX ENGAGING MEN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF HARMFUL PRACTICES In Senegal UNICEFs supported programme used combination of education and social mobilization to empower women and communities to reduce FGM and child marriage The strategic approach involve seeking the buyin of male village leaders employ local facilitators to teach education sessions tap into local communication channels and use community dialogue with both men and women The programme purposely targeted men to enlist their support and mobilized male community and religious leaders as well as engaging women and girls in an effort to ensure that abandoning FGM was collective and explicit decision involving wholecommunity approach Evaluation results from the male engagement component of this work showed positive changes in knowledge attitudes and behaviours which ultimately led to public declaration against FGM and early marriage as well as slight reduction in child marriages COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGEPRETEST YOUR CONCEPTS Factor in time and money to pretest your concepts with your intended audiences to ensure they resonate and are received and understood the way you expect them to be For guidance on pretesting you can refer to this pretesting guide developed by UNICEF during the COVID pandemic Try to personalize data and feeds based on your users characteristics generated from clickdata research that indicate the type of content they are more likely to engage with To learn more about this see this story from UNICEF Senegal on rural outreach on health and human rights infobycountrysenegalhtml THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT LANGUAGE AND LITERACY Assess the level of literacy of your intended audiences to determine how to engage with them digitally and what language and terms to use Where literacy levels are low IVR and audiovisuals may be more appropriate Ensure that your content is available in relevant languages and remember that language can also be politicizing factor in some contexts FACTOR IN COSTS AND DATA LIMITATIONS For greater and more equitable reach and utilization of your digital platforms explore how to minimize data consumption Your programmes should be cognizant that portion of your audience sometimes the majority will have limited minutes data and text message allowances Consider also that smartphones often come equipped with preinstalled applications for example Facebook Lite and with free minutes available for specific platforms Knowing the common standard free applications supported by data packages will help you select digital channels that are more likely to be accessed by your intended users Webbased solutions often have greater potential to reach remote or lowincome communities than application based solutions as many lowend devices do not have access to an application store but come with builtin web browsers BUDGET FOR MODERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTENT AND COMMENTS If your platforms include an interactive component discussion groups virtual sessions questions and answers etc allocate the required resources to respond to and moderate those activities Moreover in recent years online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been increasingly used to spread false and misleading information including during the current COVID pandemic Women and girls are especially likely to face harassment online in particular when they speak out on gender discrimination or against deepseated cultural and social norms It is recommended that you budget sufficient resources to monitor moderate and manage content within your digital communication platforms looking out for and removing any harmful content and comments If your country benefits from UReport consider engaging existing UPartners for content moderation Often these partners are trained in comment moderation AVAIL CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL DEMAND GENERATED It is likely that your digital activities will generate increased demand for services and information Indicate clearly in your online communication where users can go andor call for support and ensure you have the capacity in place to respond Inability to respond to increased demand for services will frustrate your participants reduce their trust in your activities UNICEFUNIMAWA COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE and drive them away ultimately making behaviour change less likely in the future and impacting negatively on your programme goals PUT DIGITAL SAFEGUARDING PRACTICES IN PLACE Digital safeguarding covers important dimensions such as data privacy and protection data security and how to keep people safe when using digital devices and platforms Determine appropriate safeguarding measures for your context and chosen platforms You can find more information on this in the Safeguarding Tips and Guidance and the UNICEFsupported Guidance on Responsible Data for Children documents CONSIDER HOW TO ENGAGE WITH OFFLINE USERS THROUGH MOBILE TECHNOLOGY IVR and RapidPro systems allow you to engage with offline users using lowend mobile phones IVR for example allows people to call and leave messages or to listen to prerecorded messages left by other users Such system enables information sharing and collection of feedback and opinions by encouraging intended audiences to call and leave message These messages can then be used to inform massmedia programming for example radio or TV which in turn encourage audiences to callin and answer or ask questions or provide comments thus generating continuous dialogue with intended audiences For an example on how IVR technology can be used please refer to Box MAKE PLAN FOR FEEDBACK As your digital solution inquiries about users preferences and opinions inform your activities and services make plan to share feedback with your users as often as possible Inform them about how improved information sharing services are available to them or how what they share will be used This creates virtuous data cycle incentivizing your users to share more information more frequently with greater honesty and accuracy USING COMPLEMENTARY CHANNELS FOR GREATER IMPACT Despite the extensive reach of digital approaches and their flexible options for various degrees of engagement there is little evidence that they will succeed in changing behaviours and social and gender norms if used in isolation For effective engagement digital approaches need to be complemented by other channels and reinforced through multiple media Even in times of physical distancing interventions should continue to operate across levels of the socioecological model SEM Table provides some examples for engaging remotely with intended audiences across the SEM Many of the examples listed are digital however some nondigital remote engagement channels are also suggested for message reinforcement BOX MESSAGING FOR MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH THE APONJON EXAMPLE FROM BANGLADESH Aponjon meaning dear one in Bangla is the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Actions MAMA programme in Bangladesh aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality through mobile communication technology Adaptable timesensitive and stagebased information on maternal and infant health issues is delivered directly to expectant and new mothers through SMS or interactive voice response IVR Almost of users from rural areas selected to receive messages through IVR indicating the popularity of this approach among rural populations Aponjon delivers twice weekly messages that are entertaining and educational formatted in miniskits with actors playing out real life scenarios as characters such as pregnant women doctors husbands and mothersin law MAMA Bangladesh also created unique messaging service specifically for husbands to reinforce messages provided to their wives and encourage their involvement in decisionmaking on pregnancy birth and infant care An evaluation of Aponjon indicated that women reporting at least months use of the service were approximately times more likely than nonusers to score high on both maternal healthcare knowledge and related practices such as attending antenatal care visits taking ironfolic acid during pregnancy or taking vitamin after delivery Further women reporting receiving and listening to at least messages per month were almost twice as likely to have higher knowledge score and better related practices for maternal health compared to nonusers For more information on Aponjon please refer to this brief by the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action MAMA COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE

media platforms such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram Lowbandwidth free toaccess websites such as the Internet of Good Things Photo and video virtual challenges Hotlines Interactive voice recordings Interactive video games Interactive applications UReport Choose social media platforms that allow for twoway engagement such as Facebook Groups and Live Chats on Instant Messenger Generate debate and discussion by running live sessions such as Instagram Live or Live Facebook Chats on predefined topics Involve your intended audience in the development and facilitation of these sessions Use your platform as safe space and opportunity for girls and vulnerable groups to interact with peers and increase their collective agency for change Promotemaintain new norms challenging users to post videos or photos of themselves taking stance against FGM and child marriage Allow for callers to ask or type questions when they reach out to hotlines and IVRs Access or develop video games that mimic real life situations around the topic of interest where the user must determine the best course of action If you use avatars in your games select them carefully as avatars chosen by young people especially have been shown to inspire and influence their behaviour and identity offline If you develop an application for your programme buildin engagement opportunities such as quizzes discussion groups and peertopeer support Encourage continued engagement by exploring opportunities to partner with the private sector to provide gifts prizes vouchers or free data as users interact with the activities in

services and experiences that can help them shape brighter future for themselves and their peers Community Communication applications such as WhatsApp Viber or Facebook messenger groups Videos and leaflets at places that continue to be accessed by community members such as essential shops and services Live chats and virtual meetings with community faith leaders and other influential stakeholders Radio and TV shows with callin opportunities Closed groups such as WhatsApp Viber or Facebook messenger can enable twoway communication with key stakeholders such as community and religious leaders womens groups and other relevant civil society organizations The groups can be used to exchange information continue promoting key messages organize virtual calls to debate issues arising in the community and monitoring if and how the situation is evolving Radio and TV shows can have extensive reach Build in opportunities for interaction with the audience by providing call in number that people can use to ask questions or comment on topic to generate debate and discussion Where local radio exists people who do not have access to phone can be encouraged to write their comments and questions and leave them at the radio station Megaphones only provide oneway communication however they can be helpful in informing community members of opportunities to engage in activities Videos leaflets and information boards can be placed strategically in places that people continue to access even with confinement restrictions Again these do not provide twoway communication opportunities but they can help reinforce key messages and desired actions as determined by your initial assessmentsShujaaz is multimedia platform using comic books social media and SMS

UNICEFUNITYLLE COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE MONITORING AND EVALUATION Even in the realm of digital engagement it is important to put in place key metrics that allow you to monitor if and how your digital engagement activities are contributing to the programme goals Many social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter come with builtin analytic dashboards Thirdparty software platforms also exist that can help you monitor social media analytics Both the inbuilt and thirdparty platforms can track metrics such as clicks likes tags shares and reposts In most cases these metrics give information about reach with little insight into uptake interest or actual changes in attitudes or behaviours Social media sentiment analysis metrics go beyond reach to measure user interest by grouping together different actions by users such as comments and engagement with content and categorizing them as negative neutral or positive In social norms programming this can give sense of the users attitudes and feelings about the topic When choosing the metrics for your digital activities consider the following tips nUse few carefully selected core metrics Define key metrics that can help you measure your intervention Understand the user journey and how metrics along the way engagement with particular content journey completion can provide insights into their experience with and response to your digital content nMeasure quickly and often Digital technologies are iterative and fast changing with users accessing and interacting with them in constantly evolving ways Short iterative evaluations at regular intervals help you monitor the user experience and make prompt required adjustments to your digital content nExplore ways to investigate impact Find ways to explore how online engagement translates into offline behaviour Online surveys comment analysis and analysis of usergenerated content can help understand feelings intention and impact among users If you are conducting regular assessments as described at the start of this note add some questions on respondents engagement with your digital content for example utilization and recall Coupled with the other questions in your assessment information about respondents engagement with your digital activities can give an indication of its contribution towards any changes in other metrics measured by the assessments attitude intention beliefs feelings In Nepal the Rupantaran empowerment programme for example has been adapted to run through the radio and changes in girls knowledge are being assessed through random SMS messages after each show nOffline measurement is still important Where possible supplement your digital data with offline approaches such as case studies focus group discussions observations and other qualitative methods Such assessments help explore why and how users engage with your digital approaches and if and how they apply what they have learned offline When lockdown measures prevent face toface meetings and where connectivity allows you can conduct these qualitative assessments remotely using online media such as zoom calls Facebook Messenger and other communication applications RISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS As part of its Global Risk Communication and Community Engagement RCCE response for COVID UNICEF has developed three key indicators pertaining to digital and traditional media that are also included in the global Humanitarian Action of Children HAC appeal and the global Situation Report SitRep on COVID To align approaches the three RCCE indicators listed below can also help in obtaining sense of how activities around harmful practices are progressing nReach The number of people reached through oneway channels of communication nEngagement The number of people involved in participatory actions nFeedback The number of people sharing their concerns and asking questions clarifications for available support services to address their needs through established feedback mechanisms For breakdown on each indicator and how it can be adapted to harmful practices please refer to Appendix Media analytics is the practice of analysing digital interactions on social media platforms using various forms of data It can be used to track your intended audiences opinions and needs in relation to your topic or practice of interest COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE CONSIDERATIONS FOR GOING DIGITAL While digital channels offer potential for increased reach and engagement there are also important challenges around equitable access Gender disability income education and geography can all affect if and how your intended users engage with your digital activities The following questions will help you assess the feasibility of including digital approaches in your social norms interventions reflect on potential risks and consider ways to reduce exclusion and exacerbation of pre existing power imbalances nCost Consider the cost of your digital programme and assess whether your intended audience is able to afford engaging with your content nLiteracy and language Ensure that the digital channel you choose uses the language of your intended audience and is in an accessible format Lower literacy levels will require more visual and audio content Remember that in some settings women and girls have lower literacy levels than men and boys nTechnology skills Assess whether your intended audience has the technology skills and confidence required to interact with your content Consider any differences in skills between audience segments for example rural versus urban populations girlswomen versus boys men young versus older people or wealthy versus poor nCultural norms Reflect on any local customs that may limit or prohibit access to digital technology and mobile devices In some cases there may be negative cultural reactions to some audience segments particularly girls and women using mobile phones and the internet nGender digital divide The gender digital divide is rooted in discriminatory social and gender norms which affect the ability of girls to access and engage with digital technologies In some contexts girls do not have the same access to digital technologies or to devices as boys or they may only be able to access mobile device through male household member Often girls and women have limited time for media consumption due to high volumes of chores They may also have limited opportunities for learning and development which impacts their skills and confidence to interact with digital content denying them voice for sharing experiences and speaking out against harmful practices Programmes need to reflect on whether including digital component may exclude girls and women and further exacerbate gender imbalances nDisability Consider how accessible your digital content is to people with impairments Assess what assistive technology is available to make your content inclusive nPhone lines internet connection and electricity supply Consider the available infrastructure phone lines and connectivity as well as electricity supply Disparate infrastructure may mean that segment of your audience is unable to access your digital programme nEthical considerations The digital age has amplified existing risks and in some cases created new ones Child abuse exploitation and trafficking online still occur and children are increasingly facing range of other online risks such as cyberbullying hate speech harassment and exposure to unsuitable content It is essential that children are able to participate in safe online environment benefit from safe devices applications and platforms and have the ability to use the internet safely Ethical considerations need to be at the heart of any digital engagement strategy to ensure protection of young users Please refer to UNICEFs Policy guide on children and digital connectivity UNICEFUNIKANOBANA COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE DESCRIPTION OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND POTENTIAL USES With increased mobile penetration digital engagement is steadily increasing reach across the globe In light of this country programmes will need to revise strengthen or update their strategies to include digital modes of communication Below is brief menu of the main mobile and digital platforms and technologies that can be used to support remote and virtual engagement with intended audiences Chatbots are computer programmes designed to simulate conversation with human users at scale Programmes can design chatbots or messaging experiences and deploy them over many communication channels including SMS Facebook Messenger UReport WhatsApp and Viber GeoPoll is mobilebased platform that can administer remote mobilebased surveys all over the world Using SMS and voice calls to target specific populations it can be used to conduct surveys to gather insights into communities knowledge perceptions beliefs expectations and behaviours around harmful practices Google One Box vetted sites for example National Ministries of Gender Social Welfare Health or Education can update their websites code base to include an algorithm that once enabled allows relevant content to appear in featured box during relevant searches Google One Box through its partnership with UNICEF and the Internet of Good Things IOGT offers ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OTHER RCCE RESOURCES AND HARMFUL PRACTICES Global RCCE efforts have included the development of range of resources and tools to support communication and community engagement even with physical distancing measures Many of these resources contain helpful information that is also applicable to harmful practices Appendix provides list of these resources with key considerations for FGM

offices the opportunity to be source of trusted information for communities of interest Internet of Good Things IOGT is community engagement and system strengthening tool that offers free access to mobileready webbased resources and applications configured for lowend mobile devices It provides access to free educational and lifesaving information Currently the topics and issues available on IOGT include harmful practices such as child marriage and FGM maternal health hygiene diseases such as Ebola Polio Cholera and COVID sexual health advice for adolescents Internet safety positive parenting techniques and more Content is delivered to three distinct user groups parents and caregivers adolescents and young people and frontline workers and educators It includes engagement tools such as surveys and polls In the context of physical distancing IOGT provides access to information in hard to reach communities Country programmes interested in using this platform should explore whether it is already functioning in the country and add relevant content on harmful practices MagicBox is UNICEFs big data platform which is involved in measuring the secondary effects of COVID to understand the impacts on social behaviour education sentiment opinion and vulnerable populations In addition it provides guidance on how to pinpoint and combat misinformation about COVID While not strictly related to harmful practices having an awareness of how communities are responding can help shape programming around harmful practices as well RapidPro is digital messaging platform that powers programmes such as the Internet of Good Things UReport and Chatbots It allows programmes to develop messages that can be disseminated to specific groups while also collecting data via SMS and other channels such voice or social media to enable real time data collection and mass communication with intended audiences RapidPro has traditionally been used to support immunization campaigns conditional cash transfer programmes and monitoring of public services Messaging can be adapted to address barriers and enablers around harmful practicesUReport is digital mobile messaging solution that is built on the RapidPro platform It is social messaging tool and data collection system developed by UNICEF to improve citizen engagement inform and foster positive change The programme sends SMS polls and alters messaging to its participants collecting realtime responses and subsequently publishes the data gathered Viamo is simple lowcost technology for data collection and for the provision of public information via mobile phones In countries where Viamo is present it can provide information to the general population or selected audiences provide training to mobilizers leaders and others and conduct survey and polls to monitor general sentiment attitudes and expectations around harmful practices GLOBAL RCCE INDICATORS ADAPTED TO HARMFUL PRACTICES UNICEFs global RCCE response efforts include the development of RCCE indicators to promote consistency in global regional and country level reporting on RCCE indicators pertaining to digital and traditional media These indicators are included in the global Humanitarian Action for Children HAC appeal and the global Situation Report SitRep on COVID The three following indicators are proposed nReach the number of people reached through oneway channels of communication nEngagement the number of people involved in participatory actions nFeedback the number of people sharing their concerns and asking questions clarifications for available support services to address their needs through established feedback mechanisms To promote alignment with these global indicators the tables below provides the breakdown and description of each indicator It is slightly revised version of the UNICEF Guidance for Country Offices on RCCE Indicators for COVID Global Response to indicate application of indicators in the context of harmful practices programmingMagicBox is UNICEFs big data platform which is involved in measuring the secondary effects of COVID to understand the impacts on social behaviour education sentiment opinion and vulnerable populationsCOVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE TABLE INDICATOR NUMBER OF PEOPLE REACHED SUPPORTING PLATFORMINDICATORS DEFINITION AND RATIONAL TOOLS Social media Indicator The number of impressions per post on content relating harmful practices Definition While the exact definition of an impression varies among different social media platforms it can be defined as the number of times your content enters persons screen Facebook organic impressions are the number of times any content from your page or about your page entered persons screen Facebook paid impressions measure how often your ads were on screen for your target audience Instagram Impressions measure the total number of times users saw your post or story Twitter Impressions are defined as any time Twitter user sees one of your tweets LinkedIn Impressions are the number of times the updates were shown to members For any other social media networks please refer to their specific definitions Calculation Select your top performing social media channel eg Facebook and identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the reporting period For these posts take the total number of impressions and divide by the number of posts Rationale On social media reach and impressions are related concepts that can indicate exposure to messaging Prioritizing impressions is recommended as this is standard easily accessible metric across most major social media platformsNative analytics for each social media platform eg Facebook Twitter Analytics Instagram Insights etc Web Indicator The number of unique pageviews for content related to harmful practices Definition Aggregate number of unique views to the programmes harmful practices web pages generated by the same user in the same session during the reporting period ie the number of sessions during which the page was viewed one or more times within hour period Rationale The number of unique pageviews is an indication of how many times messages related to harmful practices on UNICEF or partner webpages are viewed It also helps to identify which postspages are most popular to help shape future content strategies This is an easily available metric that can be aggregated across relevant web pages relating to harmful practices Considerations The number of unique pageviews is simple approach that is easily accessible to most country offices across different skill levels and capacity using Google Analytics Alternatively countries can choose to report on of users for specific harmful practices pages if they have the capacity to configure Google Analytics to limit this data to specific pagesGoogle Analytics TV and radio Indicator The number of people reached through TV andor radio Definition Maximum potential reach from radio and TV content on harmful practices eg spots news broadcasts radio shows Rationale This aligns with the broader RCCE guidance on mass media channelsUse data provided on viewership listenership etc by the broadcaster media monitoring agency or similar sources Print and online newsIndicator The number of people reached through printonline news Definition Maximum potential reach for printonline news Use the highest number of print publications use the circulation number online news use the average number of monthly visitors Rationale This aligns with the broader RCCE guidance on using audience sizeMedia monitoring agency or media monitoring tool such as LexisNexis NewsdeskCOVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE SUPPORTING PLATFORMINDICATORS DEFINITION AND RATIONAL TOOLS RapidPro enabled programmes includes UReport days chatbots

harmful practices and Total number of times users questions were answered via CaseProUPartners and Total number of users reachedtimes users were reached through other RapidPro activities eg via RapidPro API Rationale The number of messages sent by RapidProenabled programmes gives reasonably accurate representation of receipt of content Measuring unique users that receive messages in specific time period is more difficult metric to collect manually Considerations Not all outgoing messages are viewed and for some channels there is no reporting on message delivery eg SMS This is the best possible indicator at this time given current data access RapidPro user is single contact record which in most cases represents single SMS number Facebook account WhatsApp number etc single person may create more than one user in RapidPro but analysis showed this to be infrequent of usersRapidPro CaseProU Partners Realtime Datadriven Dashboards RD Internet of Good ThingsIndicator The number of site visitors who access relevant content on IOGT Definition Number of users accessing pages tagged for harmful practices and related content Rationale site visitor represents single person that may access multiple articles or messages on harmful practices on the IOGT site This indicator is defined by Google Analytics as user tracks site visitors by IP address that ensures no doublecounting occurs of the same person visiting multiple sitesGoogle Data Studio Dashboard Other digital toolsIndicator Can be adapted from some of the suggested indicators above Rationale Offices may employ additional digital tools such as Viamo or CommCare to reach target populations with information and messages When measuring the reach of messages with these tools reporting should focus on capturing the number of unique users reached Ignored prompts do not qualify for reach reporting but can be used to inform programmatic decision making around priority messages and audience preferences Effort should be made where possible to disaggregate reach by audience type ie gender age location professionTABLE INDICATOR NUMBER OF PEOPLE REACHED continued UNICEFUNINOORANICOVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE TABLE INDICATOR NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOL VED IN PARTICIPATORY ACTIONS SUPPORTING PLATFORMINDICATORS DEFINITION RATIONAL TOOLS Social media Indicator The number of engagements per relevant post on your top performing channel Definition Publicly visible engagements including likes reactions comments replies and sharesretweets Calculation Select your top performing social media channel eg Facebook and identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the reporting period For these posts take the total number of engagements and divide by the number of posts Rationale Due to the limitations of existing tools there is no simple accurate way to convert the number of engagements to the number of people engaged Accordingly this metric aims to give an indication of the number of people engaged through social media while reducing the potential for double counting Public engagements indicate support and interest in your content and they are also more easily comparable across different platforms Dividing the total number of engagements by the number of posts reduces the risk of double counting Focusing on your top performing channel simplifies this process Considerations To simplify data collection across different platforms country offices can use tools that aggregate engagements into single dashboardNative analytics eg Facebook Insights Twitter Analytics etc Country offices can use tools that aggregate results across accounts such as Talkwalker Social Bakers Hootsuite Fan Page Karma or similar Web Indicator Average time on page for relevant content relating to harmful practices Definition Average amount of time all users spend on pages relating to harmful practices Rationale Average time on page is an indication of how long users spend on webpage before clicking to another page longer duration can indicate that users are finding the content interesting or informative Please note that using of returning visitors is not recommended as the Global Data Protection Regulation GDPR may affect the accuracy of dataGoogle Analytics TV and radio Indicator The number of people engaged through interactive radio and TV platformsprogrammes especially community radio Definition The number of people who callin via interactive TVradio programmesVaries by platform May be reported by the station broadcaster or digital tools Print and online newsNA not likely relevant NA RapidPro enabled programmes includes UReport days chatbots etcIndicator The number of messages received in messaging programmes that have incorporated content on harmful practices Definition The number of messages received from users on RapidPro flows on harmful practices The number of messages received from users on CaseProUPartners platforms The number of messages received from users through other RapidPro activities eg via RapidPro API Rationale The number of messages received from user in message service relating to harmful practices is the strongest indicator of the level of engagement with your content This is also comparable across different messaging platforms and accounts for the digital messaging channel modality where due to length restrictions eg length of SMS content is often broken up across series of messagesRapidPro CaseProU Partners Realtime Datadriven Dashboards RDCOVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE SUPPORTING PLATFORMINDICATORS DEFINITION RATIONAL TOOLS Internet of Good ThingsIndicator The number of poll survey and question responses and

to harmful practices that are submitted on the IOGT site added with the total number of comments posted across articles relating to harmful practices that do not violate community terms and conditions Rationale IOGT has four opportunities for users to engage with the platform Polls Surveys Openended questions Comments on the page Considerations Poll participation requires the user to login to the website and is therefore infrequently used but represents the most engaged response user can initiate Comments surveys and openended questions can be configured to allow anonymous responses and therefore tend to have more engagement This data cannot be successfully pulled from Google Analytics and requires login to the Content Management System of your IOGT site in order to access and aggregate total reportingGoogle Data Studio Dashboard Other digital toolsIndicator Guidance Can be adapted from some of the suggested indicators above Rationale Offices may employ additional digital tools such as Viamo or CommCare to engage target populations on actions relating to harmful practices When measuring engagement through these tools reporting should capture the number of unique twoway user engagements completed without regard to the number of unique users Consideration Twoway communication through digital tool is defined as any time user feedback is solicited by the tool and

and secondary schools in wealthy cities including developing countries Tatnall Tatnall Davey Access to the Internet is seen as way to change education in profound ways Another term digital inclusion later took centre stage among media and researchers This term described the differences that existed between hardware and broadband access in particular this was about access to ICT knowledge in the home the school and the workplace These disparities in digital access that remained among poor undereducated and racialethnic minorities and may affect the quality of life although Ali Alam Taylor Rafiq observe studies have shown mixed results Helsper Livingstone Helsper The solution to inclusion is often described as community building therefore grassroots organizations and community centers began offering access to ICTs through their facilities Digital inclusion presupposes that people who are not connected to ICTs want to join the digital society and need assistance in understanding the importance of the technology Rather than try to find who was not connected the notion put forward in digital inclusion was to work toward bringing underserved populationspeople in underdeveloped and developing nations poor undereducated people and racialethnic minorities in the United Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse States and minority populations around the worldinto the already existing digital society The word inclusion is perceived as being more forwardthinking than the term divide when it comes to describing the state of digital affairs Despite the shift in terminology and focus several scholars and organizations around the world remain committed to the concept of the digital divide In doing so they have discovered more nuanced approaches to understanding the digital divide The second wave of digital divide interrogates access as both physical and intellectual and usage as place and purpose was introduced by Hargittai by investigating user differences in ICT skills According to Bean and Kern digital literacy is seen in the light of praxeology as school teachers carry out educational practices aimed at reducing risk behaviors facilitated by digital media and most frequently associated with student cyberbullying Pyalski The digital environment has been blamed for underutilised opportunities for learning creativity and social connectivity Lomax Murray Pyer According to the House of Lords as cited in Lomax Murray and Pyer no child should leave school without wellrounded understanding of the digital world Digital literacy concepts have slight differences in reach or focus areas and their meanings often overlap Zhang Zhu Digital literacy is described as intelligence assembly by Paul Gilster as cited in Pool and includes how to assimilate the information analyze it and reintegrate it Digital literacy refers to the ability of individuals to use skills knowledge and understanding to make full use of the opportunities offered by the new media world as well as safeguard themselves from associated risks Martin as cited in Buckingham Digital literac is the aZareness attitude and abilit of individuals to appropriately use digital tools and facilities to identify access manage integrate evaluate analyse and synthesize digital resources construct new knowledge create media expressions and communicate with others in the context of specific life situations to enable constructive social action and to reflect upon this process Martin as cited in Buckingham International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences Digital literacy can be seen as an umbrella concept that includes elements of other literature that share conceptual grounds with other forms of literacy such as knowledge literacy that is capable of identifying finding assessing and using information UNESCO Cummins Becker Alexander media literacy that is the ability to access recognize and critically evaluate media messages

to Joyce Pham Stanton Fraser Payne Crellin McDougall the history of digital literacy and online education projects has been patchy for example in the UK despite recent calls for clear curriculum for digital media education since media education aims to teach students how to become critical media users through media analysis and media production Childrens Commissioner Hobbs as cited in Polizzi Previous research according to Marsh Hannon Lewis Ritchie and Plowman et al showed the early establishment of digital literacy in young children and learning through home technology Citing Grzig and Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse lafsson Livingstone Davidson Bryce Batool Haughton and Nandi observed that girls tended to report slightly fewer digital skills than boys and younger children reported considerably fewer skills than older teenagers Moreover skills of children with disabilities who are discriminated against or who are from disadvantaged backgrounds vary some have fewer skills commensurate with their fewer resources or available supports but others have developed skills partly through facing negative experiences online Livingstone et al Childrens digital literacy changed qualitatively with age for example at around to years children were concerned with what was real or not although they would not discriminate real from fake At to years children were more concerned with what was fun or even transgressive irrespective of whether it was trustworthy Lastly by to years their increasing maturity led teenagers to refocus on what was more valuable for them or more generally Livingstone Livingstone Kirwil Ponte Staksrud The shift in focus would be brought about by change in peer and parental relations with the children and had implications for the incidence of online risks encountered by children Ofcom Childrens digital literacy was found to increase fairly steadily from age to young adulthood Also with increasing age children gained digital literacy to realise that some but not all search engine results could be trusted Ofcom study comparing EU Kids Online and Net Children Go Mobile also showed little change in the levels of childrens digital literacy and safety skills since although children are now better able to manage their privacy settings and to delete their browsing history On the other hand the same comparison showed that the proportion of children whose profiles were public had nearly doubled from to of social network users aged between to which may reflect the diversification in social networks used Livingstone et al Schools are an important partner in ensuring child protection online Shipton Esafety guidance from schools is particularly helpful for children from underresourced households where parents lack confidence or expertise concerning digital media Livingstone Mascheroni Dreier Chaudron Lagae Whittle HamiltonGiachritsis and Beech found that support from schools along with support from parents and friends also assisted with the recovery of victims of online grooming and sexual abuse International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences According to Ofcom esafety strategies and initiatives schools would use in protecting children online include annual talks some with members of the police andor NSPCC representatives information videos and associated lesson plans We saw video on CBBC about girl and Direction and she gave out her details and didnt realize Girl years old Nottingham esafety pupil representatives am an eSafety rep at school and we help to tell others how to be safe online Girl years old Nottingham takehome contracts to share with parents to agree to terms of safe internet use and Safer Internet Day held once year and other campaigns In studying two primary schools Shipton found that the schools preferred developing the critical capabilities of the students rather than employing blanket filters This was done to ensure that children can manage risks both at school and elsewhere Aston and Brzyska further strengthen the argument for developing critical capacities among children by observing that majority of teachers felt that their pupils had the skills and knowledge to use the internet safely in school yet only felt that the children were similarly equipped to use it safely at home Other scholars Byrne et al revealed that high percentages of children had basic digital literacy skills but only about on average used the internet for creative activities creating blogs videos and websites Studies show that the more digitally literate children become the more they can gain from the internet while avoiding or coping with online risks Sonck Livingstone Kuiper de Haan According to Rouchun Zongkui Shuailei Qingqi and Chen citing Bronfenbrenner the family atmosphere is the most critical microsystem that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socioeconomic status as distal environment Access to familiarity with and skill using mobile devices are first step in achieving digital literacy study showed that most children started using mobile devices in their first year of life and use was enabled by parents who gave children device to use and to keep Three out of four parents gave children mobile device when doing chores and to keep them calm Kabali Irigoyen NunezDavis Budacki Mohanty Leister Bonner Digital literacy or eskills is crucial to childrens use of the internet Internet literacy is capability constitutive to utilizing the advantages of the Internet and as Knobel and Lankshear assert has close relationship with participation in cyberculture Byrne et al observe that the Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse creation of online content by children is means of selfexpression as well as an important vehicle for participation in matters that affect them participation being one of the underlying principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child broad concept of Internet literacy refers to the information skills and behaviors used in wide range of digital devices such as smartphones laptops PCs etc Taylor Dalal citing Julian Cybersafety risks for children when using video sharing platforms websites social networking sites and games include but are not limited to Exposure to pornography Violent content Contact and conduct risks Cyberbullying and associated low selfesteem and emotional responses Contact with unknown and online predation Content and practices that are not age appropriate through viewing media used by older siblings Identity theft and Malware Robinson citing Green et al The childrens limited digital literacy skills increase the potential for harm to them One report noted children of primary school age are particularly challenged in their cognitive and emotional abilities to cope with online risk It follows then that these risks increase where adult supervision is inadequate Baldry Sorrentino Farrington study by Tomczyk in the field of digital security in the school and family environment in Poland revealed that digital literacy was necessary especially in group of people who are responsible for facilitating digital safety good example is parents who are in contact with children all the time and most time give digital devices to children under their care with good reasons or to keep them off so that they can concentrate on their work Parents have to ensure an appropriate degree of digital protection at home since previous study revealed positive relation between socioeconomic status and digital literacy Tran et al However study by Moawad and Ebrahem reported negative correlation between adolescents technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology the more their social interaction with their parents was affected On the other hand teachers help their students improve their digital literacy Savage Because of the nature of their work teachers also have responsibility to create approaches that promote effective media exposure and socialisation This is only feasible if teachers have sufficient and uptodate information about the risks emerging from digital media prevalence Teachers International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences particularly teaching in primary school bear particular responsibility for ensuring digital safety CortinaPrez GallardoVigil JimnezJimnez TrujilloTorres At the educational point teachers can influence the behaviors of students that would allow them to protect themselves from traditional and nonstandard ethreats such as problem Internet usage cyberbullying image security recognition of false information sexting copyright infringements hygiene of digital media navigation sensitivity to Internet challenges Digital literacy is undergoing constant changes as the information system is undergoing simultaneous transformations Digital literacy requires not just the technological capacity to use digital media but also the mechanisms linked to risky behavior awareness study in the UK showed that one would be termed as internet literate when they can find information confidently they can send an instant message fix problem on their computer or set up an email account or even download music Internet literate children may also be able to filter or remove virus from their computer among other activities Boys were found to be more skilled than girls For example when girl was able to send an instant message boy would be able to download music The study also revealed that internet skills increased with age Livingstone Bober Helsper Kenya with population of over million people as of is generally regarded as one of Africas most technologically advanced nations According to estimates about percent of the population is covered by third generation technology in but only of individuals and percent of households have internet access In addition Kenyas telecommunications revenues increased from USD billion in to USD billion in Okyere citing ITU Materials and Methods The study was carried out in Nairobi City County specifically Langata Subcounty Langata Subcounty is one of the nine subcounties in Nairobi City County which is one of the counties in the Republic of Kenya The SubCounty lies in the South West of Nairobi bordering Kajiado County to the North This subcounty has four divisions and eight wards namely Karen Hardy Lenana Nairobi West Olympic Mugumuini Bomas and South County This study site was selected because of its accessibility to Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse cyber cafes and highspeed Internet and the availability of many schools that had very well equipped computer labs and ICT Innovation Centres and good internet connection It was also preferred because it housed the various levels of population in terms of socioeconomic status comprising of the high class the middle class and the low class which is not characteristic of the other subcounties within Nairobi City County This subcounty also had several Information technology innovation centres The researchers utilized descriptive crosssectional design within concurrent mixed approach collecting and analysing both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time McCusker Gunaydin The study targeted children between ages years and years old from selected private and public primary schools in Langata Subcounty teachers parents and policy makers within the Department of children services and Directorate of Criminal Investigation Goddens formula informed the sample size determination of respondents plus of the sample size to cater for nonresponse by respondents making total of respondents Key Informant interviews were also carried out targeting parents Key informant teacher respondents Key informant Child protection officer respondents all sampled purposively The researchers utilised simple random stratified purposive sampling stratified sampling convenience and purposive sampling designs Three schools were selected from three regions within Langata Subcounty which included Karen South and Mugumuini wards The study sought both empirical data and secondary data from published sources like general and specific search engines Interviews and focused group discussions were carried FGDs which enabled the collection of data using interview guides questionnaires and FGD guides tools Quantitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of SPSS version Bivariate and multivariate statistics were applied to examine relationships between the independent and dependent variables Data were transformed to enable further inferential statistics to relate variables and help test hypotheses Findings were presented using graphs frequencies charts and tables Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis with the help of Nvivo version and presented in narrative and map forms Informed written consent was sought in writing and verbally from all respondents including teachers parents children and protection officers following the right International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences procedure who were prepared in advance on the nature of questioning including the degree of sensitivity of the subject Parents and guardians were approached to give consent on behalf of their children All participants were allowed to take part in the study However they were informed that if they wished to withdraw from the study at some point then they were allowed Ultimate confidentiality was observed in regards to the individuals sampled for purposes of data collection especially regarding the case studies No information provided by the children teachers parents child protection officers and government officials was shared with any other person for any purpose other than supervisors and where was required so to prepare this research report Lastly the researcher disseminated research findings as planned Results and Discussion This section presents characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents Besides the researchers present the type of schools respondents attended the risky actions by respondents when they go online and the categories of cyberbullying and abuse experienced while online Finally presented was digital literacy that was measured using twentyfive items among the respondents Table Distribution by response rate Frequency Percentage Complete questionnaires Not Completed questionnaires Total Source Field data The researchers purposively selected primary schools two private schools and two public schools per ward in the selected three wards out of the eight that existed from within Langata Subcounty in Nairobi The total sample was pupils out of which successfully filled and returned questionnaires The researchers invited children respondents aged years to years enrolled in primary public and private schools in Langata SubCounty in Nairobi City County in Kenya to participate in the study Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse Questionnaires were administered to the children and out of the questionnaires of the children either refused to or did not return their questionnaires good number filled the questionnaires successfully and returned The questionnaires that were filled successfully were sufficient for analysis for response rate That shows that automatically the study sample remained respondents Demographic Profile of Respondents This section presents the characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents The characteristics of the children were age gender class type of school residence and level of education of parents Of the respondents were girls while were boys The findings revealed that the highest number of those who successfully filled and returned questionnaires were class six pupils forming as shown in table The study found that were years old followed by were years old as the least number This may be attributed to the fact that most pupils after age may have transited to secondary school The highest number of respondents resided in the Mugumuini area followed by the Karen area and only resided in South because the response rate was low in South ward The study showed that pupils in public schools accessed the internet while in private schools accessed the internet This revealed that higher number of children in private schools access the internet compared to those in public schools This was because in private schools children used the internet even for their homework assignments very small but equal number of respondents did not access the internet Children from private schools were from higher social economic status and therefore their parents afford internet and internet access gadgets According to Rouchun Zongkui Shuailei Qingqi and Chen citing Bronfenbrenner the family atmosphere is the most critical microsystem that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socioeconomic status as distal environment Earlier survey results showed that families with elevated socioeconomic status had more Internet access devices and more Internet access resources for

through text messages through phones Whatsapp and email recorded the lowest considering it not easily used for cyberbullying Only had experienced abuse through the email International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences Most of the children did not either know how to use mails or use mails often the reason for low percentage Few had experienced abuse through WhatsApp since it was smartphone application and few of them had their phones Those who had experienced abuse through WhatsApp agreed to have shared with siblings or those who owned phones Others cited Facebook as

officer disclosed children were at risk on the internet The children were at risks of exposure online for example When children access the internet the pla games like Blue Whales Zhich ma be disastrous good eample is Zhen children end up committing suicide When children accept friend requests on social media and other platforms that exist it is risky because some are abducted mostly because they are interacting with people who enjoy anonymity It is scary that some pose as children and children easily trust and start engaging them These online strangers ask children for information and family details Zhich makes the children more vulnerable to trafficking Respondent th March Digital literacy was measured using twentyfive items among the respondents and the results revealed the following Findings on whether they frequently used the internet for schoolwork strongly disagreed while disagreed showing that more than half did not frequently use Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse the internet at school Respondents reported they played internet games on their own with agreeing and strongly agreeing About did not watch video clips on the

disagreed with spending time in virtual world as strongly disagreed and disagreed Children did not have the skill of writing blogs or online diaries and also bookmarking website as strongly disagreed and disagreed and strongly disagree and disagree respectively Children were not able to block messages from someone they did not want to hear from strongly disagreed and disagreed Quite good number were undecided for they were neutral They also reported they were neither able to change privacy settings on social networking profile strongly disagreed while disagreed nor delete the record of which sites they had visited strongly disagreed and disagreed The findings showed that respondents could not block unwanted adverts or junk mailspam strongly disagreed and disagreed Children disagreed with being able to change filter preferences strongly disagreed and disagreed Again they were not able to find information on how to use the internet safely strongly disagreed and disagreed Finally respondents were unable to compare different websites to decide if the information was true strongly disagreed and disagreed Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse The findings revealed that children were limited in skills concerning digital literacy and were therefore highly internet illiterate and this would either expose them to online abuse or even would shield them from predators since they were not so much exposed to internet risk In comparison to what was indicated by prior literature kids like teenagers are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills Rodrguez de Dios Sonck de Haan Sonck Livingstone Kuiper de Haan Besides research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital

can be defined as internetspecific problemsolving strategies children adopt after negative experience online Vandoninck et al study by the EU Kids Online identified three main coping strategies passive responses that include fatalistic stop use the internet for while and selfaccusatory responses feeling guilty about what happened proactive responses such as reporting inappropriate content and contact blocking the unwanted contact etc and communicative responses talking with parents peers teachers or other trusted adults about what happened Livingstone Haddon Grzig lafsson Learning how to cope with negative experiences effectively is one of the most effective responses for any particular situation which is part of the process of building resilience among internet users Vandoninck et al Responding to online risks by seeking support from social networks is the most common coping strategy adopted by children although in most cases they tend to combine two strategies Livingstone et al Pearson Correlation Correlations estimate the strength of the linear relationship between two and only two variables Correlation coefficients range from perfect negative correlation to positive perfect positive correlation The closer International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences correlation coefficients get to or the stronger the correlation The closer correlation coefficient gets to zero the weaker the correlation is between the two variables Ordinal or ratio information or combination must be used After testing the hypothesis stated below the researcher obtained the following results as interpreted them as shown There is no relationship between exposure to the internet and digital literacy The correlation coefficient for exposure to the internet and digital online literacy was The number of respondents in the sample answering both items is and respectively The pvalue for this correlation coefficient was There is weak positive relationship between exposure to the internet and children internet digital literacy Table Distribution by Correlation between exposure to the internet and digital literacy Mexposure Mdigitallit Mexposu re Pearson Correlation Sig tailed Mdigitall it Pearson Correlation Sig tailed Source Field data Since alpha we fail to reject the null of no relationship and conclude that the relationship is not statistically significant The researcher used twotailed because the direction was not known earlier As shown in the table pvalue of indicates that the correlation is not significant and the two variables exposure and digital literacy are not linearly related This implied that even if the children are exposed to the internet that alone does not improve much of their digital or internet literacy hence there is need for them to be guided and assisted to navigate while using the internet for their security It can further be interpreted that children exposed to the Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse internet would fall prey to predators and abusers whose tricks are dynamic and they are always ahead of the children This is in agreement with Krueger who discovered Internet skills the ability to access the web was the most significant indicator of online participation and deal with emails People who are more familiar with the Internet and have good social skills and communication skills would benefit more from internet use consistent with the RichGetRicherTheory Kraut et al Table Distribution childrens knoZledge about the Internet in comparison to Parents Frequency Percent Not true bit true Very true Other Total Source Field data Comparing their knowledge with their parents about the use of the internet regarding the statement that know more about the internet than my parents more than half of the children revealed it was not true that they were more knowledgeable than their parents Other respondents said it was bit true agreed it was true their parents were more knowledgeable than them on matters internet and gave other reasons This concurs with study by Livingstone et al on how parents of young children manage digital devices at home Children dont believe that they have more internet abilities than their parents Livingstone et al This meant children had confidence in their parents guiding them on how to use the internet and keep safe However this is contrary to study by Moawad and Ebrahem that reported negative correlation between adolescents technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology the more their social interaction with their parents was affected This raises the question of interaction and guidance provided by parents as indicated in this study although this study sample included younger children who may be more trusting to their parents compared to adolescents who listen to their peers more International and Multidisciplinary Journal of

parents about the use of the internet regarding the statement that know more about the internet than my parents almost half of the respondents accepted that they knew about the internet than their teachers Respondents thought that they knew lot of things about the internet meaning they were confident in their teachers guiding and protecting them while using the internet further respondents felt that it was not true that they know more about the internet while small percentage thought it was not true they knew lot about the internet The reason being that they were either not accessing the internet they were not digitally literate or they were not confident enough Conclusion Access to cyberspace is no longer luxury but an everyday activity for many teachers and learners in the school environment at home and other environments like cyber This study found there was early access early exposure and early adoption of mobile media devices among young children in an urban lowincome moderate and highincome community Online child abuse is today recognised as global phenomenon since the internet has been found to have powerful impact on the lives of children throughout the world This would continue to grow and evolve While Internet access and child usage were highest in industrialized countries the global pace of web access and broadband penetration and the exponential uptake of mobile phone technologies coupled with increasing capacities and decreasing costs means that the rest of the world is beginning to catch up in the next few years Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse it is anticipated that the most dramatic changes will occur in low and middleincome countries Based on the findings of this study the researchers concluded that the responsibility of online child protection was for every stakeholder including the state parents teachers citizens netizens and children themselves It was also concluded that training and the creation of awareness were important elements to consider in protecting children online The study revealed low skills among parents and teachers on internet matters yet children looked up to them and believed they would guide them in remaining safe online Children were found to be digitally literate Digital literacy helped children to remain safe as well as exposing them to internetrelated risks as was revealed by other studies Only small proportion of contemporary adults had access to ICT when they were children particularly the tools that have facilitated the revolution in interaction and communication This has probably affected the ability of adults to understand and empathize with the ways children and young people use the Internet mobile phones and other new technologies This may be especially dead on target in societies where childrens social activity particularly that of adolescents has been under fairly direct parental observation or control Recommendations The government needs to develop strategies through the Ministry of Education to create institutional capacity to respond to online child abuse to educate minors in the responsible use of ICT Moreover programs for the prevention of cyberbullying should also integrate issues related to education about sexting and sexual solicitation among other harmful online child abuse issues Holistic intervention concerning the different risks found on the Internet is also necessary following the fast and dynamic nature of the growth accessibility and availability of the internet which people are exposed to as early as months Moreover sexual education programs in schools should address sexting as it seems to be new avenue through which adolescents express their sexuality Besides educators particularly teachers and parents should be informed about Internet risks and how to protect their children to educate their children on the responsible use of ICT with emphasis on digital skills International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences The onus is on governments and the private sector to ensure that protection is integrated into promoting the expansion of access and the positive benefits the Internet brings Cyber security awareness and training ought to be top priority for all African states This should be crosscutting from the vulnerable sector or people in the society schoolgoing children families industry captains critical national infrastructure handlers government officials and the entire African continent with its unique needs The government of Kenya through the Communications Authority to first track Establishing database on reported cybercrime cases affecting children Commissioning of national research on Online Child Sexual Exploitation which once completed would provide more reliable and full picture of OCSE in Kenya Developing training curriculum that could be used to train stakeholders on online safety of children and related risks and Developing National Child Online Framework Strategy The government needs to put in place the policy legal and regulatory framework which is also important That would require the involvement and support of the political leadership and goodwill at the very highest level The lawmakers must be well trained and sensitised to help implement legislation that addresses cyber threats at all levels There is need to address online child abuse at the continental level African countries need strong Information and Computer Technology institutions This may be utilised to train cyber security experts

study examined the cyberbullying experience and coping manners of adolescents in urban Vietnam and explored the mediating effect of different support to the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues Methods crosssectional study was performed on students at four secondary schools Cyberbullying experience coping strategies psychological problems and family peer and teacher support were obtained Structural equation modeling was utilized to determine the mediating effects of different support on associations between cyberbullying and psychological problems Results There were and of students who reported that they experienced and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last months respectively Among the victims only tried to stop the perpetrators Meanwhile the majority of observers belonged to the Intervene group who tried to report cyberbullying acts or help victims Family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among adolescents Conclusion The month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban adolescents aged was low However current coping strategies against cyberbullying were not sufficient Family support is an important factor that should be considered for designing interventions to mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying on

Volume Article INTRODUCTION Cyberbullying has been welldocumented as global public health problem Cyberbullying includes acts such as posting publicly available information on the Internet being called or receiving messages that threaten or being harassed on the Internet and others Patchin and Hinduja Compared with traditional bullying cyberbullying can occur every time and everywhere and the identity of the perpetrator may not be disclosed Patchin and Hinduja Therefore cyberbullying may be more frequent and have more serious consequences for the victim Studies show that cyberbullying significantly affects adolescents such as increasing the risk of depression anxiety and suicidal ideation Klomek et al Schneider et al Nixon Fahy et al Pabian and Vandebosch Yuchang et al as well as causing physical and psychosomatic problems such as difficulty sleeping headache and loss of appetite Beckman et al Schneider et al SchultzeKrumbholz et al Kowalski and Limber Cyberbullying is also associated with the onset of substance use traditional and cyberbullying perpetration and delinquency Mitchell et al Wong et al Chan and Wong Estvez et al These consequences have been observed in all perpetrators victims and observers of cyberbullying Beckman et al Wong et al Panumaporn et al Cyberbullying among adolescents is prevalent phenomenon across nations prior taxonomic review showed that to of adolescents experienced cyberbullying at least once in their lifetime Aboujaoude et al and this rate tends to increase with increasing Internet and social media accessibility Hamm et al In the United States the rate of adolescents who were victims of cyberbullying was from to Selkie et al study conducted in seven European countries showed that of adolescents aged years were victims of cyberbullying Athanasiou et al In the Asian region review in Chinese populations revealed different prevalence of cyberbullying victimization in adolescents ranging at in mainland China in Taiwan and in Hong Kong Chan and Wong In Korea adolescents were cyberbullying victims Lee and Shin Coping strategies when having cyberbullying experience may vary and can be classified into four groups directly reacting against cyberbullying acts such as retaliation or constructive feedback ignoring the cyberbullying behaviors such as avoidance or doing nothing seeking support from other sources such as parents friends or teachers and utilizing technological solutions such as blocking senders Perren et al study in Hong Kong indicated that older male adolescents were more likely to have an active approach to cope with cyberbullying such as informing to adults parents or teachers while adolescents having limited experience with their schools tended to have avoid eg ignore the cyberbullying behaviors approaches Chan and Wong Another study in Czech adolescents found that technological strategies were the most common following by avoidance and finding support Machackova et al The proliferation of cyberbullying requires accelerating efforts to explore approaches to prevent and mitigate its consequences Global studies showed that social support is an essential component in protecting adolescents from the consequences of traditional bullying KochenderferLadd and Skinner Davidson and Demaray Rothon et al Social support refers to instrumental support such as providing the victim with helpful solutions or resources or emotional support such as spiritual encouragement belongingness or value recognition House et al Kerres Malecki and Kilpatrick Demaray In literature many studies have shown that family and friends support can play an important role in protecting adolescents from becoming victims of cyberbullying Price and Dalgleish Fanti et al Hellfeldt et al In addition adolescents who are of school age can get help from teachers Previous research has shown that victims and perpetrators of cyberviolence possibly knew each other at school and parents friends and teachers are important sources of information and support for teens dealing with cyberbullying Slonje and Smith Although many studies showed that social support helps to prevent cyberbullying among adolescents its effectiveness in minimizing the psychological consequences of cyberbullying among victims or observers has been in debate An earlier study found that support from friends alone was effective in reducing psychological problems among victims of cyberbullying Holt and Espelage Another research found that both support from family and friends played an important role in preventing victims from the mental consequences of cyberbullying Rothon et al These results concluded that social support held the potential for minimizing the cyberbullyingrelated psychological problems in youths However the evidence for this effect in different population groups such as victims perpetrators or observers is limited In Vietnam evidence about cyberbullying among adolescents as well as the impact of social support on cyberbullying is currently limited Only one previous study was conducted on adolescents and youths aged in Hanoi Vietnam to measure the cyberbullying experience in these groups Chi et al By using the modified Patchin and Hindujas scale this study found that of sample had experienced cyberbullying at least once with being called by names as the most typical form Chi et al The common responses to cyberbullies included ignoring cyberbullying behaviors and not telling family or teacher Chi et al To date none of the studies were conducted about the mediation effect of social support on mental disorders in adolescents who were victims or observers of cyberbullying Therefore our study was conducted to examine the experience of adolescents aged in urban Vietnam determine how they coped with this issue and explore the preventive mediation effect of social support to the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues MATERIALS AND METHODS Theoretical Framework In this study we employed stress buffering hypothesis Cohen and Wills which perceived social support that could mediate the relationship between stressors ie cyberbullying in Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article this case and their negative consequences ie mental problems In other words higher level of social support could more weaken this relationship Cohen and Wills in their study suggested that social support could diminish peoples perceptions about the threat of given stressors or offer coping options or other necessary resources to individuals against the stressors Cohen and Wills Via literature review we hypothesized that support from family peers and teachers might play buffering role in mediating the effect of cyberbullying experience on the mental health of adolescents Holt and Espelage Rothon et al Therefore we examined the direct effect of cyberbullying experience on adolescents mental health as well as the indirect effect of social support in buffering relationships between cyberbullying and mental health Study Design Data of this paper were collected through crosssectional study conducted in Hanoi Vietnam from January to September Four secondary schools were randomly selected in this study from list of secondary schools in Hanoi The school principal and teachers were approached by the research team and informed of the research content The questionnaire used in this study was submitted to them for approval before implementing data collection Participants included students aged years attending four selected secondary schools and they as well as their parents and teachers agreed to be enrolled in the study This study used formula to estimate population proportion with specified relative precision to calculate the essential sample with according to previous research in Hanoi Vietnam Chi et al confidence level relative precision The sample size needed for school was students or students schools An additional sample size was added to prevent participants from dropout or nonresponse resulting in students or students per school being invited to respond to questions about cyberbullying multistage sampling method was applied First the research team randomly selected two classes in each grade of each school resulting in classes being selected for the sample Next in these classes students were randomly selected to participate in the cyberbullying survey There were students who did not agree to participate leading to total of students response rate of These students along with their parents or guardians were provided written informed consent with brief information about research objectives eligible criteria research process and benefits and requirements during study participation This research protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of Hanoi Medical University Code NCSHDDDDHYHN Data Collection and Measurement Students participating in this study were asked to complete an anonymous survey questionnaire The research team directly distributed the questionnaires to students During the survey parents teachers and unselected students did not present at the site of the survey to avoid their influence on the participants responses Each student spent min completing the questionnaire structured questionnaire was used for this study The content of the questionnaire was developed under the guidance of child violence experts The questionnaires were pretested on adolescents to ensure understandability expression and logic which aimed to avoid misunderstanding or confusion to study participants Variables Cyberbullying ExperienceBystander and Coping Strategies In this study we used the Cyberbullying Test instrument to identify the individuals experience and observation of cyberbullying Garaigordobil Originally this tool asked participants to answer items about cyberbullying acts in three roles items per role perpetrators victims and observers Examples of items in the instrument included the following Have they ever sent you offensive and insulting messages by cellphone or Internet Have you ever received offensive and insulting calls on your cellphone or by Internet Skype Have you ever been assaulted to tape the assault and hang it on the Internet Each question had four options about from never to always In this study we used only two parts of the instrument for victims and observers or bystanders Moreover in the pilot we observed that it was difficult for our participants ie secondary school students to respond to the questions with these four options Thus we decided to ask them serial of yesno questions to determine whether they experienced cyberbullying acts as victims and observers in the last months This recall duration was applied to minimize the potential recall bias Participants were categorized into Cyberbullying experience or Cyberbullying observation if they reported yes for at least one cyberbullying act The Cronbach alpha values of Cyberbullying experience and Cyberbullying observation items were and respectively In this study for people experiencing cyberbullying we asked them to recall the impacts of these cyberbullying acts coping strategies against cyberbullying supporters when facing cyberbullying and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying experience Meanwhile for those ever observing cyberbullying acts participants were asked to report their reactions toward these behaviors These reactions were classified into three groups Intervene Ignore and Join in Intervene included oppose acts of cyberbullying try to help or comfort the victim and report online violence to people able to help the victim eg teachers and parents Ignore included leaving cyberspace Join in included Encouraging cyberbullying behaviors and Enjoys cyberbullying acts and wants to learn more but does not participate or promote publicly In addition we asked them to explain the reasons if they did not report the observed cyberbullying acts We also asked all participants to express their attitude toward cyberbullying by asking them question What extend do you agree or Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article disagree with cyberbullying The students rated their attitude with an point Likert scale from Totally agree to Total disagree Psychological Problems To evaluate the psychological problems the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale Items DASS was utilized This instrument included items regarding depression seven items range score anxiety seven items range score and stress symptoms seven items range score in the last days Le et al Examples of items in the instrument included the following found it hard to wind down stress domain was aware of dryness of my mouth anxiety domain and could not seem to experience any positive feeling at all depression domain Lovibond and Lovibond Participants responded to each item on fourpoint Likert scale from Did not apply to me at all to Applied to me very much or most of the time Le et al higher score in each part indicated higher severity of this psychological problem The Vietnamese version of this instrument had been validated elsewhere Le et al The Cronbach alpha of this instrument was Social Support Support from family two items peer two items and teacher three items was measured by using seven items as below My parents do not understand me or care about my feelings My parents do not listen to me or do not pay attention to the problems have My classmates are very friendly My classmates respect me and listen to my opinion My teachers help me when Im sad or having problems My teachers take care of me and support me in achieving the best results My teachers respect me and listen to me Students rated each item on fivepoint Likert scale from Totally disagree to Totally agree The score of each domain was computed by dividing the total scores of items in this domain by the number of items Scores of questions and were reversed before computing the score of parental support The score of each domain was from to with greater score meaning higher level of support The Cronbach alpha of this instrument was Sociodemographic Characteristics In this part we collected data about age gender malefemale and type of family nuclearmultigenerationsothers Statistical Analysis pvalue of was used to detect statistical significance Stata software was used for analyzing data listwise deletion approach was applied to handle missing data Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables of interest Statistical tests including chisquare and MannWhitney tests were used to examine the difference between sociodemographic characteristics social support cyberbullying attitude and psychological problems between cyberbullying experience nonexperience and cyberbullying observationnonobservation Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with cyberbullying experience yes no model and cyberbullying observation yes no model Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics age gender and types of the family support from familypeerteachers cyberbullying attitude cyberbullying experience for model and cyberbullying observation for model Moreover among those ever observing cyberbullying acts in the last months we performed the multivariate logistic regression models to determine factors that were related to Intervene yes no model or Ignore yes no model behaviors Independent variables for models and included sociodemographic characteristics age gender and types of the family support from familypeerteachers cyberbullying attitude and cyberbullying experience We did not perform the regression analysis for the Join in outcome because only nine students had these behaviors which might not be large enough sample size for the analysis Finally structural equation mold SEM was used to examine the mediation effects of family peer and teacher support on the relationships between cyberbullying experience observation and psychological problems The roles of cyberbullying cyberbullying experience and observation were coded as binary variables yes no while the depression anxiety and stress variables were treated as continuous variables The mean and varianceadjusted maximum likelihood

model fits Kline Ethical Approval Given highly sensitive information collected from adolescents we performed the following actions to ensure the rights and benefits of participants First we provided an information package to students and their parentsguardians before the survey implementation This package had detailed information about the purposes of the study study designs eligible criteria rights and benefits of study participants It was also emphasized in the information package that the participation of students was voluntary and that relationships between the students and teachersschools would not be affected in any way if they did not participate in the survey No individual data were collected to protect students privacy thus it was impossible to reidentify the participants based on the current dataset Students and their caregivers were also informed that they could skip any questions that they felt uncomfortable or they could withdraw from the study at any time We offered the helpline in the Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article information package for students who needed help to address cyberbullyingrelated issues Contacts of the principal investigators and coordinators of this study were provided to answer all questions raised about the study RESULTS The characteristics of participants are presented in Table Among secondary school students the mean age was SD years There were and of students reporting that they experienced and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last months respectively No difference was observed regarding gender age and type of family between those with and without cyberbullying experience Meanwhile the rate of females in the cyberbullying observation group was significantly higher than that in the noncyberbullying observation significant age difference was also found between these two groups Table also reveals that people who experienced cyberbullying showed significantly lower levels of attitude against cyberbullying and lower levels of perceived family and teachers support but higher level of perceived peer support and higher depression anxiety and stress scores than did those not experiencing cyberbullying These differences were also observed between participants with and without cyberbullying observation except for the level of cyberbullying attitude Figure illustrates the month rate of each cyberbullying behavior in terms of experience and observation Stole password to prevent access to blogemail was the most common behavior when and of participants ever experienced and observed this behavior respectively Received offensive insulting messages on cellphoneby Internet and Slandered through the Internet telling lies or spread rumors were the second and third most common acts Among participants experiencing cyberbullying as victims Table indicates that of students felt anxiety and fear and did not want to be close to anyone Over of victims had reduced study performance had suicidal ideation and even had suicidal attempts However only tried to stop the perpetrators and told this experience to their friends None of them told teachers parents or relatives Try to cope by myself think my parents teachers or adults do not understand or believe me and think theres nothing my parents teachers or adults can do to

students were classified into Ignore and Join in categories respectively one student could do more than one act toward cyberbullying observation Being afraid of having limited use of the Internet if they reported cyberbullying behaviors thinking that adults did not understand or believe and thinking that adults could not do anything for victims were the three most popular reasons for not reporting the cyberbullying behaviors among observers Table Table shows associated factors with cyberbullying experience and observation Cyberbullying experience was only found to be associated with cyberbullying observation OR CI Meanwhile being female and of higher age were positively related to cyberbullying observation whereas having higher level of support from family OR CI was negatively associated with the cyberbullying observation In regression analysis only cyberbullying attitude was found to be associated with intervene behaviors OR CI Participants having higher level of peer support were more likely to ignore the cyberbullying acts OR CI while those having higher level of teacher support were less likely to ignore these acts OR CI Table The SEM is illustrated in Figure The goodnessoffit indices were acceptable with RMSEA CFI and SRMR The model shows that only cyberbullying experience showed significantly positive direct effect on psychological problems The cyberbullying experience group was significantly related to family and peer support while the cyberbullying observation group was only significantly associated with family support Only family support showed to be negatively associated with psychological problems whereas peer and teacher support showed positive relations with psychological problems Table determines the mediation or indirect effects of different types of support For both cyberbullying experience and observation only family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among our participants Regarding cyberbullying experience the indirect effect of family support accounted for of the total effect and of the direct effect Meanwhile regarding cyberbullying observation this indirect effect accounted for of the total effect and of the direct effect DISCUSSION Our study contributed to the current literature about the experience and coping strategies of adolescents toward cyberbullying and the potential effects of different support to mitigate the psychological consequence of cyberbullying Our study suggested low rate of cyberbullying experience and observation in secondary school students as well as high risk of psychological problems among those experiencing cyberbullying Moreover family support was an important protective source and helped mediate the relationship between cyberbullying and psychological problems The rate of adolescents involving in cyberbullying as victims over the past months in our study was low according to the selfreport information from the participants This rate was much lower than previous research in Hanoi Vietnam which showed that of adolescents aged were FIGURE The month rates

Our result was equivalent to previous study in the United States with of adolescents who studied grades to being bullied online in the past months Kowalski and Limber Overall the estimated prevalence of cyberbullying varied significantly between different studies and countries due to the difference of cyberbullying definition time frame and methods of measurement Berne et al Selkie et al Brochado et al which results in the problematic study comparisons Indeed using the Cyberbullying Test which was valid scale to measure cyberbullying Garaigordobil was advantageous to our study compared with other prior research This measure contains cyberbullying behaviors enabling us to capture more comprehensive aspects that participants might suffer or observe during the recall period than other previous studies Hellfeldt et al Livazovi and Ham Chi et al Panumaporn et al Notably our results showed that though the impact of cyberbullying was significant the proportion of participants taking specific actions against cyberbullying was not high In addition to the impact on academic performance there was high proportion of individuals who experienced cyberbullying suffering the negative psychological effects such as anxiety fear and even suicidal thoughts This was similar to previous studies showing the serious consequences of cyberbullying on the lives of victims Schneider et al Nixon Nonetheless the findings showed that only nearly of the victims tried to stop this act of the perpetration and TABLE Impacts reactions supporters and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying

Psychology April Volume Article tried to leave cyberspace We also observed that victims only shared with friends about the issue of cyberbullying but did not share it with parents or teachers The most common reasons for not sharing with parents or teachers were because the adolescents were afraid that the adults did not believe or the adults will not be able to do anything for the adolescents Another reason was that the victims wanted to solve this problem themselves In previous study in Vietnam it was found that ignoring this behavior and blocking the perpetrators account were the two most common measures and respectively Chi et al However problems caused by cyberbullying were not easy to deal with because these behaviors can occur at any time and can reach large numbers of audiences in short period of time Patchin and Hinduja causing feeling of stigma and isolation among victims Bossler et al Burton et al and in turn worsening the consequences of cyberbullying Therefore equipping adolescents with appropriate coping strategies against cyberbullying is essential and should be prioritized in school and family Our study also examined the rate of cyberbullying observers among adolescents and identified how they reacted to cyberbullying behaviors As expected we found that the majority of observers were in the group Intervene who responded to the cyberbullying acts by reporting these behaviors or helping victims This result was similar to the study in Thailand showing that most observers belonged to the Intervene group Panumaporn et al However our study was different from study results in Belgium where the authors show that most adolescents belonged to the Ignore group when observing cyberbullying behaviors Van Cleemput et al We assumed that the cultural factors might be attributable to this difference While the Western culture highlighted individualism the Asian culture emphasized the role of collectivism which might motivate them to help others when they faced problems Sittichai and Smith On the other hand similar to the victim group the main reasons that participants in the observer group did not report violent cyber behavior included being afraid of limited Internet use and believing that adults were unable to address this issue This result suggested huge gap in the relationships between parentteacher and adolescents especially among cyberbullying victims or observers Interestingly results of the multivariate models indicated an opposite trend between peer and teacher support when higher peer and teacher support were associated with higher and lower likelihoods of being Ignore people This phenomenon could be justified that adolescents peers might not perceive this issue as problem as adults did ie parents and teachers Slonje and Smith TABLE Associated factors with different types of cyberbullying observation CharacteristicsIntervene Ignore OR CI OR CI Gender female vs malea Age vs yearsa years years years Type of family

covariance between mediators and dependent variables Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article Moreover even when youth perceived the impacts of cyberbullying they could not provide adequate support due to the lack of knowledge and resource needed Therefore instead of recommending interventions on the issue they were more likely to advise to ignore cyberbullying behaviors It should be noted that the attitude against cyberbullying played an important role among adolescents in the Intervene group This finding was consistent with previous studies on both cyberbullying and traditional bullying ang and Kim Panumaporn et al Therefore campaigns to motivate adolescents to intervene in cyberbullying are critical to diminish this behavior and its impacts The findings of this study echoed previous evidence showing that cyberbullying experience was associated with psychological problems Beckman et al Schneider et al Nixon Wong et al Panumaporn et al Moreover our study underlined the protective mediation effects of category support on the association between cyberbullying experience and observation with psychological issues Unlike traditional bullying where parent friend and teacher support helped to mitigate the impact of bullying acts on victims lives and mental health Price and Dalgleish Fanti et al Hellfeldt et al in our study friend and teacher support did not buffer against the psychological problems among cyberbullying victims andor observers In literature adolescents are concerned that sharing their experience with the teacher was an ineffective strategy Price and Dalgleish and reporting the problem to their parents could hinder their freedom in Internet use Hoff Dianne and Mitchell Sidney However in previous survey in Sweden parent and teacher support was found to buffer against depressive and anxiety symptoms in cyberbullying victims and bully victims Hellfeldt et al Another longitudinal study found that adolescents who were victims of cyberbullying had lower levels of depressive symptoms if they had family support Machmutow et al As discussed above we believed that parents could offer appropriate emotional support to help adolescents in controlling the psychological distress caused by cyberbullying behaviors Livazovi and Ham Moreover they may be more likely to perceive accurately the problem of cyberbullying while friends might not fully recognize the trouble of cyberbullying involvement resulting in the provision of inadequate support Slonje and Smith This result is critical since most of the victims in our study sought help from friends rather than their parents Thus parents should be proactive in building strong bond with their children Nixon Slonje et al On the other hand our finding partially affirmed that peer support might not be the best focus to address cyberbullying and its consequence Hellfeldt et al However further longitudinal studies should be performed to test the effect of peer support on buffering the relationship between cyberbullying and psychological impairment in different contexts The current study indicated several implications First educational campaigns should be performed to raise adolescents parents and teachers awareness and attitude toward cyberbullying motivating them to become involved to intervene and prevent cyberbullying behaviors The contents of these interventions should include knowledge and practices on cyberbullying communication and Internet use skills and prosocial behaviors empathy and coping strategies with cyberbullying Hutson et al Regular training sessions should be performed to help adolescents in acquiring skills and abilities to actively cope with cyberbullying help other victims and prevent them from joining in cyberbullying Previous studies found that active strategies to cope with cyberbullying victimization were effective to address the cyberbullyingrelated issues Ybarra et al Riebel et al Chan and Wong Second according to the study leaders in schools and communities should implement activities that increase parents roles in addressing cyberbullying and its consequences among adolescents Positive parentchildren relationships could encourage adolescents to find support when dealing with difficult situations Chan and Chui Chan and Wong Finally given that cyberbullying is an emerging problem but school regulations for this issue do not exist in Vietnam current policies should consider this type of bullying and its impact especially among adolescents Interpretation of the study results should be done cautiously with the following limitations First given that cyberbullying is sensitive issue relying on only selfreports from participants may underestimate the actual rates of cyberbullying in adolescents In literature approaches that used information from multiple sources such as peers and teachers would be recommended Brochado et al Further studies that involve multiple reporters to measure the prevalence of TABLE Standardized indirect effects of cyberbullying experience and observation on psychological wellbeing outcomes via

school psychological problems Ngo et al Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology April Volume Article cyberbullying should be taken into account Second we used the crosssectional design which limited our ability to establish the causal associations Thus conclusions about the associations and effects in this study cannot be definitely drawn Future studies should use longitudinal designs to investigate the influence of cyberbullying and social support on psychological wellbeing in middle school adolescents Third the rate of cyberbullying experience and observation was low resulting in small sample size for statistical tests Moreover we used modified instrument to measure cyberbullying experience rather than use the original one which might underestimate or overestimate the rate of cyberbullying victimization and observation Finally other characteristics such as traditional bullying exposure the Internet or social media use and cyberbullying perpetration were not fully investigated These factors were found to be associated with cyberbullying victimization in previous work Beckman et al Athanasiou et al Chi et al Hence further studies should be elucidated to measure these relationships between these factors and cyberbullying experience CONCLUSION Our study suggested that the month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban adolescents aged in Vietnam was low However current coping strategies against cyberbullying in this group were not sufficient Family support is an important factor that should be considered for designing interventions to mitigate the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health of adolescentsDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by

['COVID and its implications for protect children online April COVID has prompted widespread school closures and physical distancing measures and made online platforms and communities essential to maintaining sense of normalcy Children and their families are turning to digital solutions more than ever to support childrens learning socialization and play While digital solutions provide huge opportunities for sustaining and promoting childrens rights these same tools may also increase childrens exposure to online risks This technical note sets out some of the key priorities and recommendations on how to mitigate those risks and promote positive online experiences for children COVID has abruptly pushed childrens daily lives online As of April COVID has led to at least countrywide school closures impacting more than of the worlds student population In places where there is wide access to digital technology more and more aspects of peoples daily lives are moving online as people choose or are asked to stay home Internet usage is up in some part of the world following the spread of COVID Similarly many childrens learning experiences are being reshaped by the sudden introduction of remote learning including where available technology and virtual platforms as substitute for the classroom and schoolyard Online games social media and video chat programs are providing opportunities for children to connect with and play with their friends parents and relatives while in isolation While children aged and older may already be familiar with social media the pandemic has introduced younger children to social networking tools that may not be designed for them and for which they may hold limited preparation Parents and caregivers meanwhile are being asked to navigate their childrens shift to online learning and recreation while balancing work and other uncertainties related to the pandemic Increased online activity supports childrens learning socialization and play but also puts them at heightened risk Increased internet use can put children at greater risk of online harms such as sexual exploitation and cyberbullying Not all risks will translate into actual harm but children facing other issues in their lives may be more vulnerable It is important that measures to mitigate risks should be balanced with childrens rights to freedom of expression access to information and privacy Keeping children informed and engaged and empowering them with the skills to use the internet safely is critical line of defence Online sexual exploitation The most recent Global Threat Assessment by WePROTECT Global Alliance and groundbreaking investigative reporting by New York Times set out the scale and impact of online sexual exploitation It is highly likely that COVID will heighten this risk to children as highlighted by national law enforcement agencies and civil society organisations around the world Spending more time online may increase the likelihood that children come into contact with online predators Physical distancing measures are likely to increase childrens outreach to new contacts and groups online which could be exploited by predators to groom children for sexual exploitation With more adults isolated at home there may also be additional demand for child sexual abuse material leading to more commercial sexual exploitation of children The livestreaming of sexual abuse by family members is already well documented phenomenon in certain communities Stayathome orders will also mean that families are forced to remain in close quarters which for children living with abusers could result in an escalation of sexual abuse both offline and online For example COPPA and GDPRK Cyberbullying It is wellestablished that cyberbullying is major concern among teenagers and has wide ranging negative impacts With many children suddenly experiencing extended periods of unstructured time online and grappling with mounting sources of stress cyberbullying could proliferate The COVID pandemic has also introduced instant messaging online gaming and chat services to an increasing number of young children who may have limited online experience and be less resilient to hurtful behavior Girls children with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID may be at increased risk of online bullying and discrimination Online risktaking behavior lack of inperson interaction with friends and partners may lead older children to engage in riskier behaviour online for example through sexting or the sharing of self generated sexualized content which may expose them to risks of extortion harassment and humiliation Potentially harmful content Increased online activity may expose children to ageinappropriate and potentially harmful content including content that is violent misogynistic xenophobic promotes political or ideological violence or incites suicide and selfharm Children may also be exposed to larger quantity of targeted online marketing that promotes unhealthy foods gender stereotypes or is ageinappropriate They may also be exposed to misinformation about COVID that could drive additional fear and anxiety Inappropriate collection use and sharing of data The shift of childrens lives online including via education technology may result in the added collection and processing of childrens personal data by companies along with increased exposure to digital marketing content and techniques This may affect children under years of age who normally have privacy protection by law Limited child safeguarding online With the rush to set up distance learning schools may not have proper child safeguarding policies in place to govern student and teacher conversations via private networks and other online tools Parents and caregivers may not be aware of school district policies if they exist and may be unfamiliar with new technologies limiting their ability to engage their children in discussion about keeping safe online Governments companies schools and parents must work together to ensure that childrens online experiences are safe and positive In the context of COVID keeping children safe online will require concerted urgent action on the part of parents and caregivers school authorities digital technology companies providers social service workers and governments Empower children online Parents and caregivers school authorities digital technology companies media providers social service workers and governments must recognize that children are agents of change and should equip them with the knowledge and information they need to navigate their online lives safely during the COVID crisis and beyond Messages information and advice on navigating the digital world should be targeted to children in manner and via the channels that most resonate with them Children should also be informed about how to seek out help and support Children should also be encouraged to use their voices online to support others in need of help during this crisisChildrens perspectives should inform improvements to platforms and other changes intended to keep them engaged and safe during this quickly moving emergency Government and social service providers should incorporate childrens voices and actively involve children in policymaking that pretend them Support parents and caregivers to help children stay safe online Parents and caregivers can help children access the online resources that are vital for learning socializing and playing in the era of COVID At the same time parents and caregivers need to be alert to the online risks for children Governments companies and others should support parents with appropriate guidance and tools including how to respond to and if needed report harmful contacts conduct and content Parents and caregivers can establish with their children rules for how when and where the Internet can be used Boundaries should be set to establish healthy balance between online time and other activities Parents and caregivers should also ensure their childrens devices have the latest software updates and antivirus programmes and ensure that privacy settings are set to high For younger children tools such as parental controls can help mitigate online risks Parents and caregivers can discuss openly with their children how and with whom the children are communicating online Children need to know that kind and supportive interactions are expected and that hurtful discriminatory or inappropriate contact is never okay Children should feel confident about telling trusted adult immediately if anything distressing or inappropriate occurs Parents and caregivers can also help children differentiate between regular content and advertisements and engage in dialogue with their children to seek to counteract any negative messages Parents and caregivers can be alert to signs of distress that may emerge in connection with childrens online activity For example if child is experiencing cyberbullying they may give off warning signs such as using their device more or less frequently or becoming withdrawn or depressed Governments companies and school administrators should make parents and caregivers familiar with relevant policies as well as online and offline reporting mechanisms Parents should have the numbers of support helplines and hotlines handy and contact the police if their childrens distress is related to threats potential crimes or other illegal behaviors Provide safe online learning experience for students Schools should create or update their current safeguarding policies to reflect the new realities for children learning from home Oneonone online interactions between school staff and students should be transparent and regulated Specific safeguards may include requiring schools to share online schedules advising children to wear appropriate clothing when in front of webcams and not to connect with their teachers or virtual classrooms from bedrooms and refraining from using private instant messaging services in teacherstudent communications or asking for consent from parents for such sessions Schools should also seek digital security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individual are able to access online learning platforms and that those platforms do not record and store the virtual learning sessions by default Schools should clearly communicate online safety policies and provide resources and information on digital safety to support parents and caregivers in creating positive online learning experience eg Interland internetmattersorg NSPCC and Childnet International Schools should clearly communicate with all learners the expected code of conduct on digital platforms and communications just as would be expected for in person behavior They should promote and monitor good online behavior among students Schools should be aware that younger children in particular may not have developed or practiced these skills before and could unintentionally hurt others Schoolyard bullying among classmates may easily morph into cyberbullying and school authorities need to adapt antibullying rules and policies to online spaces and make them clear to students and parents Schools should ensure that children have uninterrupted access to schoolbased counseling services In the absence of inperson contact with counselors children in distress must have safe confidential means of securing support online or by phone There may be increased need for counselling services in the context of COVID where children may be experiencing family problems domestic violence or heightened feelings of insecurity and anxiety Girls children with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID may be experiencing increased anxieties requiring additional support Schools should promote countryspecific helplines or online counselling platforms Schools should also update guidance for teachers on identifying and reporting child abuse or neglect via their virtual communications Make online platforms safe and accessible for children In order to avoid exacerbating inequalities during the pandemic technology companies should work with governments to improve access to digital devices and internet connectivity for disadvantaged children including those who are affected by poverty separated on the move disabled in domestic and family violence settings conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary caregivers to the pandemic ITUs new Global Network Resiliency Platform REGCOVID is place for regulators government authorities and industry to share and pool experiences ongoing initiatives and innovative policy and regulatory measures designed to help ensure communities and children remain connected Technology companies should also make online learning resources available for free or at significantly reduced cost to educators and students Mobile operators should consider providing online learning resources and COVID health information for free It is imperative that increased safety features are incorporated into all devices including those being made available at low or no cost and that parents and caregivers are instructed how to activate these features Companies that are developing and deploying virtual classrooms and other educationspecific platforms should make sure that safety features are integrated and enhanced and clearly accessible to educators parents and students Data collection and other commercial practices should be transparent responsible and reflective of nationalinternational laws and regulations Social networking platforms used for teacherstudent interactions should employ builtin protection measures for children while giving adult teachers appropriate permissions to carry out their functions Furthermore online platforms using video conferencing services which are increasingly being used for online interactive sessions should ensure that relevant security and privacy protections are in place Companies should use their platforms to promote and facilitate child safety referral services and helplines for the estimated billion children and youth currently out of school some of whom may be at increased risk of psychosocial stress violence and exploitation This includes sharing information on referral and other support services available for youth such as national Child Helplines Companies can seek to increase child helpline capacity with cloudbased infrastructure and by leveraging Interactive Representative Response IVRbot systems to automate helpline queries Mobile operators should enable short codes or freeofcost calls waving interconnect charges and promoting referral and helpline resources to children Given that the pandemic is bringing younger children onto education and social networks some for the first time companies should make significant efforts to help them and their parents and caregivers learn to use online resources safely This includes Adapting online safety resources to different age groups and making these resources more accessible on their platforms to inform children parents and caregivers of online risks and provide access to support services Offering clearly signposted and easy to use technical tools and solutions eg parental controls which can empower parents and caregivers to help their children experience digital technology in an ageappropriate way Amplifying messaging on safe and responsible behaviour online and supporting children to develop digital resilience skills in other words knowledge of how to navigate and respond to risks Strengthening national prevention response and support services Governments should actively monitor how restricted movement and lockdowns may exacerbate different forms of violence both offline and online using the latest data and existing models to inform policy Governments should enforce existing regulations and strengthen law enforcement to help monitor and respond to increased online risks Governments should allocate sufficient resources to bolster train and equip core child protection workers to ensure that they can continue to keep children safe throughout the pandemic Wherever possible countries should maintain centerbased supports and home visiting for those severely affected or adapt and deliver social services virtually Governments should train health education and social service workers on the impacts that COVID may have on child wellbeing including increased online risks Those providing front line mental healthpsychosocial support will need skills in talking to children about COVID and addressing their anxiety and insecurity Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable children including those separated on the move disabled in conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary caregivers to the pandemic Government should be aware of the potential increased online risks to children during the pandemic and seek to address them through increased monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations Law enforcement should be supported to monitor potential increase in online offending behavior and have their units functional to respond to this Governments should make sure social service providers schools parents caregivers and children are aware of local reporting mechanisms and that they have the support numbers of local helplines and hotlines If they do not already exist local helplines and hotlines should be installed to support children in distress The major international reporting networks include INHOPE Hotlines and IWF portals Children can find direct support through the nationallybased Child Helpline The public should be directed to contact the police when there is imminent risk To complement efforts to connect children to resources for online learning socialization and play governments should step up educational initiatives on child online safety These should include raising awareness about online risks and resources using media and other communications channels to spread key messages Additional Resources Parenting tips on

['Introduction Ethiopia has undergone rapid transformation over the past two years Soon after being appointed in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed an ethnic Oromo effectively dissolved the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front the party that had wielded absolute power since promising restoration of political freedoms and peace with neighbouring Eritrea that was recognised with Nobel Peace Prize Gardner Nobel Prize That same year saw the appointment of Ethiopias first female president SahleWork Zewde and cabinet in which half the positions are held by women This new era has seen improvements in peoples rights to voice and association but has also been accompanied by increased insecurity and violence which first erupted in and then spread throughout the country leaving hundreds of people dead and millions displaced Human Rights Watch This policy note synthesises findings from the Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE programmes round data collection to explore changes in Ethiopian adolescents access to voice and agency in the midst of the countrys dramatic political transformation It uses mixedmethods research that includes survey with adolescents and their caregivers and qualitative interviews with adolescents parents and service providers Respondents were from three diverse rural regions South Gondar Amhara East Hararghe Oromia and Zone Afar as well as three very different urban areas Debre Tabor in Amhara Batu in Oromia and Dire Dawa City Administration We pay careful attention to gender and regional differences in how young people between the ages of and are accessing decisionmaking opportunities within the family and community We also explore changes in adolescents mobility and access to safe space and social interactions with peers their access to ageappropriate information and digital Children are future leaders of the country Ethiopian adolescents access to voice and agencyPolicy Brief October Authors Elizabeth PreslerMarshal Nicola

discuss key actions needed to accelerate progress especially for girls if Sustainable Development Goal SDG womens full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels is to be achieved United Nations Key findings The broader changes unfolding across Ethiopia are reflected in myriad ways in adolescents lives Since our baseline research in adolescents have become more comfortable speaking up for what they need more involved in their communities have more say over when they leave the house and where they go enjoy better access to information and are more likely to have role model who inspires them Changes have not however accrued uniformly to all groups of adolescents Voice and decisionmaking in the household and community There has been substantial change over the past two years in adolescents ability to contribute to the decisions that shape their own lives their households and their communities although the patterning is complex As expected given that they are now two years older considerably more younger adolescents aged years reported feeling comfortable expressing their opinions to adults at midline than at baseline As also expected girls were less comfortable voicing their opinions than boys and especially in the case of older adolescents years where the gender divide was greater for girls compared to for boys This difference in the survey was however more muted than in the qualitative findings Our qualitative research suggests that this relative parity between girls and boys reflects girls lower expectations rather than their actual input to decisions with fathers admitting that they have very limited communication with their daughters and girls explaining that even their mothers have limited say What can talk about with my daughter There is nothing talk about with her exclaimed father from Debre Tabor Some mothers exercise their rights The power goes to fathers mostly explained married yearold girl from East Hararghe Our findings further highlight that girls have very little say in the decisions that shape their lives including whether and when to marry see Box cannot refuse If refuse the man who is going to marry me he would constitute given permission to take me by force emphasised yearold married girl from Zone Afar Our survey found that differences in adolescents voice by location were more notable than gender and age differences with those living in rural Amhara and urban areas far more comfortable with speaking up to adults than those living in rural Oromia approximately onehalf versus onethird This same patterning is reflected in an index capturing adolescents perceived input into household decision making which was higher in rural Amhara than in any other location especially compared to East Hararghe Our qualitative work suggests that differences are shaped by both cultural norms and access to services In Box can take care of myself Marta is yearold girl married at age and now divorced living in rural South Gondar She is exceptional not because of the age at which she was married but because of her determination to make her voice heard against formidable family and community pressures Marta was unable to refuse her marriage which was arranged by her grandfather because he wanted to see the family line continue But she drew the line at being made to leave school by her husband who was nearly years older and still studying himself said to him What am going to do if you finish your school and become government worker and leave me Am going to end up being farmer and take care of your babies Indeed having heard that girls can get pregnant even before menarche as soon as she was forced to become sexually active she went to the local health extension worker and demanded contraceptive implant asked her for the implant that lasts for three years didnt want to give birth before become mature and know myself better and become selfsufficient she explained Determined to escape her marriage and illiteracy and to realise her aspiration of going to university Marta stole grain from her inlaws and sold it to finance her escape When she was caught by cousin she fought back was beaten and forced to go back but refused told them that would commit suicide Although her father and her inlaws tried to intimidate her into returning to her husband Marta persisted She was allowed to divorce and was preparing before the disruptions brought by covid to start secondary school cannot refuse If refuse the man who is going to marry me he would be given permission to take me by force yearold married girl from Zone AfarMarried girls ha ve le ss access to friends information and technology than their unmarried peers have trust ed friendhave phonelisten to radioread the newspaperMarried girls ar less lik ely to East Hararghe whereas initial explanations surrounding school dropout and child marriage emphasised adolescents voice and adults inability to exercise control broader narratives highlighted how adolescent choices are shaped by adults demands She has quit on her own She doesnt want to go to school explained yearold inschool boy of his sister But there must be somebody to prepare foods and do all these tasks so that our mother orders her to do those tasks This view was reinforced by key informants As community leader in East Hararghe noted When boys and girls reach the age of adolescence conflict arises between the mother and such children Once mothers initiated the girls for marriage girls will go with someone for marriage In South Gondar where school enrolment rates are higher of younger adolescents enrolled compared to in East Hararghe and in Zone and schools are more likely to have active clubs on topics including gender and civic participation young people are more regularly exposed to messages about their rights including their rights to an education and to remain unmarried They teach us about discipline our rights and responsibilities and so on observed yearold girl who is member of her schools civics club take part in school clubs It is to get better knowledge added yearold girl who explained that she had drawn on this awareness to refuse marriage arranged by her parents In Zone Afar pastoralist realities shape dayto day adolescent decisionmaking Young people reported that they largely did as their parents told them because livestock need herding but that they have final control over the animals gifted to them by their parents If want to give them livestock can give them can also refuse to give them goat When refuse my family accepts my word noted yearold girl There have been increasing opportunities in recent years for adolescents to participate in their communities In our midline research this was most evident in East Hararghe where the regional youth movement known as qeerroo helped usher Abiy to power calling for redress of Oromo political and socioeconomic marginalisation While there is considerable debate about the role and nature of the qeerroo movement Jalata in our research sites our findings revealed qeerroos taking on some positive roles For example qeerroos were working beside government officials to provide for internally displaced persons and locating truant children and returning them to the classroom In addition in communities where it has been banned they were also involved in hoard fines from the parents of adolescents caught participating in traditional shegoye dances some areas have banned shegoye given its negative consequences for participants school attendance and performance The chairperson of the qeerroo in our kebele has connections and communications with kebele administrators explained an yearold boy participant Qeerroos work dayin and dayout and bring children to school Qeerroo enable us to solve the serious problems that we have emphasised father from remote community The index measures adolescents perception of having say about household issues such as how much time they spent helping around the house how much education they will get when and who they will marry who their friends are what they do in their free time when they can leave the house and their involvement in incomegenerating activities with higher scores indicating more perceived input into household decision makingGraphics made for GAGE by Ottavia PastaAlthough adolescents actions and voices are increasingly visible in and respected by communities in East Hararghe girls remain comparatively shut out by gender norms that position them as subservient yearold girl who is member of female qeerroo group now led by young man noted that when he asked her to take over the groups leadership she declined because she knew the community would never listen to her refused believing that this village will not accept my leadership In South Gondar Amhara and Zone Afar adolescents engagement in the community tends to be less formal and relatively rare In Zone yearold divorced girl added that her generation is completely ignored by local leaders Children are future leaders of the country but no one seems to think that way No one is concerned about the development of the area Even in our high school no one contacted us about what we need and what we are doing yearold boy from South Gondar noted that he and his friends had recently come together to fight desertification and climate change after hearing about the issue on the radio We got the information from the radio we planted number of trees Mobility access to safe spaces and peers Adolescents ability to control their movements outside of the home to access safe spaces and spend time with friends is also highly variable Overall and to be expected given that they are now two years older than at baseline adolescents mobility is improving Our midline survey found that of young people had left their kebele community at least once in the past three months and that fewer had had to seek permission to do so dont ask them and dont want their permission to go everywhere explained yearold boy from Zone Afar who noted that where he goes depends more on his livestock than his parent In line with the broader evidence base however this was far less true for girls Over half of boys but less than quarter of girls reported having recently left their communities Indeed girls were quite likely to report even greater restrictions on their mobility over time due to parents concerns about girls reputations and how they reflect family honour Our mothers do not let us get out of home once we are becoming older observed yearold girl from East Hararghe The boys are set free added girl of the same age from South Gondar Regional differences were also marked Adolescents from Zone Afar were least likely to have left their communities largely because they live in remote areas but also due to clan and interethnic violence that has made travel risky Those from East Hararghe were most likely to have travelled out of their kebele due to girls need to fetch water from distant water holes and adolescents greater engagement with the cash economy and markets There is no limit and can go to market based on need observed yearold girl from remote community in East Hararghe Box Marriage multiplies girls disadvantage across all domains Our survey found that married girls have significantly less access to mobility friends and information and communications technology ICT than their unmarried peers Compared to their unmarried peers older married girls years are less likely to have trusted friend versus have phone versus or listen to the radio versus Our qualitative work found that the limits on married girls worlds are shaped by social norms around the intrahousehold gender division of labour and husbands control of his wife Married girls across the regions in our study emphasised that they simply did not have time to engage with the world beyond their home We spend most of our time searching for firewood fetching water and working on the farm so we dont get time explained yearold married girl from East Hararghe It is those unmarried girls who attend school that have happiness Married girls have lot of household responsibilities and worries about their household added yearold married girl from South Gondar More important girls agreed was that husbands exert almost total control over their young wives lives say that have to wash clothes today have to fetch water or collect firewood These things know and decide on my own explained married yearold from South Gondar When asked whether she was allowed to have say in larger decisions she replied It is the man who knows Married girls added that while technology could help expand horizons even for those who are homebound it tends to be controlled by men Most of the time men sit and listen to the radio while chewing khat plant that acts as stimulant common in parts of Ethiopia together Females do not join them and listen to the radio never sit with them to listen to the radio reported married yearold girl from Zone Afar Children are future leaders of the country but no one seems to think that way Even in our high school no one contacted us about what we need and what we are doing yearold divorced girl in Zone AfarYounger adolescents were less likely to report having trusted friend at midline than at baseline compared to presumably because they are less likely to be enrolled in school and for some girls because they are more likely to be married see Box There were no differences between unmarried girls and boys However those living in urban areas or in East Hararghe were more likely to have confidant approximately than those living in South Gondar approximately and especially those living in pastoralist Zone Afar approximately The latter figure could be capturing the fact that due to more limited school enrolment in Afar adolescents are missing out on opportunities to forge relationships with school peers However our qualitative findings suggest that they have opportunities to build friendships with agemates many Afar adolescents are active participants in sadah cultural dance where boys and girls dance outside at night without parental supervision Adolescent boys also join faema tightly knit group of peers who support the elders in enforcing clan rules and sanctions and commonly reported on the close relationships that they enjoy with their faema Our qualitative work suggests that the violence unfolding across Ethiopia during midline data collection was often formidable barrier to friendship Younger adolescents years in South Gondar reported that gun violence and local deaths encouraged them to limit social interactions in East Hararghe their peers remained wary following the border conflict of late early that left hundreds of thousands displaced and in Afar as already mentioned clan and interethnic tensions have disrupted community mobility over the past two years Similarly older adolescents in urban areas specifically detailed how friendships had been disrupted by intercommunity violence In Dire Dawa in late our qualitative findings highlighted that students from different groups were unable to learn in mixed ethnic groups due to harassment and fighting and that some parents were forced to withdraw their children and move them to other schools For example yearold boy from Dire Dawa reported that he changed schools midyear to isolate myself from the daily violence that took place even inside classrooms yearold young woman with physical disability added that she can no longer use social media to communicate with her friends because her phone was stolen in melee at Debre Tabor University had mobile phone which is used to access Facebook but my phone was stolen during the conflict in this university was with my friends in the cafeteria and when the students commence throwing stones forgot my phone and left it on the table Access to ageappropriate information and digital technology Adolescents access to information and digital technology is also increasing as technology filters further into rural areas young people mature and the need to be aware of current events has taken on new urgency as political events unfold and violence spreads Although there are considerable differences by gender see Box residence location and age are the primary delimiters pattern established by our baseline research Among older adolescents of those living in urban areas and of those living in rural areas have read newspaper at least once in the past month Similarly of those in cities and only of those in rural areas have phone for their own use Among younger adolescents who are less likely to work and to be able to contribute to the purchase price figures for phone ownership are much lower and respectively Adolescents in our qualitative sample reported that improved access to digital technology is shaping not only their daily lives allowing them to communicate with friends and listen to music but also enabling them to invest in their futures used to download books explained yearold girl from Batu after noting that her phone had recently run out of charge Somewhat surprisingly given that they receive relatively little guidance from parents and educators adolescents quite often also saw the downsides Box The gender digital divide Across age groups and locations girls have significantly less access to information and digital technology than boys This is true of older forms of technology such as radio with of boys having listened at last once in the past month compared to only of girls It is also true of newer forms of technology with of boys but only of girls having mobile phone for their own use The gender gap is larger still in terms of phones with internet connectivity In urban areas of older boys have smartphone compared to of girls Our qualitative work highlights that gender norms prevent girls from using the digital technology that would allow them to access information First parents and then husbands are afraid that girls will use phones to illicitly communicate with boys and men In our area females do not have phones It is usually males who can have cell phone It is to prevent women from cheating with other men by calling through the phone explained yearold girl from Zone Afar Even in urban areas girls often reported that they must rely on word of mouth to learn what is going on around them collect information from people replied year old girl from Batu when asked how she learnt about current events In rural areas where girls mobility is more tightly restricted and their friends are just as likely to be deprived of information many girls have no exposure to political affairs Politics is like umm it is like umm dont know what it is confessed yearold girl from South Gondar of improved connectivity yearold girl from Dire Dawa admitted that while her phone helps her study it also facilitates timewasting There is chance of anything to be good or bad But our brain tends to balance towards the negative Even myself do not use it properly could download books and read but that is not what do In an attempt to capture the dynamic changes unfolding across Ethiopia our midline tools included new modules to explore adolescents political knowledge and beliefs These tools highlighted that while some young people primarily boys from rural East Hararghe and South Gondar are embracing active citizenship others are almost completely disenfranchised In East Hararghe of older adolescents reported that politics were very important to them Our qualitative findings underscored that the ascension of Prime Minister Abiy has been personally salient for many young people in these communities However his administration is increasingly seen as grave disappointment given perception of limited gains for Oromo communities coupled with increased ethnic violence and insecurity Moreover there have been campaigns by political activists to resist the Prime Ministers efforts to promote panethnic unity Nearly as many young people in South Gondar agreed that politics is very important There is now freedom of expression and transparency This is since the government changed and Dr Abiy came to power observed an yearold boy By contrast in Zone Afar of adolescents reported that politics were completely irrelevant to their lives and in the qualitative findings only one adolescent was able to name the Prime Minister when asked Urban adolescents despite their increased access to information were far less likely to report that politics were very important to them than rural adolescents Only of boys and of girls answered in the affirmative versus of boys and of girls in rural areas Our qualitative work found that for that minority social media serves as venue through which young people can discreetly engage in political movements Facebook users inform us about the political situation in the town person who uses Facebook can get access to new information like the violence that occurs in town explained yearold boy from South Gondar Similarly yearold adolescent boy from Dire Dawa noted have two Facebook pages use one of them to communicate with friends and to download videos However use the second one to upload secret political messages and to share videos of ethnic violence within our community The majority of urban adolescents reported either that they followed politics but do not really care of boys and of girls or that politics were completely irrelevant of boys and of girls Our qualitative work strongly suggests that urban adolescents apparent apathy is an attempt to disguise fear dont need to talk about politics only want peace and stability What matters is not the one who leads it must be about peace and stability explained yearold boy from Batu after noting that gangs had led to recent chaos in the city yearold girl from Debre Tabor agreed observing that university students have been fleeing to avoid violence It wasnt that much of problem in the past but now it is big problem These days university students are withdrawing because of the security issues and conflicts Role models In part driven by the changing world around them young adolescents were far more likely to report having role model at midline than at baseline versus Improvements were more marked among boys of whom reported an inspirational role model compared to only of girls and among those living in South Gondar where had role model compared to in East Hararghe and in Zone There is no one that consider as role model reported yearold girl from remote community in South Gondar Gender and regional divides were also apparent in the type of characteristics adolescents valued about their chosen role model Girls and boys alike admired those who were smart and successful though those from South Gondar tended to emphasise educational success and those from East Hararghe financial success My sister finished her education and started job she brings blankets for my father He blessed her so much when she gave him her gift When see her status started to focus on my education to be like her explained yearold boy from South Gondar when asked why he wanted to be like his sister Boys however and especially those from Zone Afar admired those whom they saw as strong while girls were attracted to those with good personality The individuals that girls and boys chose as role models spoke volumes about girls relative disadvantage While of boys who had role model said that that role model was from outside the home this was the case for only of girls Furthermore while boys were likely to choose someone famous of those with role models outside of the home or male friend or relative girls were far more likely to choose male relative than female friend and were very unlikely to choose someone famous This was also captured in our qualitative work Facebook users inform us about the political situation in the town yearold boy from South Gondarwhere boys singled out political leaders for emulation while girls did not want to be like Jawar an influential political activist because he is analyst of the entire world want to achieve like that goal stated younger boy from East Hararghe want to be like PM Abiy Ahmed add another from the same region Although Ethiopias president is woman no girl in either the quantitative or qualitative data spontaneously mentioned her as role model and few admitted to knowing about her even when pressed We heard her name stated yearold girl from East Hararghe Girls instead tended to mention uncles and older brothers and male cousins as having inspired them along particular path saw some who went to Addis Ababa University My cousins were also educated When saw them learning said would not be fool reported yearold divorced girl from Zone Afar now finishing secondary school after being married against her will at age Indeed even in South Gondar where there are more girls who could serve as role models girls remain likely to choose man on whom to pattern their aspirations He treats us well and he is polite and doesnt mistreat us explained yearold girl from South Gondar when asked why she chose her male English teacher as her role model famous man male elativ male elativ female friendGirls are less lik ely than boysto have role models and most often look up to men rather than women Who do adolesc ents look up to BOYS GIRLS saw some who went to Addis Ababa University My cousins were also educated When saw them learning said would not be fool yearold divorced girl from Zone Afar Graphics made for GAGE by Ottavia PastaThis

progress In order to capitalise on the opportunities opening up to adolescents in this time of rapid political and social change and yet also to keep them safe it is vital to balance young peoples growing pauperism for independence and connection with their need for protection In the case of adolescent girls given their marked disadvantages as highlighted by our findings across the domains of voice agency and mobility it is especially important to invest in addressing the barriers they face at household and community levels to set the foundations for the realisation of SDG ambitious vision of equal participation of women in the political arena Our research suggests the need for five broad actions to increase adolescents access to voice and agency and facilitate their maturation into empowered adults who can make decisions about their own lives and contribute meaningfully to their communities and country Invest in adolescent clubs and safe spaces that provide young people with opportunities to foster their own voices in childfriendly venues that over time segue into scaffolded community interactions Provide adolescents with school and community based opportunities to spend time with peers and with adults who can mentor them through the transition from childhood to adulthood Clubs including municipal youth centres should promote programming that endeavours to foster confidence and voice supports boys to become champions of gender equality and helps young people find meaningful and age appropriate ways to contribute to their communities Provide parents with parenting education courses that help caregivers balance adolescents needs for protection and participation Support parents to help them understand the importance of allowing adolescents to make ageappropriate decisions about their own lives and contribute to household decision making Focused attention should be paid to gender norms and the myriad ways they disempower girls and women Recognise that married girls are the most silenced and step up crosscommunity efforts to eliminate child marriage and support married girls agency Work with community leaders parents and adolescents to help them understand the advantages of adult marriage especially visvis investments in education and to cancel adolescentplanned marriages as well as sanctioning adults who facilitate these unions Simultaneously provide programming for young married couples aimed at fostering more egalitarian forms of communication and addressing gender inequities Foster an engaged citizenry by ensuring that civics education fosters democratic and peaceoriented beliefs and behaviours and counters misinformation Whether delivered by school curriculum andor in grassroots venues civics education for young people needs to focus on encouraging democratic and peace oriented beliefs and behaviours including in the home school and community It is also vital to teach young people how to critically consume information and detect misinformation Inspire girls by creating campaigns aimed at providing them with female role models These should include regional and nationallevel role models publicised on posters and billboards and in the school curriculum given girls limited access to other sources of information There should also be concerted efforts at the local level to highlight successful girls and women including to girls families and communities References Gardner Will Abiy Ahmeds bet on Ethiopias polit ical future pay off FP January https foreignpolicy comwillabiyahmedeprdfbetethiopia

development in children online risks such as sexual exploitation and abuse of children online SEACO also occur pilot study conducted in the Philippines identified exposure to exploitative strangers and cybersex as some of the risks that Filipino children are prone to when they go online In the study children aged to years disclosed that all of them have been exposed to cybersex sexual

study ICTs enable rapid and widespread production exchange and distribution of potential child sexual abuse material through social media newsgroups email andor instant messaging systems In addition UNICEF study revealed that in Filipino children and adolescents are in danger of being bullied or being sexually abused online Aside from cyber bullying and sexting other ICTfacilitated threats to children in the Philippines include exposure to pornography or sexually explicit content online grooming and sexual solicitation offline sexual abuse facilitated by the internet and social media child abuse material child pornography and online commercial sexual exploitation of children The Philippines has become known as top global source of materials on child sexual abuse More than child pornographic images are uploaded to the internet everyweek In random search made by research team found photos of individuals appearing to be aged between and years in various nude poses and sexual acts They were recognized as Filipinos because of their build clothing and facial structure In the same year paper on cyber trafficking of Filipino girls found evidence of commercial sexual exploitation of Filipino children online The Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse defines online child sexual abuse in two ways sexual abuse of children that is facilitated by ICTs onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and sexual abuse of children that is committed elsewhere and then repeated by sharing it online through for instance images and videos It is also important to note that online child sexual exploitation is not distinct type of sexual exploitation In this case the internet is used to exploit children hence online child sexual exploitation is an umbrella term to indicate sexual exploitation with an online component The online manifestations of child sexual exploitation include child pornography or child abuse material live online child sexual abuse and solicitation of children for sexual purposes Live streaming of child sexual abuse is new form of child abuse and exploitation enabled by ICTs Currently many live stream child sexual abuse cases have been noted to be on the rise Live stream child sexual abuse is conducted in private place usually house organized by an operator where children undress and perform sexual acts on each other following instructions from remote pedophile through webcam Money is sent to the operator through an international wire transfer as payment for the show which lasts from to minutes Money is sent through Western Union or local moneytransfer agencies like Cebuana Lhuiller and GCash These money transfer methods help identify and trace online child sex abusers Recently alternative ways like prepaid debit cards and Bitcoins have been used including online money transfer sites such as Xoom and Azimo These alternative ways of money transfer offer anonymity or false identities for financial transactions and can hinder prosecution of individuals involved Poverty is seen to be key driving force for children in becoming victims of online child sexual abuse other driving forces include good grasp of the English language affordable and widespread internet access the easy money perception of webcam sex and cultural norm of family first that promotes choosing the needs of the family over the childs welfare In addition consumerism among youth may drive involvement in online sexual exploitation where money is spent on food internet access clothes cell phone load alcohol and drugs In an exploratory study on the nature and extent of livestream sexual abuse in the Philippines conducted by Terre des Hommes found three main categories according to scale of operation individual operations familyrun operations and largescale organized operations called dens Individual operations are run from private homes internet cafes or Pisonet computers that will provide internet access for minutes for every PhP Children involved in online sexual abuse are also commonly involved in street prostitution Familyrun operations are common in very crowded and poor neighborhoods where children are coerced by parents and other family members Dens are largerscale operations involving whole neighborhoods or organized criminal group operations where children are hired or trafficked Locally published studies on the topic are few and most of the information comes from gray literature ie organization research reports student theses and government reports and documents News stories and articles are alternative sources of information While the facts presented in media reports are not based on systematic investigation of materials and resources as in published research these can still provide contextual background and preliminary data for further investigation This review aimed to present preliminary information on SEACO in the Philippines using

PHILIPPINA VOL NO Sexual Exploitation of ChildrenType of operation Table shows the distribution of cases according to type of operation There were five cases of familyrun operations of SEACO where children were exposed to cyber pornography by parents or other family members typically mothers Three of the reported cases were located in Barangay Cogon Cordova Cebu The family members involvement included being the pimp of their daughters guiding the sexual performances on and offcamera and sexual abuse of child oncamera There were two mothers involved in cybersex who exposed their daughters when their clients asked for children There were cases that involved cybersex dens hidden in two or threestory houses and rented apartments several in slum areas There was one encounter that occurred in hotel room Minors were initially recruited as babysitter or domestic helper or for work in internet cafs in the city and later forced into cybersex Cybersex operations involved uploading sexually explicit images of children nudity in front of webcam and live sexual performances with children or among children In one operation snapshots of naked children cost USD nudity in front of the webcam cost USD and live sex show among children cost as high as USD The children or parents got USDUSD per show Sudden show of increased wealth would arouse suspicion in the community but did not always prompt reporting The cybersex dens were discovered through disclosure from child victims tips from foreign agencies through information arising from investigations ie arrest of client in another country and through local surveillance based on tips from neighbors and informants The increased fortune of operators also leads to the proliferation of operations within communities giving rise to cottage industry in some towns In raids conducted of cybersex dens authorities confiscated cell phones computers laptops and tablets containing sexually explicit images of children as well as receipts for money transfer remittances from foreigners In eight cases cybersex operations masqueraded as fake call centers or business establishments that sold child pornography One of the operations rented building within school compound The staff of the cybersex operations would chat online with foreigners enticing them to subscribe to pornographic websites that contain images of Filipino Table

sextortion or the online sale of child sexual abuse material In sextortion victims are found through social media such as Facebook and lured into cybersex using video call services such as Skype The sexually explicit exchange is recorded by the suspects and is used to blackmail the victim in exchange for money DiSCuSSiON Despite the Philippines having reputation as global hub for cybercrime including child sexual exploitation not much is known about this topic Our review of media reports aimed to provide picture of SEACO however our study was limited due to the following constraints First we included only online news reports as these are readily available In trying to get more indepth reports we tried to obtain data from law enforcement agencies and child protection services however information was deemed confidential and classified Conversely journalistic investigation published in revealed that in livestreaming criminal cases have been reported in the Philippines which rose to cases in In ongoing livestreaming criminal cases were reported in the Philippines Second while the earliest news report obtained was from earlier studies have documented raids of cybersex dens and the rescue of minors as early as Thus the article from was an inaccurate marker of the emergence of SEACO in the Philippines and only reflected the point at which news reports became available online Third we aimed to gain more insight into the characteristics and circumstances of SEACO victims because of the challenges in gaining access to and collecting information from this vulnerable population however the news reports revealed very little information about SEACO victims Fourth details of SEACO operations that could be gathered from the news reports were limited by the amount of information contained in the news reports Still we think this review has contributed new and important information on the forms of SEACO and characteristics of offenders that have not been previously documented by other studies In this review incidents of SEACO were first reported in Olongapo City Cordova municipality in Cebu Cagayan de Oro and Davao City In the succeeding years cases were reported from contiguous provinces and cities suggesting that physical proximity may be factor in the spread of SEACO to other areas Figure Webcam child prostitution has been observed to be more prevalent in areas known for sex tourism although geographical link requires further investigation The areas identified in this review also coincided with research focus areas selected for the incidence of livestream child sexual abuse Angeles City Taguig City Cebu City and the municipality of Cordova in the province of Cebu As expected there was very little and vague information on victims due to confidentiality Since there were no consistent reports of the age and sex distribution of victims this review provided limited information on the characteristics of victims other than that of the youngest age of victim involved in SEACO which was reported to be months old The offender categories provided more information on the range of offenders involved in cybersex operations including consumers of child sexual abuse material and operators of cybersex operations Research suggests that offender motives vary according to type of offender most child sexual abuse material consumers are motivated by sexual gratification while other offenders are interested in profit alone Although studies typically describe consumers of SEACO as white men this study found foreigners not only as clients overseas but as partners of local operators The foreign offenders were mostly in their mids older than the average age of years seen in other studies Both men and women have been found to be involved as offenders in SEACO but females are reportedly involved to limited extent Their offenses are usually related to the possession production and distribution of child sexual abuse material In commercial sexual exploitation women are typically involved in running business operations and recruitment Women are rarely the primary offender in child sexual abuse However this review found that almost half of the offenders were women and that they played active roles in SEACO Their active participation ranged from recruitment trafficking and operating cybersex operations to the sexual abuse of child during webcam performances This review also highlighted the involvement of mothers in live streaming of child sexual abuse Individual operations involving children in webcam sexual performances from private residences Internet cafs or Pisonet were not covered by the news reports These operations lack an adult operator inability to conduct money transfer payments and poor English skills may make it difficult for children to receive payments The absence of an organized operation possibly allows this type of live stream sexual abuse to escape police surveillance Livestream child sexual abuse constitutes violation of several Philippine laws suspect may be charged with three different offenses namely child trafficking child pornography and child abuse In August the Philippines Department of Justice issued an advisory including the following laws as applicable on the issue of online child sexual abuse UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child Lanzarote Convention Republic Act No or the Special Protection of Children against Abuse Exploitation and Discrimination Act Republic Act No or the AntiChild Pornography Act of Republic Act No or the AntiViolence against Women and their Children Act of and Republic Act No or Cybercrime Prevention Act of Despite having ACTA MEDICA PHILIPPINA VOL NO Sexual Exploitation of Childrenthese laws in place reporting and prosecution of suspects is hindered by shortage of personnel to implement the laws Philippine privacy laws delay in prosecution due to authentication of foreign evidence lack of knowledge among legal practitioners low age of consent and lack of support for victims CONCL uSiON AND rECOMMENDATiONS Cases of SEACO have increasingly been reported in news and feature articles from almost every region in the country over the past ten years The national legal framework for responding to SEACO is comprehensive and in compliance with international standards However grappling with the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse of children online requires measures to prevent the proliferation of this industry in the country Identifying factors and addressing issues that encourage proliferation will be essential to impede its spread More information on victims and the circumstances that lead them to become involved in SEACO is needed The other players in SEACO also need to be looked into including law enforcement authorities telecommunications companies and money transfer agencies Our review is the first step in confronting this problem Acknowledgment The idea for this work was crafted during the

Appendix About the focus groups Appendix Compiled usage figures Appendix Detailed tables Topline Questionnaire PEW RESEARCH CENTER org Mobile Connectivity in Emerging Economies Publics see mobile phones and social media bringing certain benefits to them and their societies But these views are paired with widespread concerns about their impact on children After more than decade of studying the spread and impact of digital life in the United States Pew Research Center has intensified its exploration of the impact of online connectivity among populations in emerging economies where the prospect of swift and encompassing cul tural change propelled by digital devices might be even more dramatic than the effects felt in developed societies Surveys conducted in emerging and eveloping countries across four global regions find that the vast majority of adults in these countries own or have access to mobile phone of some kind And these mobile phones are not simply basic devices with little more than voice and texting capacity median of across these nations now have access to smartphone capable of accessing the internet and running apps In concert with this development social

them personally nd the challenges that digital life can pose for children are particularly notable source of concern Some of adults in these countries say people should be very concerned about children being Facebook has brought lot of advantages for our society However it has also affected society in negative way Just like anything which can be used for both good and bad social media have brought negatives and positives for people Man Philippines The countries in this report and why they were included This report is the first of several reports that will be issued this year based on nationally representative surveys of adults age and older conducted in countries located in four different regions of the globe United mexican states Venezuela and Colombia South Africa and Kenya India Vietnam and the Philippines and Tunisia Jordan and Lebanon These countries were selected for the survey based on number of crite ria Key goals of the country selection process were to assemble group of countries that Are middle income countries as defined by the World Bank Contain mix of people with different sorts of devices Many of these countries have notable variation in the share of their populations who have smartphones more basic phones or no phones at all Offer country level diversity and variety These countries offer variety of regional pol itical economic social cultural population size and geographic conditions Vary in their market conditions These countries differ in their technological and industry competitiveness and have range of networked readiness ratings as calculated by the World Economic Forum In many cases have high levels of internal or external migration Each of these countries exhibits rising levels of urbanization and most still have substantial rural populations special report examining the impact of mobile phones on the migrant experience is also forthcoming PEW RESEARCH CENTER org exposed to harmful or immoral content when using mobile phones and median of say mobile phones have had ad influence on children in their country They also express mixed opinions about the impact of increased connectivity on physical health and morality Some of these tensions between the upsides and downsides of digital life span all countries surveyed At other times there are nation specific elements to peoples views about what these technologies have brought to their lives For instance more than half of mobile phone users in five of these countries describe their phone as something they couldnt live without but users in six countries are more likely to describe it as something they dont always need These are among the major findings from new Pew Research Center survey conducted among adults in countries from Sept to Dec In addition to the survey the Center conducted focus groups with diverse groups of participants in Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia in March and their comments are included throughout the repo rt How the focus groups were conducted Pew Research Center conducted series of focus groups to better understand how people think about their own mobile phones and the impact of these devices on their society Five focus groups were held in each of the following four countries Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia Each focus group consisted of adults coming together for an hour and ha lf for discussion led by local professional moderator using guide developed by the Center For more information on how these groups were conducted see Appendix These groups were primarily used to help shape the survey questions asked in each of the countries But throughout the report we have also included quotations that illustrate some of the major themes that were discussed during the groups Quotations are chosen

personal and societal level publics are generally more likely to say mobile phones have had mostly good impact than say the same of social media median of of adults across these countries say mobile phones have been mostly good thing for society but that share falls to on the question of the impact of social media Indeed median of think social media have been mostly bad thing for society Second these publics are more likely to say that both mobile pho nes and social media have been mostly good for them personally than they are to say they have been mostly good for society As noted above an country median of say that mobile phones have been mostly good for society But an even larger share of say mobile phones have been mostly good for them personally When it comes to social media users of these sites are generally more likely to proclaim their benefits than non users Even among users peoples views of their personal impact tend to be mor positive than their views of their societal impact These broad themes tend to occur across the full scope of the countries surveyed But Kenyans and Vietnamese stand out somewhat for their more positive views of the societal impact of both

the social impact of these platforms in similar terms These differences between user and non users tend to exist across all age groups and education levels But in some countries such as Mexico Tunisia and Lebanon younger and more highly educated social media users are more likely to feel positive about social medias societal effects than older or less educated users For instance Mexico two thirds of to year old users feel that social media ha ve mostly been good thing for society compared with about half of social media users ages and above There is similar point gap on this question between Mexican social media users with secondary education or more and users with less than secondary education Social media platform messaging app users often more likely than non users to see social media as good for society of adults who say social media ha ve mostly been good thing for society Note Statistically significant differences in bold Respondents who gave other responses not shown Social media platform and messaging app users include those who said they use one or more of the seven specific online platforms measured in this survey Source Mobile Technology and Its Social Impact Survey

CENTER org Appendix About the focus groups Pew Research Center conducted series of focus groups to better understand how people think about their own mobile phones and the impact of these devices on their society Five focus groups were held in each of the following four countries Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia Each focus group consisted of adults coming together for an hour and half for discussion led by local professional moderator using guide developed by Pew Research Center In each country the groups were structured according to the following criteria Group basic phone all participants either owned or shared basic phone that could not connect to the internet and were years old or older Group younger smartphone all participants owned or shared smartphone and were under the age of Group older smartphone all participants owned or shared smartphone and were at least years old Group women phone users all participants were women who either owned or shared phone including minimum of five participants who owned or shared smartphone and at least two participants were married and two were unmarried Group migrant phone users all participants either owned or shared phone including minimum of five participant who owned or shared smartphone and all either lived in place that was different from where they grew up or had family member who lived elsewhere All focus groups also required participants to have at least some interest in politics and aside from group which was all women they were balanced with regard to gender Aside from group participants were also required to use their phone at least once week Where feasible participants were also recruited to ensure diversity with regard to education levels employment status rural and urban location and the duration for which they have owned their phones Focus groups were held in four rather than all countries because of time and resources Countries were chosen purposefully to cover all four key regions included in the survey Latin America the Asia Pacific sub Saharan Africa and the Middle East and Nort Africa MENA PEW RESEARCH CENTER Focus groups were held in the following locations and on the following dates Mexico City Mexico March Manila Philippines March Nairobi Kenya March Tunis Tunisia March Systems Inc worked with local field partners in each of the four countries to recruit the participants using screener designed by Pew Research Center All participants were given financial remuneration for their time These groups were primarily used to help shape the survey questions asked in each of the countries But throughout the report we have also included quotations that illustrate some of the major themes that were discussed during the groups Quotations are chosen to provide context for the survey findings and are not necessarily representative of the majority opinion in any particular group or country Quotations may have been edited for gramma and clarity PEW RESEARCH CENTER org

has negative impact on sleep daytime functioning and mental health in adolescents We examine the prospective associations between digital media use and subsequent suicidal and non suicidal self harm Methods Shandong Adolescent ehavior Health Cohort SABHC is longitudinal study of adolescent behavior and health in Shandong China Participants included for the analysis were SABHC adolescents who were initially assessed in and were reassessed in selfadministered structured questionnaire was used to measure digital media use ie television watching internet use and mobile phone use on weekdays and at the weekend mental heal th and self harm Results Multi variable logistic regression analyses howed that daily internet use hours on weekdays odd ratio OR confidence interval CI and hours at the weekend OR CI and daily mobile phone use hours at the weekend OR CI were associated with increased risk of recurrent self harm Daily internet use hours on weekdays OR CI and hours at the weekend OR CI daily mobile phone use hours on weekdays OR CI and hours at the weekend OR CI were associated with increased risk of recurrent nonsuicidal self injury Limitations All data were selfreported and had no information about digital media consumption Conclusions Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be significant risk factor of selfharm suggesting that limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial to reduce risk of self harm Key words Digital media suicide attempt selfinjury adolescents cohort study Introduction Selfharm refers to intentional self poisoning or self injury irrespective of type of motive or the extent of suicidal intent Hawton et al including suicide attempt and nonsuicidal selfinjury NSSI Selfharm among you th is prevalent with to of adolescents having attempted suicide or afflicted selfharm Hawton et al Kann et al Liu et al Although most selfharms are low in lethality they are associated with clinical and functional impairment and are significant predictor of future elfharm and suicide Gould et al Hawton et al It is therefore essential to identify modifiable risk factors to develop effective intervention programs for youth self harm prevention In the modern society digital media transmitted over the internet computer network mobile smart phone tablet and or television TV has become an essential source or communication socialization and education Internet use in the world has increased considerably over the past few decades especially among youth Kaess et al According to Per Research Center of teens in the US report going online daily including who say they go online almost constantly Lenhart et al Digital media use has mixed effect on pediatric population well being with evidence of increased self esteem and perceived social support alongside harmful effects such as increased exposure to graphic content cyber bullying and risk of developing online addictive behaviors Best et al Kaess et al Tonioni et al Excessive digital media use may have detrimental impact on adolescents psychosocial development and mental health Kaess et al school performance Liu et al sleep disturbances and multiple risk taking behaviors such as disordered eating and substance abuse Levenson et al Park et al High profile cases of cyber bullying and suicide over the past decade ester et al and reports of suicide clusters facilitated by social media Robertson et al have caused an increas ed attention to better understand the association between internet use and self harm suicide Recent studies have demonstrated significant associations between pathological internet use or nternet addition and self injury Lam et al and suicidal behaviors Kaess et al Lin et al Marchant et al It has also been reported that rates of internet use were higher among adolescents who self harm than their peers who not use the internet as much Daine et al study examined the social dynamics surrounding media reporting on suicide in suicide prone community Poplar Grove USA with an enduring adolescent suicide problem and found that suicide deaths that were covered by digital media triggered significant cognitive dissonance which may generate opportunities for peer role modeling of suicide Mueller Celebrity suicides that generate large reaction from users on Twitter can also increase suicide isk Ueda These findings suggest that excessive digital media use may be significant risk factor of selfharm recent review of the association between social media internet us and suicide attempts in adolescent includes nine cross sectional studies published between and and concludes an independent association between problem atic use of social mediainternet and suicide attempts in young people Sedgwick et al However to our best knowledge most previous studies are cross sectional so that the direction of causality if any remains unclear as such further evaluation through longitudinal studies is warranted and they have been focused on pathological internet use or internet addiction Lam et al Liu et al Park et al and their findings are not consisten To address th ese limitations we conducted longitudinal study ith large community sample of adolescents in China to examine the prospective association between digital media use television watching internet use and mobile phone use and subsequent selfharm including suicid attempt and NSSI over year follow up Method Parti cipants and procedure Shandong Adolescent Behavior Health Cohort SABHC is longitudinal study of adolescent behavior and health in Shandong China total of adolescent students participated in SABHC baseline survey Detailed sampling and data collection have been published elsewhere Liu et al Liu et al In brief participants were sampled from middle and high schools in counties of Shan dong province with consideration of representativeness of the schools across the counties prior study collaboration convenience and budget for at least waves of data collection The study was approved by the research ethics committee of School of Public Health at Shandong University China We obtained permission to conduct the study from all the target schools and informed consent from participants before baseline survey Figure shows SABHC study flow chart The aseline survey was conducted amongst th graders in Nov ember December of Liu et al Liu et al Liu et al selfadministered structured adolescent health questionnaire AHQ was used to assess suicid attempt NSSI mental health digital media use and psychosocial factors Chen et al Liu Liu and Tein Liu et al Trained public health workers or master public health students administered AHQ to participants in their classrooms during regular school hours Before filling out the questionnaire participants were instructed to read the instructions carefully and were informed that the survey was anonymous their responses were blind to teachers and their participation was voluntary without any penalties for nonparticipation It took about minutes to complete the survey All th and th graders were not followed up because they were preparing for high school and college entrance exams respectively According to our study design th th and th graders at baseline were resurveyed one year later in The final analysis included participants who were initially assessed in and were reassessed in Measures Selfharm Selfharm was assessed using questions about suicide attempt and NSSI Suicide attempt was measured with the question Have you ever tried to kill yourself in your whole life for lifetime suicide attempt and Did you try to kill yourself during the past year for last year suicide attempt NSSI was measured with the question Have you ever tried to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself in your whole life for lifetime NSSI and Did you ever try to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself during the past year for last year NSSI If respondent answered yes on the question he or she was considered to have the behavior These questions have been used in our studie to assess suicidal behav ior and NSSI in Chinese adolescents Liu Liu et al Digital media use Three types of digital media exposure at baseline were surveyed including TV watching internet use for entertainment or ideo game playing and mobile phone use Respondents were asked the number of hours per day on weekdays and at the weekend that they had spent using each media in the past month which should be very different in weekdays at school and weekdays at home and may have diff erent effects on sleep and mental health Liu et al The following questions were specifically asked On an average school day how many hours do you watch TV On an average school day how many hours do you use the internet for entertainment or video game playing On an average school day how many hou rs do you use mobile smart phone On an average weekend day how many hou rs do you watch TV On an average weekend day how many hours do you use the nternet for entertainment or video game playing and On an average weekend day how many hours do you use mobile smart phone Covariates The following covariates were selected in the current study based on literature Hawton et al Kaess et al Liu and Buysse Liu et al andor if pvalues were less than in the univariate analysis for the ssociation between digital media use and self harm Lauw et al Anxio usdepressive symptoms The Chinese Youth Self Report YSR of Achenbachs Child Behavior Checklist was used to measure anxiousdepressive symptoms Achenbach Liu et al The YSR anxiousdepressed subscale consists of items that are rated on point scale not true somewhat or sometimes true and very true or often true The Cronbach alpha with the present sample was for the subscale For the present study items concerning elfharm were dropped when calculating the subscale score Impulsiveness The Eysenck impulsiveness scale was used to assess adolescents impulsivity Eysenck et al The scale is composed of items with modified response format from never or rarely sometimes often to always Example items are Do you often get into trouble because you do things without thinking and Are you an impulsive person The Cronbach alpha was with the current sample Other dolescent covariates were age gender chronic disease insomnia symptoms cigarette smoking and alcohol use Family factors included father education primary school middle school high school professional school or college or above family history of suicide or attempt selfreported family economic status excellent good fair poor or very poor and interparental relationship excellent good fair poor or separateddivorced died Statistical analysis Based on the history of selfharm at baseline and at year follow up participants were categorized into groups never self harm baseline self harm only recurrent self harm and new selfharm Chisquare tests were used to examine the differences in self harm across digital media use TV internet and mobile phone on weekdays and at the weekend Univariate and multi ple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between individual media use on weekdays and at the weekend and recurrent self harm and new self harm respec tively In the multivaria ble models covariates were adolescent factors anxiousdepressive symptoms impulsiveness age gender chronic disease insomnia symptoms cigarette smoking and alcohol use and family factors father education family history suicide or attempt self reported family economic status and inter parental relationship Primary statistical analyses were performed or selfharm Secondary analyses were performed for suicide attempt and NSSI respectively All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version Armonk NY IBM Corp Results Sample characteristics Of the thth graders and th graders who participated in the baseline survey were re survey ed at the year follow up and were included for the analysis The primary reason for loss to follow up was that some participants went to different classesschools However aseline adolescent and family demographic characteristics including age gender smoking drinking family history of suicid father education and occupation and family economic status were similar between participants who were re survey ed and those who were expected to be re survey ed all Of the participants mean age was years SD at baseline and half were males Table presents detailed sample characteristics at baseline Digital media use in Chinese adolescents On weekdays the mean time of digital media use at baseline was hours min day for watching TV hours min for internet use and hours min for mobile phone use respectively At the weekend the time of digital media use at baseline substantially increased hours min day for watching TV hours min for internet use and hours min for mobile phone use In other words watch ed TV used nternet and used mobile phone for at least hour day on weekdays watch ed TV used internet and used mobile at least hoursday at the weekend Table Selfharm at year follow up At year follow up participants engaged in self harm with for new self harm and for recurrent self harm As shown in Figure the incidence rates of new NSSI and suicide attempt ere and respectively and the incidence rates of recurrent NSSI and suicide attempt ere and respectively Associations between digital media use and self harm Table shows baseline digital media use on weekdays and at the weekend by selfharm On weekday internet use and mobile phone use were positively associated with self harm both At the weekend watching TV internet use and mobile phone use were all positi vely associated with self harm all Table shows crude and adjusted odds ratios of selfharm at year follow up associated with each digital media use Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that internet use hoursday on weekdays OR CI and hours day at the weekend OR CI mobile phone use hours day on weekends OR CI and hoursday at the weekend OR CI were significantly associated with increased risk of recurrent self harm after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates For NSSI baseline internet use hoursday on weekdays OR CI and hours day at the weekend OR CI mobile phone use hours day on weekdays OR CI and hours day OR CI and hoursday at the weekend OR CI were significantly as sociated with increased risk of recurrent NSSI after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates Table For suicide attempt baseline internet use hoursday on weekdays and hoursday at the weekend were significantly associated with fold increase in risk of new suicide attempt OR CI and an approximately fold increase in risk of recurrent suicide attempt OR CI respectively Watching TV at baseline was not independently associated with either subsequent NSSI or suicide attempt Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study to prospectively examine the association between digital media use and subsequent selfharm in large sample of Chinese adolescents Our major findings are internet use hoursday on weekdays and hours at the weekend were associated with an increase risk of recurrent self harm at year follow up after adjusting for adolescent and family covariates mobile phone use hoursday on weekends were associated with increased risk of recurrent self harm or suicide attempt internet use hours day on weekdays and hoursday at the weekend were associated with increase risks for new suicide attempt and recurrent suicide attempt respectively On average in American yearolds spent hours minutes per day on screen whilst yearolds spent hours minutes per day on screen Rideout According to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health children and young people from the UK aged years old on average spent hours on computer laptop tablet hours on their phone and hours watching TV on typical day Viner and Firth Compared to Western adolescents the averages of minutes of TV internet use and mobile phone use are lower in adolescents in China possibly due to authoritarian parenting health homework restriction or limited permit of using mobile phone at school and at home Despite relatively shorter time of digital media use in Chinese adolescents than Western peers our findings support the positive association of self harmsuicidal behavior with internet use particularly with internet addiction high levels of internet use and websites with self harm or suicide content Marchant et al Although the mechanis between digital media use and self harm is not yet clear there are several potential explanations First excessive digital media use andor internet addiction are associated with mental health problems such as depression hostility aggressive behaviors and ADHD symptoms Ko et al Lin et al Yen et al Liu et al all of which can increase risk of selfharm Liu et al Liu et al Second internet use or ocial media exposure may cause cyber bullying or peer harassment leading to depression decreased self worth hopelessness and loneliness all of which are precursors to suicidal behavio Hinduja et al John et al OKeeffe et al For example recent study of cyber victimizat ion across seven European countries found that cyberbullying is linked to higher use of social network sites in adolescents aged years Athanasiou et al In addition the feeling of lack and dissatisfaction when scrolling through newsfeed often results from constant lifesuccess comparisons eg comparing individuals true reality to their peers idealized eg perfectly Wechat or Instagr amed realitiesThese may result in having devastating consequences including self harm Third sleep insufficiency and sleep disturbance have been demonstrated to be associated with self harm Liu Liu and Buysse Liu et al Excessive digital media exposure may cause sleep loss and sleep and circadian rhythms disturbance Cain and Gradisar Chang et al Higuchi et al Fourth many adolescents may use the internet to look for information about sensitive top ics such as mental health and behavioral problems safe sexual practices or contraception and seek help online Collins et al Srivastava et al For example results suggest that there is substantial amount of sexual content in teen chat rooms both constructed by teens names utterances and present for teen users to be exposed to as observers Internet sites and activities that resemble chats may include discussions among participants in online video games posted comments on YouTube and comments on social networking sites Collins et al Research has shown that having sexual screen name or talking with peo ple known only online about sex and using chat rooms were asso ciated with higher likelihood of selfharm Mitchell and Ybarra The content and veracity of information found online can be harmful such as information about painstress release via self scathe and how to injure self or suicide Belfort et al Viewing images and reading information about self harm in digital media can normalize self harming behavior and discourage seeking professional help Daine et al and pencil lead to physical self harm and suicidal ideation Patchin and Hinduja Fifth recurrent self harm or new suicide attempts can be prompted by viewing selfharm related stories in digital media Zahl and Hawton Furthermore excessive digital media use may cause fatigue and cognitive functioning impairment poor judgement and impulsive behavior all of which in turn can lead to suicidal and nonsuicidal self harm de Cates et al Liu et al Further research is warranted to examine the psychosocial pathways and biological mechanisms including mediators and moderators between digital media use and self ham in adolescents It is interesting to note that atching TV was not independently associated with subsequent self harm This difference may be due to the inherent nature of watching TV versus the use of internet or smart phones Watching TV does not require interacting with others whereas using the internet and smart phon es does eg cyber bullying constant lifesuccess comparisons On the other hand TV programs may be more educational entertain ing enjoyable and less violent and sexual than contents in the internet or website Clinical and public health implications In the technologically driven digital era the use of digital media will undoubtedly continue to rise In the of adults and of teens ages have access to the Internet and Facebook is currently the most commonly used online social network Lenhart et al Perrin According to the th Statistical Report on Internet Development in China the number of Chinese netize ns reached million mobile Internet users reached million and the percentage of Internet surfing via mobile was as high as CNNIC Thus mobile phone is not only used for phone call but it is more likely used for internet and social communication Although digital media can provide wealth of information and resources that teens can use to learn socialize and communicate with peers and maintain their own health digital media also has negative impact on teens psychosocial development and health OKeeffe et al Our study demonstrates that excessive digital media use as associated with subsequent self harm Preventive strategies for self harm and comprehensive intervention programs at school family clinical practice and society levels are warranted Intervention programs should be designed to prevent excessive digit al media use and internet addiction and to educate adolescents to avoid unhealthy violent and sexual information when surfing the internet to improve adolescents mental health and reduce risk of self harm In the pediatricadolescent medicine practice se tting clinicians should engage in assessment and discussion about internet use especially for adolescents who have engaged in suicidal and non suicidal self harm or have mental health issues Marchant et al Strengths and limitations This study has several strengths First this is longitudinal study to examine the prospective association between digital media use and selfharm in large sample of adolescents Second participants were sampled from multiple counties and schools to be representative of adolescent student in the region Third the response rate of was acceptably high Fourth weekday and weekend use of digital media was examined separately Fifth multiple adolescent and family variables were statistically controlled for when examining the association between digital media use and self harm Furthermore it is particular ly important to examine suicide attempt and NSSI respectively Despite the strengths of the study hese findings need to be interpreted with considering the following limitations First all data were collected by self report which may have led to biased reporting of selfharm and digital media use However given that many individuals who have suicid attempt or self injury may never seek medical help or result in hospitalization self report ed measures remain valuable source of information about elfharm Hawton et al Owens et al Objective measures of digital media use or diary are desirable but self reports remain as the typical method in large scale epidemiologic al studies Second data on the content of digital media consumption were not collected It is not possible to distinguish the effects of the contents such as cyberbullying sexting and selfinjury encouraging that may lead to self harm Third internet addiction or pathological internet use is prevalent and is associated with mental health problems and suicidal behavior in adolescents Lin et al Marchant et al Tonioni et al Although excessive digital media use is symptom of internet addiction the impact of excessive digital media use and internet addiction on mental health and selfharm may be different Fourth although this sample is large it may not be powerful enough for examining the association between digital media use and suicide attempt because the incidence of suicide attempt was low Conclusions Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be significant risk factor of self harm Our study suggests that limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial to reduce risk of self harm References Achenbach TM Manual for the Youth Self Report and Prole Department of Psychiatry University of Vermont

childrens internet use amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing What do we know about the pathways to harm and vulnerability What do we know about protective factors What research gaps do we need to fill INTRODUCTION METHODOLOGY Evidence review methodology Analysis Limitations ACCESS ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES Activities and opportunities in general Digital health

Innocenti Discussion Paper Viewing sexual content online Sexual exploitation and abuse online Sexual solicitation online Sextortion Intimate partner violence online MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA APPENDIX METHODOLOGY AND SEARCH PROTOCOL Databases and search terms Results and screening REFERENCES Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Childrens lives are increasingly mediated by digital technologies yet our knowledge of how this affects their wellbeing is far from comprehensive We know for example that the online environment exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information The use of digital technologies can expand their opportunities reduce inequalities and contribute to the realization of childrens rights We also know that when children seek information online and want to learn they risk being exposed to inappropriate or potentially harmful content Yet when it comes to determining the longterm effects of internet use and online experiences on childrens wellbeing mental health or resilience the best we can do is make an educated guess This is just one evidence gap among many that need to be filled in order that society can support childrens positive use of digital technologies develop childrens skills and protect those who are vulnerable Filling these gaps would benefit children Their education relationships entertainment and participation in connected world increasingly depend on digital technologies Filling these gaps would also help to guide policy and programme responses and maximize the potential of technological advancements Our need for this knowledge has become even more acute as internet use rises during the global COVID pandemic This report identifies evaluates and synthesizes what has been learned from the most recent research about childrens experiences and outcomes relating to the internet and digital technologies It aims to inform policymakers educators child protection specialists industry and parents on the latest and best evidence and it proposes future research agenda The conceptual framework for the report is based on the wellestablished models of childrens internet use that underpin research by three international projects EU Kids Online Global Kids Online and Disrupting Harm We add to this in two ways First we pay particular attention to research on childrens sexual experiences and related risks online We do this because of the growing concern about the potential for harm online and because it reflects the priorities of the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti which funded this research as part of the Disrupting Harm project Second we examine research on childrens privacy in the digital environment because of its importance to childrens online opportunities risks and rights The methodology is rapid evidence review of two of the largest databases of peerreviewed outputs in science technology medicine social sciences and the arts and humanities Web of Science and Scopus We searched for all empirical studies concerned with digital technology and children published since We then screened the search results for relevance and methodological robustness The resulting studies were coded using version of the Global Kids Online framework We grouped our findings under seven research themes access activities and opportunities digital skills privacy online risk of harm online sexual activities and risks online and mental health and wellbeing Livingstone et al Livingstone Byrne et al Global Kids Online multinational research project on technologyfacilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse implemented in partnership by UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti ECPAT International and the International Criminal Police Organization INTERPOL Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Four overarching questions guided our review and helped us to identify the key evidence gaps What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use contributes positively to child outcomes and wellbeing What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use can amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience in children What are the remaining research gaps Below we summarize the findings in relation to these questions What do we know about how childrens internet use can contribute positively to child outcomes and wellbeing Children around the world primarily use mobile devices to access the internet for information and entertainment to connect with their friends and to engage with their community Increased internet and device uptake by society diminishes the gaps in internet access experienced by different groups of children In lowaccess contexts children lead the way in the adoption of new technologies and are online more than adults Some children experience the benefits more strongly than others Children from global South countries and poorer backgrounds face significant inequalities in relation to access to devices and the internet the quality and cost of connectivity and the availability of competent support from those around them Such inequalities create domino effect in other areas resulting in crosscountry inequalities in online activities and digital skills The online environment exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information This helps children to engage with others and become aware of different views The internet is also an important source of physical and mental health knowledge for children They value that it offers anonymity access to reliable information peer experiences and supportseeking options The internet can have positive effect on mental health and wellbeing Children who receive mental health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have improved outcomes What happens to children offline affects their experiences and outcomes online Their age gender home context and relationships with family peers and school are all important factors So too are such factors as the safety of their neighbourhood or whether they are overweight engage in substance abuse take sexual risks or are survivor of violence or sexual abuse How can childrens internet use amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they spend online The more children use the internet the more skills they develop and the more activities they can undertake But as they engage in wider range of online activities children are also more likely to Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper encounter risks However greater exposure to risk does not necessarily translate into more harm Children can be exposed to inappropriate or potentially harmful content when they are seeking information online For example some children view sexual content online to learn about sex but this content can expose them to sexually violent behaviours or genderbased sexual objectification Exposure to online risks may result in harm to the child Some studies show positive association between internet use risk encounters and negative outcomes These outcomes include anxiety depression suicidal thoughts and panic disorder Many studies show that cyberbullying victimization is associated with lower psychological wellbeing and externalizing behaviours such as feeling angry or acting out More children are bystanders of cyberbullying than they are bullies or victims This experience can have an adverse effect on childrens wellbeing over time Cyberbystanders display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school What do we know about the pathways to harm and vulnerability Children who are vulnerable offline are also more likely to be vulnerable online while protective offline factors can also reduce exposure to online risks Offline factors that create vulnerability or protection influence how children engage with the online environment Vulnerable children or those living with offline risks or disadvantage are more exposed to online risks and in turn find themselves more likely to experience harm and less able to find support Childrens overall wellbeing seems to affect how they engage with the internet For example lower level of happiness and life satisfaction is found to be associated with exposure to negative online content cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism but we do not know enough about why this is the case Children who experience violence neglect physical punishment psychological victimization parental conflict sexual harassment and offline solicitation are more likely to also be exposed to sexual solicitation online but again it is unclear exactly how or why this happens Some children are more vulnerable than others but who is vulnerable varies based on the type of online risk For example older teenagers LGBTQI children and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to engage in sexting behaviour and be victims of sextortion Girls are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation coercive sexting and cyberdating violence They are also more likely to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers and to have negative sexting experiences and are more negatively affected by cyberdating violence Children who experience one kind of online risk are also more likely to experience others For example online sexual solicitation is associated with exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online having contact with unknown people on social media voluntary sexting and video chatting with strangers Cyberbullying victimization and perpetration is associated with childrens greater exposure to negative online content and to cyberdating violence Lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer and intersex In our search of the recent literature we found no studies of the experiences of children with special educational needs or disabilities though there are reports documenting their greater exposure to online risks Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper There is connection between offending and victimization For example both the victims and perpetrators of cyberbullying tend to report weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family higher rates of loneliness being less liked at school and lower psychological wellbeing Perpetrators of cyberbullying and sextortion are also more likely to be victims Online and offline perpetration and victimization are also highly correlated This suggests that when children become the target of hurtful behaviour some respond in the same way creating snowball effect of risky conduct What do we know about protective factors There is limited evidence on what can protect children from negative online experiences and harm Some exploratory studies suggest that social support and childrens positive relationships with the people around them can act as protective factors Children who lack such social resources face double disadvantage they are more likely to experience online risks and are less likely to seek help Protective factors may differ based on the type of online risk though existing evidence addresses only few risks For example positive relationship with parents parental monitoring of childrens activities teacher care enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence and resilience are all protective factors for cyberbullying For cyberdating violence parental monitoring and emotional bonding can be protective factors Encouragement and support from parents teachers and peers can help children to become more confident internet users This is especially true for younger children Parents can reduce risks by imposing restrictions such as limiting the time children spend online But this can impede childrens skills and hinder opportunities Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in safety strategies Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect childrens privacy behaviours Protecting children online is more efficient when combined with supportive parenting more generally ie offline For example emerging evidence on cyberbullying shows that childrens overall relationships with their parents and general offline monitoring of their daytoday activities reduces childrens risk of cyberbullying more so than monitoring their online activities specifically What research gaps do we need to fill Robust highquality and comparable research is still necessary In many areas knowledge remains tentative The large majority of studies we found are based on small or nonrepresentative samples involve correlational analyses of crosssectional data and control for limited number of background variables While such studies offer some insights their limitations make it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider life environment We need better representation of the diversity of childrens circumstances At present most research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North Evidence regarding the preteenage years and from global South countries is sparse Filling these gaps will enhance our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper We still need to learn more about the positive effects of childrens internet use Only one fifth out of of the studies identified by the search explore opportunities and benefits of internet use In contrast childrens encounters with certain online risks particularly excessive internet use cyberbullying gambling and problematic gaming feature heavily in the research literature Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet without including variables related to the perceived quality or context of their internet use for example negative experiences related to online victimization or cyberbullying The focus on time spent above quality or context of use is serious limitation which constrains our understanding of which activities and risks are more likely to influence childrens outcomes There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to opportunities and risks We need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of childrens internet use to develop better understanding of what factors determine such differences and for which groups of children To do so we also need more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable comparative research This has been key objective of research conducted by the EU Kids Online and Global Kids Online research networks More evidence is needed on the outcomes of childrens internet use While studies may link childrens online experiences to risk and protective predictive factors in their life circumstances they rarely follow up on the consequences of childrens internet use over time to document either benefits or harms The evidence is particularly scarce in relation to longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health and resilience which require longitudinal research To develop the longitudinal evidence base in this field longterm investment and commitment to explore the outcomes of childrens internet use is needed We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are linked for example childrens online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations and generated hypotheses about how these shape childrens wellbeing in an increasingly digital world few recently published studies have tested these models We need better understanding of childrens digital ecology There needs to be some exploration of the nature of digital devices and online platforms and their policies applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm The pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability exposure to both offline and online risks and childrens responses to risk remain underexplored Investigating these pathways would entail developing model of mechanisms mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens background and living environment home school community with the occurrence of different types of risk and harm online This is main purpose of the Disrupting Harm project We have begun this process in our recent country comparative report comparing Global Kids Online findings for crossnational similarities and differences see Global Kids Online comparative report See also Setting the agenda for future research and analysis Stoilova et al and the projects CORE Children Online Research and Evidence and Youth Skills ySKILLS Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper There is an urgent need for childcentred research methods to complement the recent evidence We still do not understand enough about how children see these issues We need research on cultures of childhood as they are experienced by children and how these cultures change or not due to the online environment For example are there online sexual activities that may be tolerated or even encouraged because they have positive impacts on childrens evolving identities even though they may involve level of risk If so how much risk is acceptable and how do children themselves view and mitigate such risks Above all researchers should conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences in their own words For more on childcentred research see Third et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper INTRODUCTION An estimated one in three internet users globally is child This number is likely to be even higher in the global South Access to digital technology can help children to develop the skills and literacies they need to learn and prepare for life in an increasingly digital society It can give them access to health or education services or information on topics that are important for young people but may be taboo in their societies Yet internet access may also compound risks to children that unless managed could undermine their wellbeing Most importantly engagement with technologies is increasingly means of realizing childrens rights as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Use of digital technology is key driver of change and partly underpins the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals To develop appropriate policy and programme responses stakeholders need robust evidence on how children use the internet They need evidence on whether children can make use of the many opportunities it offers They also need to identify which risks of harm children may face online Such evidence can significantly contribute to the development of policies and programmes that support children and their parents teachers law enforcement officers and others who bear responsibilities for the protection of children It can also help the private sector to protect child rights and make decisions informed by the best interests of the child There have been numerous efforts to improve the global evidence base and support advocacy policy development and programming in this area Two such research efforts are particularly important to this review because they generate an international comparative evidence base of crosssectional nationally representative research with children and parents The first is Global Kids Online which was initiated in by the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti the London School of Economics and Political Science and the EU Kids Online network The project conducted in collaboration with country partners around the world uses research framework that seeks to assess the balance between online opportunities and risks of harm for childrens wellbeing The framework takes into account how interactions between offline and online factors may make difference to childrens experiences and outcomes It facilitates NorthSouth and SouthSouth collaboration and builds the capacity of national research institutions to increase sustainability in evidence generation Since directly comparable survey research has been fielded in countries covering more than children and parents In the EU Kids Online network expanded upon the Global Kids Online methodology and fielded comparable survey research in an additional countries We use the Global Kids Online research framework as point of reference The second research effort is Disrupting Harm project established in by the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and implemented by the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti the International Criminal Police Organization INTERPOL which facilitates global police cooperation and ECPAT International global network working to end the sexual exploitation of children Disrupting Livingstone et al Livingstone Livingstone Byrne et al Livingstone and Stoilova Livingstone Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Harm explores in depth childrens experiences of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse in countries in Eastern and Southern Africa and Southeast Asia This evidence review supports these research efforts by contributing to the development of the Disrupting Harm survey methodology as implemented by UNICEF It also responds to the broader need for evidence on the positive and negative effects of internet use on childrens wellbeing It assesses recent advances in the understanding and measurement of childrens online experiences identifies recent developments in the field and highlights pressing research gaps and limitations In light of growing concerns about the potential for harm to children in the digital environment we pay particular attention to research on childrens online privacy and the risk of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse Our research was guided by the following questions What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use contributes positively to child outcomes and wellbeing What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use can amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience in children What are the remaining research gaps For review of the earlier research literature see KardefeltWinther and Radford Allnock and Hynes Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper METHODOLOGY Evidence review methodology rapid evidence review method was used for this report This rapid review used systematic methods to search for and critically appraise published research Rapid evidence reviews are rigorous and explicit in their methodological approach and thus systematic but make concessions to the breadth or depth of the process for example by limiting the amount of grey literature extracting only key variables and performing simpler quality appraisal This report groups the rapid review findings around key aspects of childrens internet use and identifies future research needed to address evidence gaps We conducted keyword searches of the title abstract and text of studies in the Web of Science and Scopus databases We blended several groups of keywords technologybased childbased methodbased and violencebased see Appendix This yielded search results which were screened initially by title and abstract only and then by the full text Details of the search protocol are discussed in the Appendix The screening was based on whether the studies met the following predefined inclusion criteria publication based on primary survey research with children under years or review article offering summary of recent highquality studies from any country but published in English published since to account for advances in technology and how children use the internet deriving from research that was of high quality methodologically robust and preferably published in peerreviewed journal The requirement for highqua lity methodology was applied differently across the research themes For themes where we found little research such as activities and opportunities in relation to civic participation learning and socializing the criteria were more inclusive and some exploratory studies are discussed In such cases we treat the findings as indicative offering an insight into where more robust research could be productive For themes where more research is available notably risk of harm online in relation to cyberbullying we focus on studies with more robust methodologies and representative survey samples After applying the inclusion criteria the resulting of studies the final sample were coded and summarized for the review Analysis We develop ed code for each of the key research themes using topdown coding framework based on wellestablished models of childrens internet use The final search results were allocated to the relevant themes allowing for one article to receive multiple codes New codes were formulated to facilitate the development of more comprehensive review of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse Each study was analysed for its findings methods and measures and suggestions for furthe research Grant and Booth Livingstone et al Livingstone Byrne et al UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World

and wellbeing otal number of coded studies some studies were coded in more than one theme Limitations Limitations of the rapid evidence review This evidence review updates previous reviews of the evidence on childrens internet use and cross country comparisons by the Global Kids Online network It includes only the most recent studies published since across range of research themes As result valuable earlier studies were omitted and should be considered separately for full indepth review Our purpose was to discover new developments and the themes studied most recently how they have been researched methods and gaps and what the newest evidence suggests We did not expand the search with additional These studies were coded but then excluded from the analysis as this area has already been extensively covered elsewhere full review would be required to account for existing methodological shortcomings and limitations inherent to this subfield which was beyond the scope of this assignment For recent review and discussion paper by UNICEF covering excessive internet use and gaming see KardefeltWinther UNICEF We explore sexual activities separately from risks of harm online partly to provide more specific focus on risks related to sexual activities but also to suggest that not all of childrens sexual activities are risky some may be part of childrens sexual exploration and identity Livingstone and Bulger Byrne et al UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper keywords specific to each theme such as access or skillsrelated words because each themespecific search could constitute separate evidence review Restricting the search to the English language and to databases mainly oriented to the global North limited the evidence found from nonEnglishspeaking countries and the global South Limitations of the available research literature We found substantial imbalance across the reviewed research themes of childrens internet use see Figure While some areas such as addiction gambling and problematic gaming receive considerable attention others remain comparatively underresearched We excluded the body of literature concerned with hypothesized addiction to the internet gambling and excessive gaming partly because these areas have been covered elsewhere but also because of methodological shortcomings that make it difficult to interpret these results reliably reliable interpretation would require tailored review to query specific methodological issues which was beyond the scope of this assignment Generally we found more literature on childrens encounters with online risks than on their positive experiences activities and skills This suggests need for better balance in research on childrens internet use Another imbalance relates to the type of research participant Studies most often sample older teenagers while research on children under years of age is generally missing from the evidence base Some studies conflate children with young adults The studies we reviewed vary significantly in the definitions and the measures used for ostensibly the same construct for example cyberbullying This makes comparability across studies difficult The large majority of studies are based on small or nonrepresentative samples that make it difficult to generalize from the findings Where such studies are included in the review the findings should be considered with caution They are exploratory in nature and highlight possible areas for further research Many studies conduct correlational analyses of crosssectional data This means that they cannot establish what is cause and effect or determine longterm consequences This makes the task of establishing pathway to harm and vulnerability or protective factors for resilience particularly difficult The analysis cannot determine whether an effect for instance high level of harm is the cause or the consequence of child using digital technology We draw insights where available from the small number of longitudinal studies found in the review More longitudinal research or research that deploys research designs that support causal inferences is needed to reach conclusions about the effect of childrens internet use on their wellbeing in the long term Also problematic is that in their statistical analyses most studies control for limited number of background variables These tend to prioritize childrens psychological characteristics or their internet use They only rarely examine the role of factors relating to the childs life situation home environment or parental mediation broad consideration of neighbourhood or community effects countrylevel indicators poverty and inequalities is often missing As discussed in UNICEF review this makes it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider environment Bearing the above in mind we begin the discussion of each research theme with brief note to explain the definitions and research methods typically used We note the limitations of the research highlight the key findings and draw out suggestions for further research For an overview of this literature see KardefeltWinther KardefeltWinther Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper ACCESS Access refers to how children log on to the internet It includes what devices they use to go online and the places of access such as home school friends house or an internet caf It also includes how much time children spend online and whether they can go online when they need or want to or experience some barriers in terms of permission cost or connectivity We reviewed studies on this theme They are diverse in relation to their geographical location as well as the areas they address The locations were Chile Malaysia the Russian Federation Singapore Spain Switzerland and the United States of America comparative study looked at Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The areas covered included the connections between access and learning outcomes reading habits and online activities and opportunities and the links between access and digital skills few studies examine the impact of inequalities on internet access Most of these reports provide only descriptive statistics derived from samples that are small or close at hand and sometimes both While it is unsuitable to use these limited studies for crosscountry comparisons of prevalence they broadly support the trends identified by the larger representative surveys reviewed Key findings Regardless of the country or context children tend to mainly use mobile phones to go online There are important differences in access between countries based on the level of internet and device uptake Countries with lower levels of uptake tend to have more access inequalities Children from poorer backgrounds face more barriers to going online Countries with high internet and device penetration see narrowing gaps in relation to access Here disparities relate more to the quality and cost of connectivity which affects what children do when they are online There are important differences in access relating to the age of first access and the number of devices used Children from wealthier backgrounds and country contexts tend to go online from younger age and have access to larger number of internetconnected devices Access inequalities also relate to the availability of competent support and mediation especially when children are younger In contexts with lower internet penetration children tend to lead the way and be online more than the adults around them This raises important questions about parental support and mediation few highquality studies examine access inequalities among children In their study Mascheroni and lafsson use data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately respondents aged years across seven European countries Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom They conclude that combination of social inequalities and differences in access to digital technologies results in disparities in online activities In these countries the probability of children owning smartphone increases by per cent on average for each year they grow older from the age of years though the exact figure varies by Mascheroni and lafsson Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper country Boys and girls get their first smartphone at similar age While in these countries socio economic status is not related to smartphone ownership children who start to use the internet later than average are less likely to own smartphone as are children whose parents do not use smartphone to go online longitudinal study in Switzerland of students aged years and parents also shows that familys socioeconomic status on its own predicts neither childrens internet access nor the availability of digital devices when controlling for childrens academic performance This may be due to number of factors such as devices being relatively inexpensive affluent parents trying to limit their childrens access to devices or parents with lower socioeconomic status trying to catch up and buy devices for their children to avoid social exclusion familys socioeconomic status is however associated with how children use the internet In this study from Switzerland children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tended to use the internet more often as form of communication and entertainment and less often for educational purposes Children who had access to larger number of digital devices also tended to use the internet more often for entertainment and socializing but this was not related to socioeconomic status Childrens smartphone ownership depends partly on how their family uses mobile devices It also depends on where the country stands on smartphone adoption in terms of the availability and cost of devices and data as well as the mainstream culture of adoption Age creates important differences Younger children are less likely to use smartphone to go online daily and are less likely to have an internet plan on their phone The availability and cost of connectivity also matter as do parental decisions to limit childrens unsupervised internet use especially at younger eld Some access inequalities can create further divides in relation to how children use the internet If children start to use the internet at an older age or do not use mobile phone daily they tend to engage in fewer online activities Research from Global Kids Online suggests that engaging in fewer online activities can have detrimental effect on the development of digital skills While this effect decreases with age it remains significant even for older children Several studies with samples too small or unrepresentative to generalize from the findings offer interesting though only indicative insights into childrens internet access For example survey of children aged years living in Moscow shows that even when children are not allowed to use mobile devices at school many still do The lack of integration of digital technologies into the educational process may however affect the type of activities they do online Instead of using mobile phones to learn and look for information children may focus on entertainment and socializing United Statesbased study researching the internet access of runaways or homeless children and youth shows that children and youth who are better educated or employed are more likely to own mobile phone Digital devices are an important source of connection for homeless children including staying in touch with family members who in some cases pay the phone bills Finally survey of parents and children in Chile showed that children use different strategies Camerini et al UNICEF Mascheroni and lafsson Koroleva Harpin et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper to influence their parents adoption of new technologies Whether children are successful depends on various factors including the type of device they want Success also depends on whether they use argumentative strategies taking into account their familys or parents perspectives by reasoning or bargaining or nonargumentative strategies begging demanding or whining to influence technology adoption Limitations and suggestions for further research Most studies offer narrow understanding of access to the internet It is most often researched in relation to being able to go online and having digital device available Other important factors that can create access inequalities are rarely explored including cultural factors and parental attitudes In some contexts cultural factors may even create additional inequalities for example in relation to gender which should be explored further especially among noninternetusing children More research is needed on the effects on access of the quality cost and availability of connectivity Impacts of parental mediation strategies that encourage or discourage children to go online need to be better understood together with the effects of the availability of devices in different settings including at school We need to better understand how access inequalities create further divisions in terms of the range and complexity of online activities that children engage in and the extent to which these differences become longterm effects Correa For gender inequalities in low and middleincome countries see Banaji et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES Activities and opportunities in general Children engage in broad range of activities online These include learning community and civic participation creativity engagement in social relationships and online communication These activities may result in tangible benefits to children Sexting and watching pornography may be experienced as opportunities by some children and as risks by others These activities are discussed later in the report The review includes studies of online opportunities for children An additional six studies examine digital health Five explore digital citizenship These were reviewed separately to gain additional insights The main studies on activities and opportunities focus mostly on Europe and North America Some also cover Australia China Malaysia the Russian Federation the Republic of Korea Singapore and the United Arab Emirates The studies mainly use survey methods but some use mixed methods focus groups or interviews The quantitative research comprises panel study and few schoolbased surveys with stratified sampling But the majority of surveys use small convenience or selfselected samples Some studies control for only limited number of variables few samples include young adults aged years and above Key findings The online activities in which children engage depend on their gender country context socio economic status smartphone ownership and age What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they spend online Platforms can be used for different purposes and result in different benefits for children For example social media are mainly used for communication and socializing but can offer learning opportunities for those children who seek such benefits How children engage with the internet depends on range of factors including their needs preferences and abilities Informationseeking activities are particularly valuable to children dealing with sensitive issues such as sexuality and health Receiving support can be helpful for children dealing with hardship The Net Children Go Mobile survey shows that girls are more likely to use the internet for schoolwork and social networking than boys It was conducted in seven European countries Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom There are however crosscountry differences For example children in the United Kingdom are significantly less likely than those in Italy Portugal and Romania to use social networking sites Findings from the same study also indicate that European children from medium and higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to use the internet for schoolwork and learning activities than those with lower socioeconomic status Some of Vossen and Valkenburg Gluer and Lohaus Vanden Abeele et al Kim et al SampasaKanyinga et al Mascheroni and lafsson Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper these findings are contradicted by study conducted in the Republic of Korea It shows that neither gender nor the parents academic background is significantly related to childs use of the internet for studying This points to the possibility that some of these relationships vary by country and regional context The evidence suggests that there is relationship between which devices children use how long they stay online and the type of online activities they engage in For example Mascheroni and lafsson found that daily smartphone use is not related to using the internet for schoolwork but is associated with more engagement in entertainment and communication activities These activities are considered more participatory than schoolwork because they involve things like playing games sharing or downloading photos videos or music sharing files posting messages and creating pet or an avatar Some indicative research suggests that there may be relationship between the time spent online and the type of activities in which children engage According to study in Sweden children who spend minutes or more online per day are more likely to play games and surf the web eg to seek leisure related information while children who are online less tend to engage more in social communication and informationseeking There is longitudal evidence that using social media can develop childrens affective and cognitive empathy This enables them to share understand and recognize other peoples emotions Some studies also emphasize the importance of selfdisclosure for receiving support from peers Children who use social networking sites discuss more personal information with their offline friends than children who do not have social media account according to study in Germany of stratified sample of children aged years Belgian study of high school students aged years and recruited via random stratified sampling found that selfdisclosure is positively associated with higher emotional support received from friends Exchanging messages online with friends reinforces sense of companionship because of its characteristic of any time any place connectivity which allows them to chitchat and micro coordinate activities Intimate selfdisclosure is also associated with childrens perceived privacy and control over the content in messaging with friends Socializing can also be linked to online learning opportunities particularly in countries where such opportunities are facilitated by the education system Children sometimes use social media to manage homework tasks or engage with content related to homework When time spent on social media is used for studying it is associated with better school performance On the other hand the evidence shows that spending more time on social media more than two hours day is negatively associated with school performance if social media are not used for studyrelated activities Lim and Nam Thulin and Vilhelmson Vossen and Valkenburg Gluer and Lohaus Vanden Abeele et al Vanden Abeele et al Blair et al SampasaKanyinga et al Kim et al Badri et al SampasaKanyinga et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Some indicative findings from smaller studies suggest that the internet can offer benefits to hardto reach children and those in vulnerable situations such as children dealing with drug use mental health problems or selfharm by making it easier to access information and seek help These indicative findings suggest that technologically driven interventions to improve child wellbeing may be useful for some children Limitations and suggestions for further research While there is evidence that smartphone use is linked to variations in childrens online activities it is not clear how the type or number of devices used is associated with different activities Some activities such as learning socializing and play have received more attention in the recent research evidence while others such as creativity health and participation are discussed much less More evidence is needed across the full spectrum of online opportunities to understand which activities lead to positive outcomes and how existing inequalities may be overcome broader range of predictors of online activities and opportunities should be considered Most studies omit variables related to digital skills parental mediation or the influence of peers and the community This makes it difficult to understand how different skills or family attitudes enable or restrict children in taking advantage of online opportunities Future research should also explore whether and how positive online experiences of children are related to tangible longterm benefits If some children yield greater benefits than others research should uncover the factors that create these differences The potential of the internet to provide social and emotional support for children requires more attention in future research This would include what type of support is most beneficial and how to reach those children who most need support There is also very little research on peer versus intergenerational communication and its impact on wellbeing The potential of peer support needs to be better examined Digital health On an individual level digital health refers to the use of the internet and digital technologies to maintain or improve health and lifestyle It may involve searching for broad range of healthrelated information This includes information on healthy eating and nutrition exercise or sports sexual or reproductive health mental health disease or injury and treatment or medication Digital health also refers to using specific applications software programs or devices to monitor plan share or discuss issues related to health or lifestyle Such issues include weight loss exercise food intake and mood The six studies reviewed mainly cover countries in Europe and North America including Germany the Netherlands Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the United States One study was conducted in Nigeria The methodologies encompass range of methods from secondary data and metaanalysis to webbased focus groups and surveys The surveys are mostly crosssectional involving convenience samples and multistage random sampling of schools or clustered random Curry et al De Riggi et al Fedele et al Doornwaard et al Shabi and Oyewusi Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper sampling of schools The one longitudinal panel study used small nonprobability sample The methodological shortcomings of the studies include small samples and insufficient information about controls Key findings The digital environment is an important source of health information and support for children both in relation to physical and to mental health Children value that the internet provides anonymity access to reliable information glimpses of the experiences of peers and supportseeking options Children use variety of online channels to access digital health content They usually try to judge the reliability of the source and the particular benefits it provides but this can sometimes be difficult for them Not everyone is equally able to benefit Looking for health information online is positively associated with having higher level of digital skills Digital health outcomes are rarely discussed and the evidence on effectiveness is somewhat mixed and insufficient Several studies explore how children seek health information online They show that trusted and highquality online health information is important to young people survey in Germany of students aged years shows that the aspects most frequently cited as important for digital health information are easily comprehensible wording cited by per cent of respondents clear layout per cent and perceived reliability of the websites publisher per cent The visual style of website and whether it is explicitly aimed at students are deemed less important Girls are nearly twice as likely as boys to attach importance to the publishers reliability especially those girls who do not have migrant background or who attend school in the highest academic tier Children also evaluate the reliability of online information by determining whether the same information appears on multiple websites and if it corresponds with what they know from offline sources such as family friends or school Websites associated with medical institutions such as pharmacies or health care providers are generally considered reliable as are websites explicitly aimed at educating youth about sexual and reproductive health Forums with usergenerated content are seen as beneficial for offering glimpses of the experiences or opinions of others and for providing opportunities for informal support through online peer networks survey in Nigeria of students aged years found that per cent of children and young people use the internet to seek health information on weekly basis The most popular search topics Best et al Curry et al von Rosen et al Doornwaard et al Doornwaard et al Best et al Shabi and Oyewusi Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper include healthy diet and nutrition body size shape and image sexually transmitted infections and other sexual issues The availability of easily accessible online information is particularly valuable for the hardtoreach children who struggle to seek help face to face study of boys from Northern Ireland aged years found that one quarter of those who seek information online will not tell anyone about mental health issue They place particular value on the anonymity of digital health information resources and support services The internet also provides opportunities for children to access information on sexual health and relationships mental health support and general health services study in the Netherlands shows factors related to childrens identity and circumstances may influence how they engage with online information For example LGBTQI children and those with more knowledge about sex and sexuality are more likely to consult sexual information online Girls children who know more about sex and sexuality and those who communicate with friends rather than parents about sex tend to seek sexual information from professional websites Boys and children with low sexual selfesteem and high sexual curiosity are more likely to use interactive usergenerated online content The study in Nigeria revealed that children who have more advanced digital skills are more likely to use the internet for health information The study in Northern Ireland found no significant impact of economic status geographical location or educational attainment on the online helpseeking habits of boys in relation to health The study suggests that boys who use online helpseeking to supplement offline support may gain more mental health benefits Boys who have larger online friend networks and those who have confided in online friends regarding personal problems also have better mental health outcomes This suggests that lack of online social support may create inequalities among children Longterm digital health outcomes are rarely discussed The evidence on effectiveness is both insufficient and somewhat inconsistent review of the evidence on changes in childrens health behaviour found that mobile health interventions can have positive effect on childrens health outcomes Furthermore interventions supported by caregivers produce larger changes in health outcomes on average than those that exclusively target children Yet another review of the evidence on the effects of mobile health including use of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity outcomes among healthy children found no evidence of an effect among all interventions Best et al Nikkelen et al Nikkelen et al Shabi and Oyewusi Best et al Best et al Fedele et al Fedele et al Bhm et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research More evidence that is methodologically robust and comparable is needed to assess how children benefit from digital health information resources and support services The conclusions from current findings are limited by the small number of studies differences in measurement dissimilarities in the digital health content assessed and the methodological challenges of the study designs More evaluations are needed of digital health interventions Another area for future research is to explore how the relationship between youth health behaviours and outcomes is related to factors at the individual family and community level and influenced by health care systems Further analyses of the relationship between seeking mental health information and support and childrens exposure to online harm could be helpful especially in relation to targeting online harm interventions Digital citizenship Digital citizenship is an umbrella term It covers the role of digital technologies in the development of childrens political interest civic identity and engagement in politics It also covers their understanding of citizenship values their civic engagement and their rights in the digital world The five studies reviewed cover four European countries and Indonesia They are mainly quantitative in nature with mixture of convenience or small samples and longitudinal panel surveys using random cluster sampling of schools Key findings Digital technologies are childrens preferred medium for learning about new ideas and civic participation On their own however digital technologies have somewhat limited ability to create proactive and ongoing civic participation among children Children who actively seek political content online are more likely to develop stronger interest in politics over time than children who come across this content by chance even if they engage with it by commenting or sharing Offline engagement in civic activities such as taking part in demonstration distributing leaflets or wearing shirt is more likely to create sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens Online participation in civic activities such as expressing an opinion on social media writing blog creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll is less likely to create civic identity Still civic participation online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and help children to create new and independent opinions fiveyear longitudinal study in Sweden on the relations between online media use and political interest among children aged years wave and young people aged years wave found that children who actively engage with political content online develop stronger interest in politics over time This effect is relatively weak On the other hand children who come across political content Machackova and Serek Moeller et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper online by chance do not develop stronger interest in politics over time The study also found that range of other factors such as changes in family socioeconomic status childrens total news consumption across different platforms and interpersonal discussions with parents or peers appear to have no effect on later political interest The importance of proactive engagement with political information is also demonstrated by an Austrian study with children and young people aged years The study explored intentional proactive seeking and incidental coming across politics material randomly engagement in politics offline and online The study also asked whether the effects differ based on childrens motivations for internet use These include using the internet for selfexpression entertainment socializing or to look for political information Children who use the internet because they are interested in political information or selfexpression are significantly more likely to intentionally engage in politics both online and offline Children who use the internet mainly for entertainment purposes which defines most of the children in the sample are unlikely to engage in politics offline but may spontaneously engage in politics online This may be via activities such as liking sharing or commenting on political posts in random or nonproactive way Hence exposure to online political content can lead to higher engagement in politics but only for children who are already interested in politics or selfexpression and only if they come across political content online intentionally For the other children included in this study engagement with online political material did not seem to lead to active or longterm civic participation similar approach distinguishing offline and online civic participation was adopted in twowave panel study conducted in Czechia with adolescents aged years The findings show that the development of civic identity the sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens is not affected by online participation but it is positively predicted by offline participation In this study online participation involves signing an online petition expressing an opinion on social media writing blog creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll Offline participation is about taking part in demonstration distributing leaflets wearing shirt or another symbol or signing paper petition Surprisingly the study found no effect of either online or offline participation on childrens political selfefficacy trust in government and belief that they can influence politics Online participation on the other hand is linked to greater acceptance of unconventional authoritychallenging activism and to more negative attitudes towards social authorities and conventions possible explanation is that participating online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and create new and independent opinions in way that offline participation does not Moeller et al Heiss et al Heiss et al Moeller et al Machackova and Serek Machackova and Serek Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research Political participation is covered by substantial part of the literature It would benefit from more comprehensive approach whereby digital citizenship is also understood and studied in relation to child identity and belonging civic engagement childrens agency and rights and the formation of values through online engagement It would be beneficial to develop our understanding of the factors that help children to advance their engagement in digital citizenship activities This would help us to understand how the digital environment can facilitate and enhance childrens agency and rights We need to know more about groups of children who are marginalized and underrepresented or even persecuted in relation to their digital citizenship activities and identify ways in which their voices can be heard in all cultural social and political contexts Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper DIGITAL SKILLS The definition of skills in the literature we reviewed varies from the general ability to use the internet to specific skills related to the digital environment These specific skills include the ability to determine the credibility of online sources and information possession of online social skills and the ability to identify whether people met online are who they say they are More comprehensive multidimensional models include operational skills browsing skills social skills creative skills mobile skills personalsecurity skills critical skills and devicesecurity skills We reviewed seven studies on digital skills They used both qualitative and quantitative methods Two studies include parents as well as children The quantitative research ranges from large representative surveys used for crosscountry comparisons used in two studies to small and convenience samples and studies which do not clarify their sampling methods The research is mostly based in Europe except for two studies that focus on Malaysia and Latin America the Plurinational State of Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Mexico Peru and Uruguay Key findings Better digital skills are associated with more online opportunities but also more online risks Parents tend to use restrictive mediation when they or their child have lower level of digital skills Restrictive mediation reduces online risks mostly at the expense of digital skills and online opportunities In countries with low internet adoption children tend to be better internet users than their parents In such cases parents rely on their children and use the internet less on their own hence they are less able to provide support to their children when needed It is difficult to measure childrens digital skills The studies mostly rely on childrens self assessment rather than performance testing which means that some more confident children may overestimate their digital skills Several studies suggest that better digital skills are associated with more online activities but also more online risks Skills have decisive role in how children engage with the internet and in what their parents allow or encourage them to do online nationally representative survey of parents of children aged years from eight European countries shows that children who are encouraged to take advantage of online opportunities and are actively supported by their parents tend to do more

Mantzouranis et al Nygren and Guath RodriguezdeDios et al Teimouri et al Livingstone et al Galperin and Arcidiacono Livingstone et al Teimouri et al RodriguezdeDios et al For review of the evidence on antecedents and consequences of digital skills see Haddon et al forthcoming Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper things online and have better digital skills However they also face higher levels of risk To limit that risk parents sometimes use restrictive mediation such as taking away devices not allowing children to go online or limiting what they can do This reduces risk but it also reduces childrens digital skills and through this reduces the activities children engage in Children are more likely to be restricted when they are younger when they have lower level of digital skills or when their parents have lower level of digital skills However schoolbased survey in Spain of students aged years shows that associations between digital skills and online opportunities are stronger than those between digital skills and online risks This means that restricting children is reducing online risks mostly at the expense of online opportunities study explored the intergenerational transmission of digital skills and internet use in the context of countries with low to moderate levels of internet adoption The authors look at how childrens internet use and skills affect parental internet use and skills The study is based on largescale surveys with children and young people aged years in six Latin American countries the Plurinational State of Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Mexico Peru and Uruguay It found that the intergenerational transfer of motivation and skills from children to adults is on average outweighed by leaning effects This means that parents rely on children to perform online tasks for them Hence parents whose children are better internet users tend to rely on them and use the internet less on their own qualitative study with girls aged years and years in the Netherlands explored skills and confidence in determining whether an online stranger was an adult or peer The findings suggest that most girls are confident in their ability to identify an adult with possible sexual intentions but less than half of them per cent are actually able to do it When unsure about whom they are in contact with most girls apply strategy that does not involve interaction with the person They scan the profile page of the stranger checking the contact information the profile picture and whether they have friends in common When mutual friends are present trust increases significantly and girls are less critical If still unsure girls ask their friends in common about the stranger or more often continue the conversation with the stranger to find out more Important cues that alarm girls are when the other person ignores personal questions shows an exaggerated amount of interest acts as friend and makes sexual comments The study also found that girls in the younger group aged years report more distress when such incidents occur than those in the older group The potential unreliability of childrens selfassessment of their digital skills is addressed by Swedish study on news credibility The study asked students aged years to assess their competence in finding and evaluating online information While most respondents rated themselves as quite skilled at factchecking per cent rated their ability as good or very good and searching for information online per cent good or very good most of them per cent could not separate news from advertisements in popular online newspaper Selfreported skills of factchecking and searching ability are inversely associated with performance but children are better at recognizing manipulated images per cent and identifying such images as poor evidence per cent The students also had difficult time determining the trustworthiness of credible biased and false information online Hence the study concludes that claiming to be good at finding information online is associated with an inability to determine the trustworthiness of information Livingstone et al Livingstone et al RodriguezdeDios et al roenestein et al Nygren and Guath Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research The reviewed literature offers little discussion of how particular skills may be related to higher or lower exposure to risks and to what types of risk more comprehensive model of skills is needed which can explain what role skills play if any in childrens pathways to harm and vulnerability or in the protective factors that help to build resilience The skills literature is almost exclusively digital It does not examine how offline skills such as critical thinking or social skills may support children when applied to online situations More research is needed on the possible benefits from the application of such skills in an online environment We found no longitudinal research that could explain differences between childrens digital skills Do children who acquire better digital skills at younger age have improved outcomes from their internet use and are such effects longlasting There are gaps in our knowledge of what factors from childrens offline and digital environments create the best conditions for learning digital skills and how best to support children to acquire digital skills Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper PRIVACY ONLINE Privacy relates to childrens understanding of range of related issues at the personal institutional and commercial level and their ability to mitigate privacyrelated risk The issues include knowledge of how to protect their own and others personal information online what to share and with whom how to use privacy settings and how personal data are collected by businesses or institutions and used for monitoring analyses or commerce The studies we reviewed are mostly from Europe and North America There are several studies from Asia including from China Malaysia the Philippines and Singapore The quantitative research is crosssectional with most of the studies using convenience or small samples Some studies include mixture of children and adults All findings should be considered indicative Key findings Overall children are less concerned about certain aspects of online privacy than adults and are less engaged in privacy management Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in safety strategies Girls have greater privacy concerns than boys and are more likely to have parental involvement in managing their online privacy Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect privacy behaviours eg having private profile Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age while peer mediation increases This is similar to other aspects of internet use The evidence of how skills affect privacy is inconclusive Having the relevant skills does not necessarily mean that children will engage in better privacy protection strategies Most of the studies in our sample examine privacy by exploring the relationship between privacy risks and other online risks such as sexting sexual exploitation or contact with unknown people The focus is often on children having public social media profile sharing information with people they have got to know online using privacy settings sharing passwords with friends and being concerned about privacy Mostly the studies are interested in exploring the factors that influence online privacy both positively and negatively These factors include device use media literacy mediation by parents teachers or peers and personal characteristics such as gender age and personality traits Some studies examine the violation of privacy Examples include the manipulation or dissemination of personal information or images without consent or being monitored by others such as partners or parents The findings suggest that gender and age influence online privacy behaviours web survey administered to social media users in Norway aged years investigated the impact of privacy concerns on selfie behaviours across gender and age groups The groups were adolescents For summ ary of the evidence on childrens privacy online see Livingstone et al Marret and Choo Montiel et al Reed et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper aged years young adults aged years and adults aged years The adolescents in the sample were much less concerned about privacy and less engaged in privacy management than the older groups Female users had greater privacy concerns than male users across all three age groups and the degree of privacy concern was not influenced by the use of privacy management strategies Adolescent girls who had greater privacy concerns engaged less in taking personal selfies cropping or editing photos and using photo enhancement filters There was no influence on group selfietaking and none of these factors was significant for adolescent boys United Statesbased survey of children and young people aged years though limited in terms of generalizability found that gender can be an important factor in determining privacy concerns Girls in the study were more likely to have parent who accessed their online profiles They were also more likely to have had discussion with parent about privacy settings The findings suggest that children who have privacy discussions are more likely to have private profiles on social media However this does not affect how often they use social media The children in the study who said that their parent knew their passwords were less likely to have private profile If we speculate this may be because they are already very cautious about what they post online knowing their parents will see it Those who had discussions with teachers about social media safety and privacy settings were more likely to have private profile Approximately one half of the participants reported that they discussed the importance of privacy settings with parents per cent teachers per cent and peers per cent Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age while discussions with peers increase Other exploratory studies show that significant factors for childrens online privacy practices also include device use and digital literacy Findings from survey of participants aged years living in the capital region of the Philippines which is again limited in generalizability show that children who use more devices have better online privacy behaviours The relationship is even stronger for children with better information literacy However another exploratory study looking at online privacy digital literacy and actual exposure to online risks shows that digital skills may be less important than privacy concerns in driving privacy behaviours This study comprised survey conducted in Malaysia among children aged years It shows that the participating children were less exposed to online risks when they were highly aware of the severity of online risks and had high online privacy concerns These findings may be explained by qualitative study with children and young people aged years It shows that online privacy is perceived as likely to be infringed as children struggle to maintain the boundaries between different social circles digital crowding and to control how information about them travels audience segregation Despite this lack of informational privacy there is an element of social or psychological privacy online It is based on trust in others and expectations that personal information will be handled correctly Hence whether or not children are concerned about their privacy affects how they engage with the internet and deal with risky situations Dhir et al Romo et al Bernadas and Soriano Teimouri et al Setty Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The offlineonline connection is explored in survey with children aged years in China It demonstrates the importance of differentiating between children with high and low levels of self disclosure both online and offline Children who use the online space as an extension of offline relationships and share information in more balanced way both offline and online are more likely to experience positive outcomes and to show signs of resilience low personal scores for neuroticism When online selfdisclosure occurs at the expense of offline selfdisclosure this tends to be associated with low personal scores for conscientiousness agreeableness and extroversion and high scores for neuroticism Limitations and suggestions for further research lot of privacy research proceeds with adult definitions of privacy and does little to account for what children think and know about privacy Paying attention to childrens definitions of privacy or more precisely drawing connections between their definitions and the issues that adults are concerned about on childrens behalf could help us to strengthen childrens privacy practices In previous piece of research we emphasized that the majority of research concerns privacy in interpersonal contexts with less attention paid to commercial or institutional contexts Relatedly most research conceives of data that are deliberately and knowingly provided with fewer studies recognizing that data traces and inferred data or metadata also matter for childrens privacy This evidence review found the same gaps and lack of extensive measures of online privacy which go beyond using privacy settings having public profile and sharing information with strangers More research is needed on the effect of skills on online privacy behaviours particularly in relation to privacy strategies values and behaviours or peer pressure which could inform peer training and empowerment methods Chen et al Stoilova et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper RISK OF HARM ONLINE The large majority of the studies identified by the review dealt with different aspects of online risk and harm This review includes total of studies divided into sexual risks studies which are discussed in section and nonsexual risks studies Of this latter set studies on excessive internet use online gambling and excessive gaming were coded for research theme but excluded from further analysis and this report The nonsexual risks reviewed include General or overall online risk exposure studies Seeing usergenerated negative content studies Hurtful and bullying behaviour studies Cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism studies Sexual risks include Receiving and sending sexual messages studies Viewing sexual content online studies Online sexual exploitation and abuse studies Each topic is defined and reviewed separately below Online risk exposure Online risk covers exposure to range of threats related to online content child as recipient of advertising content spam violent or hateful content pornographic or unwanted sexual content contact child as participant in situations related to being bullied harassed or stalked receiving unwanted sexual messages being groomed meeting in person contacts first met online and conduct child as an actor engaging in hacking gambling bullying or harassing behaviour sending sexual material to others Harm refers to the negative consequences some children experience from exposure to risks eg feeling bothered or upset Not all risks necessarily lead to harm and children can be affected differently by exposure to the same kind of risk The sources which for this report we allocated to the broader category of general risk include surveybased crosssectional studies with samples ranging from representative to small convenience samples The geographical area covered by the studies goes beyond Europe and the United States to also include Japan Malaysia Singapore Taiwan Province of China Thailand and Turkey Key findings Digital skills positively predict both online risks and online opportunities Better digital literacy and safety skills are associated with more engagement not only in online opportunities but also in risky online activities Hasebrink et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Parental mediation can affect childrens exposure to risks but there is no combination of enabling and restrictive mediation that both increases opportunities and reduces risks Reducing risks is always at the expense of opportunities The evidence on what types of risk lead to harm is insufficient It is often assumed rather than assessed that exposure to risk leads to harm There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks vulnerability or support influence childrens exposure to online risk and subsequent feelings of harm and the severity of that harm Many studies in the sample point out the interconnectedness of online risks with digital skills online opportunities and parental mediation survey of children aged years in Spain found that the variation in childrens exposure to online risks is not explained much by their level of digital skills The intuitive expectation that children with better skills experience fewer risks was not confirmed The authors speculate that this may be due to the greater strength of other predictors such as peer norms and pressure sensationseeking and offline victimization Similarly smallerscale survey conducted in Malaysia among child aged years found that skills were less important for exposure to online risks than awareness of risks and privacy concerns The indicative findings suggest that children who think that the internet is risky and dangerous perceived severity of an online risk are less likely to encounter risks online However whether children think that they are likely to experience online risks perceived susceptibility does not affect how much they are exposed to online risk The findings limited in terms of generalizability suggest two things internetrelated selfefficacy does not seem to reduce childs exposure to risk or affect privacy concerns and greater digital literacy and safety skills are associated with riskier online activities which may cause more harm This suggests that digital literacy education needs to find new ways to build on childrens digital selfefficacy to ensure that risk exposure or at least the experience of internetrelated harms is avoided or reduced few studies point to the protective effect of parental mediation on childrens exposure to risks However the relationship between the two is complex No combination of enabling and restrictive mediation has been found that both increases opportunities and reduces risks highquality cross national European study found that the maximum increase in opportunities occurs when parents engage in high enabling and low restrictive mediation But this also increases risks The maximum decrease in risks can be achieved by choosing high level of restrictions but this will also result in the greatest reduction in opportunities Restrictive mediation diminishes online risks through the reduction of digital skills and mostly at the expense of online opportunities Some studies found that active parental mediation is not significantly associated with exposure to online risk while active mediation by teachers and peers can reduce risk Parental and teacher Bayraktar Teimouri et al RodriguezdeDios et al RodriguezdeDios et al Teimouri et al Bayraktar Chang et al RodriguezdeDios et al Livingstone et al Livingstone et al Livingstone et al RodriguezdeDios et al Shin and Lwin Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper mediation also tends to focus more on making instructive remarks such as talking about information management while peers are more likely to engage in neutral types of active mediation such as helping or recommending The effects of parental mediation can also vary in different contexts For example active mediation is positively related with online risk exposure in Turkey but not in European countries Limitations and suggestions for further research substantial gap in the research is the lack of attention paid to the differences between online risk and harm Not all exposure to risk leads to harm and children are not equally affected More evidence is needed on what types of risk lead to harm what groups of children are more vulnerable and what the longterm effects are on childrens development and wellbeing There is little evidence on how children can build resilience and what protective factors exist Is exposure to risk necessary for the development of resilience What preventive strategies can be effective There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks vulnerability or support may influence childrens exposure to online risk and their experiences of harm more comprehensive model of online harm is needed which explores how the relationship between antecedents and consequences is mediated by the online environment Seeing negative content This refers to potentially negative usergenerated cognitive content This includes websites or online discussions where people talk about or show images of physically harming or hurting themselves committing suicide ways to be very thin such as being anorexic or bulimic taking drugs and gory or violent images The reviewed studies focus mainly on the effects of negative content on childrens behaviour Some aim to identify risk and protective factors The online content considered includes sites advocating eating disorders selfinjury and suicide or that involve exposure to violence The seven studies use variety of methodological approaches from small qualitative research to large representative surveys metaanalyses and evidence reviews The surveybased studies are cross sectional and some use convenience samples Geographically they cover European countries and the United States Bearing in mind the significant differences between the countries studied the applicability of the findings to other contexts particularly in the global South needs to be established Key findings As general pattern among the countries included here primarily European countries and also the United States it seems that older adolescents aged years are more likely to access negative content than young adults aged years and over Girls tend to be more likely to see eating disorder content while boys are more likely to access proselfharm and prosuicide content It seems more common for children to lease in passive exposure such as viewing violent content than active engagement such as liking or posting content The evidence on how where and why children come across this content is insufficient Shin and Lwin Bayraktar Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Lower levels of happiness with life previous offline and online victimization and lack of social support can increase childrens exposure to negative online content There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to negative content More analysis is needed on whether these differences are cultural related to national policies and regulation or related to other factors The interface and functionality of online platforms can make difference Imagebased anonymous and less moderated formats can facilitate the circulation of some usergenerated negative content The evidence on protective factors is somewhat limited Indicative findings suggest that happiness with life and social support can act as protective factors in relation to seeing negative content few of the studies discuss prevalence of exposure to negative content survey of respondents aged years across Finland Germany the United Kingdom and the United States suggests that sites that advocate eating disorders selfinjury and suicide are familiar to children and young people In all four countries per cent of respondents had seen selfinjury or suicide sites or both with exposure to both types of content more common than seeing only one type The same study found that girls are more likely to see eating disorder content while boys see more proselfharm and pro suicide content Intentional selfharm however is more common among young females than young males This may be explained by the fact that some boys may follow more violent content online The younger participants aged years were also more likely to access harmadvocating online content There is some evidence that exposure to harmful content varies among online platforms study of black and Hispanic youth in the United States found that it was more common on Facebook than Instagram and children usually experience passive exposure to it such as seeing content rather than active engagement such as liking or posting content lower level of happiness and previous online and offline victimization experiences are also associated with exposure to such online material Other risk factors relate to sociodemographic background variables such as not living with parents migrant background and urban residence The authors of the multicountry study conclude that those facing difficulties in their everyday life are at higher risk of accessing online sites that may foster unhealthy behaviour However the study found important crosscountry differences For example exposure rates to all three types of harmadvocating material were significantly lower in Germany possibly due to differences in regulation digital ecology and the general mental health of the youth population The different risk factors varied in significance in the different countries Some studies unpack the extent to which engagement with the internet plays an important role Using higher number of social media and online services is associated with higher risk of accessing harmadvocating online content the frequency of online activity is not Similarly qualitative study in Wales in the United Kingdom with sample of children and young people aged years with history of selfharm showed that the internet played an important part in participants selfharm Minkkinen et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Oksanen et al Stevens et al Oksanen et al Oksanen et al see also Turja et al Oksanen et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper practices The internet allows users to access information about selfharm consume images or participate in online communities of selfharmers which can normalize the practice It also allows them to seek support The participants discussed how seeing the images can provide sense of satisfaction or create desire to replicate them Sharing of ones own images was more likely to be linked to severe selfharm Those who wanted to share their own images preferred more visual platforms where posting is anonymous and less scrutinized or moderated The evidence on protective factors is scarce and needs further research It seems that happiness with life may be positively associated with lower risk of accessing negative content online on topics such as selfinjury and suicide It also seems that social support can act as protective factor Friends can create buffering effect for some young people For others closeness to family members is substantial protective factor and living without parents is risk factor Hurtful and bullying behaviour Hurtful behaviour online generally involves using digital technology and the internet to purposely share private information photos or videos in hurtful way or sending threatening or insulting messages via email instant messaging chat or texts It also includes spreading rumours and false information about the victim or purposely excluding them from online communications Cyberbullying is traditionally characterized by online harassment that is perpetrated repeatedly and involves power imbalance between the perpetrator and victim The literature reviewed here did not always differentiate between hurtful online behaviour and bullying online Bullying is not always operationalized online using the traditional defining features of repetition and power imbalance Thus this review includes online hurtful behaviour and cyberbullying jointly whether occurring repeatedly and involving power imbalance or otherwise Key findings are listed for each subsection The limitations of the material and suggestions for future research are given at the end of each subsection Cyberbullying This area of this theme produced some of the most extensive results with more than articles found To narrow the results the inclusion criteria were refined to include only surveybased research with higherquality sampling This reduced the sample to studies which were analysed and included in the review Even among the studies the majority are crosssectional and omit from their models the range of confounding variables previously shown to be significantly related to cyberbullying or online hurtful behaviour These include subjective wellbeing and social support The majority of studies cover experiences of children in the global North Australia European countries and the United States with few focusing on Asian countries and Israel Key findings Boys in the studies included here experience cyberbullying mainly through video games and text messages Girls experience it mainly through social media Boys are also more likely than girls to be perpetrators or victims who also perpetrate bullying Jacob et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Oksanen et al Turja et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Choi et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Perpetrators of cyberbullying are more likely to also be victims Online and offline perpetration and victimization are also highly correlated Cyberbullying perpetration and victimization have common predictors These include having weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family loneliness lower social likeability at school lower psychological wellbeing and having an impulsive personality Cyberbullying victimization is associated with lower psychological wellbeing and externalizing behaviours Protective factors in relation to cyberbullying include positive relationship with parents parental monitoring of childrens activities generally rather than online only teacher care enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence and resilience The evidence suggests that boys and girls experience cyberbullying differently in terms of both perpetration and victimization Overall boys are more likely to be perpetrators or victimperpetrators than girls although this is not supported by all studies Girls tend to be targeted more than boys for their appearance weight or sexuality They are also more likely to be the victims of genderbased harassment exclusion and reputational damage Boys and girls are targeted through different channels Boys tend to be victimized through video games and mobile phone text messages Girls are more likely to experience cyberbullying through social media There is strong correlation between cyberbullying victimization and perpetration as well as between online and offline perpetration and victimization Accordingly there are several common predictors of both cyberbullying perpetration and victimization These include having weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family loneliness lower social likeability at school lower psychological wellbeing and having an impulsive personality eg lack of selfcontrol While crosssectional studies show that high level of activity on social networking sites is predictor of cyberbullying victimization and perpetration longitudinal study in Germany demonstrated reverse relationship It showed that more frequent mobile and internet use was an outcome of cyberbullying victimization and perpetration Other risk factors associated with online bullying and harassment perpetration include lower self efficaciousness and empathy higher selfperceived popularity the need for popularity and the perception of high violence in childs neighbourhood Being the target of cyberbullying is associated with having physical or developmental disability living with single parent perceived poor school environment and social anxiety such as fear of negative evaluation from peers and social avoidance Backe et

Lee and Shin Abeele et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper and distress range of risk behaviours is also associated with cyberbullying victimization This includes use of alcohol or drugs at school an affiliation with gangs involving violence and engaging in risky internet behaviours such as publishing personal information on social networks The evidence on the role of parental mediation in cyberbullying is inconclusive While some studies found significant association between parental control and supervision of childrens online activities and lower cyberbullying perpetration and victimization others found no significant relationship One study even shows that parental mediation predicts higher likelihood of victimization The studies that found significant relationship show that the positive effect of parental control is mediated by less time spent online and decreased engagement in risky behaviours online On the other hand there is emerging evidence that what is important are childrens overall relationships with their parents and the monitoring of childrens activities in general rather than of their online activities in particular Looking at factors that can protect children from becoming victims of cyberbullying besides parental mediation researchers found significant impact of teacher care the presence of established and enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence subjective wellbeing and resilience Examples of resilience include the ability to tolerate experiences such as change personal problems illness pressure failure and painful feelings Studies where cyberbullying victimization was used as predictor identified several negative outcomes among victims including the internalization of problems lower subjective wellbeing suicidal ideation depression anxiety including stress lower selfesteem physical symptoms emotional problems and actual suicide attempts One study showed that the most distressing incidents for children are those that involve both inperson and online elements multiple perpetrators and power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator Children in this study found technologyonly harassment less distressing Mixed incidents which occur both online and offline are more likely to involve repeated harassment and current or past friends or romantic partners as perpetrators This points to the potential importance of perpetrator identity in determining the negative impact of cyberbullying Cyberbullying victimization is also associated with long list of externalizing behaviours These include selfharm online and offline substance use viewing web content related to suicide and selfharm and more frequent mobile or internet use They may also involve social problems or peer problems for example children thinking that their peers do not like them Externalizing behaviours can also encompass problems with academic achievement and behavioural problems such as getting into fights damaging property and defiant behaviour GonzlezCabrera et al Choi et al Bevilacqua et al AlvarezGarcia et al Backe et al Mesch Pabian and Vandebosch

Cyberbystanders cyberbystander is someone who has observed or witnessed cyberbullying but was not its main perpetrator or victim Witnesses to bullying can take different roles They can act as assistants to the bully by following the main perpetrator and participating in bullying They can reinforce the bully by watching and laughing at the victim They can defend the victim interfering to protect or comfort the victim Or they can act as outsiders who observe but do not engage in any way Key findings More children are bystanders of cyberbullying than bullies or victims There are conflicting age and gender patterns in predicting cyberbystanding across different countries Whether bystanders intervene or remain outsiders depends on their own and the victims gender as well as their relationship with the perpetrator and the victim Bystanders of cyberbullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school Being witness of cyberbullying even if not perpetrator or victim can have an adverse effect on childrens quality of life over time We found nine studies on the topic of cyberbystanding mainly from Australia and European countries with one study from the Islamic Republic of Iran and another from Israel With couple of exceptions most studies use convenience sampling and correlational analyses Overall there is higher proportion of cyberbystanders than cyberbullies or cybervictims among children Gender seems to be predictor of cyberbystanding in some countries but not in others Girls are significantly more likely than boys to be cyberbystanders in Australia the Islamic Republic of Iran and Spain and among Jewish adolescents in Israel But there is no difference by gender among Arab adolescents in Israel and in the Republic of Korea One study found that girls in Spain are more likely to witness specific types of cyberbullying including sexual harassment online defamation and rumours insulting calls and dissemination of videos or photos With regard to the behaviours of cyberbystanders the gender of the observer and the victim of cyberbullying is an important factor Girls are more likely to take the role of defender of the victim while their male peers are more likely not to interfere study in Germany of schoolchildren aged years found that compared with boys girls are more empathetic have higher sense of responsibility and perceive more negative outcomes from cyberbystanding Boys are more likely to report feelings of moral disengagement Salmivalli et al Salmivalli Razjouyan et al Lee et al GonzlezCabrera et al LapidotLefler and Hosri Razjouyan et al Lee et al LapidotLefler and Hosri GonzlezCabrera et al Delgado and Escortel Delgado and Escortel Yudes et al Patterson et al Yudes et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Children who have larger online friendship networks are more likely to witness cyberbullying according to study on Australia and the Republic of Korea Offline friendship networks are significant predictor of cyberbystanding in the Republic of Korea but not in Australia According to another study age is significant predictor of witnessing cyberbullying in Colombia but not in Spain or Uruguay That same study showed that being an assistant to the bully was more common among younger children aged years than among young people aged years Two recent studies in Australia found that an important predictor of whether young person intervenes to help the victim is their relationship with the perpetrator andor the victim In qualitative study children mentioned that it was difficult to identify an interaction as cyberbullying or to know its harmful intentions and consequences to the target because of the vague nature of online communications Thus knowing the people involved is important for children to know how to react and whether to intervene This is confirmed in the German study which compared the emotional processes underlying the behaviour of witnesses to offline and online bullying According to this study bystanders of cyberbullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school They also perceive lower negative outcomes and lower selfefficacy than bystanders of school bullying However there was no difference in feelings of empathy between bystanders to cyberbullying and school bullying study in the Islamic Republic of Iran found no association between emotional intelligence and cyberbullying roles including cyber bystanding Only one study looked at the effect of cyberbystanding on children longitudinally It shows that cyber bystanders score higher on all dimensions of quality of life compared with cybervictims and cyber bullies Still the quality of life of cyberbystanders falls significantly over time after five months even when they have never been perpetrator or victim of cyberbullying Limitations and suggestions for further research Despite the significant amount of research on cyberbullying there is no unified definition or measurement for bullying For example some studies define bullying as involving repeated occurrences while others measure one or more incidents as bullying Similarly the measurement of cyberbystanding varies some studies include only cases where children have directly witnessed cyberbullying while others also include cases that children have only heard about or are aware of This affects the interpretation of the findings from individual studies and the ability to draw more generalizable conclusions about cyberbullying its incidence effects and protective factors Very few studies of cyberbullying investigate the relationship between victims and perpetrators and the implications of possible power imbalance only two studies did so finding that victims experience higher distress levels Hence it is important to better understand the circumstances within which cyberbullying occurs Lee et al Yudes et al Patterson et al Patterson et al Razjouyan et al GonzlezCabrera et al Mitchell et al Mitchell et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper More longitudinal studies are needed to shed some light on causality and longterm outcomes The majority of recent studies look at predictors but there seems to be much less research on the potential effect of cyberbullying and cyberbystanding on childrens wellbeing for example Many studies omit important individual and environmentallevel covariates that have proven to be significantly related to online bullying and harassment experiences in previous research These covariates include subjective wellbeing and social support Integrating childrens experiences of offline risks and protective factors with online risk experiences may be useful in developing more comprehensive models to understand cyberbullying The studies reviewed do not always distinguish between cyberbullying and cyberbystanding It is not always clear whether participants can indicate their adoption of multiple roles for example being cyberbully as well as cyberbystander Cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism Cyberhate is the use of digital technology to profess attitudes devaluing others because of their religion race ethnicity sex or gender sexual orientation national origin or some other characteristic It is distinct form of cyberviolence because it targets individuals based on their collective identity and belonging to group rather than based on their unique individuality We found only two studies that address cyberhate one comparing the United States and Finland and another based only in the United States We found none on violent extremism Both studies use an online survey and mix children with young adults in their research One is based on larger survey while the other includes quite specific groups ethnic minority from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or having history of selfharm Key findings Cyberhate materials usually pertain to group stereotyping blaming or advocating hate based on race sexual orientation religion nationality or immigration status sex or gender and politics There is some indicative evidence that greater online exposure to hate material may vary based on differences in internet use including the platforms used and the time spent online It may also vary based on user characteristics such as younger age migrant background or country of residence as well as some offline factors such as lower levels of happiness life satisfaction and trust in government The evidence gaps in this area are substantial and relate not only to prevalence but also to risk and vulnerable groups and most of all to protective factors The study based in the United States only used an online survey with sample of internet users aged years The survey produced demographically balanced panel data The researchers found that the majority of their sample had seen or heard hate material online in the previous three months Costello et al New publications that came out after the literature search was completed show large variations of cyberhate exposure between countries Machackova et al Increases in witnessing online hate are positively related to being perpetrator of online hate Wachs et al Girls tend to use strategies for coping with online hate more often than boys Younger teenagers more often use technical strategies than older teenagers Wachs et al Costello et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper In almost half of the cases the material pertained to group stereotypes followed by material blaming group for the nations problems or advocating hate towards group and material that called for violence or discrimination Mostly online hate pertained to race sexual orientation religion nationality or immigration status sex or gender and politics The respondents were most likely to encounter hate material on Facebook YouTube and Twitter the three most commonly used platforms Other risk factors include time spent online age origin and ethnicity and trust in government Each additional hour spent online increases the likelihood of seeing or hearing hate material But spending more than three hours day online reduces this likelihood This suggests both that those who view hate material online are likely to come upon it shortly after accessing the internet and that users who spend more time online tend to avoid hate material Individuals who distrust government are more inclined to view websites disseminating hate material The same is true for those from white or Hispanic background and people with at least one parent born outside of the United States Exposure to hate material decreases with age The study found no relation between exposure to cyberhate and risktaking closeness to friends and family offline gender or geographical location The second study was slightly younger online sample of individuals in the United States and individuals in Finland aged years It found that exposure to online hate was more frequent in the United States compared with Finland This was explained by the greater ethnic diversity and focus on freedom of speech in the United States The study found that people exposed to online hate were less satisfied with their lives and less happy in general This is possibly bidirectional relationship according to the authors Exposure leads to less wellbeing this can in turn lead to greater exposure the study reports If this is the case higher levels of exposure could be the result of vicious cycle Limitations and suggestions for further research The fact that we were able to identify only two cyberhate studies suggests that more evidence is needed in this area particularly on violent extremism Understanding the consequences of mere exposure compared to active engagement posting liking may be particularly important Another substantial gap relates to the lack of evidence on actual harm to children and the longterm effects Both of the studies discuss associations between different risk factors but can say very little about harm or causality particularly in relation to more durable outcomes for childrens wellbeing While the publications discuss range of background characteristics the evidence on protective factors is particularly patchy Future research should consider the potentially wide range of factors that could be examined in relation to childrens access to cyberhate and violent extremism content Costello et al Keipi et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper SEXUAL ACTIVITIES AND RISKS ONLINE Viewing or exchanging sexual content Childrens online sexual activities are mainly researched in terms of the exchange of sexual material in relation to range of activities such as cybersex exchanging sexualized content sexting chatting about sex or seeking sexual partners online The recent literature reviewed here however is dominated by research on sexting Exchanging sexual content sexting Sexting is defined as sending eceiving or exchanging selfproduced sexualized content This includes images messages or videos sent or received through mobile phones the internet or both Sexting can be positive experience and normal part of teenagers exploration of sexuality and relationships While it may be done among consenting children it may still place them at risk Sending or receiving sexual content can be nonconsensual including as result of coercion receiving unwanted sexual content through sexual bullying or harassment or sharing someone elses content without the persons consent We reviewed studies on sexting The overwhelming majority were conducted with children in European countries and the United States Most of the studies are quantitative They are predominantly crosssectional including large convenience samples of more than people and controlling only for demographic characteristics Only five studies can be considered methodologically robust with representative samples and adequate covariates or longitudinal design Key findings The factors that predict higher likelihood of sexting behaviour among children include gender male age older sexuality LGBTQI and socioeconomic status low Girls are more likely than boys to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers to have negative sexting experiences and to be vulnerable to coercive sexting victimization Most studies conceptualize sexting as deviant behaviour and do not acknowledge that it can be positive experience for teenagers who want to explore their sexuality and relationships Harm is often assumed rather than assessed One of the main limitations of the literature on childrens online sexual activities is the absence of relationship context in studying these interactions Many studies do not ask children about their relationship with their sexting or cybersex partners which precludes nuanced understanding of these interactions This is an important limitation given the evidence on differential outcomes depending on the identity of childrens sexting or cybersex partners Psychological problems reduced online safety and privacy online sexual solicitations by adults and offline risks such as sexual interactions with adults and dating violence are all associated with sexting Courtice and Shaughnessy United Nations Interagency Working Group on Sexual Exploitation of Children Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Gender age sexuality and socioeconomic status are among the factors that predict sexting behaviour among children Studies find that boys nonheterosexual children older teenagers and children from lower socioeconomic background are more likely to engage in sexting However there is evidence that girls are more likely to be asked for sexts to receive sexts from strangers and to have more negative sexting experiences Girls are also more vulnerable to coercive sexting victimization and to having their selfproduced sexual content sent to other people without their consent Boys and older children aged years are more likely to coerce partner to send messages with sexual content than girls aged years Sexting practices are shaped by broader gender and cultural contexts One study found that girls in the Netherlands but not boys who uploaded sexualized pictures of themselves on social media were more likely to engage in sexting than those who did not This is related to their sexual selfconcept of being sexually mature and efficacious and is moderated by their level of extroversion and the volume of sexual media they consume Qualitative research with children further highlights the gendered nature of the risk that comes with sexting Boys are culturally perceived as entitled to take pleasure in viewing sexual nude images of girls as way of fitting in with their peers On the other hand the unauthorized distribution of nude images of girls has more damaging impact on the girls reputations leading to them being stigmatized or slutshamed Children often place the responsibility for mitigating the risk from sexting on the person sending the sexts especially when this is girl Predictors of sexting among children include having romantic partner and trusting the person they are sexting Sexting is also associated with having an extroverted less agreeable and less conscientious personality type as well as with higher levels of neuroticism especially depression impulsiveness and vulnerability to stress Two studies conducted with representative samples in Australia and in European countries found that children who sext are more likely to have emotional problems as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours even though framing sexting as deviant and necessarily harmful behaviour was criticized by the researchers who see sexting as normal part of the teenage exploration of sexuality and relationships Milton et al Alonso and Romero Morelli et al van Oosten and Vandenbosch Wolfe et al Romo et al Patchin and Hinduja GmezGuadix et al Buren and Lunde

and Aubrey Alonso and Romero GmezGuadix et al Sevcikova Milton et al For positive view of sexting see Albury Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The Australian study examines range of covariates including time spent on the internet cyber bullying perceived social support digital literacy and information and communications technology safety skills There is some indicative evidence on possible longerterm negative effects from longitudinal study with convenience sample of about children It shows that sending sexts predicts decrease in positive emotions one year later This is without controlling for whether the initial sexting experience was positive or negative Aspects of the digital context can also be related to sexting behaviour representative study in the United States found that receiving sexts was positively linked to using phone during school hours and negatively associated with being on family mobile phone plan and going to school that supervises the use of phones Some studies found positive relationship between childrens sexting and latenight internet use disclosure of personal information online talking to people they first met online and regular viewing of online pornography In terms of online safety and privacy children who sext are less likely to have preventive privacy behaviours They are less careful with what they post online and more likely to give out personal information like their real name home address and phone number Childrens engagement in sexting is also related to their experiences offline Some studies show connection to other risktaking behaviours both sexual and nonsexual This means that some children live in culture of higher risktaking Children who send sexts are more likely to engage in other risktaking behaviours such as increased alcohol consumption having more sexual experiences having their first sexual interaction at younger age and having unsafe sex However the relationship between sexual intercourse and sexting is only significant for younger boys but not girls aged years and for adolescents aged years The relationship context within which sexting occurs is important for some outcomes study in Belgium of students aged years shows that the positive relationship between sexting and lifetime substance use and heavy drinking is only significant among children who send sexts to people other than their romantic partners Receiving and sending sexts is related to online sexual solicitations and having sexual interactions with adults such as sending sexual content or meeting offline for sexual contact It is also related to cyberbullying victimization and perpetration However longitudinal study of students aged years in Galicia Spain found that sending sexts predicted decrease in victimization in general such as being hit insulted or threatened but did not find significant relationship with cyberbullying victimization Moreover there is positive relationship between Alonso and Romero Wolfe et al Milton et al Buren and Lunde Stanley et al Milton et al Sevcikova Van Ouytsel et al Romo et al Sevcikova Van Ouytsel et al Buren and Lunde de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Alonso and Romero Machimbarrena et al Milton et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Alonso and Romero Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper the exchange of sexts and datingviolence perpetration and victimization as well as with experiencing interpersonal violence and abuse within childrens intimate relationships Examples of interpersonal violence include facetoface emotional physical and sexual violence Viewing sexual content online Viewing sexual content online includes exposure to pictures or videos of sexually explicit material such as nudity and people having sex including pornography Pornography for this review is specifically defined as sexually explicit media intended for sexual arousal While most studies test childrens intentional exposure to sexually explicit material online few also include measure of accidental exposure Eighteen studies in our review looked at viewing sexual content online The majority are from European countries Studies mainly use large convenience samples with only demographic control variables and crosssectional designs Key findings Children view sexual content online to learn about sex but tend to see mens dominance and violent behaviours against women Boys are more likely than girls to view such content Children who are more interested in sex are also more likely to view sexual content online They are also more likely to have experiences of risky sexual activities such as casual sex sexual sensation seeking and exposure to unwanted sexual solicitation This suggests multiple vulnerabilities and risk of harm for some children In the studies reviewed here boys had greater exposure than girls to sexual content online as is the case with other online sexual activities Children who view sexual content online tend to believe that they can learn something from it and are more likely to view online pornography They are more likely to engage in other sexrelated activities such as casual sex or engaging in sexual sensationseeking They are also more prone to have instrumental attitudes towards sex meaning that they perceive sex as core instrument for sexual gratification and to be exposed to unwanted sexual solicitation They are more apt to meet face to face with someone they first got to know online Several factors both internetrelated and not mediate some of these relationships For example viewing sexual content online is related to sexual sensationseeking especially for those children who engage in online sexual activities more frequently as well as those who think that internet pornography has more damaging effects on others than on themselves Viewing sexual content is related to sexting for children who have higher alcohol consumption Morelli et al Stanley et al Chen et al BallesterArnal et al Vandenbosch and van Oosten Stanley et al Chen et al Chang et al Marret and Choo Chen et al Morelli et al Vandenbosch and van Oosten Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper study in Australia that explored the content children are exposed to when watching sexual content online revealed that significantly more children see mens pleasure mens dominance and mens violent behaviours against women than vice versa It also found that girls are more likely than boys to recognize violence against women in pornography These findings are concerning given the evidence that children use pornography to learn about sex Still the findings explain the association among boys between viewing pornography and having sexually aggressive behaviour and holding negative gender attitudes There is much less evidence on protective factors and outcomes in relation to viewing sexual content online Support from parents or friends but not teachers seems to provide buffer against the negative effect of sexually aggressive behaviour associated with viewing online pornography There is no evidence that parental use of internet filtering successfully protects children from encountering sexual content online There are also significant gaps in terms of outcomes One study found no direct relationship between viewing online pornography and its impact on mental health outcomes once the consequences of general internet use are taken into account These consequences include sleep loss and withdrawal when the internet is inaccessible Limitations and suggestions for further research Childrens engagement with digitally mediated sexual activities such as sexting or viewing sexual content online need to be studied in the context of childrens intimacy partner relationships and desire to learn about sex These practices must be understood within the cultures of teenage sociality that both encourage and regulate the exchange of sexual material Future research needs to reflect more closely how children perceive online sexual activities and to remain open to the possibility that for some such activities are beneficial Studying online sexual activities as deviant and harmful behaviours does not correspond with the experiences of all children Another limitation at present relates to the different ways in which studies operationalize sexting with some studies looking only at sending sexts or only at receiving sexts This creates partial picture of the predictors and outcomes of different types of sexting For example it is not clear why some children are more likely to receive than send sexts An area that needs further exploration is the motivations and outcomes of different types of sexting especially the sharing of sexts of others without their consent With regard to the evidence on viewing sexual content future studies should link the content that children see online to outcomes Currently issues of content and outcomes are studied Davis et al Davis et al Lykens et al Doornwaard et al Shin and Lee Shin and Lee Przybylski and Nash Hokby et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper separately Studies should also distinguish between accidental and intentional viewing of sexual content online and the different kinds of sexual content that children may be exposed to Finally more evidence is needed on the impact of viewing sexual content online on childrens wellbeing in general Overall there is lack of clarity regarding the protective role of social support from family and friends in relation to patterns of childrens online sexual activities and their outcomes Studies have not found that family support reduces the likelihood of children sending sext to strangers nor that parents use of internet filtering decreases childrens exposure to sexual content online Nonetheless there is evidence that parental and friend support can act as buffer against the negative effects of viewing online pornography including against sexually aggressive behaviour Parental discussions with children about online privacy settings also reduce the risk of sexting This calls for closer investigation into the impact of different forms of social support on childrens online sexual activities Sexual exploitation and abuse online We define online sexual exploitation and abuse as including all acts of child sexual abuse child prostitution production or dissemination of child sexual abuse materials child corruption the intentional causing for sexual purposes of child to witness sexual abuse or sexual activities and solicitation of children for sexual purposes These acts can take place virtually but can be preceded or accompanied by or can develop into exploitation offline We identified studies on online sexual exploitation and abuse They generally focus on prevalence predictors and risk and protective factors The majority of studies were conducted in European countries with smaller number in the United States and in countries of East and Southeast Asia Most often these studies include older teenagers Children under years of age are generally missing from the evidence base Some studies conflate children with young adults The studies vary in the extent to which they operate within the parameters of our definition of online sexual exploitation and abuse Our search yielded no studies on children exploited infor prostitution child sexual abuse materials or child corruption There are variations in relation to who the perpetrator is and how the child regards the interaction For example some studies specify that the perpetrator is an adult Others also include peers or strangers without asking about age Some research asks children about only unwanted sexual experiences while other studies leave this open This makes it challenging at times to identify the precise definition used in the research and to establish comparability of findings Key findings Online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to combination of factors related to three areas namely the digital context online activities and skills childrelated factors gender age well being offline risks and the social context factors related to family peers and community Children who are more vulnerable offline perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have less protection and support are also more vulnerable online Council of Europe For review of the evidence on child sexual exploitation and abuse see also Radford et al and UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Online victimization can create real risks for the offline victimization of children Being asked to do something sexual online is strong predictor of children meeting in person for sexual purposes an adult they first got to know online In assessing the risk factors the studies mainly focus on three areas The first is the digital context which covers childrens online activities and occasionally skills The second area deals with child related factors such as gender and age wellbeing and offline behaviour for example sensation seeking risktaking and experiences of violence The third is the social context which covers factors related to family peers and community An overall conclusion supported by all studies is that online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to combination of factors across all three areas but that children who are more vulnerable offline perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have less protection and support are also more vulnerable online Children who are at higher risk of victimization tend to be female older teenagers LGBTQI children and children from ethnic minority backgrounds They are also more likely to have experienced other forms of online and offline violence to lack social support and to engage in risky online behaviour such as posting personal information or pictures online and chatting to strangers Factors not significantly related to online sexual exploitation and abuse include childrens selfesteem the number of people on their contact lists and the use of and length of time spent on social networking sites We explore this further in relation to specific types of online sexual exploitation and abuse There is range of protective factors identified in this literature in relation to online sexual exploitation and abuse including enabling parental mediation helpseeking and the ability to recognize violence in personal relationships For better understanding of the incidence and impact of child sexual exploitation and abuse we need to acknowledge the interconnection of childrens existing vulnerabilities both online and offline and the presence of protective factors at both the individual and social level Below we examine the evidence on online sexual solicitation sextortion and cyber dating violence Sexual solicitation online Sexual solicitation also referred to as grooming denotes the process of establishing relationship with child either in person or through the use of information and communication technologies to facilitate online or offline sexual contact Online sexual solicitation refers to requests to child to share personal sexual information or engage in sexual activities or sexual talk through digital technologies This topic yielded the most evidence of all topics in the area of online sexual exploitation and abuse total of publications Most of the research is quantitative using schoolbased survey methods and cluster or stratified random sampling In four cases convenience sampling was used One study used an online panel Most of the research is crosssectional except for one longitudinal study in Taiwan Province of China However even when the studies use large samples overall drilling down to sexual solicitation victims produces small samples DeMarco et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix United Nations Sklenarova et al Chang et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Only one of the studies in our sample is qualitative in that it uses focus groups One study includes young adults but was retained as it is retrospective and covers the preadulthood period Geographically the research covers Asia India Japan Malaysia the Republic of Korea Taiwan Province of China and Thailand Europe Cyprus Germany Ireland Italy the Netherlands Spain and the United Kingdom and the United States Key findings Girls and older teenagers are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation according to most studies but there are exceptions Being subjected to online sexual solicitation is associated with online risk behaviours including exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online having unknown people as friends on social media voluntary sexting video chatting with strangers time spent online on weekdays but not on weekends and high levels of gaming There is connection between being vulnerable offline and online Online sexual solicitation is correlated with offline exposure to violence neglect physical punishment psychological victimization parental conflict sexual harassment and sexual solicitation Perpetrators are mixture of strangers and people known to the child Perpetrators of online sexual solicitation are less likely to be known to the child than perpetrators of facetoface sexual abuse Social support can act as protective factor Children who lack such social resources face double disadvantage they are more likely to experience online sexual solicitation and less likely to seek help The publications indicated that to per cent of those surveyed had been subjected to sexual solicitations by an adult and to per cent had received unwanted sexual solicitations regardless of the age of the perpetrator The differences are likely to be related to both methodological approaches and country specificities The majority of the studies in the review found that girls experience online sexual solicitation unwanted or not specified more often than boys including in Ireland Italy Spain Sweden and the United Kingdom But in some contexts such as Taiwan Province of China boys are more likely than girls to experience online sexual solicitation In Malaysia both genders are equally likely to be subjected to online sexual solicitation and boys are sometimes found to be more likely than girls to be perpetrators of unwanted sexual solicitation few studies explore how sexual solicitation experiences vary by childrens age There is some evidence from two studies in Spain which suggests that age is an important factor This research found that children aged years were significantly more likely to receive requests to engage in sexual activities or in sexual talk or to give out personal sexual information than their younger peers Groenestein et al DeMarco et al Montiel et al Machimbarrena et al Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin de Santisteban and Gmez Guadix DeMarco et al Chang et al Marret and Choo Marret and Choo Montiel et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper aged years Age and gender were also found to be important factors by German study with children aged years which looked at their online sexual interactions with adults and peers These interactions included having sexual conversation exchanging pictures and cybersex The study found that half per cent of children had engaged in some type of online sexual activity While this activity mostly involved peers about one in five children in this study had had sexual interaction with an adult Of the children who engage in online sexual activities about one in five have experiences of being solicited for sexual purposes Overall only per cent of their sexual interactions with peers and per cent of such interactions with adults are perceived as negative This study found that the children experiencing online sexual solicitation were more likely to be girls older teenagers gay or bisexual not living with both parents of foreign nationality and lacking in social support The majority of studies do not ask children about their relationship with the person soliciting them It can be concluded from recent evidence that the perpetrators are mixture of strangers and people known to the child study conducted in Cyprus with children and young adults aged years found that in cases of online sexual solicitation the perpetrator was less likely to be known to the individual than in cases of facetoface sexual abuse Spanish study with younger sample of children aged years showed that in two thirds of online solicitation cases children first met their perpetrator online That same study found that two thirds of the children who engaged in sexual interactions with adults reported the use of some form of persuasion strategy by their perpetrator The study tested three persuasion techniques used by adults in the sexual solicitation of children deception meaning to pretend to be someone else bribery defined as offering money or gifts and the formation of non sexual emotional relationship It found that online sexual solicitations such as requests by an adult for child to send sexual pictures or videos or to engage in cybersex were associated with the use of deception and bribery Sexual interactions for example where children agree to send an adult sexual pictures or videos of themselves or to meet an adult offline to have sexual contact are related to the formation of nonsexual emotional relationship This means that children may be groomed to develop feelings of closeness and intimacy with the adult perpetrator which can then lead directly to sexual interaction and abuse without the mediation of sexual solicitation study in Malaysia of children aged years shows that slightly more than half of the children who were in contact with an unknown person online were invited to facetoface meeting and that per cent of these children went to this meeting Nearly one third of the children reported that the person they met was an adult who posed as minor More than half of the children who met people they first got to know online went to the meeting alone and had met more than six people separately Boys are more likely to meet people face to face as are children who go online in internet cafs view pornography online and disclose personal information on the internet Not being explicitly Sklenarova et al Sklenarova et al Karayianni et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al Marret and Choo Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper forbidden by parents to meet strangers or to use certain websites and chat rooms also increases the likelihood of meeting people offline Of the children who said they had met person they first got to know online per cent reported that they had been assaulted either sexually or physically More than half of these children experienced multiple types of assaults Forced sexual intercourse was reported by respondents in the study males females Several studies explore the role of childrens online activities in relation to the experience of online sexual solicitation longitudinal study in Taiwan Province of China shows that higher levels of online gaming exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online and chatting to strangers via webcam are associated with higher likelihood of exposure to an unwanted sexual solicitation Sexual solicitation is also significantly associated with having unknown people on list of social networking friends voluntary sexting instant messaging or using video chat and time spent online on weekdays but not on weekends Comparing children who are only solicited for sexual purposes with those who are also involved in sexual interaction with an adult meaning that they sent sexual photos or videos of themselves or met face to face with an adult they previously met online the latter are more likely than the former to have played online games to have used chat and to have met new people online Other risk factors include perpetration of online harassment and aggression Being asked to do something sexual online is strong predictor of child meeting in person for sexual purposes an adult they first got to know online There is connection between being vulnerable offline and online Children who are exposed offline to sexual harassment solicitation bullying among boys and parental conflict are also more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation Both physical sexual abuse and online sexual solicitation are significantly correlated with exposure to violence neglect physical punishment and psychological victimization However children experiencing both types of sexual abuse do not experience higher odds of these outcomes than those experiencing only one of them study of children and young people aged years living in Cyprus found that those from urban areas and those whose fathers educational level was lower were more likely to report online sexual solicitation and physical abuse The vicious cycle continues as children who have experienced online solicitation are then more likely to experience sexual violence and abuse offline There is very little research on the effects of sexual solicitation on children Depressive symptoms are significantly positively associated with online sexual solicitation according to studies with children in Spain and Taiwan Province of China but this association was found only among girls in Sweden Marret and Choo Chang et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Marret and Choo Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin DeMarco et al DeMarco et al Karayianni et al Karayianni et al Nagamatsu et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Chang et al Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Low levels of helpseeking reporting experiences of illicit solicitation to friends parents or helpline are associated with higher rates of online sexual solicitation Children who have stronger social support from parents and friends are more likely to show protective behaviour and seek help after experiencing online sexual solicitation Children who have been involved in risky behaviour offline such as intoxication illicit drug use absenteeism from school or having problems with teachers are also more likely to seek help after experiencing online sexual solicitation This suggests that children can also develop protective strategies and resilience Parenting plays key role in protecting children recent crosssectional study conducted across six countries shows that instructive parental mediation is negatively related to being victim of online sexual solicitation among children aged years while restrictive mediation predicts higher levels of victimization Sextortion Sexual extortion sometimes referred to as sextortion is the threatened dissemination of images of sexual nature without consent usually to exact revenge or procure benefits such as additional images sexual acts or money Our database search for the period yielded only one study on sextortion among nationally representative sample of children conducted by Patchin and Hinduja The study of children aged years in the United States used singleitem dichotomous questions for measuring victimization and offending The findings from this study may only be relevant for children in the United States and should not be generalized to other countries Key findings Sextortion usually occurs within existing relationships romantic or friendship and much less by among people unknown to each other Children involved in offending are also more likely to be victims of sextortion The data on sextortion are mostly inconclusive with large variation between studies According to the studies in our sample boys are more likely to be involved in sextortion than girls both as victims and perpetrators but are less likely to tell anyone about it Victims are more likely to be nonheterosexual There are no differences based on age and race The study indicates that per cent of children aged years had reported ever being victims of sextortion Three per cent had reported being offenders There is connection between offending and victimization Those involved in one role are more likely to also be involved in the other similar to online bullying Unlike other forms of sexual exploitation where girls tend to be the victims sextortion victims are more likely to be boys and to be nonheterosexual Boys are also more likely than girls to target others The study found no difference in sextortion experiences by race and no consistent Marret and Choo Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin DeMarco et al DeMarco et al DeMarco et al Wachs et al United Nations Patchin and Hinduja Patchin and Hinduja Some studies find that girls are more likely to be sextortion victims See for example sextortion Such differences may be due to reporting measurement or local differences Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper difference concerning age except that yearolds are generally more likely to be involved compared with children of other ages The victims of sextortion experience range of harms such as being stalked or harassed per cent of boys and per cent of girls being contacted repeatedly online or over the phone per cent of boys and per cent of girls or having fake profile created in their name per cent of boys and per cent of girls In about one in four cases the sextortion results in the sharing of the image with someone else without permission According to the study by Patchin and Hinduja boys are significantly less likely to tell someone including parent the police or their school about sextortion incident Only per cent report it compared with per cent of girls When boys do tell someone they most often turn to friend per cent compared with per cent of girls Girls most often turn to their parent per cent compared with per cent of boys Very few sextortion victims report the incident to the site or app on which it occurred per cent of boys and per cent of girls Intimate partner violence online Intimate partner violence online is broadly defined as abusive behaviour such as harassment control or stalking within sexual relationship or by dating partner facilitated by technology Five studies and one metareview in our sample address cyberdating violence The research is based in Europe Belgium Bulgaria Cyprus England in the United Kingdom Italy Norway and Spain and the United States It employs schoolbased surveys mostly with convenience sampling methods One study employs purposive sample stratified by community risk factors such as poverty unemployment minority populations rental housing femaleheaded households and community violence with random selection of schools and participants Key findings Girls are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence as are children transitioning to adolescence those in heterosexual relationship those who have wider age gap with their partner and those who have experienced bullying victimization or perpetration Adverse childhood experiences such as exposure to violence abuse and other trauma and risk taking such as alcohol binge drinking for boys and early and unsafe sex for girls are riskpredicting factors Girls are more negatively affected by the experience of intimate partner violence than boys and are more likely to be monitored or pressured by their partner Parental involvement such as monitoring and emotional bonding can be protective factor in relation to intimate partner violence online But there is no association with family and peer support community engagement among children or school connectedness SmithDarden et al Van Ouytsel et al Backe et al SmithDarden et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The evidence suggests that girls are more likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence as are those who are younger than their partner those in heterosexual relationship and those who have experience of bullying victimization or perpetration Girls are more likely to be sent too many messages that make them feel uncomfortable to be pressured to share passwords or respond quickly to calls or texts or to have their messages whereabouts and activities monitored by their partner wider age gap between the partners and being the victim of such electronic intrusion are associated with higher likelihood of perpetration Girls are also more negatively affected by the experience than boys Gender plays an important role in relation to predictive risk factors study with children and young people in Belgium aged years who had been victims of cyberdating abuse found that male victims were significantly more likely to have engaged in alcohol binge drinking while girls were more likely to have been sexually active at younger age and to have had unprotected sex Another study which tested the relationship between family school and communitylevel factors and various forms of cyberdating aggression among children in the United States found that gender male predicts coercive sexting but not cyberstalking or online harassment Perpetration of intimate partner and cyberdating violence is overall more common among children transitioning to adolescence and those from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds according to United Statesbased study As with online sexual solicitation offline vulnerability and parenting are significant factors predicting victimization and protection Adverse childhood experiences such as exposure to violence abuse and other trauma significantly predict higher rates of cyberdating aggression perpetration Parental involvement in the form of parental monitoring and emotional bonding is significantly associated with lower likelihood of perpetration of all forms of cyberdating aggression Perceived safety of the community predicts lower levels of cyberstalking only There is no association between intimate partner or cyberdating violence and family and peer support community engagement among children or school connectedness Limitations and suggestions for further research As with most of the other aspects of childrens internet use more evidence is needed on the long term outcomes for children of experiencing online sexual exploitation and abuse For example more evidence is required on recovery time and on childrens capacity to form healthy attachments to trustworthy others in both the immediate aftermath and later in life We need to understand the offline context of childrens lives to identify risk and protective factors for online sexual exploitation and abuse and how to support childrens ability to cope What role do cultural taboos and poverty or inequality play in facilitating sexual exploitation and abuse online or offline Backe et al Hellevik and verlien Reed et al Reed et al Hellevik and verlien Van Ouytsel et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper If we are to understand online sexual exploitation and abuse we need more evidence to explain the pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability their exposure to online sexual solicitation and their response to it This would entail developing model mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens background and living environment home school community with the occurrence of sexual solicitations and sexual abuse There are inconsistencies and variations in how researchers define measure and explain online sexual exploitation and abuse This creates challenges for identifying clear model of vulnerability and protection In most studies the relationship between children and the perpetrators is unclear Further gaps relate to the online platforms where such interactions happen and how they unfold There is more focus in the literature on associations between online sexual exploitation of children and other risk factors and much less on the experiences of harm and the longterm impact on childrens wellbeing and outcomes There needs to be an exploration of the nature of online platforms applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against child sexual exploitation Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING The studies we reviewed typically offer narrow measure of childrens psychological wellbeing more comprehensive model is needed promising solution can be offered by the work of Ryff an American academic and psychologist which is among the most popular conceptualizations of psychological wellbeing Her model of wellbeing incorporates measures of six dimensions self acceptance positive relations with others personal growth purpose in life environmental mastery and autonomy This model has been successfully applied by The Childrens Society in its international survey of childrens wellbeing Childrens Worlds which in wave involves child participants aged years from countries around the world This research makes connections between wellbeing and childrens lives and daily activities their time use and their own perceptions and evaluations of their wellbeing Ryffs model can be supplemented by measures of depression selfharm and life satisfaction It is worth noting that wellbeing may be positioned as an outcome or as an input for example as measure of child vulnerability We identified studies on digital technology and its relation to mental health and wellbeing most of which are based in Europe Belgium Estonia Hungary Italy Lithuania the Netherlands Northern Ireland United Kingdom Norway Spain Sweden and Wales United Kingdom and North America Canada and the United States smaller number of studies address the context in parts of Asia and the Middle East China the Islamic Republic of Iran Israel the Republic of Korea Taiwan Province of China and Thailand The research is predominantly surveybased with only one qualitative study and one metaanalysis The majority of quantitative studies are crosssectional and face methodological issues such as small or convenience samples There are several longitudinal studies in the review but some of them are limited in their findings by sampling issues Key findings Longterm outcomes related to childrens wellbeing mental health or resilience are rarely explored The evidence on how factors related to digital device and internet use may intersect with offline factors and predict child wellbeing requires development The evidence on the impact of childrens internet use on mental health and wellbeing is mixed and inconclusive Some studies show positive association between internet use and negative outcomes such as anxiety depression suicidal thoughts and panic disorder while others show negative association and some studies show no relationship at all In most cases there is only evidence about an association not causality child who uses the internet excessively and experiences poor mental health may be using digital technologies as way of coping with preexisting issues The internet can have positive effect on mental health and wellbeing Children who receive mental health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have reduced depression levels Ryff For more

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper What matters for childrens mental health is less the time spent using the internet and social media and more how children use their time online and the consequences of that use recent UNICEF review on the impact of digital technology use on childrens mental health and well being found that the evidence to date is largely inconclusive It concludes that childrens use of digital technology is more often assessed in terms of the time spent online rather than by measuring such factors as the type of online activities children engage in or the context of internet use This evidence review found similarly mixed results While some studies show positive association between internet use and mental health problems others find negative association or no association at all For example findings from crosssectional and longitudinal studies conducted in China the Islamic Republic of Iran the Republic of Korea and the United States show significant association between increased digital social media or internet use and higher levels of anxiety depressive symptoms suicidal ideation panic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD This association is stronger among children who do not live with either of their parents In contrast three longitudinal studies from Canada European countries and the United States found no significant direct impact of the time children spend using digital technologies such as social media the internet and texting on their mental health in terms of depression and anxiety Another study found that moderate social media use was associated with the highest levels of mental wellbeing compared with either too much or too little social media use It is plausible that these conflicting results stem from the different ways in which digital media use is measured Comparing longitudinal studies it seems that those that find no relationship with mental health measure use in terms of hours spent online per day or per week Studies that do find an association measure the number of times per day or per week that children use certain digital platforms or do specific activities such as sending messages or using social media Several studies show that what matters for childrens mental health is not merely the time spent using the internet and social media but rather how children use this time what they experience online and the consequences of that use More specifically it is the negative perceived impact of high levels of internet use or social media stress on sleep loss and withdrawal negative mood when the internet is inaccessible that indirectly mediates the adverse effect on mental health over time Another study found that children who report frequent daily use across all social media platforms suffer worse mental health problems compared with low social media use subgroups The possible causal relationship between intense internet use and decreased mental health and well being is rarely studied Hence it is often difficult to say whether excessive use of digital technologies is KardefeltWinther Liu et al Lee et al Khodarahimi and Fathi Zhang et al Kim Ra et al Vannucci and McCauley Ohannessian Lim et al Lee et al George et al Heffer et al Hokby et al Shimoga et al Hokby et al van der Schuur et al Vannucci and McCauley Ohannessian Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper the cause or consequence of poor mental health In fact one study found evidence of reverse causation where greater depressive symptoms predicted more frequent social media use although only among girls Most studies do not show significant gender differences in these associations study in the United States of students aged years examined digital selfharm defined as the anonymous online posting sending or otherwise sharing of hurtful content about oneself The authors found that it was significantly correlated with experiences of depressive symptoms qualitative study with children with previous history of selfharm revealed that the internet can act as catalyst for childrens selfharm behaviours normalizing them through their participation in online communities where others share selfharm practices and techniques and through easy access to images that invoke physical reaction and inspire behavioural enactment Digital selfharm is also associated with other experiences of violence and risk both offline and online such as school bullying and cyberbullying drug use and participation in various forms of adolescent deviance such as attacking someone or stealing These results tie in with the evidence of the positive association between cyberbullying victimization and online sexual solicitation among children and suicidal thoughts depression and anxiety Another group of studies demonstrates the positive impact of internet use on mental health and wellbeing Higher levels of childrens wellbeing are positively associated with receiving mental health support online and with speaking to friends online regarding personal problems Similarly decreased levels of depression are associated with freely revealing negative emotions online Social media use can be positive coping mechanism for socially rejected children because they tend to use it to share their personal difficulties positive effect on mental health is also observed when internet use is perceived to make life more meaningful improve school grades or enhance performance Thus besides time spent online it is important to understand the ways in which children use the internet and social media what they are exposed to while online and the mediating perceived consequences of that use to have better idea of the impact on their mental health An overwhelming majority of the studies we reviewed do not measure outcomes at all Instead they describe the incidence of certain behaviours but leave their consequences unexplored Among the studies that do examine outcomes most outcomes measured in online risk research are immediate and topicrelevant Longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health or resilience are rarely explored For instance in studies of cyberbystanding one outcome measured is that of expressed empathy with the victim following an intervention But the longterm consequences of being cyber Heffer et al Pa tchin and Hinduja Jacob et al Fisher et al Hinduja and Patchin Kim et al Nikolaou Chang et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Best et al Xie et al Ophir Hokby et al Delgado and Escortel Razjouyan et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper bystander are not examined In studies of online sexual solicitation shortterm outcome measured may be helpseeking from friends or family while longerterm outcomes that may be related to well being and mental health are not explored Efforts to tackle longterm consequences present methodological challenge for crosssectional studies Measures of wellbeing may be positioned as an outcome or as an input such as measure of child vulnerability Studies that acknowledge this problem tend to posit bidirectional or transactional process whereby more vulnerable young people may become drawn into online risk and in turn find themselves more likely to experience harm or they simply observe correlations For instance one study found correlation between sexting and negative mental health and wellbeing such as suicidal thoughts and behaviours and body image concerns Strikingly we found few studies exploring the consequences of online sexual solicitation on victims wellbeing The literature clearly assumes that these are adverse but the evidence and the measures needed are underdeveloped the Disrupting Harm project will address this gap In the research on sexting there is little examination of outcomes which is also problematic though here the outcomes are less certain since sexting can be either voluntary or coerced behaviour Limitations and suggestions for further research One substantial gap in the literature relates to the lack of comprehensive approach to studying the relationship between internet use and wellbeing and how offline factors may influence outcomes Crossnational research on childrens wellbeing in relation to the offline domain demonstrates the importance of wide range of childrelated factors These include age gender home context family relationships peer relationships school context teacher relationships neighbourhood quality health and safety and risk behaviours such as obesity substance abuse violence and sexual risktaking Countrylevel factors such as gross domestic product and income inequality are not strong predictors of child wellbeing We found no studies examining how factors related to digital device and internet use may intersect with offline factors and predict child wellbeing This highlights the need for further research With few exceptions most studies focus on the impact on mental health of time spent using the internet without considering the nature or context of the different activities that children engage in online When testing the impact of time spent online researchers rarely include variables related to the perceived quality of online experiences or issues to do with online victimization such as cyber bullying Knauf et al DeMarco et al Milton et al Newland et al UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti Newland et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA Robust highquality and comparable research is still necessary In many areas our knowledge remains tentative The large majority of studies we found are based on small or nonrepresentative samples involve correlational analyses of crosssectional data and control for limited number of background variables While such studies offer some insights their limitations make it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider life environment We need better representation of the diversity of childrens circumstances At present most research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North Evidence on the preteenage years and from global South countries is sparse Filling these gaps will enhance our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience We still need to learn more about the positive effects of childrens internet use Only one fifth out of of the studies we reviewed explore opportunities and benefits of internet use In contrast childrens encounters with certain online risks particularly excessive internet use cyber bullying gambling and problematic gaming feature heavily in the research literature Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet without including variables related to the perceived quality or context of online experiences or experiences related to online victimization for example cyberbullying This is serious limitation which constrains our understanding of which activities are more relevant to positive child outcomes Even more so as recent research demonstrates that subjective measures of time spent online can be highly unreliable There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to opportunities and risks We need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of childrens internet use to develop better understanding of what factors are significantly associated with positive and negative experiences and how much these matter for different groups of children To do so we also need more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable comparative research More evidence is needed on the outcomes of childrens internet use While studies may link childrens online experiences to predictive factors in their life circumstances they rarely follow up on the consequences of childrens internet use over time to document either benefits or harms The evidence is particularly scarce in relation to longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health and resilience which require longitudinal research To develop the longitudinal evidence base in this field we need more longterm investment funding for and research commitment to the study of childrens outcomes implementing efficient ways to account for the rapid changes in the digital environment We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are linked for example childrens online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations and generated hypotheses about how these shape childrens wellbeing in an increasingly digital world few recently published studies have tested these models We have begun this process in our recent country comparative report comparing Global Kids Online findings for crossnational similarities and differences see Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper We need better understanding of childrens digital ecology There needs to be some exploration of the nature of digital devices online platforms applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm More evidence is needed to explain the pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability exposure to both offline and online risks and childrens responses to risk Investigating these pathways would entail developing model of mechanisms mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens backgrounds and living environment home school community with the occurrence of different types of risk and harm online This should be done using combination of analyses of personal countrylevel and digital ecology factors that can foster or prevent childrens exposure to risk There is an urgent need for childcentred research methods to complement the recent evidence We still do not understand anywhere near enough about how children see these issues We need research on cultures of childhood as they are experienced by children themselves For example we need research on forms of sexual exploration online that may be tolerated or even encouraged because they have positive impacts on childrens evolving identities There is need for researchers to conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences in their own words For more on childcentered research see Third et al For further suggestions see Stoilova et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World

texts applying the same criteria for relevance and new requirement for methodological rigour and removing all studies that do not meet the criteria Results for which the full text was unavailable were also removed creating final sample for analysis In relation to the particular focus on harm most of the studies were based on research with adults either victims or perpetrators or case files rather than research with children Several studies also analysed online interactions between children and perpetrators These were also excluded Exclusions The exclusions made during the screening mostly

million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet Of the roughly million people with Internet access be children and adolescents Digital activity has also intensified especially during the Covid pandemic There is an urgent need to increase digital literacy from an early age to minimize the risk of online harm to equip children who are future voters and consumers with the skills and understanding they need to assume those roles and to maximize meaningful use of the Internet Generally Indonesians have poor digital literacy This problem was exacerbated when Information and Communication Technology ICT was dropped from the national school curriculum in Several government initiatives including the National Literacy Movement Gerakan Literasi Nasional GLN the Siberkreasi program and reintroducing ICT to the school curriculum have yet to be implemented effectively and with specific focus on improving digital literacy skills Promoting Digital Literacy Skill for Students through Improved School Curriculum Policy Brief No by Nadia Fairuza Azzahra Felippa AmantaApril POLICY BRIEF shutterstockYos Digitalization and Digital Literacy in Indonesia The number of Internet users in Indonesia has increased significantly in recent years Between and Internet users increased by In of the million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet Statistics Indonesia While the greatest increase comes from people living in urban areas where the number of users increased by rural areas have also experienced steady rise increasing by Young people have also enjoyed increasing access to the Internet In the past four years the percentage of Indonesian students aged years who have access to the Internet increased sharply from to Statistics Indonesia Graph Slightly more than quarter of Internet users are children and adolescents To strengthen students digital literacy the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to improve the curriculum for teaching ICT This requires the participation of the Ministry of Communications and Informatics and nongovernment actors with special expertise in digital solutions It has to apply new approach of cultivating critical thinking skills in the classroom improving teachers capacities in both ICT and critical thinking and introducing basic digital literacy skills for parents The Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to cooperate with the Ministry of Communication and Informatics on expanding technology and Internet access especially for students living in rural areas This requires the cooperation of the private sector shutterstockPhunkod Digital activity has also surged survey conducted by Hootsuite and We are Social reveals that Indonesian respondents aged years old spend an average of hours and minutes on the Internet every day This is higher than the global average of hours and minutes per day Indonesia ranks th out of surveyed countries in terms of most time spent on the Internet higher than Singapore and Vietnam and lower than the Philippines and Malaysia Children are also well engaged on the Internet especially in social media Focus group interviews in Cambodia Indonesia Malaysia and Thailand conducted by UNICEF found that many children manage multiple social media accounts for entertainment communication and education purposes Some of them are not only consumers but also content creators During the Covid pandemic digital activities have expanded and intensified as many people have had to shift to online solutions For example new digital consumers in ecommerce in Indonesia increased as much as during the Covid pandemic in Google et al Ministry of Trade Due to longterm school closures educational activity has also shifted online especially in urban areas As result children are exposed to an expanded range of digital content and products and become more important segment of online consumers However the remarkable growth of Internet use in Indonesia has not necessarily corresponded with improved digital literacy This refers not only to the ability to use technology such as skills to use devices software and the basic use of the Internet It also includes digital literacy skills that revolve around the ability to understand evaluate and responsibly use information acquired from digital sources which is the subject of this policy brief Considering the premature development of digital literacy in Indonesia this brief will not engage in discussion of more advanced levels of digital literacy that require an understanding of cybersecurity digital citizenship data privacy etc According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Indonesia ranks st out of countries for its level of education and preparedness to use the Internet Indonesias position is lower than neighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia which rank nd and rd respectively The low level of digital literacy in Indonesia especially in rural areas limits what Internet users can meaningfully do when they are online and may exacerbate the digital divide Purbo Digital divide is gap between individuals families enterprises and geographical areas at various socioeconomic levels in terms of both their access to information and communication technology ICT resources and their use of the Internet for any purposes Source Statistics Indonesia bFigure Percentage of students aged years old who have access to Internet The Urgency of Digital Literacy Improvement As Internet use pervades every aspect of life the urgency of improving digital literacy increases This includes improving understanding of how to use digital products in responsible manner and taking advantage of opportunities and resources available on the Internet There is wide agreement that users must be equipped with the skills needed to maximize the benefits from their online activities Purbo Building these skills can begin at young age especially when children are already exposed to the Internet Children are quite agile in their technology use but this does not necessarily translate to maturity in content consumption and engagement Many online platforms are not designed for children and there are hardly any barriers to prevent their accessing inappropriate content Without thorough understanding of digital literacy children may be susceptible to online threats and harmful content including hoaxes and misinformation cyberbullying online fraud and even sexual exploitation Awareness of hoaxes and misinformation is especially relevant in light of the societal threats posed by populist and radical internet content that can threaten democratic norms and institutions As future voters citizens and political participants children must be prepared to confront and recognize dangerous and misleading content and sources In addition to preventing immediate online harm acquiring digital literacy at an early age prepares children to become consumers of online goods and services In the interest of future consumer protection children should be equipped with the ability to critically assess online terms and conditions and understand consumer rights and data privacy The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index Indeks Keberdayaan KonsumenIKK stood at in This score indicates that Indonesian consumers understand their role but are not yet critical in terms of using their rights and obligations Ministry of Trade Improving digital literacy among children can help to improve performance on this index in the future Digital literacy is also important because it opens the door to employment opportunities and facilitates the mastery of other essential skills Karpati Digitalization constantly creates and transforms jobs throughout the labor market Digital literacy skills give students the ability to thrive in this dynamic digital environment The Personal Data Protection Bill Rancangan UndangUndang Perlindungan Data PribadiRUU PDP under development in the Indonesian House of Representatives considers introducing minimum age of years for setting up social media account without parental consent Sari This policy is intended to protect children from harmful internet content but it will have the effect of reducing opportunities to build digital literacy that will allow them to innovate and thrive in the modern world Equipping children with digital literacy will help them to be digitally resilient to make responsible decisions and to optimize the benefits of spending their time online The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index IKK measures consumers ability to empower themselves The IKK index is grouped into scoring systems Awarerecognize their rights and obligations as consumers Understandunderstand their rights and obligations to protect themselves Capableable to decide the best choices as consumers and prioritize local products Criticalactively defend their rights and prioritize local products Empoweredactively defending consumers interest in interacting with the market Teaching Digital Literacy Skills in Indonesia Digital literacy is strongly dependent on basic literacy skillsreading and writing comprehension Unfortunately Indonesia consistently performs poorly in literacy Fifteenyearold Indonesian students surveyed in the Programme for International Students Assessment PISA ranked st out of countries Only demonstrated at least level proficiency in reading compared to the OECD average of OECD On the other hand of Indonesian adults living in Jakarta perform at or below level in literacy according to the Survey of Adult Skills PIIAC OECD These surveys highlight that while the majority of Indonesians can understand simple texts using basic vocabulary they have difficulty understanding and critically evaluating long and complex texts contributing factor toward low literacy levels is the lack of emphasis on critical thinking skills in the school curriculum The National Curriculum mandates the implementation of High Order Thinking Skills HOTS but it is not wellintegrated into or widely taught during teacher training in Indonesia Ilyas In practice Indonesian education focuses on older approaches to learning such as memorization WENR UNICEF In addition to the problems of low literacy and poor critical thinking skills in the general population digital literacy education is largely missing from Indonesian schools Information and Communication Technology ICT was included as compulsory subject in the National Curriculum also known as Kurikulum Tingkat Satuan Pendidikan or KTSP but content was limited to basic skills such as how to use computer computer applications and devices to support study activities In the Ministry of Education removed ICT from the list of compulsory subjects in the National Curriculum with the intention of integrating ICT learning across all school subjects Bona However many public schools responded by dropping the subject altogether Purbo Teachers of other subjects were unable to incorporate ICT into their lesson plans because their own ICT skills and knowledge were insufficient whereas ICT teachers were confused by the removal of the subject from the National Curriculum Subekti Yudha Luqman As result many Indonesian students have received no education in ICT The inequality of Internet access across the different regions of Indonesia and the socioeconomic conditions of Indonesians are the major structural challenges for the improvement of digital literacy First the percentage of households that can access the Internet is the highest on the most densely populated island of Java while it is much lower in the eastern parts of Indonesia Statistics Indonesia as illustrated in Figure PISA has scale of to indicate reading proficiency The scale consists of indicating the proficiency of understanding simple text with literal meaning Scale indicates the ability to identify the meaning of moderatelength text Scale indicates the ability to understand multiple texts Scale students can understand indirect cues and nuances in single or multiple texts Scale students are able to compare the meaning of multiple lengthy texts Scale indicates the ability to understand long and abstract texts and use multiple criteria to validate the information Source Statistics Indonesia bFigure Internet Access percent per Household by Province in Indonesia Internet users are predominantly households with higher incomes They are more likely to afford and access devices and internet subscriptions Bachtiar et al Lack of Internet access is strongly linked to low levels of digital literacy Inexperienced users are unlikely to be as competent or resilient as those who use the Internet on daily basis Expanding access especially to disadvantaged communities is crucial for digital literacy improvement The inequality of access is also visible in the education sector According to Statistics Indonesia only of primary and junior secondary schools and of senior secondary schools have access to the Internet This results in low and widely varying levels of ICT

Improving digital literacy is one of five priorities in the governments plan to accelerate the digital transformation in Indonesia Cabinet Secretariate of the Republic of Indonesia However there is no solid set of policies or clearly targeted outcomes related to digital literacy The Economist Intelligence Unit Efforts to increase digital literacy start from the basic level of increasing general literacy by nurturing the ability to understand interpret create and communicate texts They must also involve critical thinking skills and the ability to critically observe analyse and interpret information and the logical connection between ideas to support rational individual decisionmaking processes Finally and following more specific definition of digital literacy they require the ability to find evaluate use and create content on digital platforms Dealing with such complex set of necessary skills involves programs and activities spread across government agencies In Indonesia this includes the Ministry of Education and Culture the Ministry of Religious Affairs as well as the Ministry of Communication and Informatics In order to promote general literacy the government has initiated programs such as the National Literacy Movement Gerakan Literasi NasionalGLN established by the Ministry of Education and Culture MOEC in It includes the promotion of literacy in three areas literacy in schools Gerakan Literasi SekolahGLS family Gerakan Literasi KeluargaGLK and society Gerakan Literasi MasyarakatGLM GLN was mandated through MOEC Regulation No on Developing Character on Students with the purpose of synchronizing all literacy programs that have been running in each MOEC directorate and expanding public involvement in the development of literacy culture in Indonesia The main focus on this movement is to cultivate reading habits of students The GLN guidelines also addresses digital literacy and defines it as the skills to make use of information from digital sources in an accountable manner It includes the aim of developing digital learning habits and improving the use of digital media in school education GLN but it does not seek to increase the skills to critically analyze and navigate digital sources The evaluation of digital literacy according to the GLN guidelines merely assesses whether stakeholders have integrated digital sources and media in the learning process and their daily life MOEC Several MOEC regulations are of relevance in this context Increasing digital literacy is not being directly addressed in the National Education Standards but critical thinking skills are included MOEC Regulation No specified them as the basic competency standard required for primary and secondary school graduates MOEC Regulation No on the Standard of Content for Primary and Secondary Education also mentioned critical thinking skills as one of the indicators for mastering school subjects While MOEC Regulation No on the Standardized Process of Primary and Secondary Schools demands that the learning process must include activities of observing questioning and analysing which are essentially critical thinking skills these skills have not become an indicator to assess students competence in MOEC Regulation No on the Education Assessment Standard National Education Standards are the minimum standards in Indonesias education system They consist of eight standards Standard of content Standard of process Graduate competence standard Teachers and educational personnel standard Standard of facilities and infrastructure Management standards Financing standards Educational assessment standards basic level of digital literacy training addresses the technical competence to use digital devices and software In that regard MOEC Regulation No reintroduced ICT as an optional subject at the primary school level and made it compulsory subject for junior and secondary middle schools SMPSMA beginning in the academic year However deficiencies of the ICT curriculum with respect to digital literacy remain The curriculum puts strong focus on understanding and improving technical competence in areas such as programming using office applications and writing blog posts while there is insufficient emphasis on how to responsibly and critically use these technologies The national curriculum has to be based on the National Education Standards which include critical thinking skills However MOEC Regulation No MOEC does not integrate critical thinking skills in the ICT subject For the schools under the Ministry of Religious Affairs MORA such as Madrasah MORA Regulation No on Guideline of Curriculum Implementation in Madrasah has yet to include digital literacy in the curriculum The subject that seems most suitable to convey digital literacy is informatics informatika but it is an optional and not mandatory subject on junior and senior secondary levels of Madrasah It is not offered on the primary education level As for other institutions of Islamic education such as Pesantren the curriculum is designed by the Kyai or prominent figures in the institution without the intervention of MORA Azzahra Pesantren may teach ICT skills but the exact number of pesantren teaching ICT remains unknown Most Pesantren are traditional by nature anyway and unlikely to address digital technologies There is no information available on how many Pesantren are equipped with necessary facilities such as Internet and computers Despite the lacking focus on digital literacy skills in the national curriculum some schools especially those operated by the private sector have integrated digital literacy in advanced ICT classes They go beyond the national curriculum requirements when they teach st century skills such as digital citizenship critical thinking and problem solving Sampoerna Academy nd British School Jakarta nd Still this will only be accessible for students from upperincome families Most schools in Indonesia are not equipped with digital facilities and lack the human resources to teach students digital literacy and not just the functionalities of digital devices Mainstreaming digital literacy must therefore go beyond the initiatives of individual schools and requires significant support from the government More specifically addressing digital literacy Ministry of Communication and Informatics MOCI initiated the National Digital Literacy Movement Gerakan Nasional Literasi Digital or Siberkreasi to improve digital literacy skills in Indonesia Siberkreasi is multistakeholder initiative aimed at reducing misinformation and negative contents on the Internet through public awareness activities by private businesses civil society organizations etc As part of the movement MOCI also provides online references and digital sources through the website literasidigitalid in the form of videos articles and ebooks on digital literacy It also encourages the government to include digital literacy in the school curriculum MOCI As of people had participated in offline Siberkreasi programs including seminars workshops and talk shows in provinces Audiences included both students and adults MOCI This policy brief specifically addresses the curriculum after the ICT subject has been reintroduced Madrasah is an Islamic education institution that teaches the national curriculum and uses methods similar to formal schools but also incorporate weekly hours of Islamic instructions Madrasah are found on all levels of school education primary Madrasah IbtidaiyahMI junior secondary Madrasah TsanawiyahMTs and senior secondary Madrasah AliyahMA Pesantren is culturallyrooted Islamic educational institution in Indonesia characterized by its boarding school element and traditional method of teaching Islamic theological materials However the scope of this program remains limited and it is unknown whether it has improved digital literacy There is no program evaluation incorporated into Siberkreasi and digital literacy has not yet been added to the school curriculum In MOCI and its Siberkreasi partners plan to publish Digital Literacy Module which covers four aspects of digital literacy namely digital skills digital safety digital ethics and digital culture This module is supposed to provide practical tips on improving digital literacy skills There will also be equipped with evaluation parts in every chapter to assess users understanding The module is yet to behad not been published during the at the time of writing process of this policy brief Policy Recommendations Create comprehensive interministerial framework for digital literacy MOCI and MOEC have cooperated in organizing events on digital literacy however despite the fact that both address the improvement of digital literacy the National Literacy Movement and Siberkreasi are largely separated from one another There is need to streamline efforts in comprehensive interministerial framework Improve digital literacy education in the school curriculum As ICT education was reintroduced in schools in MOEC and MORA should adjust the curriculum to fit the demands of the digital age Students must be prepared to be responsible and literate digital citizens and consumers The curriculum should prioritize cultivating the ethical and responsible use of technology as well as navigating myriad information in the digital settings The curriculum should prioritize responsible information use and sharing identification of trustworthy sources of information and protecting students during their online activity These skills are more relevant than the dated ICT content in the curriculum Teaching material must be simplified and adjusted to the specific age groups in school while also involving parents to guide and support their children in online activities Cultivate critical thinking across all school subjects Critical thinking skills are crucial prerequisite to improving digital literacy Critical thinking is necessary for understanding and verifying information from online sources In developed countries such as Finland and Switzerland critical thinking is an integral aspect of education MOEC and MORA should rethink and provide guidance on how to better integrate critical thinking skill across all learning activities while learning lessons from the shortcomings of this strategy for ICT education Practices such as working collaboratively with peers using HOTS content and questions for assignments and exams and cultivating habit of questioning analyzing and crafting arguments in discussion should be part of every classroom Include digital literacy and critical thinking in teachers training Digital literacy materials should be included in teachers training Without improving the low overall ICT competence and critical thinking pedagogy among teachers they will not be able to play their part in improving the digital literacy of students Equipping the parents with basic digital literacy skills Developing responsible online behavior starts at home To be able to supervise the online activities of their children parents must themselves know how to navigate social media find reliable news and critically assess the content Parents need to have basic digital literacy skills because they are also not immune to digital threats MOCIs Siberkreasi needs to create training modules and offer courses that target parents Cooperating with the private sector to formulate relevant curriculum content The digital space is dynamic and everchanging The education sector has difficulty keeping up In order to improve the dynamics of digital literacy education MOEC and MORA should coordinate with MOCI and engage in partnerships with private sector experts The private sector has been engaged in public seminars and talk shows through MOCIs Siberkreasi program but not in improving the school curriculum These external experts can help the government to formulate relevant indicators for the digital literacy contents skills in the school curriculum Improving access of technology to support digital inclusion Improving Internet access and technology especially in rural parts of Indonesia should remain government priority in order to address the digital disparity and open up opportunities for disadvantaged families MOCI is planning to equip about villages with Internet access Private sector involvement which has be considered should be encouraged MOEC and MORA should also cooperate with the private sector to equip schools especially in rural areas with Internet access laptops and computers References Azzahra NF Effects of the Pesantren Law on Indonesias Education System Projection Center for Indonesian Policy Studies Bachtiar Diningrat Kusuma Al

['Effectiveness of Digital Platforms to Reduce VAW Dr Erika Fraser and Caroline Enye January Query What is the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms eg soap operas radio programmes Facebook Apps YouTube and Instagram to reduce violence against women Purpose To test soap opera approach to drive behaviour change to address deeply ingrained socio cultural norms that enable very high levels of VAWG in Bangladesh Reaching women and girls through traditional outreach and training has had some impact but digital technology presents an opportunity to increase and widen our reach Digital and mobile phone penetration is high in Bangladesh particularly amo ng young people At this stage we envisage the soap opera would primarily target young people years with the scripting of the story youth led and broadcast on digital platforms used by young people in Bangladesh Introduction Traditional and digital media platforms can be important pproaches to reach young people with social messaging with huge potential to transform harmful social norms around gender and violence through public discussion and social interaction However these tools are not without risks and challenges This document provides rapid review of the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms including soap operas radio programmes Facebook Apps YouTube and Instagram to reduce violence against women and girls VAWG As these digital platforms are still relatively new this query also includes any evidence on the effectiveness of more traditional me dia approaches eg radio television This report begins by setting out the methodology and strength of the evidence base Section before pulling out the key lessons from the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms to reduce VAWG Section Further details on case studies are provided in Annex Methodology and evidence base The review prioritised existing syntheses where possible in order to draw on the fullest range of evidence possible given time constraints Search strategy Studies were identified through searches using Google and relevant electronic databases PubMed Science Direct and Google Scholar for priority sources Key search terms included soap opera radio television TV Facebook Apps YouTube Instagram technology digital AND violence against women GBV rape AND adolescent youth young people Criteria for inclusion To be eligible for inclusion in this rapid mapping studies had to fulfil the following criteria Focus Research evaluations and studies of digital platforms and soap opera programmes to reduce violence against women Time period January Language English and Portuguese Traditional media refers to television radio and print media DFID refers to the word digital within its strategy as the tools techniques technology and approaches of the internet age Typically digital media is used to describe internet forums blogs wikis podcasts and social media applications eg YouTube Instagram Facebook VAWG Helpdesk Research Report No Publishing status publicly available in almost all cases pub lished online Geographical focus low and middle income countries but opened up to high income countries in areas where evidence was lacking Overall the evidence base on the effectiveness of digital platforms and media programming to reduce VAWG is limited according to DFIDs How to Note on Assessing the Strength of Evidence ie moderate to low quality studies medium size evidence body low levels of consistency The most rigorous studies are over ten years old eg Soul City in South Africa Programme in Brazil or currently awaiting results eg Change Starts at Home in Nepal Most other studies are either lowquality observational studies or are based primarily on monitoring data on the reach of programme for example ow many viewers or listeners rather than impact The few systematic reviews that exist on VAWG point to the scarcity of high quality rigorous research in this area and particular ly lack of research measuring changes in violent behaviour or experiences of VAWG Fulu et al Trabold et al There is particularly limited data on the effectiveness of digital platforms partly due to this being relatively new approach and the rapidly evolving technological context Various apps and online tools have been developed but these are mostly not evaluated There is also an vidence gap in understanding he effectiveness of different approaches for women and girls who are particularly vulnerable to violence online and offline such as adolescent girls women and girls with disabilities and young people of diverse sex ualities and gender identities Faith and Fraser Examples of soap opera and digital platforms used to address VAWG see Annex for further examples and details Programme

driving behaviour change around VAWG but research suggests that it should be linked with more intensive engagement via offline activities and local action Key lessons include the importance of providing opportunities for young people to put new norms and behaviours into practice India soap opera whose themes include acid attacks and omestic violence Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon MKBKSH Woman Can Achieve Anything used communication approach across wide range of communication platforms to engage the audience As part of this it formed community outreach groups Research found that the groups were spurring interpersonal conversations beyond the group for example of group Including television and radio serial an interactive voice response system social media outlets and on theground activities The programme partnered with NGOs in the states of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh to infuse MKBKSH viewinglistening with community outreach groups groups in Districts of Bihar and groups in Districts of Madhya Pradesh These groups were called Sneha Groups named afte Dr Sneha the protagonist in the soap opera members reported talking about the issues raised in the soap opera to family to friends and to frontline health or social workers Wang and Singhal In India Bell Bajao found that mobile video vans accompanied by staff and youth advocates were extremely effective in mobilising communities nd enabled the public to ask questions about domestic violence and womens rights Breakthrough In Nigeria Voices for Change VC observed that people that had physical interaction with the programme had the most intense change but that others who were targeted indirectly through mass media also sometimes reached position from where they are able to act on gender inequality brandmass edia campaigns are an important part of creating change but may not be enough by themselves to create profound change in most cases Rather they can create the conditions for further influencing by those that experienced intensive inputs they are the next generation of low hanging fruit Milward and Nelson Other examples of mediadigital programmes involving offline discussion groups include Soul City South Africa Change Starts at Home Nepal Programme and Entre Ns Brazil and bey ond and Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales We Are Different We Are Equal Nicaragua Evidence suggests the type of communications platform visual vs verbal appears to play role in influencing behaviour change although further research is needed and attributing change within multi media programme can be complex Data from Nigerias VC programme found difference in attitude and behaviour associated with hearing the media talk of the town about violence against women in the Purple Tinz radio show versus seeing violence portrayed in the media This suggests that seeing or hearing depictions of violence can reinforce harmful descriptive norms the sense that violence is common and acceptable In contrast hearing violence being discussed provides lis tenersviewers the space to analyse and challenge their own perceptions and harmful norms see box below Influencing Behaviour Change Lessons from DFIDs Voices for Change VC programme Whilst the results are not clear cut and there is more to learn about how to effectively use mass communications communications platforms which specifically created space for discussion and interrogation were shown to be particularly effective For example findings from VC suggests that seeing more scenes of violence against women portrayed on TVradio corresponds with higher VAWG perceptions and behaviour whereas discussion of VAWG on TV and the radio correlates with decline in VAWG at home This hy pothesis is consistent with findings from VCs qualitative surveys where interviewees credited discursive spaces as being particularly influential in the development of new ideas and shifting personal attitudes and behaviours The impact of online content is mixed Evidence generated by VC finds that individuals participating in the Purple Academy and Purple online Purple Spaces felt more willing to speak up against violence Yet findings from VC show very different results from light versus intensive web engagement People with intensive online Purple Academy exposure completion of module reported four to eight times greater change in their support for gender equality including their willingness to speak up against VAWG compared to thos with general Purple Academy recognition Analysis of the Attitudes Practice and Social Norms Survey APSN results suggest that people who had only light exposure to online Purple content are consuming digital media from much broader range of sources as well and this wider online engagement is different from people who have no exposure to online Purple con tent This matters because simultaneously with programming online there were many other spaces and forums where gender was being discussed in unmoderated and often negative ways Sources VC DennyE et all Storylines and essaging Storylines and essages should be piloted with target audiences to ensure they are understood correctly and to minimise any unintended negative effects Avis The evaluation of Soul City soap opera in South Africa highlighted the importanc of formative research with both audiences and experts to develop and field test storylines and materials to ensure their effectiveness DFIDs VC programme also gained valuable lessons about messaging both in pre test and in the annual communications eview At the launch of the brand whilst users found the Purple brand appealing and the communications relevant there was no association with gender equality This resulted in the programme re branding to Purple the suggesting gender equa lity which created dramatic shift in users understanding of the core brand message The most effective messaging is tailored to audiences using social marketing principles and creating supportive environment that enables the intended audience to make hanges Avis eg by mobilising communities in support of the campaign For example VCs Purple lifestyle brand unified communications encouraging sense of wider gender equality movement ather than disparate activities VC and Identifying how gender equal ity and non violent behaviour will benefit the audience was at the core of communication Programmes should avoid reinforcing harmful descriptive norms that VAWG is widespread and instead look to reinforce protective norms or put positive norms in place For example in Nicaragua Paluck and Ball note that it appears possible that the plot of the television series and radio call in programme Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales We are Different We are Equal may have reinforced negative descriptive norms such as the perception that sexual and physical abuse are widespread problems By advertising how common problem is there is risk of norma lising this behaviour For example in Nigeria positive messages around self fulfilment career success and loving romantic relationships were developed from VCs research into the values young people held The meta narrative of gender equality within rel ationships was promoted by the Purple tagline creating sense of identity as person who will be the best they can be and support others to reach their full potential It is also important to channel individuals into opportunities to act on messages such as supporting and advertising hotline to report violence For example Soul City in South Africa partnered with national toll free helpline with online counsellors and comprehensive national database to refer callers to ongoing support at community level approx imately calls were answered on lines over months When raising awareness or trying to change social norms it is an ethical imperative to ensure that details of local keep services are accessible for peopl who have experienced violence see later section on safeguarding single brand identity unifies communications encouraging wider sense of movement for change For example the Girl Effect programme developed different brands in close association ith girls Ni Nyampinga in Rwanda meaning the beautiful girl inside and out who makes good decisions in Kinyarwanda and Yegna in Ethiopia ours in Amharic In Ethiopia the Yegna brand focuses on branded edutainment package radio drama talk show music and network of Yegna ambassadors who hold weekly listening parties that creates platform to have national conver sation about some of the cultural norms holding girls back such as violence against girls Nigerias VC Purple brand was effective in its ability to attribute individuals change and to which particular media platform through the annual Social Norms At titude and Practice Survey The findings informed programming choices to maximise impact and value for money Descriptive norms are what people think other people do Saturation or intensity of messaging is key to changing behaviours For example research in Burkina Faso on using radio programming concluded that up to ten messages day are required to be able to scientifically prove subsequent related change in behaviour Murray et al However such high intensity broadcasting is challenging to achieve in practice instead the study recom mend developing messages across range of channels short second advertising spots combined with longer dramas and opportunities to interact Broadening ccess to digital platforms Rigorous enquiry can help identify which communications platform are most accessible and used by the target audience National data may be out ofdate or not disaggregate by factors such as gender age religionculture disability Small scale pilots can help with understanding diversity and nclusion Evidence suggests that it is also important not to rely solely on digital platforms the most effective programmes provide alternative options to ensure young people who are not digitally connected are not being left behind For example in Br azil Promundos Entre Ns Between Us radio soap opera aired on community radio and was broadcast in places you ng people frequented schools beauty salons cyber cafes In rural Sierra Leone Media Matters for Women MMW broadcasts udio podcasts at Listening Centres that MMW builds and manages through community promoters in and around towns often attracting around people to hear the weekly broadcasts People with disabilities can face particular barriers to accessing traditional and digital media DFIDs Strategy for Disability Inclusive Development notes the importance of considering the differential needs of girls and women with disabilities and ensuring they can access the same opportunities to participate DFID No examples were found during this query of media or digital tools on VAWG which have considered the needs of people with disabilities DFID have highlighted various ways tha digital technologies can overcome barriers includ ing voice recognition magnification and text tospeech functionality for people with visual cognitive learning and mobility disabilities text messaging telephone relay and video captions for pers ons with hearing and speech disabilities and hands free navigation and gesture controlled interfaces for people with severe mobility impairments DFID World Bank Programmes can also work offline with Disabled Peoples Organisations DPOs to reach people with disabilities who cannot access digital platforms Further advice and information can be accessed at DFIDs new disability helpdesk Working with young people around digital platforms Formative research is important in understanding how young men and women use different digital platforms In Nigeria VCs legacy paper on using digital spaces noted that young people often engage for short periods of time while they multitask with other activities view different sites at once messag friends as well as being regular interrupted by bad connection Programmes need to take these habits into account when designing content for digital platforms and when evaluating impact Such as Kenema Makeni and Waterloo located in three different provinces Contact email Note that VC findings refer to digital onlinemobile only Usage of radio tv tc is less complex Cocreation with young people is important to get the content and messaging right For example the Springster online mobile first platform formally Girl Effect Mobile was designed for and created by irls Girl readers submit their own stories via monthly Your Words contest and connect with each other using features such as commenting threads polls and reactions In DFIDs VC programme in Nigeria young people were engaged in user experienc and content design workshop to design the look feel and initial content of the am Purple website and employed young people as core staff to support content creation and moderate social media Young people engage in different ways depending on their age evidence suggests it is important to ffer range of ageappropriate opportunities In India Must Bol used creative digital media platforms for young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it Must Bol ound that different online activities attracted different age groups photo contests attracted young er people whereas blogathon attracted an older group Liou Evidence suggests that usical and artistic approaches are effective ways of engaging young people as are celebrities and other influencers In Brazil Entre Ns soap opera was accompanied by set of comic books and soundtrack In Viet Nam celebrities participated in digital campaign Love Journey by being models in ample photo essay creating campaign music video and writing songs on healthy relationships that they performed at musical concert In Ethiopia Girl Effect created the Yegna girl pop group to accompany ra dio drama and talk show that championed the potential of girls In Nigeria popular musicians created music video supported the campaign through live appearances and promoted Purple through their social media channels Challenges to engaging young people around digital platforms to prevent VAWG include literacy cultural norms only reaching certain young people who have access to digital technology as well as risks to privacy and safety see following section Avis For example VC Purple mobile platform had consistently lower numbers of young women engaging on the site closely reflecting the national statistics of malefemale online users Additional investment went into women targeted advertising nd content that spoke directly to young women As result overall user numbers dropped but resulted in almost equal number of male and female users Whilst being equally popular and relevant amongst the wealth groups the purple radio show was most successful in reaching the lower wealth quintiles Denny and Hughes Safeguarding Risks with digital mobileonline spaces need to be carefully planned for monitored and mitigated against Risks associated with the use of digital platforms include trolling grooming and abusive content as well as risks to digital privacy all of which need to be carefully managed and mitigated For example the VC Purple website and social media platforms were closely monitored for signs of backlash and abuse and in response to abusive content posted on the Facebook page number of users were banned from the platform Importance of moderators and rules to ensure digital space are safe for young people For example the closed Facebook group Female in Nigeria Fin with over million members gets hundreds of applications for posts every day but they are managed and approved by group of volunteers About make it on the page It also has strict rules including not judging each other removing negative comments and no religious themed advice Fin is not place of worship For more information see wedomobile platformsspringster Ensure digital platforms provide way for young people who have experienced violence to access support For example in Nigeria the VC Purple website featured dedicated page with links to organisations and services for survivors of VAWG In South Africa Soul City partnered with national toll free helpline staffed by counsellors Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation of traditional and digital media approaches to reduce VAWG remains key evidence gap where investment is needed to avoid the risk of programmes being unable to demonstrate impact Of the examples reviewed for this query only nine had evidence of impact on attitudes and two on violence perpetration or victimisation DFIDs review of the VAWG portfolio cautioned of the risks for innovative DFID media programmes which are not able to demonstrate impact eg attracting ne gative public attention and being shut early Evaluations of traditional and new media programmes often generate complex results which can take time to interpret Both Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales in Nicaragua and VC in Nigeria found mixed changes in attitudes behaviours and norms relating to VAWG which var ied by geographic and programming areas In Nigeria there was strong evidence that VC has brought about significant change amongst individuals who engaged in phy sical and virtual Safe Spaces targeted trainings and mass media communications Evidence suggests the most effective programming builds in opportunities for learning and adapting in response to audience feedback and wider changes in the political and socio economic context In Nepal the DFID funded Change Starts at Home programme hich aims to reduce intimate partner violence between married couples uses Listening and Discussion Groups to ensure that the radio drama content is relevant and applicable as well as to explore issues in greater depth Listener reactions and feedback ar shared with the radio production team to guide the content of future episodes and adapt messaging accordingly Clark et al Digital platforms can provide transparent and accessible mechanisms to generate real time beneficiary feedback at scale lose feedback loops and provide pulse check for offline activities For example the Indian soap opera Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon MKBKSH Woman Can Achieve Anything present pioneered the use of an Interactive Voice Response System IVRS which provided discussion forum for viewers and way to share feedback The IVRS platform had million calls from more than unique headphone numbers across out of Indias states Independent analysis of the IVRS data noted that IVRS as reached media dark areas through Mobile Vaani networks and Community Radio Stations giving voice to less privileged audience members No media initiative anywhere in the world has received such high level of audience participation in real time such scale Wang and Singhal Costs and alue for Money High upfront costs are often incurred by programmes using digital platforms and communications approaches to allow for design testing and adaptation according to review of DFIDs VAWG portfolio It also noted that the timeframe needed to achieve social norm change and the front loading of inputs can skew Value for Money assessments in the early stages of programming VAWG Helpdesk So while costs may come down over time it should also be noted that costs may increase in subsequent years if additional investments are needed to male and female groups per study site meet weekly for weeks develop the intervention based on programmatic learnings as was the cas with VC in Nigeria More costing information is forthcoming in from DFIDs What Works to Prevent VAWG research programme Digital platforms can be resource intensive during implementation For example in India the Must Bol digital campaign for young people noted that they needed more staffing During the last quarter of the campaign when both on and offline work was the strongest there were only three fulltime people working on the campaign larger group would have been much better Liou In Cambodia key lesson rom DFID and Asia Foundation support to three mobile apps which aim to end violence against women is that apps often have hidden costs requiring investments to maintain complex backend systems and websites It is therefore important to fully understand from the outset the process and the time cost requirements involved as well as whether any other imilar digital platforms exist which could be adapted Costing studies of soap opera approaches have calculated low unit costs due to the large number of people reached For example South Africas Soul City soap opera cost US per person reached by television US per person reached by print media and US per person reached by radio in These low costs were largely due to the massive reach of the programme Soul City the series on violence against women reached of the population in South Africa However data on unit costs should be used with caution as other approaches may have more evidence of effectiveness Evidence reviews have concluded that although edutai nment approaches may have lower unit costs per beneficiary they are not necessarily more cost effective than more intensive activities such as community mobilisation eg ASA in Uganda Fulu et al Sustainability and scale up Schools and educational institutions provide entry points to scale up programming for young people as well as offline discussions For example in Brazil Promundo began collaborating with the Education Secretariats and schools in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Bah ia to adapt and integrate Entre Ns Between Us radio soap opera into the public education sector Similarly in China the Man campaign united more than students across top universities campuses in Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Hunan in both digital and virtual activities In Viet Nam the Department of Education supported Love Journey activities in schools There are several examples of promising practice in partnering with private sector organisations to leverage distribution networks nd expertise in social marketing branding and communications For example in Ethiopia Girl Effect partnered with the leading water company Ambo Mineral Water to further publicise the Yegna brand Ambo Water printed the Yegna logo and programme schedule of the Yegna radio show on the stickers of five million bottles as well as on Ambo trucks Distribution of the bottles was mainly targeted at girls in For example VCs unit costs of social media reach was per person reached by social media decreasing to but then However other parts of the programme came down consistently for example the physical safe space costs Armitage and Hughes Must Boi encouraged young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it The campaign specifically targeted mainly urban middle class youth aged and consciously aimed to work more with young men The three apps are Krousar Koumrou animated features and sharable quiz which aims to change negative attitudes and be an educational tool to increase knowledge to end domestic violence Safe Agent personal network notification app for users to be able to discreetly and quickly contact up to trusted family and friends if they feel unsafe and Plus to help food and service sector workers feel confident and able to claim their rights to be free from harassment and violence in th workplace rural areas of Amhara region where the Ye gna marketing director noted that Ambo reaches everywhere in the country and this creates an opportunity for us to connect to the inner society that we could not reach only through receiving set and television Partnering with Ambo means that we can leverage the ir extensive distribution network to increase awareness of Yegna and drive more listeners to the show In Brazil Promundo partnered with SSL International to design new brand of Durex condom that spoke for and to young people Promundos peer educat ors young men recruited from the community developed the Hora condom which translates as in the heat of the moment after young men reported hearing their peers saying Everyone knows you shouldnt hit your girlfriend but in the heat of the momen you lose control Ruxton Evidence suggests that programmes that partner with local organisations and build capacity are the most sustainable For example in Nepal the VOICES project combined an innovative Samajhdari Mutual Understanding radio programme with comprehensive community outreach initiative that provided legal literacy training formed listener and dialogue groups and trained women leaders as community reporters and community leaders Local radio stations and organisations also benefitted from enhanced professionalism on talking about violence against women An impact assessment of the programme noted that the sustainability of radiodigital technology is improved by offline activities such as outreach and training in communiti es Although the program has now ended these organisations and media reporters will continue to play crucial role in reporting and preventing violence Equal Access

SDGQuality Education developing countries have integrated digital literacy into general education making it an active part of the digital economy for the majority of their people Urbancikova Manakova Ganna There are two common terms Digital divide and digital inclusion which relate to connectivity and internet utilization that have gained popularity Nemer The real origin of the term Digital divide is not known but it was advanced and began to be widely used in the mids to describe the disparity between households that have access to the Internet and households that do not have access to the Internet Light Pigato However this divide continues to persist today in the wake of COVID Aissaoui Catalysts for bridging the digital divide on what former US Vice President Gore called the information superhighway was the notion of ICTs as global education and economic equalizer Cerf Computers were introduced in college classrooms around the world and are making their way into primary and secondary schools in wealthy cities including developing countries Tatnall Tatnall Davey Access to the Internet is seen as way to change education in profound ways Another term digital inclusion later took centre stage among media and researchers This term described the differences that existed between hardware and broadband access in particular this was about access to ICT knowledge in the home the school and the workplace These disparities in digital access that remained among poor undereducated and racialethnic minorities and may affect the quality of life although Ali Alam Taylor Rafiq observe studies have shown mixed results Helsper Livingstone Helsper The solution to inclusion is often described as community building therefore grassroots organizations and community centers began offering access to ICTs through their facilities Digital inclusion presupposes that people who are not connected to ICTs want to join the digital society and need assistance in understanding the importance of the technology Rather than try to find who was not connected the notion put forward in digital inclusion was to work toward bringing underserved populationspeople in underdeveloped and developing nations poor undereducated people and racialethnic minorities in the United Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse States and minority populations around the worldinto the already existing digital society The word inclusion is perceived as being more forwardthinking than the term divide when it comes to describing the state of digital affairs Despite the shift in terminology and focus several scholars and organizations around the world remain committed to the concept of the digital divide In doing so they have discovered more nuanced approaches to understanding the digital divide The second wave of digital divide interrogates access as both physical and intellectual and usage as place and purpose was introduced by Hargittai by investigating user differences in ICT skills According to Bean and Kern digital literacy is seen in the light of praxeology as school teachers carry out educational practices aimed at reducing risk behaviors facilitated by digital media and most frequently associated with student cyberbullying Pyalski The digital environment has been blamed for underutilised opportunities for learning creativity and social connectivity Lomax Murray Pyer According to the House of Lords as cited in Lomax Murray and Pyer no child should leave school without wellrounded understanding of the digital world Digital literacy concepts have slight differences in reach or focus areas and their meanings often overlap Zhang Zhu Digital literacy is described as intelligence assembly by Paul Gilster as cited in Pool and includes how to assimilate the information analyze it and reintegrate it Digital literacy refers to the ability of individuals to use skills knowledge and understanding to make full use of the opportunities offered by the new media world as well as safeguard themselves from associated risks Martin as cited in Buckingham Digital literac is the aZareness attitude and abilit of individuals to appropriately use digital tools and facilities to identify access manage integrate evaluate analyse and synthesize digital resources construct new knowledge create media expressions and communicate with others in the context of specific life situations to enable constructive social action and to reflect upon this process Martin as cited in Buckingham International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences Digital literacy can be seen as an umbrella concept that includes elements of other literature that share conceptual grounds with other forms of literacy such as knowledge literacy that is capable of identifying finding assessing and using information UNESCO Cummins Becker Alexander media literacy that is the ability to access recognize and critically evaluate media messages

to Joyce Pham Stanton Fraser Payne Crellin McDougall the history of digital literacy and online education projects has been patchy for example in the UK despite recent calls for clear curriculum for digital media education since media education aims to teach students how to become critical media users through media analysis and media production Childrens Commissioner Hobbs as cited in Polizzi Previous research according to Marsh Hannon Lewis Ritchie and Plowman et al showed the early establishment of digital literacy in young children and learning through home technology Citing Grzig and Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse lafsson Livingstone Davidson Bryce Batool Haughton and Nandi observed that girls tended to report slightly fewer digital skills than boys and younger children reported considerably fewer skills than older teenagers Moreover skills of children with disabilities who are discriminated against or who are from disadvantaged backgrounds vary some have fewer skills commensurate with their fewer resources or available supports but others have developed skills partly through facing negative experiences online Livingstone et al Childrens digital literacy changed qualitatively with age for example at around to years children were concerned with what was real or not although they would not discriminate real from fake At to years children were more concerned with what was fun or even transgressive irrespective of whether it was trustworthy Lastly by to years their increasing maturity led teenagers to refocus on what was more valuable for them or more generally Livingstone Livingstone Kirwil Ponte Staksrud The shift in focus would be brought about by change in peer and parental relations with the children and had implications for the incidence of online risks encountered by children Ofcom Childrens digital literacy was found to increase fairly steadily from age to young adulthood Also with increasing age children gained digital literacy to realise that some but not all search engine results could be trusted Ofcom study comparing EU Kids Online and Net Children Go Mobile also showed little change in the levels of childrens digital literacy and safety skills since although children are now better able to manage their privacy settings and to delete their browsing history On the other hand the same comparison showed that the proportion of children whose profiles were public had nearly doubled from to of social network users aged between to which may reflect the diversification in social networks used Livingstone et al Schools are an important partner in ensuring child protection online Shipton Esafety guidance from schools is particularly helpful for children from underresourced households where parents lack confidence or expertise concerning digital media Livingstone Mascheroni Dreier Chaudron Lagae Whittle HamiltonGiachritsis and Beech found that support from schools along with support from parents and friends also assisted with the recovery of victims of online grooming and sexual abuse International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences According to Ofcom esafety strategies and initiatives schools would use in protecting children online include annual talks some with members of the police andor NSPCC representatives information videos and associated lesson plans We saw video on CBBC about girl and Direction and she gave out her details and didnt realize Girl years old Nottingham esafety pupil representatives am an eSafety rep at school and we help to tell others how to be safe online Girl years old Nottingham takehome contracts to share with parents to agree to terms of safe internet use and Safer Internet Day held once year and other campaigns In studying two primary schools Shipton found that the schools preferred developing the critical capabilities of the students rather than employing blanket filters This was done to ensure that children can manage risks both at school and elsewhere Aston and Brzyska further strengthen the argument for developing critical capacities among children by observing that majority of teachers felt that their pupils had the skills and knowledge to use the internet safely in school yet only felt that the children were similarly equipped to use it safely at home Other scholars Byrne et al revealed that high percentages of children had basic digital literacy skills but only about on average used the internet for creative activities creating blogs videos and websites Studies show that the more digitally literate children become the more they can gain from the internet while avoiding or coping with online risks Sonck Livingstone Kuiper de Haan According to Rouchun Zongkui Shuailei Qingqi and Chen citing Bronfenbrenner the family atmosphere is the most critical microsystem that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socioeconomic status as distal environment Access to familiarity with and skill using mobile devices are first step in achieving digital literacy study showed that most children started using mobile devices in their first year of life and use was enabled by parents who gave children device to use and to keep Three out of four parents gave children mobile device when doing chores and to keep them calm Kabali Irigoyen NunezDavis Budacki Mohanty Leister Bonner Digital literacy or eskills is crucial to childrens use of the internet Internet literacy is capability constitutive to utilizing the advantages of the Internet and as Knobel and Lankshear assert has close relationship with participation in cyberculture Byrne et al observe that the Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse creation of online content by children is means of selfexpression as well as an important vehicle for participation in matters that affect them participation being one of the underlying principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child broad concept of Internet literacy refers to the information skills and behaviors used in wide range of digital devices such as smartphones laptops PCs etc Taylor Dalal citing Julian Cybersafety risks for children when using video sharing platforms websites social networking sites and games include but are not limited to Exposure to pornography Violent content Contact and conduct risks Cyberbullying and associated low selfesteem and emotional responses Contact with unknown and online predation Content and practices that are not age appropriate through viewing media used by older siblings Identity theft and Malware Robinson citing Green et al The childrens limited digital literacy skills increase the potential for harm to them One report noted children of primary school age are particularly challenged in their cognitive and emotional abilities to cope with online risk It follows then that these risks increase where adult supervision is inadequate Baldry Sorrentino Farrington study by Tomczyk in the field of digital security in the school and family environment in Poland revealed that digital literacy was necessary especially in group of people who are responsible for facilitating digital safety good example is parents who are in contact with children all the time and most time give digital devices to children under their care with good reasons or to keep them off so that they can concentrate on their work Parents have to ensure an appropriate degree of digital protection at home since previous study revealed positive relation between socioeconomic status and digital literacy Tran et al However study by Moawad and Ebrahem reported negative correlation between adolescents technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology the more their social interaction with their parents was affected On the other hand teachers help their students improve their digital literacy Savage Because of the nature of their work teachers also have responsibility to create approaches that promote effective media exposure and socialisation This is only feasible if teachers have sufficient and uptodate information about the risks emerging from digital media prevalence Teachers International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences particularly teaching in primary school bear particular responsibility for ensuring digital safety CortinaPrez GallardoVigil JimnezJimnez TrujilloTorres At the educational point teachers can influence the behaviors of students that would allow them to protect themselves from traditional and nonstandard ethreats such as problem Internet usage cyberbullying image security recognition of false information sexting copyright infringements hygiene of digital media navigation sensitivity to Internet challenges Digital literacy is undergoing constant changes as the information system is undergoing simultaneous transformations Digital literacy requires not just the technological capacity to use digital media but also the mechanisms linked to risky behavior awareness study in the UK showed that one would be termed as internet literate when they can find information confidently they can send an instant message fix problem on their computer or set up an email account or even download music Internet literate children may also be able to filter or remove virus from their computer among other activities Boys were found to be more skilled than girls For example when girl was able to send an instant message boy would be able to download music The study also revealed that internet skills increased with age Livingstone Bober Helsper Kenya with population of over million people as of is generally regarded as one of Africas most technologically advanced nations According to estimates about percent of the population is covered by third generation technology in but only of individuals and percent of households have internet access In addition Kenyas telecommunications revenues increased from USD billion in to USD billion in Okyere citing ITU Materials and Methods The study was carried out in Nairobi City County specifically Langata Subcounty Langata Subcounty is one of the nine subcounties in Nairobi City County which is one of the counties in the Republic of Kenya The SubCounty lies in the South West of Nairobi bordering Kajiado County to the North This subcounty has four divisions and eight wards namely Karen Hardy Lenana Nairobi West Olympic Mugumuini Bomas and South County This study site was selected because of its accessibility to Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse cyber cafes and highspeed Internet and the availability of many schools that had very well equipped computer labs and ICT Innovation Centres and good internet connection It was also preferred because it housed the various levels of population in terms of socioeconomic status comprising of the high class the middle class and the low class which is not characteristic of the other subcounties within Nairobi City County This subcounty also had several Information technology innovation centres The researchers utilized descriptive crosssectional design within concurrent mixed approach collecting and analysing both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time McCusker Gunaydin The study targeted children between ages years and years old from selected private and public primary schools in Langata Subcounty teachers parents and policy makers within the Department of children services and Directorate of Criminal Investigation Goddens formula informed the sample size determination of respondents plus of the sample size to cater for nonresponse by respondents making total of respondents Key Informant interviews were also carried out targeting parents Key informant teacher respondents Key informant Child protection officer respondents all sampled purposively The researchers utilised simple random stratified purposive sampling stratified sampling convenience and purposive sampling designs Three schools were selected from three regions within Langata Subcounty which included Karen South and Mugumuini wards The study sought both empirical data and secondary data from published sources like general and specific search engines Interviews and focused group discussions were carried FGDs which enabled the collection of data using interview guides questionnaires and FGD guides tools Quantitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of SPSS version Bivariate and multivariate statistics were applied to examine relationships between the independent and dependent variables Data were transformed to enable further inferential statistics to relate variables and help test hypotheses Findings were presented using graphs frequencies charts and tables Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis with the help of Nvivo version and presented in narrative and map forms Informed written consent was sought in writing and verbally from all respondents including teachers parents children and protection officers following the right International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences procedure who were prepared in advance on the nature of questioning including the degree of sensitivity of the subject Parents and guardians were approached to give consent on behalf of their children All participants were allowed to take part in the study However they were informed that if they wished to withdraw from the study at some point then they were allowed Ultimate confidentiality was observed in regards to the individuals sampled for purposes of data collection especially regarding the case studies No information provided by the children teachers parents child protection officers and government officials was shared with any other person for any purpose other than supervisors and where was required so to prepare this research report Lastly the researcher disseminated research findings as planned Results and Discussion This section presents characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents Besides the researchers present the type of schools respondents attended the risky actions by respondents when they go online and the categories of cyberbullying and abuse experienced while online Finally presented was digital literacy that was measured using twentyfive items among the respondents Table Distribution by response rate Frequency Percentage Complete questionnaires Not Completed questionnaires Total Source Field data The researchers purposively selected primary schools two private schools and two public schools per ward in the selected three wards out of the eight that existed from within Langata Subcounty in Nairobi The total sample was pupils out of which successfully filled and returned questionnaires The researchers invited children respondents aged years to years enrolled in primary public and private schools in Langata SubCounty in Nairobi City County in Kenya to participate in the study Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse Questionnaires were administered to the children and out of the questionnaires of the children either refused to or did not return their questionnaires good number filled the questionnaires successfully and returned The questionnaires that were filled successfully were sufficient for analysis for response rate That shows that automatically the study sample remained respondents Demographic Profile of Respondents This section presents the characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents The characteristics of the children were age gender class type of school residence and level of education of parents Of the respondents were girls while were boys The findings revealed that the highest number of those who successfully filled and returned questionnaires were class six pupils forming as shown in table The study found that were years old followed by were years old as the least number This may be attributed to the fact that most pupils after age may have transited to secondary school The highest number of respondents resided in the Mugumuini area followed by the Karen area and only resided in South because the response rate was low in South ward The study showed that pupils in public schools accessed the internet while in private schools accessed the internet This revealed that higher number of children in private schools access the internet compared to those in public schools This was because in private schools children used the internet even for their homework assignments very small but equal number of respondents did not access the internet Children from private schools were from higher social economic status and therefore their parents afford internet and internet access gadgets According to Rouchun Zongkui Shuailei Qingqi and Chen citing Bronfenbrenner the family atmosphere is the most critical microsystem that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socioeconomic status as distal environment Earlier survey results showed that families with elevated socioeconomic status had more Internet access devices and more Internet access resources for

specifically pornographic videos The online action considered less risky was gaming at This means that the children had experienced abuse through some videos They reported having watched music video clips they considered offensive Almost half the respondents had experienced bullying that involved strangers sharing pictures and videos with them Some children reported having experienced abuse through text messages through phones Whatsapp and email recorded the lowest considering it not easily used for cyberbullying Only had experienced abuse through the email International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences Most of the children did not either know how to use mails or use mails often the reason for low percentage Few had experienced abuse through WhatsApp since it was smartphone application and few of them had their phones Those who had experienced abuse through WhatsApp agreed to have shared with siblings or those who owned phones Others cited Facebook as site where they experienced abuse Table Categories of Cyberbullying experienced Frequency Percent Text message Email Phone call Picture or video clip WhatsApp Total Source Field data child protection officer disclosed children were at risk on the internet The children were at risks of exposure online for example When children access the internet the pla games like Blue Whales Zhich ma be disastrous good eample is Zhen children end up committing suicide When children accept friend requests on social media and other platforms that exist it is risky because some are abducted mostly because they are interacting with people who enjoy anonymity It is scary that some pose as children and children easily trust and start engaging them These online strangers ask children for information and family details Zhich makes the children more vulnerable to trafficking Respondent th March Digital literacy was measured using twentyfive items among the respondents and the results revealed the following Findings on whether they frequently used the internet for schoolwork strongly disagreed while disagreed showing that more than half did not frequently use Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse the internet at school Respondents reported they played internet games on their own with agreeing and strongly agreeing About did not watch video clips on the

strongly agreed Table Distribution by digital literacy Source Field data The children were able to use instant messaging for agreed while strongly agreed Response on whether the children visited social networking sites More than half of the respondents International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences strongly disagreed and disagreed that they sentreceived emails The study revealed that of those who participated in children did not play games online much with less than half strongly disagreeing and disagreeing On whether they played games with other people online strongly disagree and disagree On the use of webcam strongly disagreed and disagreed They did not agree to frequently visit chatroom strongly disagreed and disagreed Less than half of the respondents did not put or post photos videos or music to share with others strongly disagreed while disagreed More than half of respondents did not put or post messages on website whereby strongly disagreed and disagreed always create characters pets or avatars SD and Slightly less than half the respondents did not often use file sharing sites as strongly disagreed while disagreed Half of the respondents disagreed with spending time in virtual world as strongly disagreed and disagreed Children did not have the skill of writing blogs or online diaries and also bookmarking website as strongly disagreed and disagreed and strongly disagree and disagree respectively Children were not able to block messages from someone they did not want to hear from strongly disagreed and disagreed Quite good number were undecided for they were neutral They also reported they were neither able to change privacy settings on social networking profile strongly disagreed while disagreed nor delete the record of which sites they had visited strongly disagreed and disagreed The findings showed that respondents could not block unwanted adverts or junk mailspam strongly disagreed and disagreed Children disagreed with being able to change filter preferences strongly disagreed and disagreed Again they were not able to find information on how to use the internet safely strongly disagreed and disagreed Finally respondents were unable to compare different websites to decide if the information was true strongly disagreed and disagreed Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse The findings revealed that children were limited in skills concerning digital literacy and were therefore highly internet illiterate and this would either expose them to online abuse or even would shield them from predators since they were not so much exposed to internet risk In comparison to what was indicated by prior literature kids like teenagers are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills Rodrguez de Dios Sonck de Haan Sonck Livingstone Kuiper de Haan Besides research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital capabilities will gain more from online opportunities Lee Chae Livingstone Helsper Nikken Schols Sonck de Haan Certain empirical studies on the contrary have shown that the more qualified teenagers

can be defined as internetspecific problemsolving strategies children adopt after negative experience online Vandoninck et al study by the EU Kids Online identified three main coping strategies passive responses that include fatalistic stop use the internet for while and selfaccusatory responses feeling guilty about what happened proactive responses such as reporting inappropriate content and contact blocking the unwanted contact etc and communicative responses talking with parents peers teachers or other trusted adults about what happened Livingstone Haddon Grzig lafsson Learning how to cope with negative experiences effectively is one of the most effective responses for any particular situation which is part of the process of building resilience among internet users Vandoninck et al Responding to online risks by seeking support from social networks is the most common coping strategy adopted by children although in most cases they tend to combine two strategies Livingstone et al Pearson Correlation Correlations estimate the strength of the linear relationship between two and only two variables Correlation coefficients range from perfect negative correlation to positive perfect positive correlation The closer International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences correlation coefficients get to or the stronger the correlation The closer correlation coefficient gets to zero the weaker the correlation is between the two variables Ordinal or ratio information or combination must be used After testing the hypothesis stated below the researcher obtained the following results as interpreted them as shown There is no relationship between exposure to the internet and digital literacy The correlation coefficient for exposure to the internet and digital online literacy was The number of respondents in the sample answering both items is and respectively The pvalue for this correlation coefficient was There is weak positive relationship between exposure to the internet and children internet digital literacy Table Distribution by Correlation between exposure to the internet and digital literacy Mexposure Mdigitallit Mexposu re Pearson Correlation Sig tailed Mdigitall it Pearson Correlation Sig tailed Source Field data Since alpha we fail to reject the null of no relationship and conclude that the relationship is not statistically significant The researcher used twotailed because the direction was not known earlier As shown in the table pvalue of indicates that the correlation is not significant and the two variables exposure and digital literacy are not linearly related This implied that even if the children are exposed to the internet that alone does not improve much of their digital or internet literacy hence there is need for them to be guided and assisted to navigate while using the internet for their security It can further be interpreted that children exposed to the Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse internet would fall prey to predators and abusers whose tricks are dynamic and they are always ahead of the children This is in agreement with Krueger who discovered Internet skills the ability to access the web was the most significant indicator of online participation and deal with emails People who are more familiar with the Internet and have good social skills and communication skills would benefit more from internet use consistent with the RichGetRicherTheory Kraut et al Table Distribution childrens knoZledge about the Internet in comparison to Parents Frequency Percent Not true bit true Very true Other Total Source Field data Comparing their knowledge with their parents about the use of the internet regarding the statement that know more about the internet than my parents more than half of the children revealed it was not true that they were more knowledgeable than their parents Other respondents said it was bit true agreed it was true their parents were more knowledgeable than them on matters internet and gave other reasons This concurs with study by Livingstone et al on how parents of young children manage digital devices at home Children dont believe that they have more internet abilities than their parents Livingstone et al This meant children had confidence in their parents guiding them on how to use the internet and keep safe However this is contrary to study by Moawad and Ebrahem that reported negative correlation between adolescents technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology the more their social interaction with their parents was affected This raises the question of interaction and guidance provided by parents as indicated in this study although this study sample included younger children who may be more trusting to their parents compared to adolescents who listen to their peers more International and Multidisciplinary Journal of

parents about the use of the internet regarding the statement that know more about the internet than my parents almost half of the respondents accepted that they knew about the internet than their teachers Respondents thought that they knew lot of things about the internet meaning they were confident in their teachers guiding and protecting them while using the internet further respondents felt that it was not true that they know more about the internet while small percentage thought it was not true they knew lot about the internet The reason being that they were either not accessing the internet they were not digitally literate or they were not confident enough Conclusion Access to cyberspace is no longer luxury but an everyday activity for many teachers and learners in the school environment at home and other environments like cyber This study found there was early access early exposure and early adoption of mobile media devices among young children in an urban lowincome moderate and highincome community Online child abuse is today recognised as global phenomenon since the internet has been found to have powerful impact on the lives of children throughout the world This would continue to grow and evolve While Internet access and child usage were highest in industrialized countries the global pace of web access and broadband penetration and the exponential uptake of mobile phone technologies coupled with increasing capacities and decreasing costs means that the rest of the world is beginning to catch up in the next few years Muhingi Mavole Nzau Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse it is anticipated that the most dramatic changes will occur in low and middleincome countries Based on the findings of this study the researchers concluded that the responsibility of online child protection was for every stakeholder including the state parents teachers citizens netizens and children themselves It was also concluded that training and the creation of awareness were important elements to consider in protecting children online The study revealed low skills among parents and teachers on internet matters yet children looked up to them and believed they would guide them in remaining safe online Children were found to be digitally literate Digital literacy helped children to remain safe as well as exposing them to internetrelated risks as was revealed by other studies Only small proportion of contemporary adults had access to ICT when they were children particularly the tools that have facilitated the revolution in interaction and communication This has probably affected the ability of adults to understand and empathize with the ways children and young people use the Internet mobile phones and other new technologies This may be especially dead on target in societies where childrens social activity particularly that of adolescents has been under fairly direct parental observation or control Recommendations The government needs to develop strategies through the Ministry of Education to create institutional capacity to respond to online child abuse to educate minors in the responsible use of ICT Moreover programs for the prevention of cyberbullying should also integrate issues related to education about sexting and sexual solicitation among other harmful online child abuse issues Holistic intervention concerning the different risks found on the Internet is also necessary following the fast and dynamic nature of the growth accessibility and availability of the internet which people are exposed to as early as months Moreover sexual education programs in schools should address sexting as it seems to be new avenue through which adolescents express their sexuality Besides educators particularly teachers and parents should be informed about Internet risks and how to protect their children to educate their children on the responsible use of ICT with emphasis on digital skills International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences The onus is on governments and the private sector to ensure that protection is integrated into promoting the expansion of access and the positive benefits the Internet brings Cyber security awareness and training ought to be top priority for all African states This should be crosscutting from the vulnerable sector or people in the society schoolgoing children families industry captains critical national infrastructure handlers government officials and the entire African continent with its unique needs The government of Kenya through the Communications Authority to first track Establishing database on reported cybercrime cases affecting children Commissioning of national research on Online Child Sexual Exploitation which once completed would provide more reliable and full picture of OCSE in Kenya Developing training curriculum that could be used to train stakeholders on online safety of children and related risks and Developing National Child Online Framework Strategy The government needs to put in place the policy legal and regulatory framework which is also important That would require the involvement and support of the political leadership and goodwill at the very highest level The lawmakers must be well trained and sensitised to help implement legislation that addresses cyber threats at all levels There is need to address online child abuse at the continental level African countries need strong Information and Computer Technology institutions This may be utilised to train cyber security experts

['The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on ountriesC eveloping ducation in Zuheir Khlaif and Soheil Salha Faculty of Educational Sciences and Teachers Training An Najah National University Nablus Palestine Shahid Fareed Department of Computer Science Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan Pakistan Hadi Rashed Business Communication Department Kabul University Kabul Afghanistan Abstract The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in the developing countries of Palestine Libya and Afghanistan as reported by middleschool students their parents and teachers These countries have been struggling with an unstable and violent situation for decades Semistructured interviews were conducted with participants from the three countries and online classes were observed Findings revealed that COVID widened the digital gap among students and families which created challenges in terms of online class attendance In addition violation of students and parents digital privacy emerged as another key challenge to emergency remote teaching However teacher presence and timely feedback in synchronous online sessions strengthened students engagement within the emergency remote teaching environment Overall emergency remote teaching during the COVID crisis deepened inequities across students and infringed upon the digital ethics of students teachers and parents Keywords COVID Coronavirus digital inequity digital privacy Khlaif ZN Salha Fareed Rashed The hidden shadow of the coronavirus on education in developing countries Online Learning The motivation for the current study was the findings of Khalif and Salhas brief report regarding the unanticipated challenges of education during the COVID pandemic For this paper the researchers used the same data from the same participants but developed different research questions on digital privacy gender inequity and the specific impact of he digital divide The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Emergency Remote Teaching ERT is an unplanned and sudden shift from traditional in person education to remote teaching using technology to deliver teaching and learning materials and activities due to natural disasters economic crises violence and andemics In the past individual countries have used technology to teach online for limited time in response to crises and school shutdowns Czerniewicz et al Holzweiss et al Khlaif Salha Shraim Khlaif Traxler et al This year ERT was implemented in countries across the world to contend the outbreak of Coronavirus Johnson et al Khlaif et al ERT is unlike normal online learning while typical online courses take months to design develop and deliver to students ERT materials or lectures were originally designed for facetoface delivery and their quality in the remote context can be low Khlaif Salha In developing countries in particular students may also struggle with the digital equity and accessibility of educational resources delivered in the context of crisis Czerniewicz et al Jones Bridges Khlaif et al In this study we investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in the developing countries of Palestine Libya and Afghanistan as reported by middleschool students their parents and teachers In the introductory sections below we first describe our conceptual framework which is centered in digital inequity and digital privacy Next we describe the context of the three countries under study and lay out our key research questions Conceptual Framework The dimensions and determinants of the impact of COVID on educational systems within developing countries are wide and varied In the context of digital learning however two issues may represent key challenges to students and their families in developing ountries digital inequity and digital privacy Below we review these two issues in more detail with particular reference to the three developing countries under study Digital Inequity Digital equity is conceptualized in the framework of resource distribution technical knowledge and skills and the impact of Information and Communication Technology ICT use Yuen et al Willems et al defined digital equity as access to hardware and software and connectivity to the internet to create share and exchange highquality content in suitable language Resta et al suggested that there are five dimensions of digital equity hardware software and connectivity to the internet highquality digital content in local languages creation and sharing of digital content educators who know technology and highquality research and application In recent years with the increasing use of ICT in education digital inequity has begun to receive more attention from researchers Kurea Yuen et al With the shift to remote learning during the COVID crisis digital inequity has become an even more critical topic Hall et al Khlaif et al For example recent US study reported that school closures due to the spread of COVID prevented children with disabilities from continuing their learning These children were from the poorest families who did not have access to technology Collis Lope felix de vega carpio In developing counties the digital divide may be even more stark Shraim and Khlaif highlighted that key challenge of implementing elearning in the Palestinian educational The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March system was students differential access to devices and highspeed internet significant aspect of the digital divide in developing countries is the difference between men and womens access to and use of technology Mariscal et al Singh For example Elaiess found gender divide in Libya with women and girls having less access to technology such as the internet compared with men because of cultural and social issues Internet cafes for only men are not accepted The digital gap in gender is more evident for countries in the global south such as the three countries under study than for countries in the global north such as the US Digital Privacy Digital privacy refers to the protection of an individual information and communication that is used or created while using the internet on computer or personal device Robertson et al It is worth noting that the protection of digital privacy requires the knowledge the technical practices of online security institutional privacy procedures and the skill to conduct several processes for protecting online data Li Digital privacy is often understood as an individual right that must be respected and secured even when people have different objectives and desires Ahmed Booth With advancements in technology individuals can communicate and leverage data more easily but are also at increased risk of hackers violating their privacy and data confidentiality Lustgarten et al Despite the importance of digital privacy students are often unaware of its meaning or value For example Lorenz et al conducted survey of sixtyone participants from Estonia which examined the relationship between students awareness of privacy and their level of participation in the online learning environment The findings of the study revealed that students in the online learning environment did not distinguish between educational social interaction and their privacy The researchers considered student lack of awareness to be threat to the student privacy Lorenz et al Similarly Siemens et al conducted research on Canadian students in masters degree program to explore their perceptions of privacy and its impact on their engagement within an elearning environment The findings of the study revealed that students are not aware of their privacy in the online forums Students may be unaware of digital privacy issues because they have not been formally taught about them Kumar et al conducted nine focus group sessions with teachers in elementary school settings across three regions in the north of the to ascertain the meaning of digital privacy and security The findings of their study revealed that teachers rarely teach their students about digital privacy and security while using technology However teachers and parents themselves may have little understanding about digital privacy Citizens concerns and behaviors in terms of digital privacy may also be influenced by political and cultural factors For example Fahey and Hino point out that during the COVID pandemic some countries such as France South Korea Iran and Qatar have taken data first approach to contact tracing and other public health measures while other countries such as Germany Italy Japan and the US have taken privacy first approach Studies of digital privacy have not focused on developing countries However unique set of political and cultural factors impact education in developing countries For example in Afghanistan the education system has long struggled with issues revolving around culture lack of security and distance these challenges continue today Arooje Burridge Rasmussen Kelly Many of these challenges are further affected by transparency and quality The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March assurance Thus levels of awareness and concern about digital privacy in education could be quite different from those found in prior studies Context of the Three Countries Under Study The three developing counties under study are Palestine Libya and Afghanistan All three countries have been struggling with unstable situations and continuous violence for decades and thus have implemented ERT many times before the COVID pandemic Although the three countries are quite distinct all three share similar security situation have experience in education under crisis used online learning before the COVID pandemic transformed education into ERT during the COVID pandemic and have the technological initiatives to integrate technology into teaching and learning Below we provide context regarding the educational system of each country Libya Education policy in Libya is managed from the top down and is influenced by the overall political system of the country The education system has changed frequently since the Arab Spring in Aloreibi Carey The World Bank reported significant success in enhancing the literacy rate in Libya by increasing the budget for education and making it free and accessible for all Libyans and implementing new programs to improve education Conversely Gadour argued that the Libyan educational system is still not capable of producing graduates with the necessary skills to compete in world where knowledge and technology are essential for development in different aspects of the society Hbaci et al found that Libyan educators believe that using technology is still difficult task and that schools need computers internet access training and financial support to improve the teachers technological competencies in teaching and learning Libyan students may also be underrepresented in terms of their participation in global learning platforms recent study of Arab users of the MITx online learning platform found that only per million Libyans used the platform compared to per million in the United Arab Emirates and per million in Egypt RuiprezValiente et al Palestine As an occupied territory Palestine is subject to variety of ongoing restrictions such as checkpoints and other travel restrictions as well as periodic security spikes characterized by unrest violence and travel lockdowns which negatively impact its educational system For example students and teachers may be unable to pass through checkpoints in order to reach school in time or school trips may be canceled due to travel restrictions Traxler et al recent study conducted by Bruck et al confirmed the continued conflict in Palestine decreased the probability to pass the final exam and the opportunities to get an admission from the university to pursue higher education To mitigate the negative impact of restriction of mobility their students education many Palestinian teachers have turned to digital technologies Traxler et al Furthermore the Ministry of Education hereafter MoE which is responsible for the administration and development of the Palestinian education system at the levels of preschool basic education and secondary education has taken different procedures on the ground to reduce the negative impact of conflict on educati on such as locating teachers close to their living place and opening new schools in rural areas Shraim Shraim Khlaif Moreover the MoE has pursued variety of initiatives to mix technology in public schools such as the Professional Development program supported by the US through USAID the Belgium Learning project supported by the Kingdom of Belgium and Smart Learning supported by the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March local community in Palestine Khlaif Farid As consequence Palestinian education is highly digitized at both the managerial and instructional levels Khlaif et al In general the Palestinian education system is thought to be strong with an adult literacy rate at more than Itmazi Afghanistan The education system in Afghanistan is influenced by the Taliban and therefore there were several changes in the Afghani education system from the Taliban period to the postTaliban period Dandawate Dhanamjaya The decades of conflict almost destroyed the education system in Afghanistan During the Taliban era most girls schools were closed girls represented only about of school enrollment and women were barred from the few Teacher Training Colleges that remained open Shayan For students who did attend school the syllabus included religious subject that took up to of the teaching time Guistozzi Starting in girls enrollment began to rebuild by girls represented of school enrollment and of teachers were women Shayan However enrollment is inequitably distributed across the country in of girls attended school in the Hazara region while only did so in several southern provinces Larson Noorajan described Afghani online learning as very poor stating that access to the internet and digital learning resources are still not available in most educational institutions The digital divide is greater than expected because of the digital inequity to access to technology and the social gap among the Afghani society Khan et al Saay and Norta claimed that higher education institutions have moved forward in terms of creating shared reliable high speed interoperable elearning structure similar system for is not yet reality Contribution of this Study Although much research has been conducted on distance education there is lack of research on ERT in developing countries particularly since the COVID emergency forced schools to close and transfer their education to online classes This study examines hidden shadow on education across these three countries the unrevealed impact of ERT during the COVID pandemic on education including on students parents teachers and quality of content The study aims to answer the following questions How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school settings by instructors in these three countries To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and their families To what extent did digital privacy concerns create chall enges for students and their families Methods qualitative approach was adopted for the current study The qualitative approach is generally used to describe an intervention or phenomenon in the real life context in which it occurred Yin The qualitative approach used in the current study as individual semi structured interviews and observations of online learning sessions The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Participants The participants in the study were parents students and teachers in middle school settings in Libya Palestine and Afghanistan Sixty participants participants from each country including teachers parents and students were interviewed to discuss their lived experience with ERT in middle school settings during the COVID pandemic Furthermore online classes for each participating teacher were observed Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants The criteria for recruiting the participants in the study were having experience in online teaching during the COVID pandemic living in Libya Palestine and Afghanistan and allowing the online classes to be observed The participants were recruited through the professional network of the first author who was working with nonprofit organizations to train teachers on the use of ICT tools in education in these countries Table presents demographic information about he participants Table Participants Demographic Characteristics Participants Palestine Libya Afghanistan Male Female Male Female Male Female Teachers Parents Middle school students Total Data Collection Semi structured interviews with participants on Zoom were the main data source of this research Individual interviews were minutes in length and were audiorecorded after obtaining permission from each participant The interviews with participants from Libya and Palestine were in the Arabic language The interviews with participants from Afghanistan were in the Dari and Arabic languages The secondary data collection approach was observations of online classes Researchers observed four online classes for each teacher The main criterion for teachers to participate in the study was allowing their different online classes to be observed The researchers observed online classes from the three countries which took around hours Forty online classes were in the Arabic language and were in the Dari language the Afghani official language The classes comprised students from different backgrounds and cultures All the students parents and teachers participated in the study on voluntary basis Data Analysis The data analysis process started with the manual transcription of the interview audio files The transcribed files in the Dari language were translated into the Arabic language to facilitate the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March data analysis process The researchers individually coded the data into themes and subthemes from all the data sources by using thematic analysis Creswell Creswell Through thematic analysis researchers analyze categorize and report patterns in the data After constructing the themes that emerged in the analysis of the interview data the researchers used these themes to analyze the observations of online classes In terms of the analysis of the observations of online classes the researchers wrote notes on the structure of the classes and audiorecordings of the sessions to answer the first research question Furthermore the data from the observations of online classes were used to support themes and subthemes that emerged in the individual interviews Trustworthiness After transcribing the interviews the researchers sent all the written transcripts to participants for checking asking them to verify the content for accuracy Moreover participants were asked to write notes rewrite content and add new information on the transcripts Participants transcripts were not altered by the researchers When the final themes had been constructed professor in educational technology was asked to select small portion of the transcription and analyze it based on the constructed themes to check the accuracy of the themes In the Results section below transcript excerpts are labeled according to the participant role Parent Teacher or Student country Afghanistan Libya or Palestine and personal identification number Results Research question How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school settings by instructors in these three countries Based on the analysis of the observations of online classes the researchers categorized the implementation of ERT by schools and teachers in the three countries in to three themes type of online learning classes students engagement and the design and delivery of online instruction Type of Online Learning Classes Most of the teachers in the three countries used both synchronous and asynchronous tools to deliver instruction to the learners in the middle school settings Typically teachers created their asynchronous class using Edmodo or Google Classroom and posted links to synchronous Zoom sessions on the class wall Most of these teachers also recorded the synchronous sessions and posted the recordings for students who may have missed class Students needed to log into the virtual classes to access the recorded sessions All the teachers used free versions of the Zoom application Google Classroom and Edmodo However some teachers used other asynchronous platforms to deliver instruction and to communicate with their students and they rarely used synchronous sessions followup question was sent to these teachers about the reasons for not using synchronous session Typically teachers responded that most of their students did not have access to the internet because of the electricity in Gaza in Palestine and in Afghanistan being cut off Despite differences in the type of online instruction among the teachers from the three countries all teachers instruction shared the following common features it was free it was easy The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March to use students had to enroll in the platform to access content and technology tools were integrated Types of Content Delivered Various types of content were used by teachers to instruct students including interactive activities designed in opensource platforms educational videos from YouTube PowerPoint slides designed by teachers and students pictures infographic and whiteboard animation Teachers from Palestine and Afghanistan focus ed on using simple technological tools to design and deliver the instruction most of which were from opensource platforms They integrated simple tools to design and deliver interactive content to the students However the Libyan teachers depended only on one tool to design and develop instruction which was the Edmodo platform Few teachers assigned online tasks or activities to their students in the synchronous sessions as they reported they did not want to distract students in the online sessions Instead they assigned activities asynchronously using Edmodo or Google Classroom In synchronous online sessions teachers shared their screens used different features of the online platform such as the whiteboard and polls and used breakout rooms to allow students to work on assignments in small groups Depending on the type of instruction teachers allowed students to share their screen Students Interaction Teachers tried to support students engagement and interaction with each other in the synchronous and asynchronous sessions by designing and delivering activities few teachers gave students the opportunity to interact with the instructor or with their peers These teachers delivered online individual and group activities Teachers asked students to work on these activities online by forming groups and giving them the option to share their screens to present their work to their peers Other students were able to interact with their peers by providing text and verbal comments by using chat and audio features Many of the students engaged and interacted with their teachers thr ough text questions written on the chat tab In addition some students engaged in answering their peers questions on the chat tab Some female students from the three countries were reluctant to participate verbally in the online discussion However we noticed that these students were active in the asynchronous discussion on the platform The researchers asked the female students followup question about their engagement with the platform and discussions Feedback from participants indicated that students had various reasons for choosing to participate in asynchronous rather than synchronous interaction including personal reasons and cultural and religious reasons We discuss these reasons in more detail under Research Question Moreover the researchers noticed that the presence of teachers on the platform and timely feedback encouraged students to complete their assignments and interact with their peers Students from Afghanistan were more engaged in asynchronous activities than Palestinian st udents Observations suggested that the reason for this was that unlike the Afghani teachers Palestinian teachers did not interact with their students in asynchronous platform Libyan students engaged and interacted in both synchronous and asynchronous platforms less than the Afghani and Palestinian students The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Challenges of ERT All the participants from the three countries reported that ERT was big challenge for them since it was unplanned and students teachers and parents were unprepared to shift to online learning Most of the teachers in the three countries agreed that this was not the first time we moved to online teaching during crisis Teacher and that previous transformation had been for specific schools in specific districts due to violence Teacher Implementing ERT on large scale in the three countries caused pressure and anxiety for families in these countries parent from Afghanistan said Using online learning during the COVID crisis put me and my wife under pressure We have three kids in school We do not have enough devices and enough knowledge about online teaching Parent Research question To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and their families All the participants from the three countries reported that oving to ERT suddenly increased the digital gap in the learning process In addition they all reported that digital inequity put them under high pressure and caused anxietyparticularly since they did not know when this state of emergency would end and allow them to return to facetoface learning Overall the researchers identified three main themes inequity in internet and hardware quality of digital content and inequity based on gender Inequity in Internet and Hardware Internet Broadband Connectivity Teachers from Libya Afghanistan and Palestine noted the weakness of internet bandwidth as an element that hindered their ability to provide timely instruction to students ultimately affecting student engagement Although teachers in all three countries mentioned the issue it was reported less in the Palestinian context than in the Afghani and Libyan contexts Teachers and students who referred to the inequity in internet reported that access to internet broadband was one of the major barriers to implementing ERT during the COVID pandemic For example teacher from Afghanistan reported that the internet nowadays is weak because lot of people were trying to attend online classes It cannot help me prepare instruction and deliver it to my students Teacher Researchers observed that students from rural areas in all three countries were at more of disadvantage in terms of the availability and reliability of the internet than their peers from large cities live in small village north of Gaza Palestine did not attend online classes missed most of them because the electricity is cut off all the time Even if we have electricity the internet is weak asked my relative who lives in Gaza city to send me the recorded files to view them when electricity is available Student female student from rural area in Afghanistan stated usually go to my uncle house to attend online classes because we do not have the internet at home Student The participants from Libya reported that families financial situations influenced their connectivity to the internet am teacher in Tripoli have not received my salary for the last year so how can pay for the internet My priority is to pay for food and living expenses Moving to emergency remote teaching was sudden and it is difficult to adopt it in short time Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Inequit in Hardware Families from all three countries reported that some households have too few technological devices based on the number of children enrolled in schools and universities especially in families in which the father or mother or both are enrolled in graduate program at univ ersity female student from Libya reported cannot attend synchronous classes because my sister is using the device laptop when it is time for the class Student female student from Palestine stated that before this crisis COVID used to use my moms iPhone to finish my assignments but now cannot do this because she uses it to teach her students Student parent from Libya reported Because of the stay at home rule lost my job and it is difficult to buy new device for my kids to attend online learning asked their teacher to provide me the recorded teaching materials to use them by my children Parent male student from Afghanistan stated have two sisters one in high school and the older one at the university All of us are using the same desktop My dad cannot buy an additional computer for us Student parent from Palestine said cannot buy more devices because have not received my salary in the last six months because of Coronavirus Parent Quality of Digital Content Parents teachers and students agreed that the quality of digital content delivered by teachers in both synchronous and asynchronous sessions was low For example Libyan parents and students mentioned the low quality of course content for math and English while Palestinian and Afghani students and parents reported the low quality of learning materials and content in science Teachers believed the low quality of course content was result of the sudden transition to remote learning contexts We moved to online teaching within hours do not have time to plan and design suitable content for my students The teaching online is completely different from teaching face to face It needs specific teaching strategies specific content which takes lot of time to prepare Teacher Other teachers from Libya and Palestine reported that they were unprepared to design interactive content stating that they do not have team to design and do not know the tools to use in the design process Teacher Teacher Teacher Teacher Teacher Students from Afghanistan complained about the quality of the assignments and the grading system The content is related to the lesson in the book but when went to do the assignment it was unclear do not feel there was connection between the assignment and the material In addition do not know how my teacher will grade me Student Some parents from Palestine and Afghanistan were struggling to teach and assist their children because they do not have experience with the design of digital content Palestinian parent said usually teach my children and help them finish their tasks and activities but now do not know how to start with them asked my brother who is teac her to help them Parent parent from Afghanistan stated am not educated in using technology It is difficult for me to teach my kids this type of content Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Inequity Based on Gender Most students and parents and some teachers believed that online course design and delivery was biased based on gender For example female students reported that course materials and activities tended to focus on males by showing photos of boys or using boys names Our observational data supported female students perceptions that teachers from all three countries privileged male students by using gendered language referring mostly to boy names allowing male students to speak more frequently and often interrupting female students My teachers are biased toward males in online classes Since the beginning of teaching online two months ago have only been allowed to use the mic twice for two or three minutes but some males talk more than all the females Student female student from Libya said In the presentation of our project my teacher did not give us an opportunity to present in the same way as males and in mixed teams He asked if prefer males to present the project like to discuss my ideas but am not allowed to Student The inequity based on gender was not only due to teachers as some families did not allow their female children to use the microphone female student from Libya stated My dad put restrictions on using the microphone and camera while using his laptop for online learning Student Palestinian female student mentioned that her mo ther allowed her to use the internet for learning without opening the mic and the camera Student Research question To what extent did digital privacy concerns create challenges for students and their families According to the data analysis new theme related to the ERT during the COVID crisis was mentioned by the participants which was digital privacy Most of the participants in the current study stated that teaching and learning in the ERT environment should be managed professionally and ethically by teachers and students All participants expressed concerns about digital privacy and most of the students reported that their digital privacy was violated by on of their family members or by their teachers Furthermore families stated that sharing devices such as smartphones laptops or desktops is considered as violating individual privacy In general perspectives on privacy seemed re lated to two key themes gender differences in privacy and sharing devices or internet access Gender Differences in Privacy As mentioned earlier many female students mentioned that their families did not allow them to use their camera or microphone during class followup question was sent to the students asking why their families were concerned about the camera and microphone Below we draw from these responses as well as students original interviews Due to security concerns cultural traditions or rel igious strictures many female students and their families felt their personal images should remain private For example one parent said We are living in bad situation because of violence and security am concerned about her daughter privacy in online learning do not know how to protect her Parent In some districts in Afghanistan Libya and Palestine it is considered inappropriate for families to allow their children to share photos videos or even to appear talking in video clip Other families from these countries consider themselves openminded and allow their children to share videos and The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March photos and use webcam on the internet however these families were minority Overall many female students felt their privacy was threatened by teachers as well as other students First some teachers asked female students to engage in practices that the students or families felt were inappropriate For example the researchers noticed that some male teachers asked students to open their camera at the beginning of the session Some of the girls refused to open it with one girl saying do not like to open my camera for personal reasons Student and the teacher respected their privacy During the online sessions some teachers asked students to share their desktop some students agreed to share it while others refused to share it with one saying have personal pictures in the background on my computer Student In interviews few other female students reported that their teachers asked them to open the webcam which they considered violation of their digital privacy and reported to their families One student asked Personal information on social media and in the online classes is private information do not like to use the camera so why did my teacher asked me to open the camera Student Other families did not allow their girls to attend online classes if they were asked to share their information on social media or share their laptop screen Second female students felt that many of their male peers did not know the boundaries or work professionally Student in the new online learning environment female student from Afghanistan expressed anger about some of her male friends who looked for her social media profile and sent her friend request Some female teachers from Libya and Afghanistan also reported that many girls complained about the bad conduct of their peers which included taking screen shots of the online sessions and posting them on social media pages trying to add them as friends on social media and sharing their emails on the chat tab in the online sessions to contact them In contrast most of the male students did not care about their privacy They were willing to open their camera and to share their desktop and shared no concerns about these practices in their interviews Sharing Devices or Internet Parents from all three countries reported they were forced to share their own smartphones laptops or desktops with their children for schooling purposes which they felt was violation of individual privacy parent from Palestine sta ted Because we do not have extra devices somet imes share my smartphone with my son and allow him to use it My accounts on social media are open and share my thoughts with my close friends Allowing family member to share my device puts my digital privacy at risk Parent Libyan parent reported that she does not like to share her laptop with her children She said am lawyer and all of my clients files are stored on my computer Honestly when let my kids use my laptop observed them Parent We asked her followup question about restricting access to her files by using password The answer was do not have high skills in computers to protect myself would appreciate it if you could help me Parent woman from Afghanistan reported that her husband asked her if he could share her smartphone in his online session My husband is science teacher and he asked if he could use my phone At the beginning hesitated because have my sister wedding pictures on it Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March In addition to sharing devices many families shared their internet access points with neighbors This practice was common in Palestine and Afghanistan but was less common in Libya since buying an internet package is cheaper than in Palestine and Afghanistan No do not like to share internet with others It is cheap have high internet speed for less than Parent When families shared internet with neighbors parents worried that their children could be stalk ed by others on their network parent from Afghanistan reported We share internet with one of our neighbors because it is expensive to buy an internet package alone My daughter told me that our neighbors son knows everything about her online account and sen her friend request Parent Students from Libya and Palestine reported that they do not feel safe and secure in the online environment when they share internet with their neighbors For example female student from Palestine said When post anything on social media our neighbors son was the first to like or comment feel he is waiting for me to write post Student Discussion The aim of the study was to explore the challenges of ERT during the COVID crisis in three developing countries Libya Palestine and Afghanistan qualitative approach was adopted to achieve this aim Moving suddenly from facetoface teaching to ERT complicated and disrupted the educational system in these countries which had already been affected by violence and unstable policy as well as the weaknesses of the infrastructure and the bad economic situation Although teachers tried their best to foster students engagement in online learning sessions they sometimes failed because of the digital inequity among students and families Teachers and students in the developing countries used synchronous and asynchronous free tools to continue teaching and learning in the ERT and teachers on both asynchronous and synchronous platforms provided support and encouraged students to engag in online activities Teachers relied on their own technology solutions because there was no welldesigned and secure online system or platform for teaching and learning As result learners digital privacy was threatened and consistent with previous studies the quality of content in the emergency context was low compared with content delivered in well planned online learning context Hodges et al Khlaif et al Mohmmed et al Whittle et al Our results found number of inequities between students Some parents could not provide their children with technological devices and families in rural and remote places encountered difficulties in getting connected to internet broadband which reduced students engagement in online synchronous sessions compared with online asynchronous sessions Girls were also less active in synchronous online sessions than boys due in large part to their hesitancy to share their personal images but they were more active and productive in the asynchronous platforms These results align with previous studies suggesting that digital inequity negatively influences the online learning process Khidhir et al Khlaif Salha Khlaif et al We also found that digital privacy was major concern for both parents and students Most families were concerned about daughters opening their webcams or sharing their screens Parents were reluctant to share their own devices for their childrens schooling and vex that their childrens activities could be monitored by neighbors via shared internet access points In general The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March violation of students and parents digital privacy increased during the coronavirus ERT which reduced students engagement in online classes The concepts of digital inequity and digital ethics are still very limited underrated and unclear in developing countries such as Palestine Afghanistan and Libya Both were eroded in the coronavirus ERT setting which had negative influence on students engagement in online classes The absence of these concepts and related processes of instructional design among teachers in ERT settings was obvious which deepened digital inequity and damaged digital privacy To address these issues the Ministries of Education in these countries may wish to consider three key actions First they could provide students and teachers with devices and reduce internet fees to make the internet available to wide range of citizens Second they could develop clear vision about digital privacy Finally develop shared technology platform across the system that will benefit learners and train teachers on it The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March References Affouneh Salha Khlaif

attitudes and their practices regarding the use of digital technol ogies during preschool education The main research questions the study intended to address focused on teachers and parents attitudes and practices about the role of digital technology supplies in young childrens development The study used mixed rese arch approach using in depth interviews and an online questionnaire The results have shown that only one of the eight preschool teachers reported positive attitude regarding the impact of digital technology in childrens development Most of the interv iewed preschool teachers showed preference towards authentic play and activities exercising childrens psycho motor skills However most of parents have suggested that their children starting from early years of their development are exposed to differen digital technologies In conclusion there are two contradictory findings progressive and regressive philosophies among parents and preschool teachers regarding their perceptions and practices on the use of digital technologies in young childrens lear ning and development The study advocates for continuous cooperation between parents and teachers to ensure aspect of maximizing benefits and alleviating potential risks of using digital technologies in early childhood education Keywords preschool tea cher parents digital technology attitudes practices Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No INTRODUCTION Technology plays crucial role in children and adults everyday lives There are numerous studies showing that the use of digital technology from different user groups is increasing ev ery day However studies also show that there are different perceptions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the use of digital technology children especially during their early ages of development Information and Communications Technology hereafter ICT can be defined as anything which allows us to get information to communicate with each other or to have an effect on the environment using electronic or digital equipment Bolstad However according to Kalas in early childh ood education literature hereafter ECE the concept of ICT includes computer hardware and software digital cameras and video cameras the Internet telecommunication tools programmable toys and many other devices and resources In many countries EC or preschool education is conceptualized differently This study focuses on preschool education ie the years before children attend elementary school In Kosovo the Law on Pre university education requires children to enrol in elementary school at si years old Therefore the study concentrates on perceptions on the use of technology during children development before the age of six known as preschool age as defined by the Kosovo Curriculum Framework MEST In addition the study focuses on he use of digital technology at early childhood institutions and their home Early childhood education policies and practice itself in Kosovo has been great challenge for the overall educational policies According to study report published by the Kos ovo Education and Employment Network KEEN project the inclusion of children in institutionalized pre school education in Kosovo continues to be challenge given that by according to data from the Education Management information System EMIS here are only public kindergartens and licensed private institutions which are community based Gjelaj Rraci Bajrami As result Kosovo remains the country with the lowest inclusion of children in preschool education aged to years old in the region with an inclusion rate of The highest inclusion rate is in pre primary classes aged to where of children are involved Ibid Despite this current situation the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan KESP under the strategic objective teaching and learning plans to maximize learning through quality teaching implementing competency based curricula and by using high quality teaching resources The implementation of the new curriculum in all schools is understood as central to improving the quality of learning in Kosovo In addition to teacher training this requires the preparation of textbooks and other teaching and learning materials including electronic teaching materials that are in harmony with the Kosovo Curriculum Framework KCF This also assumes that special attention should be paid to providing schools with ICT equipment as well as other teaching support However two important stakeholders in early childhood development teachers and parents have opposing opinions regarding the use of digital technology in education Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No The purpose of this study is to analyze teacher and parents attitudes and practices about the use of digital technologies during early years of education The study aims to give answer to two main research questions What are the attitudes and practices of the parents towards the use of digital technology during early years of children development at home What are the attitudes and practices of preschool teachers toward the use digital technology during early years of children development in kindergarten education LITERATURE REVIEW Historically theorists and researchers have debated whether young children should use technology at school Alper Blackwell Cordes Miller Kirkorian Wartella Anderson House Lindahl Folkesson Morgan Parett Quesenberry Blum Plowman McPake at Zomer and Kay Various authors have expressed the view that computerICT use is ot appropriate for young childrens cognitive physical social and emotional development However there is no clear evidence to support this claim and this view has increasingly been replaced by the view that when used appropriately ICT can be usef ul tool for supporting young childrens learning and development Bolstad There are diverse attitudes presented from different stakeholders when discussing early years of children development and the use of digital technology Today it is common to observe toddlers and preschool children watching videos playing games on tablets or exploring on the internet With such dynamic developments there is need to establish better understanding of the process of engaging ICT in everyday play and learning activ ities of preschool children Several recent research findings pointed out the extraordinary potential of ICT to enhance the learning and other developmental processes of children Kalas According to Kalas studies have shown that digital tec hnologies can provide children with new opportunities to engage in attractive and relevant play learning communication exploration and development Properly integrated digital tools can empower younger children by providing them with voice especiall with limited literacy capabilities at their young age US Department of Education Digital technologies as digital toys which are properly integrated in learning can empower children by granting them voice they have never had before In this context digital technologies also open new pathways for alternative social interactions and change the learning relationships between children and teachers UNESCO Hayes and Whitbread examined holistic development of young childrens learning and identified seven different ways that learning could be enhanced by integrating ICT namely ICT and literacy ICT and mathematical understanding ICT and science creativity problem solving and playful use of technology visual literacy and painting media education digital animation and learning of music Results of the interviews with teachers and parents as shown by the study of Ihmeideh Alkhawaldeh have indicated clear perpetuation of the role of Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No technology and digital media in the intellectual religious and moral aspects due to the contributions of these aspects to childrens learning and development Based on Byron New Zealand Council for Educational Research and Stephen Plowman most of the concerns fall into one of four categories harmful physical effects childrens learning cognitive social and emotional development exposure to harmful contents and new technologies displacing other important learnin and play activities However nowadays it is almost impossible to come across an educational institution without an ICT presence In early childhood education the term ICTs could include computers digital cameras and digital video cameras creativity and communication software and tools the internet telephones mobile telephones tape recorders interactive stories computer games programmable toys videoconferencing technologies and closed circuit television data projectors microphones headphone electronic whiteboards and more Olowe Kutelu Early childhood in service and pre service teachers views are essential for ICT integration in early childhood settings and studies have shown that positive views are crucial for influencing their decisions to use ICT in their teaching Sime Priestley Their views and intentions predict the integration or lack thereof of ICT in the classroom while the successful integration will also depend on other factors such as appropriate skills and training Sime Priestley Inan Lowther examined the effects of teachers individual characteristics and perceptions of contextual factors that influence ICT integration in classrooms One of the independent variables included in their st udy was teachers beliefs about technology which was defined as the teachers perception of the influence of technology on teaching and learning practices Findings showed that teachers computer proficiency teachers overall support teachers technical support and computer availability have significant influence on teachers beliefs about technology Also teachers beliefs had strong influence on the use and integration of ICT in classrooms Regarding pre service early childhood teachers Angeli showed that they are not free of personal beliefs about the role of ICT in early childhood settings and that they may also have misconceptions about the potential of ICT tools in teaching and learning Although they appropriate technology in their ro le as students eg to prepare lessons plans they resist seeing technology as part of their relationship with children and express little desire to use computers with children as future teachers Laffey Furthermore Kiridis Tsakiridou Kask alis Golia have found that pre service early childhood teachers have positive views about the use of computer in early childhood settings Such views have pointed out that the use of computer enhances teaching thus computers should be used acro ss all kindergarten activities Their findings have recommended the introduction and use of computers have positive outcomes for young children such as higher concentration and participation in educational process enhancement of learning outcomes and acilitation of communication Literature also speaks that in service teacher training has been of informative nature and nonsystematic Minaidi Hlapanis and relevant courses mainly aim at the Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No development of teachers familiarity with ICT use of word processing spreadsheet presentation programs and internet According to Gialamas Nikolopoulou the positive influence of the computer self efficacy on views intentions is statistically significant for each population but it is stronger or the teachers This finding is in agreement with earlier studies that showed positive relationships between computers selfefficacy and inpre service early childhood teachers views Chen Chang Tsitouridou Vryzas On the contra ry to teacher perceptions and beliefs parents are more opened to use different supplies of digital technologies and most of studies show that there is strong relationship between parents different habits and influence to their children Studies show hat nowadays parents are not spending much quality time with their children while the amount of time spent by them on reading to their children is very low Shin Hesketh Hinkley Campbell Studies also found that parent technology use or at titudes toward media to be positively correlated with their childrens use of technology Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes Genc McCloskey et al Vittrup Snider Rose Rippy Blackwell Lauricella Wartella Overall parents showed positive attitudes toward media to the extent that they believed media exposure to be vital to childrens development and many disagreed with recommendations from expert sources regarding ageappropriate screen time Vittrup et al STUDY CONTEXT The Republic of Kosovo is the newest state in Europe It declared its independence on February th he total population of the Republic of Kosovo is estimated at million with ethnic Albanians comprising ethnic Serbs and other ethnic groups of the total population The current education sector in Republic of Kosovo is undergoing extens ive reform efforts in all sub sectors addressing key challenges of increasing participation and improving equity and quality of education with limited resources According to the Strategic Developing Plan of Education despite good progress in education reform there are challenges to be addressed Regarding preschool education system Kosovo seems to have the lowest rate of inclusion of preschool children in institutionalized education According to the Agency of Statistics in Kosovo there are only public kindergartens in overall state The capital of Kosovo Prishtina municipality has started implementing new model of community based kindergartens and it seems the best way to expand the inclusion of preschool aged children in educat ion The National Development Strategy Plan aims at improving the quality of education and early childhood education is one of the priorities The new Kosovo Curriculum Framework KCF focuses on learner centeredness competencies integrated teaching and learning flexibility mobility and transparency MEST Overall Kosovo is considered to have very advanced legislation in the field of education pre primary education for children aged years is expected to become Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No mandatory afte financial analysis done by KOMF Public awareness about the importance of ECE has also risen due to initiatives of UNICEF MEST and numerous partner organizations MEST has committed itself to providing improved access and quality educati on for all children and on all educational levels including Early Childhood Education ECE Preschool education is now part of the wider Pre University Strategy During preschool sector started to acquire support by MEST in order to develop Early Le arning Development Standards ELDS for children from birth to yearold The goal of the Early Learning Development Standards was to increase the quality of education activities in preschool education both in the family environment and preschool institut ions MEST However the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan KESP and the document of Kosovo Curriculum Framework underline that in order to become successfully integrated into digital economy students need to attain digital competencies Therefore along with basic knowledge of literacy and numeracy the current and future education system should stress the importance of digital awareness and literacy so that full functional literacy is achieved during formal schooling MEST Kosovo Edu cation Framework Even though educational policies in our country prioritize the continuous professional development of educators and the integration of ICT at all levels of pre university education and specifically in preschool institutions This research contributes to enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and parents in harmony with Kosovos strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in Early Childhood METHOD Participants The sample for this study includes preschool teac hers selected randomly from public preschool institutions all over Kosovo in order to see if there are differences in perceptions regarding the use of digital technologies in early childhood education between preschool teachers working in different parts of Kosovo The number of kindergartens in the cities of Kosovo is very low usually there is one kindergarten in one city However the situation regarding the availability of kindergartens public private and community based is higher in Prishtina the capital of Kosovo Teachers involved in this

randomly selected parents participated in the study Table provides parent demographic information According to Creswell one of the mo st common probability sampling approaches used by researchers is random sampling which allow representatives preschool teachers and parents in this study an equal chance of getting selected This sampling strategy was purposely chosen by our group of re searchers considering that topics such as the use of digital technologies in early childhood education are limited in the context of developing countries such as Kosovo Hence this sampling strategy allowed our study to acquire wide range of perceptio ns from both preschool teachers and parents as randomly selected the selected sample representatives enhancing the value of our findings Table Parents Demographic Characteristics Children age Place of living Rural Urban Didnt declare total Instruments The study used both in depth interviews and an online questionnaire to collect the data In depth interviews with preschool teachers where used to find out what are the teacher attitudes and practice regarding use of digital supplies in preschool education settings model of indepth interview protocol used from Kelly was used to identify four dimensions of teacher attitudes toward use of digital technology consisted from Teacher previous experience with regards to technology use Availability of digital technologies in current workplace Own believes about technology effects to children learning and development and Professional development activities with regard to technology skills Questions about the practices of integration of technology during the classes and the ones that ask to describe the lessons activities with technology where avoided when teachers declared that they do not have any kind of digital technology in their classro oms In order to collect preschool parents attitudes regarding the use of use of digital technologies in early childhood education an open online questionnaire was distributed to parents in October The questionnaire was self constructed and djusted to the context It covered main research questions dealing with parental attitudes and practices about The types of digital technologies used by their children Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No The amount of time spent with any kind of digital technologies and Believes about adva ntages and disadvantages regarding the effects of digital technologies on their children development and school readiness Data Analysis The in depth interviews were analyzed using content analysis Kolbe Burnett In addition the four dimensions from Kelly model were used as criteria and guiding elements to convey many themes and discussions The content analysis was followed by descriptive statistical analysis of the online questionnaire Creswell FINDINGS Parents Attitudes and Practices about use of Digital Technology during Early Years According to the data parents attitudes and practices about use of digital technology during early years can be organized into two groups One of the groups comprises parents that support the idea of enabling their children to use digital technologies such as TV laptop tablets smart devices computers gaming technology see Fig The other group of parents represents the opinion of avoiding their childrens exposure to digital technologi es during their early stages of development see Fig Figure Type of Technology Used by Children up to as Reported by Parents The questionnaire data showed that most of the parents declared positive towards th use of digital technologies for their young children ages to The results presented have indicated that most of parents grant access to TV smart phones and tablets for their young children ages to Parents Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No reporte that they are satised with how their young children access and use technology at home referring to the benets of technology use including but not limited to learning of English language acquiring technology skills and general development In fact around percent of parents declared they are firm believers that children using technology will promote their school readiness However around percent of them do not support this relationship Figure Parents Perceived Benets on School Readiness Despite the countless benefits parents associate technology use with socializing problems too much screen time sleeping problems physical development delays while they also think that children miss outdoor play with their pe ers and they even develop behavioral problems from the contact with inappropriate content such as violence and aggressive games Figure Time Children Spend Using Technology Each Day The data presented in the pie chart above indicates variation of childrens time allotted in front of screen from minutes to hours per day as reported by parents Most of the children use any type of technologies up to hours per day According to Lauricella Wartella Rideout there is scientific evidence to argue that very young children spend less time with media than older children This finding corresponds Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No with other findings Lauricella Wartella Rideout suggesting the general assumption that there is less exposure to technology in educating very young children Figure Parents Perceived Benets Associated with Technology Use While there is evidence to suggest that the use of technology does not nearly support childrens social skills development it is important to recognize that parents are aware of the benefits technology brings The que stionnaire results showed that parents believe that by using digital technologies children improve their language skills early learning skills and technology skills Having in mind that there are very few applications for youn children in Albanian language main language in Kosovo children are using digital platforms in English language and this might be considered by their parents as beneficial modality for their children language development These results complement oth er studies related to the language teaching lessons in particular Such studies emphasize that the use digital stories that promote lessons as enjoyable and productive affect the improvement of language skills interest attitudes attention and motivation in positive way Girmen Kaya However other fields of development are considered to be rather poorly developed such as social skills psycho motor development and communication skills In addition our findings of this study are consistent with other studies in the field of early childhood education and the use of technology Such studies also support the conclusion that parents have positive attitude towards the use of digital technologies in early childhood educat ion see McCloskey Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauricella Wartella In addition they support the process of exposing their children to technology supplies arguing in favor of the technology benefits on their children development As reported by Ihmeideh Alkhawaldeh both parents and teachers expressed high degree of agreement concerning the role of technology digital media in developing child culture Nevertheless data presented in the Figure indicates parents conc erns about the negative effects of technology on their childrens development As our findings present parents indicate their concerns by reporting distress that their children are spending excessive screen time can be exposed to inappro priate content when using Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No the internet engaged in less active play time might be negatively influenced by commercial content are engaged in less time playing in the yard might develop physical disorders and might develop sleeping problems In such cases while studies see Girmen Kaya McCloskey Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauricella Wartella highlight the importance of the use of digital technologies early childrens education our study points towards other imperative aspects in early children education that might lack behind due to the use of technology Figure Parents Concerns About Negative Effects from Digital Technology Economic consumption Preschool Teachers Attitudes and Practices about use of Digital Technology during Early Years Comparing to parents attitudes preschool teachers declared themselves very differently regarding the use of digital supplies during early years edu cation Most of the teachers believe that young children during this age mostly need interaction with their surrounding environment and engage with concrete tools toys Teacher experiences with regards to technology As declared by the interviewed tea chers most of them have been raised and educated in an environment without the use of any type of digital technologies None of them were provided with the opportunity to be exposed to an education environment that makes uses of digital technologies avail able at their disposal for teaching and learning Their pedagogy system did not support any digital technology learning tools The interview results emphasized that the previous education system power students learning through making use of physical mater ials as means of demonstration Back then the only technology related supplies that students were acquainted with were radio and TV Therefore teachers lack of experience with technology related supplies during their previous learning experience is va lid predictor for their current attitudes and perceptions regarding the use of technology in early childhood education The following verbatim quote represents this same argument Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No Our teachers never used technology in the classroom We were educated in very traditional method We didnt have computers in school or at home We even didnt have TV at school The main source of knowledge was books and teachers During early childhood we didnt used to go to kindergarten We went to school for the first tim when we were years old saw computer for the first time on when we bought one for my son declares preschool teacher LM age It can be seen also from other interviewed teachers that their experience with regard to technology was very pathetic The presented lack of experience could have affected teachers believes attitudes and practices on their present work with young children Only one from eight teachers declared that she was trained to work with computer Available technology suppl ies in current working place Most of the teachers declared that they have only one TV in the kindergarten The TV is placed in joined room where all the children from different groups could have their time to go there and watch movie During the previo us years they were asked or advised from the educational inspectors not to let children watch TV at all since they are being passive during that time Based on their experience they were using TV only for calming down the children as they prefer watchin TV This indicated experience shows that the only technology available in the kindergarten was no used for educational proposes Five from eight kindergartens reported that they only possessed one video projector that is rarely used since the group is packed and it is logistically inconvenient to organize spate projector group uses Moreover the interviewed teachers declared that they lack any kind of smart devices in the classroom In addition children are not allowed to bring their own devices at sc hool kindergarten In all the classrooms they declared that they do have music player The music player is bought usually by parents There are no computers in the classrooms in none of the seven public kindergartens in Kosovos main cities Figure Type of digital technology supplies in the kindergarten as declared by teachers Instead of real digital technology supplies preschool teachers declared that they use technology supplies brought by parents such as TV microwav iron radio which are Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No not properly functioning or are out of order preschool teacher has reported the following Through imaginary play with these technology supplies children develop their communication skills and creativity as well as enjoy rol playing IG age preschool teacher working in public kindergarten FH age declared that We encourage children to play in groups socialize with each other through authentic play and toys even if they want to bring their own smart de vices we dont allow them to do so because the devices are fragile and children can break them and we dont have time to deal with such issues Personal attitudes towards digital technology There is consensus among the majority of the interviewed teach ers that using digital technology during early years will only harm children psycho physical development The results have shown that they ignore any possibility that the use of technology devices is beneficial during early childhood education Teachers ha ve claimed that if kindergarten funding would enable them to purchase technology supplies they would only utilize them as didactical materials serving as means for providing illustration and examples Such technology supplies will not to be used by child ren themselves Most of the kindergarten teachers seven from eight believe that kid already spend lot of time using digital devices at home so while they are at school or kindergarten they should only play and learn in interaction with the enviro nment other children and other adults Children learn best when they explore and discuss with their peers and adults They need to move around solve authentic problems think critically and resolve possible conflicts from the real life experiences Pr eschool teacher HM age One of the interviewed teachers JM age declared that she would use smart devices such as smart boards or other smart tablets She said We miss very essential materials toys and paper dont know when we will be ab le to have smart devices in the classroom We could only ask from parents to bring their own devices at school Children love exploring and playing with them They can learn math language or singing Professional development activities for technology sk ills Preschool teachers were asked about their types of professional development activities that have helped them acquire technology skills and to what extent did their college coursework prompted them to integrate technology in classroom Teachers that ha ve been recently graduated with bachelor degree in preschool education Faculty of Education declared that they had only one course dedicated to ICT in preschool education The other teachers that have been studying in so called Pedagogical High School training offered for kindergarten teacher before preschool education was offered at University level they never had single course that dealt with the integration of Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No technology in teaching Similarly teachers coming from the faculty of general pedagogy were not offered any course during their pre service teacher training All of interviewed teachers declared that they attended an in service training of basic ECDL European Computer Driving License qualification However they have never used such train ing into their practice due to lack of computers at their disposal at kindergartens where they work It is usually one computer at principals office but none in our classrooms IM age None of the interviewed teachers feel they are sufficiently prepared to teach early childhood content using technology All of them would prefer training that would prepare them to use different technology supplies and also help them change their traditional mindset toward technology use during early years We admit that the world has changed Children of today are children of technology era They like it and maybe they can learn from it if used properly declares one of the interviewed teachers IM age The findings supported by this study conclude that younger generation teachers that have been qualified during recent years have been displayed more open attitude towards the use of technology use and the need to incorporate technology training during their professional development plan However teacher who have been educated during pre professional age Hargreaves have the tendency to be more reluctant to new teaching methods and changing their perspectives DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The purpose of this study was to analyze preschool teachers an parents views and practices regarding use of digital technologies during early childhood education Our findings have indicated that there are differences between parents and teacher views and attitudes regarding the use of digital technologies during arly years of children or pupil development Most of the parents of children to declared that they provide to their children different types of digital technology supplies starting from their first year of their development Regularly children spend lot of time on TV laptop and other smart technological devices Children spend screen time from minutes up to more than four hours per day Parents believe that there are some benefits emerging from the digital media They believe that their children development increases in some of their developmental areas including language development cognitive early learning skills and technology skills Children are using digital supplies in English language and this might be considered by their parents as beneficial to their language skills development This funding is consistent with other findings in the field of technology use in early children education see see Girmen Kaya McCloskey et al Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauric ella Wartella However while our findings are emerge and support from numerous findings in this field the novelty of our results should be emphasised That is while the use of technology use in early children Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No education is important our study uggests that other fields of development are considered weekly developed such as social skills psycho motor development and communication skills Parents believe that the use of technology improves their childrens overall development and school readin ess However they have also reported some concerns about the negative impact technology might have on their children wellbeing such as lack of active play time in opened environment physical development disorders or sleeping problems Correspondingly enc have showed that parents with negative opinions indicate how smartphone usage can cause physical or mental problems in the future they fear that their children will be introverted have an isolated life or be affected by harmful radiation Despite this most of them exposed their children to at least one digital supply during the first year of life and the number of supplies increases on yearly basis This finding is very controversial and points toward further discussions in the field of tec hnology use in early children education Despite parents views preschool teachers have very different attitudes about use of digital technology supplies during early years of children development The in depth interviews showed that teacher attitudes ar mostly affected by four factors as shown in the model below Figure Visualization of Factors Influencing Teacher Attitudes toward Technology Use Teachers previous experience with regards to technology use availability of digital technology supplies in current working place own believes about technology effects to children learning and development and professional development activities with regard to technology skills were indicated also very important at Kelly This study reports that teachers perceptions were influenced both by the interpersonal level as well as the communityinstitutional level In addition our findings are consistent with Kelly suggesting that the capacity building of teachers is important for ef fective use of technology tools Teaching experience seems to be correlated to their attitudes toward use of technology Studies show that teachers with more teaching experience have less favourable attitudes toward technology and use technology less ofte than teachers with less experience Blackwell Lauricella and Wartella Our study also depicted similar situation in Kosovo Teachers with more teaching experience where strictly against the integration of technology in their lesson plans or ac tivities with preschool children Inan Attitudes Teachers previous experience Availability of digital technology Own believes about technology Professional development Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No Lowther showed that teachers perceptions of instructional benefits are an influential factor that affects technology integration in classrooms The interviewed teachers in our research also declared their vi ews as negative toward technology This affected their practice as well The study of Badia et al presents that ICT related school conditions such as ICT teaching policy and ICT infrastructure show significant but more modest association with tea chers perceived effectiveness of digital technology Similarly put finds have reported that the lack of proper technological tools in kindergarten to certain extent have influenced their negative perceptions regarding the use of technology For many years these poor conditions have influenced teachers lack of willing to use technology with young children Their professional in service and pre service development is also poor and their previous experience in school was not guided by the use of techn ology As reported by UNICEF it is imperative that ECCE educators are productively integrated in professional development related to technological use It is important to understand that the process of becoming ICT competent for ECCE educator is longterm transformation which requires continuous support and monitoring Since its beginning efficient professional development program must focus both on developing ICT literacy of the educators and simultaneously utilizing their emerging new lit eracy for building new pedagogies of ICT in favor of childrens learning and development Findings of the study are debatable since on the one hand the majority of parents support and utilize the use of technology in their children development while preschool teachers later in children education are stemming childrens exposure to digital technologies This influences children development in many levels while in this case creating two confusing levels of early children education ie using both rogressive and regressive philosophies in children development This is also relevant to initiate discussions at policy level in the country and other countries concerning with similar conflicts Findings have policy implications for preschool curriculum implementation towards quality education in early children development This research contributes to enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and parents in harmony with Kosovos strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in Early Child hood The question today on the use of technology does not concern the paradigm of whether it is positive or negative Today the use of digital technologies in education system is inevitable Rather different stakeholders involved with early childhood dev elopment should acknowledge both the benefits and risks that technology use brings to children and teachers continuous cooperation between parents and teachers should be facilitated to ensure prospects of maximizing its benefits and alleviating potentia risks in early childhood education REFERENCES

['COVID and its implications for protect children online April COVID has prompted widespread school closures and physical distancing measures and made online platforms and communities essential to maintaining sense of normalcy Children and their families are turning to digital solutions more than ever to support childrens learning socialization and play While digital solutions provide huge opportunities for sustaining and promoting childrens rights these same tools may also increase childrens exposure to online risks This technical note sets out some of the key priorities and recommendations on how to mitigate those risks and promote positive online experiences for children COVID has abruptly pushed childrens daily lives online As of April COVID has led to at least countrywide school closures impacting more than of the worlds student population In places where there is wide access to digital technology more and more aspects of peoples daily lives are moving online as people choose or are asked to stay home Internet usage is up in some part of the world following the spread of COVID Similarly many childrens learning experiences are being reshaped by the sudden introduction of remote learning including where available technology and virtual platforms as substitute for the classroom and schoolyard Online games social media and video chat programs are providing opportunities for children to connect with and play with their friends parents and relatives while in isolation While children aged and older may already be familiar with social media the pandemic has introduced younger children to social networking tools that may not be designed for them and for which they may hold limited preparation Parents and caregivers meanwhile are being asked to navigate their childrens shift to online learning and recreation while balancing work and other uncertainties related to the pandemic Increased online activity supports childrens learning socialization and play but also puts them at heightened risk Increased internet use can put children at greater risk of online harms such as sexual exploitation and cyberbullying Not all risks will translate into actual harm but children facing other issues in their lives may be more vulnerable It is important that measures to mitigate risks should be balanced with childrens rights to freedom of expression access to information and privacy Keeping children informed and engaged and empowering them with the skills to use the internet safely is critical line of defence Online sexual exploitation The most recent Global Threat Assessment by WePROTECT Global Alliance and groundbreaking investigative reporting by New York Times set out the scale and impact of online sexual exploitation It is highly likely that COVID will heighten this risk to children as highlighted by national law enforcement agencies and civil society organisations around the world Spending more time online may increase the likelihood that children come into contact with online predators Physical distancing measures are likely to increase childrens outreach to new contacts and groups online which could be exploited by predators to groom children for sexual exploitation With more adults isolated at home there may also be additional demand for child sexual abuse material leading to more commercial sexual exploitation of children The livestreaming of sexual abuse by family members is already well documented phenomenon in certain communities Stayathome orders will also mean that families are forced to remain in close quarters which for children living with abusers could result in an escalation of sexual abuse both offline and online For example COPPA and GDPRK Cyberbullying It is wellestablished that cyberbullying is major concern among teenagers and has wide ranging negative impacts With many children suddenly experiencing extended periods of unstructured time online and grappling with mounting sources of stress cyberbullying could proliferate The COVID pandemic has also introduced instant messaging online gaming and chat services to an increasing number of young children who may have limited online experience and be less resilient to hurtful behavior Girls children with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID may be at increased risk of online bullying and discrimination Online risktaking behavior lack of inperson interaction with friends and partners may lead older children to engage in riskier behaviour online for example through sexting or the sharing of self generated sexualized content which may expose them to risks of extortion harassment and humiliation Potentially harmful content Increased online activity may expose children to ageinappropriate and potentially harmful content including content that is violent misogynistic xenophobic promotes political or ideological violence or incites suicide and selfharm Children may also be exposed to larger quantity of targeted online marketing that promotes unhealthy foods gender stereotypes or is ageinappropriate They may also be exposed to misinformation about COVID that could drive additional fear and anxiety Inappropriate collection use and sharing of data The shift of childrens lives online including via education technology may result in the added collection and processing of childrens personal data by companies along with increased exposure to digital marketing content and techniques This may affect children under years of age who normally have privacy protection by law Limited child safeguarding online With the rush to set up distance learning schools may not have proper child safeguarding policies in place to govern student and teacher conversations via private networks and other online tools Parents and caregivers may not be aware of school district policies if they exist and may be unfamiliar with new technologies limiting their ability to engage their children in discussion about keeping safe online Governments companies schools and parents must work together to ensure that childrens online experiences are safe and positive In the context of COVID keeping children safe online will require concerted urgent action on the part of parents and caregivers school authorities digital technology companies providers social service workers and governments Empower children online Parents and caregivers school authorities digital technology companies media providers social service workers and governments must recognize that children are agents of change and should equip them with the knowledge and information they need to navigate their online lives safely during the COVID crisis and beyond Messages information and advice on navigating the digital world should be targeted to children in manner and via the channels that most resonate with them Children should also be informed about how to seek out help and support Children should also be encouraged to use their voices online to support others in need of help during this crisisChildrens perspectives should inform improvements to platforms and other changes intended to keep them engaged and safe during this quickly moving emergency Government and social service providers should incorporate childrens voices and actively involve children in policymaking that pretend them Support parents and caregivers to help children stay safe online Parents and caregivers can help children access the online resources that are vital for learning socializing and playing in the era of COVID At the same time parents and caregivers need to be alert to the online risks for children Governments companies and others should support parents with appropriate guidance and tools including how to respond to and if needed report harmful contacts conduct and content Parents and caregivers can establish with their children rules for how when and where the Internet can be used Boundaries should be set to establish healthy balance between online time and other activities Parents and caregivers should also ensure their childrens devices have the latest software updates and antivirus programmes and ensure that privacy settings are set to high For younger children tools such as parental controls can help mitigate online risks Parents and caregivers can discuss openly with their children how and with whom the children are communicating online Children need to know that kind and supportive interactions are expected and that hurtful discriminatory or inappropriate contact is never okay Children should feel confident about telling trusted adult immediately if anything distressing or inappropriate occurs Parents and caregivers can also help children differentiate between regular content and advertisements and engage in dialogue with their children to seek to counteract any negative messages Parents and caregivers can be alert to signs of distress that may emerge in connection with childrens online activity For example if child is experiencing cyberbullying they may give off warning signs such as using their device more or less frequently or becoming withdrawn or depressed Governments companies and school administrators should make parents and caregivers familiar with relevant policies as well as online and offline reporting mechanisms Parents should have the numbers of support helplines and hotlines handy and contact the police if their childrens distress is related to threats potential crimes or other illegal behaviors Provide safe online learning experience for students Schools should create or update their current safeguarding policies to reflect the new realities for children learning from home Oneonone online interactions between school staff and students should be transparent and regulated Specific safeguards may include requiring schools to share online schedules advising children to wear appropriate clothing when in front of webcams and not to connect with their teachers or virtual classrooms from bedrooms and refraining from using private instant messaging services in teacherstudent communications or asking for consent from parents for such sessions Schools should also seek digital security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individual are able to access online learning platforms and that those platforms do not record and store the virtual learning sessions by default Schools should clearly communicate online safety policies and provide resources and information on digital safety to support parents and caregivers in creating positive online learning experience eg Interland internetmattersorg NSPCC and Childnet International Schools should clearly communicate with all learners the expected code of conduct on digital platforms and communications just as would be expected for in person behavior They should promote and monitor good online behavior among students Schools should be aware that younger children in particular may not have developed or practiced these skills before and could unintentionally hurt others Schoolyard bullying among classmates may easily morph into cyberbullying and school authorities need to adapt antibullying rules and policies to online spaces and make them clear to students and parents Schools should ensure that children have uninterrupted access to schoolbased counseling services In the absence of inperson contact with counselors children in distress must have safe confidential means of securing support online or by phone There may be increased need for counselling services in the context of COVID where children may be experiencing family problems domestic violence or heightened feelings of insecurity and anxiety Girls children with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID may be experiencing increased anxieties requiring additional support Schools should promote countryspecific helplines or online counselling platforms Schools should also update guidance for teachers on identifying and reporting child abuse or neglect via their virtual communications Make online platforms safe and accessible for children In order to avoid exacerbating inequalities during the pandemic technology companies should work with governments to improve access to digital devices and internet connectivity for disadvantaged children including those who are affected by poverty separated on the move disabled in domestic and family violence settings conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary caregivers to the pandemic ITUs new Global Network Resiliency Platform REGCOVID is place for regulators government authorities and industry to share and pool experiences ongoing initiatives and innovative policy and regulatory measures designed to help ensure communities and children remain connected Technology companies should also make online learning resources available for free or at significantly reduced cost to educators and students Mobile operators should consider providing online learning resources and COVID health information for free It is imperative that increased safety features are incorporated into all devices including those being made available at low or no cost and that parents and caregivers are instructed how to activate these features Companies that are developing and deploying virtual classrooms and other educationspecific platforms should make sure that safety features are integrated and enhanced and clearly accessible to educators parents and students Data collection and other commercial practices should be transparent responsible and reflective of nationalinternational laws and regulations Social networking platforms used for teacherstudent interactions should employ builtin protection measures for children while giving adult teachers appropriate permissions to carry out their functions Furthermore online platforms using video conferencing services which are increasingly being used for online interactive sessions should ensure that relevant security and privacy protections are in place Companies should use their platforms to promote and facilitate child safety referral services and helplines for the estimated billion children and youth currently out of school some of whom may be at increased risk of psychosocial stress violence and exploitation This includes sharing information on referral and other support services available for youth such as national Child Helplines Companies can seek to increase child helpline capacity with cloudbased infrastructure and by leveraging Interactive Representative Response IVRbot systems to automate helpline queries Mobile operators should enable short codes or freeofcost calls waving interconnect charges and promoting referral and helpline resources to children Given that the pandemic is bringing younger children onto education and social networks some for the first time companies should make significant efforts to help them and their parents and caregivers learn to use online resources safely This includes Adapting online safety resources to different age groups and making these resources more accessible on their platforms to inform children parents and caregivers of online risks and provide access to support services Offering clearly signposted and easy to use technical tools and solutions eg parental controls which can empower parents and caregivers to help their children experience digital technology in an ageappropriate way Amplifying messaging on safe and responsible behaviour online and supporting children to develop digital resilience skills in other words knowledge of how to navigate and respond to risks Strengthening national prevention response and support services Governments should actively monitor how restricted movement and lockdowns may exacerbate different forms of violence both offline and online using the latest data and existing models to inform policy Governments should enforce existing regulations and strengthen law enforcement to help monitor and respond to increased online risks Governments should allocate sufficient resources to bolster train and equip core child protection workers to ensure that they can continue to keep children safe throughout the pandemic Wherever possible countries should maintain centerbased supports and home visiting for those severely affected or adapt and deliver social services virtually Governments should train health education and social service workers on the impacts that COVID may have on child wellbeing including increased online risks Those providing front line mental healthpsychosocial support will need skills in talking to children about COVID and addressing their anxiety and insecurity Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable children including those separated on the move disabled in conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary caregivers to the pandemic Government should be aware of the potential increased online risks to children during the pandemic and seek to address them through increased monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations Law enforcement should be supported to monitor potential increase in online offending behavior and have their units functional to respond to this Governments should make sure social service providers schools parents caregivers and children are aware of local reporting mechanisms and that they have the support numbers of local helplines and hotlines If they do not already exist local helplines and hotlines should be installed to support children in distress The major international reporting networks include INHOPE Hotlines and IWF portals Children can find direct support through the nationallybased Child Helpline The public should be directed to contact the police when there is imminent risk To complement efforts to connect children to resources for online learning socialization and play governments should step up educational initiatives on child online safety These should include raising awareness about online risks and resources using media and other communications channels to spread key messages Additional Resources Parenting tips on

['Authors Anita Ghimire Fiona Samuels and Samjhana Bhujel This brief is part of series of publications on adolescents working in adult entertainment in Nepal Findings on the lives of adolescent girls and boys working in the sector can be found in the accompanying report and crossborder sex work between India and Nepal is explored in this brief Overview While digital technology can help adolescents promote their rights access information and participate in society it also comes with risks of exploitation and abuse There is dearth of information on how adolescents working in the adult entertainment sector AES use the digital technology and its impact on their wellbeing This brief aims to bridge the information gap to safeguard vulnerable adolescents working in the AES from the negative impacts of technology use and help them to leverage technology for their protection The scale of the challenge Understanding how vulnerable adolescents use technology and what impact it will have on them will be important in helping build adolescents capabilities There is dearth of data on this for Nepal and this report aims to fill that gap by discussing technology use amongst adolescents working in the Adult Entertainment Sector sector where these adolescents are highly vulnerable to physical sexual economic and emotional violence Key recommendations NGOs should make more use of social media and digital technology to raise awareness among adolescents in Nepal about career counselling and risky jobs such as in the adult entertainment sector Digital literacy interventions for girls and boys in schools and for those working in the adult entertainment sector would reduce the risk of online exploitation Programmes should use social media to target hard to reach girls and boys in the AES and develop longterm cost effective interventions NGOsINGOs and the government should revise their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online sex work is captured

fasttrack social change for themselves their families and communities and their countries GAGEs research addresses two broad questions What do adolescents lives look like as they evolve over the second decade of life and how are their experiences gendered What impact have change strategies eg through programme interventions had on adolescents development adolescents will need to contribute more throughout their lives to support the ageing population the age group will become the largest group in years and will increase rapidly thereafter Technology use among adolescents in South Asia

Richardson et al Apart from three studies conducted recently by the Freedom Fund the use of digital technology in the AES and its implications for programming in Nepal has not been explored in any depth Most programmes fail to recognise the impact of digitalisation and focus solely on the establishmentbased AES Understanding technology use is critical to ensuring policies and programmes address issues faced by girls and boys in this rapidly changing industry Studies have included cases where children involved in the AES in Nepal have been asked to take photos and videos by their clients Sath Sath CWIN and ECPAT The internet also gives children access to pornographic images videos Additionally middleaged men send young girls and boys nude images on Facebook indicating online sexual exploitation of children Sath Sath The same study finds that menboys create fake profiles and online identities to establish relationships with girlswomen and lure them into sharing intimate pictures in order to blackmail them for money and sexResearch findings How adolescent girls use digital technology for work in the AES The majority of girls reported using social media for work although some prefer facetoface contact due to fears of online abuse Common apps include Facebook Messenger YouTube and imo while the use of Viber and Instagram according to key informants is increasing among young girls entering the sector There is general belief that being active on social media attracts more clients Little girl therefore share music videos photos and public posts to increase followers and while Facebook does not allow explicit content they also post sexual content Girls mostly own modern digital phones or smartphones laptops tablets and other devices were not commonly owned Apart from company profiles on Facebook girls post personal music videos photos TikTok videos or public group messages to increase followers Aside from those working in Dohari girls reported having two mobile phones and two Facebook accounts one for work and the other for family and nonwork friends Girls working in Dohari have only one account and the account is in their real name as they are on the lookout for contacts in the music industry to enhance their careers Girls who engage in the crossborder AES use Messenger to stay in contact with clients in India when they are working in Nepal Relationships with Nepali clients who travel for foreign employment are maintained through Facebook Viber and imo Maintaining contact ensures they send gifts and money remain loyal customers and engage their services when they come to Kathmandu While technology has not entirely dismantled establishmentbased AES venues it does offer alternative ways for girls to work and connect with clients This applies to commercial sex work as well Female migrants who travel for foreign employment also use apps that connect domestic workers to customers and integrate social sites like Facebook and Instagram to find clients for sex work have heard it internationally from journalists not in Nepal but there is an application called SALES where the middleman provides women domestic worker or even CSW to clients Key informant interview Kathmandu In their free time girls use the internet and their phones to keep in touch with family and friends back home as well as new friends in the urban areas where they work The girls watch videos on YouTube to improve their singing and dancing skills so that they can perform better at work They also reported making prank calls to random boys for funHow boys middlemen and employers use digital technology Boys who work in the AES do not have to attract clients as their jobs in the AES are usually in cooking security and administrative and financial work of the establishments Even if boys work as dancers and singers such as in Dohari and dance bars they are not pressured to bring in clients like the girls For details see our accompanying report They therefore use Facebook for personal communication Middlemen and employers use social media and digital technology to recruit new girls and move them between employers and clients including for crossborder international adult entertainment work The middlemen who supply girls communicate with them through social media to offer them jobs As they earn higher commission for younger girls they are constantly incentivised to recruit young girls into the industry They do this by adding village girls on Facebook communicating with them regularly and luring them to urban areas to work in the adult entertainment industry Employers also use digital technology to live stream videos and post photos of celebrities models and artists to attract girls and boys to work in the industry and clients to their establishments Employers use technology to move girls between cities in Nepal to respond to the demand for fresh faces After girl has worked in city for few months the middleman or employer will connect her to client middlemen and employers in another city and send for replacement All these arrangements happen over the phone The same process is used for moving girls to India We also found that girls will invite their friends if they find the work is good in new location After few months they often move together to work in another hub Internet access among girls and boys working in the AES Access to the internet is mixed Although WiFi is often free at their place of work boys and girls are usually only allowed to use the internet to contact clients As explained above boys are usually not engaged in entertaining clients but have security and management roles and as such their use of the internet is not seen as necessary for bringing in customers unlike for girls Hence employers are strict about not letting boys use internet during their working hours For details see our accompanying report When not at work girls and boys either buy monthly data pack or use passwords to the Wifi given by fellow tenants They cannot afford unlimited home internet subscriptions Dohari are duet houses where groups of girls and boys sit opposite to one another and the lead sings duets The songs are flirty and conversational and are composed during the performance itself as an answer to the remark of the opposite group who takes the lead in singingOur employer will scold us if we use phones during work Boys mostly go to the restroom to use internet and mobile Once inside the restroom they play games on the mobiles or use Facebook Focus group discussion with boys working in dance clubs Kathmandu How girls in the AES communicate with clients Initial client conversations commonly take place via text message while illiterate girls use Messenger and imo Once the girls have met the clients few times they will video call or chat with them over Messenger It is common practice to have two SIM cardsphone numbers one personal the other for business to avoid family members hearing about their work Yes am afraid that parents will know about me When my husband comes to Kathmandu change my number have been using two SIM cards one is for my clients and the other one is for my family Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Kathmandu Clients forcing girls to share their phone numbers is common challenge for girls Employers also encourage girls not to refuse the clients Girls only share work numbers with trusted clients that they have met few times in case they end up harassing them or being impolite If they do not trust them but they are good source of income regular pay well important to the employer girls will offer to call them instead of sharing their numbers The contacts of trustworthy clients are saved to avoid fake and unwanted calls and their other nonwork number that is used to contact family members is not shared with clients even if they ask for it Yes am afraid that parents will know about me When my husband comes to Kathmandu change my number have been using two SIM cards one is for my clients and the other one is for my family Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work KathmanduI give them my number if the person seems nice If the person and his behaviour dont look nice dont give Interviewer Can you identify by looking Can you know their behaviour How do you know Some people are softspoken while some are very aggressive The aggressive people try to force us while the people with good habit will obey us Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Girls working in the AES establishments and freelance primarily use Messenger to communicate with clients As with mobile phones initial contact happens via text Once comfortable the girls switch to voice and video calls Girls with low literacy use Messenger voice calls When communicating via social media clients often request sexualised video calls involving flirting or the performance of sexual acts or private pictures Most girls were cautious about accepting calls or sharing sensitive content unless it was with regular trusted client However those who are open to sharing such contents perceive this as necessary to keep clients happy for their own financial benefit They also feel it is good for work and part of their duty to employers to accept such requests He asks me to send pictures and then send He sends his picture We then start to comment on each others picture Interviewer Do you do video call Yes do Interviewer Doesnt he ask you to show him your private pictures No he has not asked for that yet Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work JhapaGirls entering the AES who have completed secondary school tend to use imo and Viber instead of Facebook They believe these apps are safer as clients cannot contact them unless they have their number On Facebook one does not necessarily need phone number to call However if the clients have their numbers they can call them over Viber or imo unless the girls block them use Facebook and there are numerous people calling me on Messenger So usually prefer Viber and imo because strangers cannot directly contact without my phone number On Facebook the boys sometimes sent pictures of their private parts Focus group discussion with girls engaged in freelance sex work Sunsari Use of imo groups The study finds that imo groups are location specific Kathmandu Girls and Boys and Rodhi ghar Butwal duet singing house Butwal interest based lets chat with couple Indonesian and Philippines girls and Dohari or random Everyones dear and fun group Anyone can join these groups Some are international while others have only local members Fake accounts were active in all the imo groups looked at review of the messages in group chats finds that conversations are flirty usually have double meanings and include the exchange of sensitive and sexual images Any user can start private chat from group chat Requests for private chats with girls are common It seems that clients make contact with girls through groups and then move on to private chats to negotiate sex meeting timeplace and payment The study finds that imo groups used by sex workers appear to have been created by girls as administrators However key informants were of the opinion that men or boyfriends who work as middlemen often open and operate the groups using girls name Invitations are sent to boys who in turn invite their male peers increasing the size of the group Typically an administrator will connect group to several other groups to expand their networks and connect users to new groups give them my number if the person seems nice Some people are softspoken while some are very aggressive The aggressive people try to force us while the people with good habit will obey us Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa usually prefer Viber and imo because strangers cannot directly contact without my phone number On Facebook the boys sometimes sent pictures of their private parts Focus group discussion with girls engaged in freelance sex work SunsariYouTube and online TV channels Our analysis of YouTube channels owned by girls working as freelance sex workers finds that girls upload video interviews photos and contact information to publicise their work and attract new clients Online TV channels such as Pulchowki Media also provide links to sex work The channel was closed and the owners arrested in for paying girls for highly sexualised scripted interviews The government has also closed YouTube channels which show restricted pornographic content Positive impacts of digital technology on sex workers For girls and boys working in Dohari social media gives them exposure and way to showcase their talent They join professional groups like National Dohari Association on Facebook to connect with people who might progress their careers They believe that this opens avenues to participate in Dohari programmes in other cities or abroad Similarly girls feel that YouTube has helped them improve their dancing and singing skills through watching new films helping them perform better at work In Jhapa we found freelance sex workers from relatively wealthy families who were influenced to enter into sex work through friendship circles used technology to exclude middlemen once they had established relationships with few welloff clients This gives them the freedom to choose clients as well as increase their earnings First the girls meet groups of clients through hotel staff or middlemen who work in hotels One they have worked with group they then make personal arrangements instead of using middleman with selected clients This can increase their income considerably as expressed by one girl make around lakhs in month if save Interviewer In one month You make that much money In the job Yes Interviewer Do you go around Figure typical active imo group linked to the AES by age group Source AnitaGhimireNISER Box Case study NGO uses social media to reach sex workers In Jhapa and Sunsari NGOs are updating their engagement strategies and using technology to reach girls who may otherwise have been excluded from programmes Here NGOs are using social media to target women and girls with health and awareness campaigns Sahara Nepal national NGO based in Jhapa that works with vulnerable groups noticed decrease in establishmentbased sex work that women and girls were soliciting in digital spaces In response they trained staff to identify and join social networks used by sex workers

and subsequently provide information via webchat Sex workers who previously did not want to identify themselves now come to dropin centres Based on insights from joining these networks Sahara Nepal offered HIV testing in the community to enable sex workers to be discreetly tested in their own home This resulted in considerable increase in people accessing HIV tests and key informants feel that this has reduced the gap between the estimated and actual numbers of people living with HIV in Nepal No its through the contact So the thing is at first came in contact with one hotel where used to do business with people per day collected guest from that process Before they used give to the broker and to us Now with the same guest get or Interviewer How do you do it yourself Through your mobile Yes Interviewer How do you make contact Can you please tell me in detail tell them that am available outside the hotel They take my number and call me later Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Some girls have used mobile phone to escape trafficking forced sex work by calling the police According to key informants girls also use phones to call their contacts in NGOS for help if the police arrest them or treat them badly Negative impacts of the internet and technology on sex workers The study finds social media has several negative impacts particularly for girls According to key informants it widens girls social circles connecting them to new peer groups who lead them into sex work Similarly social media has made it cheaper and easier for middlemen to reach out and befriend girls assess their lives see if they are destitute and lure them into sex employment Social media makes it easier for men to track girls down online They find out their names in Dohari restaurants or dance bars when they perform on stage Unlike other girls performers in Dohari in particular use their real names on Facebook so that music producers can easily find them They subsequently feel forced to accept unsolicited friendship requests from men for the sake of business or pushed by their employers This opens up avenues for abuse by clients including unwelcome calls messages and pornographic content Similarly in adult entertainment venues girls are under pressure to attract as many clients as possible Even if they initially resist we found they end up sharing numbers and social contacts making them vulnerable to future online abuse Social media also gives clients continuous access to girls Respondents said that clients send pornographic videos out of working hours They feel pressured to respond even if they are not working and spending time with family Some girls were followed by clients even after they had left the sector to get married and eventually the marriages ended when the husbands and their families came to know about their previous engagement in the AES Access to technology has changed the needsaspirations of clients as well as the range of services they expect For example clients used to only have contact with girls inside establishments Now they expect them to always be available including during outofwork hours As girls are not allowed to use their phones at work this can create tension with regular clients who feel ignored They become hostile send vulgar images and videos or threaten them via instant messaging services We also found that social media increases the risk of exploitation from intimate partners Boyfriendshusbands use social media to coerce girls into sex work and extort their earnings According to the girls their partners open accounts in their name and negotiate with clients forcing them to provide the agreed services This can be under harsh conditions such as sex with multiple people at the same time Girls often only become aware of these accounts much later and thus also suffer the emotional violence of betrayal by people close to them Some girls feel freelance sex work and advertising online is dangerous and could risk exposure They find it safer working in establishments like hotels and using middlemen who offer protection and negotiate with clients on their behalf didnt give him my number even though he was regular customer If he wants to meet me he can come here but dont want to take risk meeting him outside If meet him at the hotel the owner is responsible if something happens to me but if meet him outside who will be responsible Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa Girls who leave the sector are constantly afraid that their boyfriends or husbands will find out about their former work in the sex industry using the internet Key informants said that for single mothers the fear that their children and the parents of their childrens partners will find out about their sex work is strong motivation to change jobs Technology makes it possible to find out someones work history long after the event major fear among women who have left the sector Before they used give to the broker and to us Now with the same guest get or Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work JhapaThey women who have now left the sector say things like Now my daughter is married worked as sex worker so could bring them up What will happen to her life if her inlaws find that her mother was doing such work So left the sector Key informant interview Jhapa Boys who engage in substance abuse also use social media to exploit girls Key informants who helped file cases against violent partners shared that boys who abuse substances entice girls into relationships via social media to extort money for drugs They film sex videos with the girls and threaten to post them online or expose their work as sex workers boy made video of my friend He hasnt posted it on Facebook yet She was telling that he has clicked her pictures too Interviewer Why do they make videos What type of people are they Are they married people The drug addict boys make that videos Interviewer What do they do with the videos Do they blackmail girls or what do they do Yes They do so to get money Indepth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex work Jhapa In Kathmandu girls working in establishments said that they are forced to share explicit images to attract clients to the establishment Those engaged in freelance sex work also send images to attract and keep clients In Jhapa and Sunsari where all respondents were freelance sex workers sharing pictures and doing video calls seems to be common This might make girls more vulnerable to abuse by middlemen and clients Some girls who have attended NGO trainings talk about their right to privacy and said they refuse to send videos to clients We can see therefore that girls have certain amount of power and control in their negotiation with clients However we are not sure if in practice girls can keep up with the pressure from clients and their own financial needs This is may be result of awareness training and female empowerment interventions We tell the clients in very straightforward manner that it is not the place to take selfies and we would not allow it After that if they want to spend time with us they can or else just leave client was taking video in his mobile Instantly went near him and seized his mobile then slapped him Indepth interview with girl engaged in sex work Jhapa client was taking video in his mobile Instantly went near him and seized his mobile then slapped him Indepth interview with girl engaged in sex work Jhapa Antitrafficking checkpoint at NepalIndia border NISERConclusions and recommendations As in other parts of the world technology is increasingly being used in Nepals adult entertainment industry and is changing its structure and how the AES is organised mediated particularly in relation to sex work All girls and boys working in the sector have access to mobile phones and the internet Facebook Messenger and imo are the most commonly used apps while younger and more educated workers increasingly use Viber Instagram and YouTube Technology has changed the nature of client interaction opened up new avenues for girls who are looking to enter the industry and has facilitated crossdistrict and cross border sex work It is also used outside of work to keep in touch with family and friends Girls typically have two SIM cards and two Facebook accounts to keep their families from finding out about their work The positive effects of technology for sex workers include the decreased influence of middlemen and greater decisionmaking powers and sometimes income Girls use technology to limit exposure to abusive clients and dangerous situations Programmes have also started using technology to target freelance sex workers who tend to be hard to reach On the negative side it has made the recruitment of adolescents into sex work cheaper and easier exposed adolescents working in the sector to pornography opened up avenues for middlemen and sexual partners to exploit girls and has made it difficult for girls to establish family life once they have left the industry The research also finds that technology pushes more adolescents into sex work as middlemen have increased access to girls online In addition girls and boys become curious about joining the sector after seeing online ads and live videos produced by adult venues Technology has not totally displaced establishmentbased sex work but it has expanded the scope of the adult entertainment sector and the volume of sex work Recommendations for donors civil society and NGOs include the following As technology use is widespread it can be leveraged to raise awareness of the risks associated with entering the adult entertainment sector and promote alternatives such as encouraging young girls to stay in education or take vocational training Digital literacy classes for girls and boys working in this sector as well as those in school would help raise awareness of the risk of exploitation online and promote safety precautions Programmes should use social media to target hard to reach sex workers who are at increased risk from clients middlemen and partners ie those who do not work in establishments are not unionised and are not linked to NGOs Lessons should be taken from programmes already engaged in such activities NGOsINGOs and the government should revise their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online sex work is captured Their interventions should also shift from targeting girls who work in establishments to account for the growing trend of girls working on freelance basis using personal contacts NGOs have expressed the need for longterm commitment and resources for successful reintegrationrehabilitation of former sex workers Technology could provide lowcost dissemination and programming solutions to maximise existing resources Current training programmes are overly focused on running beauty parlours and tailor shops These should be broadened to cover other skills such as hotel management driving and mobile phone and TV repairs to provide instant jobs and encourage young people to find alternatives to

focus on western and developed countries Where countrylevel pre valence data or largescale research exists rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and nonwestern countries than their western and developed counterpartsObjective We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their ectiveness Methods Following PRISMA guidelines we conducted systematic search of six databases and identied eight studies to include in our analysis Results Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on pre school and primary schoolaged children Most have focused on interventions delivered in edu cational settings with lack of focus on populationlevel interventions to prevent child sexual abuse Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self protection and helpseeking not deployment of those skills actual reduction in prevalence ofCSA or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contextsConclusions If the focus on schoolbased strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries signi cant gap in knowledge of the ecacy of populationlevel inter ventions outside of school contexts and consistency across the application of interventions willremain Evaluations are needed that address the cacy of broader governmentled or wholeof community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse or thatcan link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization Introduction Child sexual abuse CSA is global social problem with growing research and media attention Many researchers in developed countries have investigated prevalence rates Mathews et al risk and protective factors Kaufman et al and prevention strategies Morley Higgins to mitigate the occurrence of CSA particularly within the context of youthserving organizations Concern regarding the signi cant issue of CSA has begun to be echoed by research in developing and nonwestern lowtomiddle income countries in recent years Abeid Muganyizi Massawe Mpembeni Darj et al AlSaif et al Plummer Njuguna Veenema Thornton Corley Although some authors refer to lowtomiddle income countries we use the term August Received in revised form January Accepted January Corresponding author Email address RussellChild Abuse Neglect Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Tdeveloping countries based on the nomenclature set out in the UN country classi cation United Nations The World Health Organization WHO de ned CSA as the involvement of child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend is unable to give informed consent to or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent or that violates the laws or social taboos of society Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in relationship of responsibility trust or power the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person World Health Organisation It is also widely accepted that the de nition of sexual abuse includes both contact and noncontact forms of abuse Kloppen Haugland Svedin Maehle Breivik Mathews CollinVezina Numerous systematic reviews exist of research on topics related to CSA such as prevalence rates Barth Bermetz Heim Trelle Tonia Pereda Guilera Forns GomezBenito Stoltenborgh BakermansKranenburg Alink van Ijzendoorn risk factors Putnam Whitaker et al and the ectiveness of di erent prevention strategies Letourneau Schae er Bradshaw Feder Walsh Zwi Woolfenden Shlonsky These reviews however have largely focused on research conducted in developed countries Therefore our aim here is to focus on what research evidence is available about CSA preventioneorts in developing countries and identify implications for improving prevention orts globally Many developing countries have begun implementing laws with local and international nongovernment organizations supporting the prevention of CSA In recent years developing countries have broadly adopted policies and laws that directly and formally address violence against children including sexual abuse United Nations This has been achieved through national plans of action on children the inclusion of children protection from sexual violence in broad child protection initiatives and the devel opment of speci national agendas on violence against children United Nations In recent years more than countries have adopted di erent types of action plans for children United Nations However there are varying degrees of comprehensiveness with approximately of countries surveyed by the UN not fully adopting laws to protect children against all form of violence Since Angola Bolivia the Dominican Republic Ecuador Kenya Montenegro Serbia and South Sudan have adopted or amended their constitutions to include prohibition on violence against children United Nations Regarding sexual violence the United Nations noted that signi cant progress has been made in recent years on legislation against sexual abuse and exploitation of children Of the member states of the United Nations that responded to the UNs Global Survey highlighted that prohibition on sexual exploitation of children including prostitution is in place These initiatives are promising considering the high prevalence rates of CSA in developing countries However holisticapproach to understanding the right policy mix for CSA is warranted This systematic literature review of CSA in developing countries is the rst step toward more researchinformed and targeted policy development ects of child sexual abuse The eects of CSA have been found to be both immediate and long term In childhood researchers have identi ed eects including cognitive impacts Barrera Calderon Bell mental health including depression anxiety Olafson Wurtele and posttraumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation Cashmore Shackel Fergusson Boden Horwood Longterm ects into adulthood include mental ill health Amado Arce Herraiz Fergusson et al Lindert et al as well as detrimental impact on individuals adult roles such as employment parenting education and relationships de Jong Alink Bijleveld Finkenauer Hendriks Despite the risk of child sexual abuse being lower for males than females although not necessarily in institutions see Quadara Nagy Higgins Siegel the ects of CSA on men have been widely researched One reason for this apart from the need to understand the lifelong ects of abuse for male survivors is fears of cycle of abuse based on the fact that the majority of adult child sexual enders and adolescents with harmful or concerning sexual behaviors are male Plummer Cossins These issues may be of more concern in developing countries that have patriarchal societal norms CSA has vicarious ects on families and communities Blakemore Herbert Arney Parkinson which could be ex acerbated in societies that emphasize the needs of group members and place importance on interconnectedness between societal members over individual priorities due to the value placed on community engagement Such lifelong ects for male and female victims coupled with concerning prevalence rates globally indicates the need to have ective interventions policies or strategies targeted at the prevention of child sexual abuse for both boys and girls in developed and developing countries Prevalence Few countries have good prevalence data Mathews et al Where prevalence data do exist they are usually expressed as range given the disparate de nitions methodologies and data reporting mechanisms employed in studies Many researchers as well as international development organizations also suggest that CSA rates are consistently underestimated due to the inherent chal lenges of disclosure and reporting Kloppen et al Radford Corral Bradley Fisher Recent metaanalyses have estimated global rates of CSA to be between for boys and for girls Pereda et al Stoltenborgh et al Where data are available strong contrast exists between developed and developing countries in terms of prevalence data Studies from developed countries show lower prevalence rates for boys and higher for girls compared to developing countries ForD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect example prevalence in Scandinavia is reported to be between and for boys and between and for girls Kloppen et al in Japan for boys and for girls for nonpenetrative CSA Tanaka Suzuki Aoyama Takaoka MacMillan and in the United States for boys and for girls Finkelhor Shattuck Turner Hamby This considerable international variability may be explained at least in part by gender di erences in prevalence of CSA in the two key contexts in which it occurs organizational vs familial abuse As Quadara et al noted Child sexual abuse occurring within institutional settings including residential care education sporting or religious organi zations generally see higher rates of boys being victims of abuse than girls however girls are victims of teacherstudent sexual abuse at higher rate than boys Knoll Moulden Firestone Kingston Wexler Sullivan Beech Generally sexual abuse committed by educators occurs at similar rate globally In recognition of the negative ects of segregated institutional care and the bene ts of familybased care progressive de institutionalization of many care environments in western countries has occurred such as homebased services to replace psychiatric institutions and segregated homes for children and adults with disability and mental illness eg see Torrey and the de velopment of foster care and kinship care in the child protection system to replace children orphanages Innocenti Research Centre Given such institutional care for children has been associated with high levels of neglectful and abusive behaviour including child sexual abuse this might then lead to di erent gender mix in overall prevalence of CSA in developed compared to developing countries Based on the limited research that does exist prevalence rates in developing countries paint poorer picture than is the case for developedwestern countries For example Croatia has an overall prevalence of Ajdukovi ac Rajter Rates are even higher for countries in Asia Africa and South America with rates of in Saudi Arabia AlEissa et al between Zolotor et al and Kacker Varadan Kumar in India in Colombia in Russia Zolotor et al and for boys and for girls in Tanzania Abeid Muganyizi Mpembeni Darj Axemo In some cases these rates may be comparable to data from developed countries however data from developing countries are often not able to be disaggregated by gender In other cases there is distinct and concerningly higher rates in many developing and nonwestern lowto middle income countries which has led to investigations of not only shared risk factors globally but also speci cultural and contextual risk factors in these localities Risk factors Although much of the research on risk factors has occurred in developed western countries similar factors have been identi ed across range of developing countries including Indonesia Pakistan and many African countries Ali Ali Khuwaja Nanji Bridgewater Meinck Cluver Boyes Mhlongo Rumble et al In addition to the general risk factors associated with CSA see Kaufman et al Putnam developing countries face speci risk factors due to their context These contextual di erences are associated with the strong communitycentric thinking of many societies in developing countries Meinck Cluver Boyes LoeningVoysey Plummer Njuguna and the economic situations faced by individuals families and communities World Health Organization Research suggests these contextual risk factors play more signi cant role in the risk of CSA occurring than the individual or familylevel factors prominent in both developed and developing countries Plummer Njuguna These contextual risks include the patriarchal nature within communities Whitehead Ro ee stereotyped and discriminatory gender norms Bridgewater and the perceived role of children within tribal communities Plummer Njuguna Exacerbation of risk factors as result of the absence of governance processes the absence of screening mechanisms to identify those who have already ended against children and poor adultchild supervision ratios Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse provide additional credence to the higher prevalence rates in developing countries Prevention recent shift in how to address the issue of child sexual abuse has seen an increase in the desire to prevent abuse before it occurs rather than focus on better responses once CSA has already occurred in order to reduce the likelihood of harm and ongoing trauma Letourneau et al Levine Dandamudi This shift has required an investigation into how those outside of law en forcement responsible for responding after CSA has occurred can play role in preventing abuse from occurring in the rst place CSA has been widely cited as public health problem Letourneau Brown Fang Hassan Mercy Mathews Numerous researchers have suggested that populationlevel prevention initiatives ie public health approach are the best way toprevent CSA including researchers from both Englishspeaking western countries Letourneau Eaton Bass Berlin Moore McMahon Puett and developing countries Skeen Tomlinson Veenema et al Public health approaches recognize that prevention occurs at three levels Primary before it occurs secondary when risks are evident and tertiary after harm has occurred to ameliorate its impact and prevent future harm Quadara et al Due to the community and macrolevel approaches utilised in public health approach models it is often led at the governmental or national level Herrenkohl Lonne Scott Higgins However WHO noted that no national plans to prevent CSA existed across South East Asian countries raising questions as to whether any populationlevel initiatives were being applied in developing countries The target of primary CSA prevention activity can range from individuals through to wholeof community interventions Interventions such as delivery of CSA prevention education or protective behaviors programs Quadara et al are focused onD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect the individual knowledge and skill of children and young people to understand their bodies their right to safety and how to seek help if confronted with concerning or abusive behaviour at the earliest possible opportunity On the other hand communitylevel pre vention initiatives such as parenteducation strategies are typically largescale governmentled initiatives reaching much larger audiences To complement the focus on the knowledge attitudes and skills of individuals more recently there has been stronger focus on situational and cultural risk factors in youthserving organizations and other community settings Kaufman Erooga Higgins Zatkin Morley Higgins Prevention initiatives need to be comprehensive considering not only the broad range of risk factors but also the potential sources of protective strategies Although there is good evidence for the ectiveness of prevention strategies to address other forms of familial child maltreatment such as homevisiting during the prenatalinfancy period seeHolzer Higgins Brom eld Richardson Higgins there is no available evidence to show that such generic family support initiatives are ective at preventing CSA Prevention initiatives also need to be targeted to the unique risks for CSA As well as strategies to increase skills awareness and obligations of individual childrenyoung people and their parentscaregivers safety concerns also need to be ad dressed at macrosocietal level These strategies should be focused on equipping large numbers of young people with skills to resist thus increasing the ort required of enders to engage in ending behavior training adult workers who work in youth serving organizations to better understand the risk factors and signs and how to implement situational risk mitigation to addressprevent or interrupt grooming behaviour and increasing obligations surrounding reporting of child sexual abuse and those who engage in potentially grooming behavior eg see Pagesexpolitationgroomingaspx Systematic reviews of prevention methods in western and developed countries such as that by Walsh et al have con tinued to support the development of programs and strategies to prevent child sexual abuse within these countries Training programssuch as the Child Abuse School Liaison program Hanson et al and the Enough Preventing Child Sexual Abuse in My School online training program Gushwa Bernier Robinson have shown positive results in improving knowledge and skills related to preventing child sexual abuse Whether such improvements in knowledge lead to reduction in actual occurrence of child sexual abuse is debated in the literature Walsh et al With the identi cation of speci contextual risk factors in developing countries some researchers have begun looking at the ectiveness of prevention methods at the individual country level in developing and nonwestern countries We are not aware of any existing review of evaluations of CSA prevention strategies being applied in de veloping countries However knowledge of what prevention strategies are available and their ectiveness in preventing CSA is needed to support the work of researchers practitioners and policy makers wanting to improve the safety and wellbeing of childrenand young people globally Many western countries have had formal inquiries and government reviews and in response many prevention activities have been implemented through regulation by government as well as voluntarily by organizations and the nature of youthserving organizations having changed radically through major process of deinstitutionalization of disability and child welfare services Innocenti Research Centre Torrey It is important now to see what the application of these lessons might be for developing countries where there may not have been governmentled review of system failures and where greater proportion of the population of children are spending time in institutional care of the kind subject to these inquiries Our aim is to systematically review the available evidence on the ectiveness of CSA prevention strategies in developing countries The research question that guided the analysis is What type of sexual abuse prevention interventions or initiatives are being implemented in developing countries and are they ective In conducting this review our aim is to better understand the types of prevention strategies that ectively support individuals organizations and communities in these countries We hope to highlight best practice knowledge gaps and implementation gaps where we may have good evidence of ectiveness but limited takeup of interventions in relation to prevention of CSA and to identify implications for how best to support the safety of children and young people in developing countries from sexual abuse Method To guide

the eight studies included in this review as well as considering the results of each study we focused on the methodology and design study characteristics including year and size of study sample population age gender etc and the country of research Data were extracted using an Excel spreadsheet based on the Cochrane Public Health Group Data Extraction and Assessment Template Using these data indirect comparisons where interventions used in separate studies are compared were made to identify what types of interventionsinitiativesstrategies are being used in developing countries to prevent CSA and howeective these interventions are when considering the outcomes measured in each individual study Findings Overview of studies Two studies were from Africa ve were from Asia and one from Latin America All the studies reviewed used quantitative methodology using quasiexperimental or experimental designs Three studies were largescale over participants whereas the remaining six were smallscale studies Only one study Citak Tunc et al made reference to any funding provided for the research which was provided by university scienti research projects management unit This is not to say the other research or indeed interventions weren provided funding but this was not explicitly stated within the research articles All but one study included both male and female participants Across the studies interventions were implemented by range of people includingteachers nurses trained facilitators and childrenyoung people themselves We now describe which groups of participants were the focus of attention within the studies the types of interventions and whether they were focused on evaluating cacy of those interventions Participants As can be seen in Table most research on interventions to support the prevention of child sexual abuse in developing countries has been focused on younger children either in primary school Dunn Fitriana Suryawati Zubaidah Hurtado Katz Ciro Guttfreund Nosike Neherta Machmud Damayanti Afrizal or preschool Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al One study focused on increasing the sexual abuse prevention knowledge of children living with disability Kucuk Platin Erdem One evaluated program that supported women and children at risk of sexual abuse Sinclair et al Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect Types of interventions Most of the interventions used within the studies included in this review focused on improving children knowledge of what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate touching and selfe cacy to act ie to speak up and seek help if hypothetically they were exposed to an abusive behaviour Many of these educational interventions included the use of story books and other devel opmentally appropriate materials One study focused on improving selfdefense capabilities in young people and three utilized one of two intervention programs developed overseas in western countries Within the literature included in this review there was evidence of only one investigation into the cacy of largescale governmentled intervention to prevent CSA in developing country Dunn Similarly there was little evidence of inter ventions that went beyond just increasing knowledge andor skills of children and young people regarding how to stay safe from potential abuse Such studies have been questioned in relation to whether they contribute to decrease in actual CSA victimization not just an increase in knowledge or skills Walsh et al What was evident through this review was the orts by researchers to use strong methodologies such as

These measures included the What if Situations Test Wurtele Hughes Owens the Personal Safety Questionnaire Wurtele Gillispie Currier Franklin Neglect and the Children Knowledge of Abuse QuestionnaireRevised Tutty Sinclair et al was the only study we identied that used incidence rates in both an intervention and control group to measure the reduction in sexual abuse as result of the intervention being tested while the remaining studies used their own outcome measure developed for the study with no re porting on reliability or validity of the measure Discussion The aim of this systematic review was to understand the state of primary prevention strategies being used and evaluated in developing countries We identify the nature of child sexual abuse prevention strategies and interventions in developing countries understand the typical settings and population groups in which intervention strategies are being used to investigate the ectiveness of the interventions used Nature of prevention policies and interventions In the few interventions outlined in the research papers included in this review most prevention work is targeted at the local level typically in education settings for children at preschool and primary school These interventions focused on improving chil drens understanding of their bodies appropriate and inappropriate touch and who they could reach out to if they have concerns about someone behavior Given the reach of school systems these interventions could be classi ed as being based on public health approach to primary prevention Herrenkohl et al Numerous researchers Letourneau et al Quadara et al have discussed the importance of utilizing public health approach to prevent child sexual abuse As it involves both policy setting andcommunitywide activities such as awareness raising and behavior change strategies public health strategies are typically led at the national or state government level Of the studies included in this review only one study was governmentled intervention Dunn Two studies Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al focused on an intervention the Body Safety Training Pro gram developed in the US in the mids and revised in and which has been tested for cacy when compared to control groups and other intervention options see Wurtele Saslawsky Miller Marrs Britcher Wurtele Kast MillerPerrin Kondrick Both studies discussed the translation of the program into the respective language of the participants Mandarin and Turkish using psychologists educators and other experts to support the translation of either the entire program or the key titles The use of western interventions in developing countries comes with advantages and disadvantages On the one hand these pro grams have often been evaluated in experimental trials and been found to enhance knowledge about sexual abuse and protective skills On the other hand it is yet to be investigated whether sexual abuse prevention programs developed and shown to be cacious in one cultural or social context can be as ective in di erent cultural or social context Considering the use of Body Safe Training Program westerndeveloped locallevel intervention in these two studies it is reasonable to consider that an expansion of interventions in developing countries could include westerndeveloped community andsocietallevel interventions Already there has been orts to introduce child maltreatment prevention strategies from western developed countries such as parent education and early home visiting however these were not identi ed through our literature search because they are broader in their goals and not designed to speci cally to prevent CSA and no data exist to demonstrate their ecacy at reducing the risk of CSA These kinds of societal and communitylevel interventions would most likely be based on governmentled prevention policies in developed countries but would have to take into consideration the cultural factors relevant to the context in which interventions were being implemented Typical settings and population groups Although the eight studies re ected variety of intervention types speci information was not always available Where it was schoolbased interventions or interventions delivered by teachers were the most common This trend has been previously noted within the wider literature Letourneau et al Evidence of the ectiveness of schoolbased interventions aimed at preventing CSAlargely in developed countries has been identi ed through recent systematic review Walsh et al However Walsh et al questioned whether children gains in knowledge and skills translates to an actual reduction in CSA This has implications for developing countries where not all baby are in school The outofschool rate in primary schoolaged children in lowincomecountries is relative to in their highincome counterparts the lower secondary outofschool rate is and respectively Of children not attending school globally approximately are from developing countries UNESCO Vul nerable groups such as poor girls are more likely to be out of school Mertaugh Jimenez Patrinos Thus there is agreement that public health model including populationlevel prevention strategies and situational prevention approach would be better placed to improve prevention of child sexual abuse across di erent settings Kaufman Erooga Higgins Zatkin Quadara However we did not identify any populationlevel interventions within the search parameters of this review With so fewD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect studies meeting the criteria we set concern regarding the ectiveness of programs to reduce the high rates of CSA in developing countries is warranted Most interventions in developing countries appear to focus on very young children The development and empirical in vestigation of interventions aimed at preschool aged children is warranted considering the research showing that children under the age of seven constitute signi cant proportion of CSA victims Finkelhor The intervention most used in developing countries for children this age identi ed in our review is the Body Safety Training program Wurtele et al evaluated by two of the papers Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al We were non able to uncover any peerreviewed evaluation work conducted by any NGO in this review Despite many interna tional aid and development agencies recognizing the importance of child protection in their work it was surprising to see no published evaluations of the cacy of such programs This could be because assessing outcomes as opposed to delivering in itiatives is not as highly valued the di culties in translating evaluation results for peerreview publication or the general challenges of outcome evaluation designs makes such an activity very di cult Intervention cacy in developing countries Overall the studies provided positive picture about the ectiveness of the interventions in increasing abuse prevention knowledge and when tested the selfe cacy of children and young people to take protective action should they encounter an unsafe situation All six studies that measured knowledge andor skills showed signi cant improvements in participants capabilities The evidence suggests that interventions that aim to improve young people knowledge andor skills regarding keeping themselves safe can be successful in that goal however researchers have not gone further to measure whether that increased knowledge andorskill in the longer term leads to decrease in sexual abuse victimization as result Such evidence would be di cult to obtain without strong existing country or regional prevalence data or at least incidence data for CSA reported to authorities against which tocompare Considering the average delay between abuse and disclosure of CSA is estimated to be in the order of years Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse this is signi cant barrier to comprehensive evaluation of current prevention orts The studies included in our review give evidence that range of individuals both professional and peers can support the improvement of sexual abuse prevention knowledge in young people As prevalence and incidence are notoriously di cult to measure in relation to child sexual abuse Mathews et al it is perhaps not surprising that only one study within the scope of this review used incidence rates to measure success Sinclair et al Incidentally in that study rates of sexual abuse dropped signi cantly as result of the intervention In the months following participation in the program sexual assault incidence rates showed statistically signi cant reduction within the intervention group of The control group saw no change in incidence rates across the same time Verbal defense skills were identi ed as the rst skill learned followed by physical selfdefense skills The authors attributed the decline in incidence for the intervention group to this They acknowledged that if CSA did occur the intervention group would also be more likely to disclose that assault had occurred noting that this opened the door to potential support and intervention Sinclair et al The results from developing countries con rm what has also been shown in developed countries that prevention strategies focused on knowledge can ectively increase the sexual safety knowledge and skills of young children However there is lack of evidence that supports the link between an increase in knowledge and decrease in incidence of CSA Walsh et al This lack of evidence is not because of lack of data to show no relationship but because of the absence of an agreed proxy outcome measure and the di culty in tracking actual incidence of CSA particularly in the absence of national prevalence or representative surveillance data on sexual abuse incidence in most countries The challenge of attributing direct outcomes to preventionoriented policies and interventions apply equally in developed and developing countries Mathews et al Seven of the eight studies focused on acquisition of knowledge andor skills as the primary outcome measure Only one evaluation Sinclair et al looked at the implementation of that knowledge the con dence and selfe cacy of participants to take action based on knowledgeskill or other emotional factors that might in uence implementation of the knowledge gained Few studies followedup with participants One study Dunn that measured knowledge gains conducted followup tests after six weeks The study that measured disclosures of child sexual abuse and rape Sinclair et al collected postintervention data after months Other than these followup procedures there were no followup studies that examined the retention of knowledge use of skills or changes in con dence over time State of knowledge of CSA primary prevention activities in developing countries The number of experimental or quasiexperimental designs is major strength of the approach being taken by researchers in developing countries to evaluate the ectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing CSA Most of the studies had random allo cation to intervention and control groups with some utilizing prepost evaluation design measuring the intended outcomes bothbefore and after intervention One of the key weaknesses of the research we identi ed is the lack of comparative analysis of two or more programs using the same implementation protocol and outcomes evaluation strategy Currently no data exist to suggest whatworks better All that can be said given the range of speci intervention programs is that prevention knowledge and skills canbe taught and achieve statistically signi cant increases in children knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts in developing country contexts as has been seen in western Englishspeaking research on schoolbased interventions second key weakness is the lack of outcome variables measured in research investigating CSA prevention strategies Most research regarding the cacy of interventions has focused on the increase of children prevention knowledge and skills Investigation into the conditions of safetyD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect that support situational crime prevention approach to preventing child sexual abuse could be gained by measuring additional variables such as children perceptions of safety within settings where abuse can potentially occur Moore McArthur Heerde Roche OLeary the safeguarding capabilities of sta and volunteers working with children and young people Russell Higgins or parent carer and family empowerment and awareness of CSA prevention being used in organizations and within the community Conclusion Safeguarding children from CSA has continued to receive increasing attention globally due to high incidence and prevalence rates While developed countries such as the US Australia and countries across Europe have years experience researching and de veloping interventions to prevent CSA developing countries have only seen empirical evaluation of the ectiveness of such in terventions in the past decade Although data are limited as developing countries appear to have higher prevalence of CSA compared to developed and western countries it is heartening to see that schoolbased prevention interventions can result in increased knowledge and skills for children in these countries Despite the importance assigned to safeguarding activities by international aid organizations however there is scant evidence in English language peerreview journals of rigorous quality evaluations of the policies and related intervention strategies they can or do employ when working in developing countries Although there are considerable orts internationally to prevent CSA that exist however they have not been subject to empirical evaluation and the ndings published in peerreview journals The sizeable gap between the prevention orts and the formal research evaluating their ectiveness suggests an area of focus for funding and further research orts to understand whether and how such prevention initiatives are or are not ective in their goal of preventing CSA in developing and nonwestern lowto middle income countries Considering the global scale and growing interest in addressing the problem of CSA it is disappointing to have not found more evidence of largescale governmentled initiatives to combat this abuse in developing countries Compared to developed nations fewevaluations of governmentled initiatives or institutional standard practices such as curriculum have been undertaken in developing countries It is given that individual nations hope to make di erence and reduce CSA but further work and the requisite funding is needed to apply rigorous public health approach with an evaluation component Most programs being evaluated in developing countries were isolated interventions or programs Although there are some limited local schoollevel programs in de veloping countries even in that context we did not nd reference to there being an overarching public health or systemlevel model behind the interventions on which teaching about prevention of sexual abuse can be based at wholeofpopulation level We foundno evaluation of national or regional initiative or of an integrated prevention framework in developing country There was relatively poor geographical coverage of evaluative research regarding CSA prevention with no international com parisons undertaken No evaluations were published from South America North Africa Paci ca or the Middle East Given our systematic search of multidisciplinary databases found so few eligible studies research into CSA prevention in developing countries and evaluation of interventions is global need For prevention strategies to ectively support individuals organizations and communities in developing countries more rigorous evaluations need to be conducted and reported so that the internationalcommunity can identify best practice for implementation Implications To support locallevel activities in developing countries aimed at reducing CSA the accessibility of primary prevention programs should be focus of governments and nongovernment organizations operating in developing countries who are funded directly by governments international aid agencies and overseas donors Countrywide policiesprograms are needed supported by partner ships with research experts to conduct evaluation research on their prevention ortswhether they be at community or societal levels As is the case in dealing with related areas of interpersonal violence such partnership activities between international agenciesand governments must also recognize and promote equality and the human rights of women and children which underpin many of the intervention activities CSAspeci prevention also needs to be situated within the context of child maltreatment prevention more broadly from public health perspective Herrenkohl et al By recognizing the crossover between CSA prevention and broader child maltreatment prevention as well as issues related to gender and patriarchal social norms prevention initiatives would be able to relate speci cally to the risk factors identi ed as being more relevant in the developing nations in which they are being implemented This review highlights the need for prevention programs that are broader and go beyond schoolbased sexual abuse prevention knowledge of children particularly given the higher outofschool rates in developing countries linked to framework for com prehensive CSA prevention and preferably an even broader child maltreatment prevention framework Considering the opportunities orded through technological solutions where these can be appropriately used research is needed to investigate the cacy of how these can be applied in developing countries with consideration to the limitations and risks that come with internet access in relation to CSA could support broader rollout of ective prevention interventions With the use of westernled interventions in developing countries to reduce CSA it is essential to consider cultural adaptation of such interventions based on solid examination of cultural beliefs that may be barriers or enablers of prevention orts As well as development of new culturally appropriate and speci CSA prevention strategies such adaptations would need to ensure con sideration of the perceived role of children and young people within the societies that interventions are being applied in as well asthe level of importance placed on community and societal cohesionD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect The primary prevention programs that governments and nongovernment agencies begin utilizing should go beyond schoolbased protective behaviors programs measuring only the increase in knowledge and skills but rather be linked to broader framework for comprehensive prevention that includes improving conditions of safety for children such as addressing workforce capabilities and building engagement with parents and the broader community Those leading prevention orts should include within their pro grams research including qualitative methodologies to evaluate the ectiveness of prevention orts in speci contexts For example this could include programs delivered in contexts where children may not be attending school regularly and where other risks to their safety and wellbeing from poverty neglect child labor etc may intersect with their risk of CSA and the capacity of prevention initiatives to be ective

FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA APPENDIX METHODOLOGY AND SEARCH PROTOCOL Databases and search terms Results and screening REFERENCES Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Childrens lives are increasingly mediated by digital technologies yet our knowledge of how this affects their wellbeing is far from comprehensive We know for example that the online environment exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information The use of digital technologies can expand their opportunities reduce inequalities and contribute to the realization of childrens rights We also know that when children seek information online and want to learn they risk being exposed to inappropriate or potentially harmful content Yet when it comes to determining the longterm effects of internet use and online experiences on childrens wellbeing mental health or resilience the best we can do is make an educated guess This is just one evidence gap among many that need to be filled in order that society can support childrens positive use of digital technologies develop childrens skills and protect those who are vulnerable Filling these gaps would benefit children Their education relationships entertainment and participation in connected world increasingly depend on digital technologies Filling these gaps would also help to guide policy and programme responses and maximize the potential of technological advancements Our need for this knowledge has become even more acute as internet use rises during the global COVID pandemic This report identifies evaluates and synthesizes what has been learned from the most recent research about childrens experiences and outcomes relating to the internet and digital technologies It aims to inform policymakers educators child protection specialists industry and parents on the latest and best evidence and it proposes future research agenda The conceptual framework for the report is based on the wellestablished models of childrens internet use that underpin research by three international projects EU Kids Online Global Kids Online and Disrupting Harm We add to this in two ways First we pay particular attention to research on childrens sexual experiences and related risks online We do this because of the growing concern about the potential for harm online and because it reflects the priorities of the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti which funded this research as part of the Disrupting Harm project Second we examine research on childrens privacy in the digital environment because of its importance to childrens online opportunities risks and rights The methodology is rapid evidence review of two of the largest databases of peerreviewed outputs in science technology medicine social sciences and the arts and humanities Web of Science and Scopus We searched for all empirical studies concerned with digital technology and children published since We then screened the search results for relevance and methodological robustness The resulting studies were coded using version of the Global Kids Online framework We grouped our findings under seven research themes access activities and opportunities digital skills privacy online risk of harm online sexual activities and risks online and mental health and wellbeing Livingstone et al Livingstone

International and the International Criminal Police Organization INTERPOL Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Four overarching questions guided our review and helped us to identify the key evidence gaps What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use contributes positively to child outcomes and wellbeing What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use can amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience in children What are the remaining research gaps Below we summarize the findings in relation to these questions What do we know about how childrens internet use can contribute positively to child outcomes and wellbeing Children around the world primarily use mobile devices to access the internet for information and entertainment to connect with their friends and to engage with their community Increased internet and device uptake by society diminishes the gaps in internet access experienced by different groups of children In lowaccess contexts children lead the way in the adoption of new technologies and are online more than adults Some children experience the benefits more strongly than others Children from global South countries and poorer backgrounds face significant inequalities in relation to access to devices and the internet the quality and cost of connectivity and the availability of competent support from those around them Such inequalities create domino effect in other areas resulting in crosscountry inequalities in online activities and digital skills The online environment exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information This helps children to engage with others and become aware of different views The internet is also an important source of physical and mental health knowledge for children They value that it offers anonymity access to reliable information peer experiences and supportseeking options The internet can have positive effect on mental health and wellbeing Children who receive mental health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have improved outcomes What happens to children offline affects their experiences and outcomes online Their age gender home context and relationships with family peers and school are all important factors So too are such factors as the safety of their neighbourhood or whether they are overweight engage in substance abuse take sexual risks or are survivor of violence or sexual abuse How can childrens internet use amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they spend online The more children use the internet the more skills they develop and the more activities they can undertake But as they engage in wider range of online activities children are also more likely to Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper encounter risks However greater exposure to risk does not necessarily translate into more harm Children can be exposed to inappropriate or potentially harmful content when they are seeking information online For example some children view sexual content online to learn about sex but this content can expose them to sexually violent behaviours or genderbased sexual objectification Exposure to online risks may result in harm to the child Some studies show positive association between internet use risk encounters and negative outcomes These outcomes include anxiety depression suicidal thoughts and panic disorder Many studies show that cyberbullying victimization is associated with lower psychological wellbeing and externalizing behaviours such as feeling angry or acting out More children are bystanders of cyberbullying than they are bullies or victims This experience can have an adverse effect on childrens wellbeing over time Cyberbystanders display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school What do we know about the pathways to harm and vulnerability Children who are vulnerable offline are also more likely to be vulnerable online while protective offline factors can also reduce exposure to online risks Offline factors that create vulnerability or protection influence how children engage with the online environment Vulnerable children or those living with offline risks or disadvantage are more exposed to online risks and in turn find themselves more likely to experience harm and less able to find support Childrens overall wellbeing seems to affect how they engage with the internet For example lower level of happiness and life satisfaction is found to be associated with exposure to negative online content cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism but we do not know enough about why this is the case Children who experience violence neglect physical punishment psychological victimization parental conflict sexual harassment and offline solicitation are more likely to also be exposed to sexual solicitation online but again it is unclear exactly how or why this happens Some children are more vulnerable than others but who is vulnerable varies based on the type of online risk For example older teenagers LGBTQI children and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to engage in sexting behaviour and be victims of sextortion Girls are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation coercive sexting and cyberdating violence They are also more likely to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers and to have negative sexting experiences and are more negatively affected by cyberdating violence Children who experience one kind of online risk are also more likely to experience others For example online sexual solicitation is associated with exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online having contact with unknown people on social media voluntary sexting and video chatting with strangers Cyberbullying victimization and perpetration is associated with childrens greater exposure to negative online content and to cyberdating violence Lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer and intersex In our search of the recent literature we found no studies of the experiences of children with special educational needs or disabilities though there are reports documenting their greater exposure to online risks Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper There is connection between offending and victimization For example both the victims and perpetrators of cyberbullying tend to report weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family higher rates of loneliness being less liked at school and lower psychological wellbeing Perpetrators of cyberbullying and sextortion are also more likely to be victims Online and offline perpetration and victimization are also highly correlated This suggests that when children become the target of hurtful behaviour some respond in the same way creating snowball effect of risky conduct What do we know about protective factors There is limited evidence on what can protect children from negative online experiences and harm Some exploratory studies suggest that social support and childrens positive relationships with the people around them can act as protective factors Children who lack such social resources face double disadvantage they are more likely to experience online risks and are less likely to seek help Protective factors may differ based on the type of online risk though existing evidence addresses only few risks For example positive relationship with parents parental monitoring of childrens activities teacher care enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence and resilience are all protective factors for cyberbullying For cyberdating violence parental monitoring and emotional bonding can be protective factors Encouragement and support from parents teachers and peers can help children to become more confident internet users This is especially true for younger children Parents can reduce risks by imposing restrictions such as limiting the time children spend online But this can impede childrens skills and hinder opportunities Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in safety strategies Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect childrens privacy behaviours Protecting children online is more efficient when combined with supportive parenting more generally ie offline For example emerging evidence on cyberbullying shows that childrens overall relationships with their parents and general offline monitoring of their daytoday activities reduces childrens risk of cyberbullying more so than monitoring their online activities specifically What research gaps do we need to fill Robust highquality and comparable research is still necessary In many areas knowledge remains tentative The large majority of studies we found are based on small or nonrepresentative samples involve correlational analyses of crosssectional data and control for limited number of background variables While such studies offer some insights their limitations make it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider life environment We need better representation of the diversity of childrens circumstances At present most research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North Evidence regarding the preteenage years and from global South countries is sparse Filling these gaps will enhance our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper We still need to learn more about the positive effects of childrens internet use Only one fifth out of of the studies identified by the search explore opportunities and benefits of internet use In contrast childrens encounters with certain online risks particularly excessive internet use cyberbullying gambling and problematic gaming feature heavily in the research literature Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet without including variables related to the perceived quality or context of their internet use for example negative experiences related to online victimization or cyberbullying The focus on time spent above quality or context of use is serious limitation which constrains our understanding of which activities and risks are more likely to influence childrens outcomes There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to opportunities and risks We need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of childrens internet use to develop better understanding of what factors determine such differences and for which groups of children To do so we also need more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable comparative research This has been key objective of research conducted by the EU Kids Online and Global Kids Online research networks More evidence is needed on the outcomes of childrens internet use While studies may link childrens online experiences to risk and protective predictive factors in their life circumstances they rarely follow up on the consequences of childrens internet use over time to document either benefits or harms The evidence is particularly scarce in relation to longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health and resilience which require longitudinal research To develop the longitudinal evidence base in this field longterm investment and commitment to explore the outcomes of childrens internet use is needed We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are linked for example childrens online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations and generated hypotheses about how these shape childrens wellbeing in an increasingly digital world few recently published studies have tested these models We need better understanding of childrens digital ecology There needs to be some exploration of the nature of digital devices and online platforms and their policies applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm The pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability exposure to both offline and online risks and childrens responses to risk remain underexplored Investigating these pathways would entail developing model of mechanisms mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens background and living environment home school community with the occurrence of different types of risk and harm online This is main purpose of the Disrupting Harm project We have begun this process in our recent country comparative report comparing Global Kids Online findings for crossnational similarities and differences see Global Kids Online comparative report See also Setting the agenda for future research and analysis Stoilova et al and the projects CORE Children Online Research and Evidence and Youth Skills ySKILLS Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper There is an urgent need for childcentred research methods to complement the recent evidence We still do not understand enough about how children see these issues We need research on cultures of childhood as they are experienced by children and how these cultures change or not due to the online environment For example are there online sexual activities that may be tolerated or even encouraged because they have positive impacts on childrens evolving identities even though they may involve level of risk If so how much risk is acceptable and how do children themselves view and mitigate such risks Above all researchers should conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences in their own words For more on childcentred research see Third et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper INTRODUCTION An estimated one in three internet users globally is child This number is likely to be even higher in the global South Access to digital technology can help children to develop the skills and literacies they need to learn and prepare for life in an increasingly digital society It can give them access to health or education services or information on topics that are important for young people but may be taboo in their societies Yet internet access may also compound risks to children that unless managed could undermine their wellbeing Most importantly engagement with technologies is increasingly means of realizing childrens rights as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Use of digital technology is key driver of change and partly underpins the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals To develop appropriate policy and programme responses stakeholders need robust evidence on how children use the internet They need evidence on whether children can make use of the many opportunities it offers They also need to identify which risks of harm children may face online Such evidence can significantly contribute to the development of policies and programmes that support children and their parents teachers law enforcement officers and others who bear responsibilities for the protection of children It can also help the private sector to protect child rights and make decisions informed by the best interests of the child There have been numerous efforts to improve the global evidence base and support advocacy policy development and programming in this area Two such research efforts are particularly important to this review because they generate an international comparative evidence base of crosssectional nationally representative research with children and parents The first is Global Kids Online which was initiated in by the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti the London School of Economics and Political Science and the EU Kids Online network The project conducted in collaboration with country partners around the world uses research framework that seeks to assess the balance between online opportunities and risks of harm for childrens wellbeing The framework takes into account how interactions between offline and online factors may make difference to childrens experiences and outcomes It facilitates NorthSouth and SouthSouth collaboration and builds the capacity of national research institutions to increase sustainability in evidence generation Since directly comparable survey research has been fielded in countries covering more than children and parents In the EU Kids Online network expanded upon the Global Kids Online methodology and fielded comparable survey research in an additional countries We use the Global Kids Online research framework as point of reference The second research effort is Disrupting Harm project established in by the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and implemented by the UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti the International Criminal Police Organization INTERPOL which facilitates global police cooperation and ECPAT International global network working to end the sexual exploitation of children Disrupting Livingstone et al Livingstone Livingstone Byrne et al Livingstone and Stoilova Livingstone Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Harm explores in depth childrens experiences of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse in countries in Eastern and Southern Africa and Southeast Asia This evidence review supports these research efforts by contributing to the development of the Disrupting Harm survey methodology as implemented by UNICEF It also responds to the broader need for evidence on the positive and negative effects of internet use on childrens wellbeing It assesses recent advances in the understanding and measurement of childrens online experiences identifies recent developments in the field and highlights pressing research gaps and limitations In light of growing concerns about the potential for harm to children in the digital environment we pay particular attention to research on childrens online privacy and the risk of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse Our research was guided by the following questions What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use contributes positively to child outcomes and wellbeing What is the most recent evidence on how childrens internet use can amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their wellbeing How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience in children What are the remaining research gaps For review of the earlier research literature see KardefeltWinther and Radford Allnock and Hynes Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper METHODOLOGY Evidence review methodology rapid evidence review method was used for this report This rapid review used systematic methods to search for and critically appraise published research Rapid evidence reviews are rigorous and explicit in their methodological approach and thus systematic but make concessions to the breadth or depth of the process for example by limiting the amount of grey literature extracting only key variables and performing simpler quality appraisal This report groups the rapid review findings around key aspects of childrens internet use and identifies future research needed to address evidence gaps We conducted keyword searches of the title abstract and text of studies in the Web of Science and Scopus databases We blended several groups of keywords technologybased childbased methodbased and violencebased see Appendix This yielded search results which were screened initially by title and abstract only and then by the full text Details of the search protocol are discussed in the Appendix The screening was based on whether the studies met the following predefined inclusion criteria publication based on primary survey research with children under years or review article offering summary of recent highquality studies from any country but published in English published since to account for advances in technology and how children use the internet deriving from research that was of high quality methodologically robust and preferably published in peerreviewed journal The requirement for highqua lity methodology was applied differently across the research themes For themes where we found little research such as activities and opportunities in relation to civic participation learning and socializing the criteria were more inclusive and some exploratory studies are discussed In such cases we treat the findings as indicative offering an insight into where more robust research could be productive For themes where more research is available notably risk of harm online in relation to cyberbullying we focus on studies with more robust methodologies and representative survey samples After applying the inclusion criteria the resulting of studies the final sample were coded and summarized for the review Analysis We develop ed code for each of the key research themes using topdown coding framework based on wellestablished models of childrens internet use The final search results were allocated to the relevant themes allowing for one article to receive multiple codes New codes were formulated to facilitate the development of more comprehensive review of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse Each study was analysed for its findings methods and measures and suggestions for furthe research Grant and Booth Livingstone et al Livingstone Byrne et al UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World

exploitation and abuse online sexual solicitation sextortion sexual violence child sexual abuse materials Mental health and wellbeingPositive and negative outcomes affecting childrens mental health and wellbeing otal number of coded studies some studies were coded in more than one theme Limitations Limitations of the rapid evidence review This evidence review updates previous reviews of the evidence on childrens internet use and cross country comparisons by the Global Kids Online network It includes only the most recent studies published since across range of research themes As result valuable earlier studies were omitted and should be considered separately for full indepth review Our purpose was to discover new developments and the themes studied most recently how they have been researched methods and gaps and what the newest evidence suggests We did not expand the search with additional These studies were coded but then excluded from the analysis as this area has already been extensively covered elsewhere full review would be required to account for existing methodological shortcomings and limitations inherent to this subfield which was beyond the scope of this assignment For recent review and discussion paper by UNICEF covering excessive internet use and gaming see KardefeltWinther UNICEF We explore sexual activities separately from risks of harm online partly to provide more specific focus on risks related to sexual activities but also to suggest that not all of childrens sexual activities are risky some may be part of childrens sexual exploration and identity Livingstone and Bulger Byrne et al UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper keywords specific to each theme such as access or skillsrelated words because each themespecific search could constitute separate evidence review Restricting the search to the English language and to databases mainly oriented to the global North limited the evidence found from nonEnglishspeaking countries and the global South Limitations of the available research literature We found substantial imbalance across the reviewed research themes of childrens internet use see Figure While some areas such as addiction gambling and problematic gaming receive considerable attention others remain comparatively underresearched We excluded the body of literature concerned with hypothesized addiction to the internet gambling and excessive gaming partly because these areas have been covered elsewhere but also because of methodological shortcomings that make it difficult to interpret these results reliably reliable interpretation would require tailored review to query specific methodological issues which was beyond the scope of this assignment Generally we found more literature on childrens encounters with online risks than on their positive experiences activities and skills This suggests need for better balance in research on childrens internet use Another imbalance relates to the type of research participant Studies most often sample older teenagers while research on children under years of age is generally missing from the evidence base Some studies conflate children with young adults The studies we reviewed vary significantly in the definitions and the measures used for ostensibly the same construct for example cyberbullying This makes comparability across studies difficult The large majority of studies are based on small or nonrepresentative samples that make it difficult to generalize from the findings Where such studies are included in the review the findings should be considered with caution They are exploratory in nature and highlight possible areas for further research Many studies conduct correlational analyses of crosssectional data This means that they cannot establish what is cause and effect or determine longterm consequences This makes the task of establishing pathway to harm and vulnerability or protective factors for resilience particularly difficult The analysis cannot determine whether an effect for instance high level of harm is the cause or the consequence of child using digital technology We draw insights where available from the small number of longitudinal studies found in the review More longitudinal research or research that deploys research designs that support causal inferences is needed to reach conclusions about the effect of childrens internet use on their wellbeing in the long term Also problematic is that in their statistical analyses most studies control for limited number of background variables These tend to prioritize childrens psychological characteristics or their internet use They only rarely examine the role of factors relating to the childs life situation home environment or parental mediation broad consideration of neighbourhood or community effects countrylevel indicators poverty and inequalities is often missing As discussed in UNICEF review this makes it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider environment Bearing the above in mind we begin the discussion of each research theme with brief note to explain the definitions and research methods typically used We note the limitations of the research highlight the key findings and draw out suggestions for further research For an overview of this literature see KardefeltWinther KardefeltWinther Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper ACCESS Access refers to how children log on to the internet It includes what devices they use to go online and the places of access such as home school friends house or an internet caf It also includes how much time children spend online and whether they can go online when they need or want to or experience some barriers in terms of permission cost or connectivity We reviewed studies on this theme They are diverse in relation to their geographical location as well as the areas they address The locations were Chile Malaysia the Russian Federation Singapore Spain Switzerland and the United States of America comparative study looked at Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The areas covered included the connections between access and learning outcomes reading habits and online activities and opportunities and the links between access and digital skills few studies examine the impact of inequalities on internet access Most of these reports provide only descriptive statistics derived from samples that are small or close at hand and sometimes both While it is unsuitable to use these limited studies for crosscountry comparisons of prevalence they broadly support the trends identified by the larger representative surveys reviewed Key findings Regardless of the country or context children tend to mainly use mobile phones to go online There are important differences in access between countries based on the level of internet and device uptake Countries with lower levels of uptake tend to have more access inequalities Children from poorer backgrounds face more barriers to going online Countries with high internet and device penetration see narrowing gaps in relation to access Here disparities relate more to the quality and cost of connectivity which affects what children do when they are online There are important differences in access relating to the age of first access and the number of devices used Children from wealthier backgrounds and country contexts tend to go online from younger age and have access to larger number of internetconnected devices Access inequalities also relate to the availability of competent support and mediation especially when children are younger In contexts with lower internet penetration children tend to lead the way and be online more than the adults around them This raises important questions about parental support and mediation few highquality studies examine access inequalities among children In their study Mascheroni and lafsson use data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately respondents aged years across seven European countries Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom They conclude that combination of social inequalities and differences in access to digital technologies results in disparities in online activities In these countries the probability of children owning smartphone increases by per cent on average for each year they grow older from the age of years though the exact figure varies by Mascheroni and lafsson Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper country Boys and girls get their first smartphone at similar age While in these countries socio economic status is not related to smartphone ownership children who start to use the internet later than average are less likely to own smartphone as are children whose parents do not use smartphone to go online longitudinal study in Switzerland of students aged years and parents also shows that familys socioeconomic status on its own predicts neither childrens internet access nor the availability of digital devices when controlling for childrens academic performance This may be due to number of factors such as devices being relatively inexpensive affluent parents trying to limit their childrens access to devices or parents with lower socioeconomic status trying to catch up and buy devices for their children to avoid social exclusion familys socioeconomic status is however associated with how children use the internet In this study from Switzerland children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tended to use the internet more often as form of communication and entertainment and less often for educational purposes Children who had access to larger number of digital devices also tended to use the internet more often for entertainment and socializing but this was not related to socioeconomic status Childrens smartphone ownership depends partly on how their family uses mobile devices It also depends on where the country stands on smartphone adoption in terms of the availability and cost of devices and data as well as the mainstream culture of adoption Age creates important differences Younger children are less likely to use smartphone to go online daily and are less likely to have an internet plan on their phone The availability and cost of connectivity also matter as do parental decisions to limit childrens unsupervised internet use especially at younger eld Some access inequalities can create further divides in relation to how children use the internet If children start to use the internet at an older age or do not use mobile phone daily they tend to engage in fewer online activities Research from Global Kids Online suggests that engaging in fewer online activities can have detrimental effect on the development of digital skills While this effect decreases with age it remains significant even for older children Several studies with samples too small or unrepresentative to generalize from the findings offer interesting though only indicative insights into childrens internet access For example survey of children aged years living in Moscow shows that even when children are not allowed to use mobile devices at school many still do The lack of integration of digital technologies into the educational process may however affect the type of activities they do online Instead of using mobile phones to learn and look for information children may focus on entertainment and socializing United Statesbased study researching the internet access of runaways or homeless children and youth shows that children and youth who are better educated or employed are more likely to own mobile phone Digital devices are an important source of connection for homeless children including staying in touch with family members who in some cases pay the phone bills Finally survey of parents and children in Chile showed that children use different strategies Camerini et al UNICEF Mascheroni and lafsson Koroleva Harpin et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper to influence their parents adoption of new technologies Whether children are successful depends on various factors including the type of device they want Success also depends on whether they use argumentative strategies taking into account their familys or parents perspectives by reasoning or bargaining or nonargumentative strategies begging demanding or whining to influence technology adoption Limitations and suggestions for further research Most studies offer narrow understanding of access to the internet It is most often researched in relation to being able to go online and having digital device available Other important factors that can create access inequalities are rarely explored including cultural factors and parental attitudes In some contexts cultural factors may even create additional inequalities for example in relation to gender which should be explored further especially among noninternetusing children More research is needed on the effects on access of the quality cost and availability of connectivity Impacts of parental mediation strategies that encourage or discourage children to go online need to be better understood together with the effects of the availability of devices in different settings including at school We need to better understand how access inequalities create further divisions in terms of the range and complexity of online activities that children engage in and the extent to which these differences become longterm effects Correa For gender inequalities in low and middleincome countries see Banaji et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES Activities and opportunities in general Children engage in broad range of activities online These include learning community and civic participation creativity engagement in social relationships and online communication These activities may result in tangible benefits to children Sexting and watching pornography may be experienced as opportunities by some children and as risks by others These activities are discussed later in the report The review includes studies of online opportunities for children An additional six studies examine digital health Five explore digital citizenship These were reviewed separately to gain additional insights The main studies on activities and opportunities focus mostly on Europe and North America Some also cover Australia China Malaysia the Russian Federation the Republic of Korea Singapore and the United Arab Emirates The studies mainly use survey methods but some use mixed methods focus groups or interviews The quantitative research comprises panel study and few schoolbased surveys with stratified sampling But the majority of surveys use small convenience or selfselected samples Some studies control for only limited number of variables few samples include young adults aged years and above Key findings The online activities in which children engage depend on their gender country context socio economic status smartphone ownership and age What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they spend online Platforms can be used for different purposes and result in different benefits for children For example social media are mainly used for communication and socializing but can offer learning opportunities for those children who seek such benefits How children engage with the internet depends on range of factors including their needs preferences and abilities Informationseeking activities are particularly valuable to children dealing with sensitive issues such as sexuality and health Receiving support can be helpful for children dealing with hardship The Net Children Go Mobile survey shows that girls are more likely to use the internet for schoolwork and social networking than boys It was conducted in seven European countries Belgium Denmark Ireland Italy Portugal Romania and the United Kingdom There are however crosscountry differences For example children in the United Kingdom are significantly less likely than those in Italy Portugal and Romania to use social networking sites Findings from the same study also indicate that European children from medium and higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to use the internet for schoolwork and learning activities than those with lower socioeconomic status Some of Vossen and Valkenburg Gluer and Lohaus Vanden Abeele et al Kim et al SampasaKanyinga et al Mascheroni and lafsson Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper these findings are contradicted by study conducted in the Republic of Korea It shows that neither gender nor the parents academic background is significantly related to childs use of the internet for studying This points to the possibility that some of these relationships vary by country and regional context The evidence suggests that there is relationship between which devices children use how long they stay online and the type of online activities they engage in For example Mascheroni and lafsson found that daily smartphone use is not related to using the internet for schoolwork but is associated with more engagement in entertainment and communication activities These activities are considered more participatory than schoolwork because they involve things like playing games sharing or downloading photos videos or music sharing files posting messages and creating pet or an avatar Some indicative research suggests that there may be relationship between the time spent online and the type of activities in which children engage According to study in Sweden children who spend minutes or more online per day are more likely to play games and surf the web eg to seek leisure related information while children who are online less tend to engage more in social communication and informationseeking There is longitudal evidence that using social media can develop childrens affective and cognitive empathy This enables them to share understand and recognize other peoples emotions Some studies also emphasize the importance of selfdisclosure for receiving support from peers Children who use social networking sites discuss more personal information with their offline friends than children who do not have social media account according to study in Germany of stratified sample of children aged years Belgian study of high school students aged years and recruited via random stratified sampling found that selfdisclosure is positively associated with higher emotional support received from friends Exchanging messages online with friends reinforces sense of companionship because of its characteristic of any time any place connectivity which allows them to chitchat and micro coordinate activities Intimate selfdisclosure is also associated with childrens perceived privacy and control over the content in messaging with friends Socializing can also be linked to online learning opportunities particularly in countries where such opportunities are facilitated by the education system Children sometimes use social media to manage homework tasks or engage with content related to homework When time spent on social media is used for studying it is associated with better school performance On the other hand the evidence shows that spending more time on social media more than two hours day is negatively associated with school performance if social media are not used for studyrelated activities Lim and Nam Thulin and Vilhelmson Vossen and Valkenburg Gluer and Lohaus Vanden Abeele et al Vanden Abeele et al Blair et al SampasaKanyinga et al Kim et al Badri et al SampasaKanyinga et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Some indicative findings from smaller studies suggest that the internet can offer benefits to hardto reach children and those in vulnerable situations such as children dealing with drug use mental health problems or selfharm by making it easier to access information and seek help These indicative findings suggest that technologically driven interventions to improve child wellbeing may be useful for some children Limitations and suggestions for further research While there is evidence that smartphone use is linked to variations in childrens online activities it is not clear how the type or number of devices used is associated with different activities Some activities such as learning socializing and play have received more attention in the recent research evidence while others such as creativity health and participation are discussed much less More evidence is needed across the full spectrum of online opportunities to understand which activities lead to positive outcomes and how existing inequalities may be overcome broader range of predictors of online activities and opportunities should be considered Most studies omit variables related to digital skills parental mediation or the influence of peers and the community This makes it difficult to understand how different skills or family attitudes enable or restrict children in taking advantage of online opportunities Future research should also explore whether and how positive online experiences of children are related to tangible longterm benefits If some children yield greater benefits than others research should uncover the factors that create these differences The potential of the internet to provide social and emotional support for children requires more attention in future research This would include what type of support is most beneficial and how to reach those children who most need support There is also very little research on peer versus intergenerational communication and its impact on wellbeing The potential of peer support needs to be better examined Digital health On an individual level digital health refers to the use of the internet and digital technologies to maintain or improve health and lifestyle It may involve searching for broad range of healthrelated information This includes information on healthy eating and nutrition exercise or sports sexual or reproductive health mental health disease or injury and treatment or medication Digital health also refers to using specific applications software programs or devices to monitor plan share or discuss issues related to health or lifestyle Such issues include weight loss exercise food intake and mood The six studies reviewed mainly cover countries in Europe and North America including Germany the Netherlands Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the United States One study was conducted in Nigeria The methodologies encompass range of methods from secondary data and metaanalysis to webbased focus groups and surveys The surveys are mostly crosssectional involving convenience samples and multistage random sampling of schools or clustered random Curry et al De Riggi et al Fedele et al Doornwaard et al Shabi and Oyewusi Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper sampling of schools The one longitudinal panel study used small nonprobability sample The methodological shortcomings of the studies include small samples and insufficient information about controls Key findings The digital environment is an important source of health information and support for children both in relation to physical and to mental health Children value that the internet provides anonymity access to reliable information glimpses of the experiences of peers and supportseeking options Children use variety of online channels to access digital health content They usually try to judge the reliability of the source and the particular benefits it provides but this can sometimes be difficult for them Not everyone is equally able to benefit Looking for health information online is positively associated with having higher level of digital skills Digital health outcomes are rarely discussed and the evidence on effectiveness is somewhat mixed and insufficient Several studies explore how children seek health information online They show that trusted and highquality online health information is important to young people survey in Germany of students aged years shows that the aspects most frequently cited as important for digital health information are easily comprehensible wording cited by per cent of respondents clear layout per cent and perceived reliability of the websites publisher per cent The visual style of website and whether it is explicitly aimed at students are deemed less important Girls are nearly twice as likely as boys to attach importance to the publishers reliability especially those girls who do not have migrant background or who attend school in the highest academic tier Children also evaluate the reliability of online information by determining whether the same information appears on multiple websites and if it corresponds with what they know from offline sources such as family friends or school Websites associated with medical institutions such as pharmacies or health care providers are generally considered reliable as are websites explicitly aimed at educating youth about sexual and reproductive health Forums with usergenerated content are seen as beneficial for offering glimpses of the experiences or opinions of others and for providing opportunities for informal support through online peer networks survey in Nigeria of students aged years found that per cent of children and young people use the internet to seek health information on weekly basis The most popular search topics Best et al Curry et al von Rosen et al Doornwaard et al Doornwaard et al Best et al Shabi and Oyewusi Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper include healthy diet and nutrition body size shape and image sexually transmitted infections and other sexual issues The availability of easily accessible online information is particularly valuable for the hardtoreach children who struggle to seek help face to face study of boys from Northern Ireland aged years found that one quarter of those who seek information online will not tell anyone about mental health issue They place particular value on the anonymity of digital health information resources and support services The internet also provides opportunities for children to access information on sexual health and relationships mental health support and general health services study in the Netherlands shows factors related to childrens identity and circumstances may influence how they engage with online information For example LGBTQI children and those with more knowledge about sex and sexuality are more likely to consult sexual information online Girls children who know more about sex and sexuality and those who communicate with friends rather than parents about sex tend to seek sexual information from professional websites Boys and children with low sexual selfesteem and high sexual curiosity are more likely to use interactive usergenerated online content The study in Nigeria revealed that children who have more advanced digital skills are more likely to use the internet for health information The study in Northern Ireland found no significant impact of economic status geographical location or educational attainment on the online helpseeking habits of boys in relation to health The study suggests that boys who use online helpseeking to supplement offline support may gain more mental health benefits Boys who have larger online friend networks and those who have confided in online friends regarding personal problems also have better mental health outcomes This suggests that lack of online social support may create inequalities among children Longterm digital health outcomes are rarely discussed The evidence on effectiveness is both insufficient and somewhat inconsistent review of the evidence on changes in childrens health behaviour found that mobile health interventions can have positive effect on childrens health outcomes Furthermore interventions supported by caregivers produce larger changes in health outcomes on average than those that exclusively target children Yet another review of the evidence on the effects of mobile health including use of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity outcomes among healthy children found no evidence of an effect among all interventions Best et al Nikkelen et al Nikkelen et al Shabi and Oyewusi Best et al Best et al Fedele et al Fedele et al Bhm et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research More evidence that is methodologically robust and comparable is needed to assess how children benefit from digital health information resources and support services The conclusions from current findings are limited by the small number of studies differences in measurement dissimilarities in the digital health content assessed and the methodological challenges of the study designs More evaluations are needed of digital health interventions Another area for future research is to explore how the relationship between youth health behaviours and outcomes is related to factors at the individual family and community level and influenced by health care systems Further analyses of the relationship between seeking mental health information and support and childrens exposure to online harm could be helpful especially in relation to targeting online harm interventions Digital citizenship Digital citizenship is an umbrella term It covers the role of digital technologies in the development of childrens political interest civic identity and engagement in politics It also covers their understanding of citizenship values their civic engagement and their rights in the digital world The five studies reviewed cover four European countries and Indonesia They are mainly quantitative in nature with mixture of convenience or small samples and longitudinal panel surveys using random cluster sampling of schools Key findings Digital technologies are childrens preferred medium for learning about new ideas and civic participation On their own however digital technologies have somewhat limited ability to create proactive and ongoing civic participation among children Children who actively seek political content online are more likely to develop stronger interest in politics over time than children who come across this content by chance even if they engage with it by commenting or sharing Offline engagement in civic activities such as taking part in demonstration distributing leaflets or wearing shirt is more likely to create sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens Online participation in civic activities such as expressing an opinion on social media writing blog creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll is less likely to create civic identity Still civic participation online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and help children to create new and independent opinions fiveyear longitudinal study in Sweden on the relations between online media use and political interest among children aged years wave and young people aged years wave found that children who actively engage with political content online develop stronger interest in politics over time This effect is relatively weak On the other hand children who come across political content Machackova and Serek Moeller et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper online by chance do not develop stronger interest in politics over time The study also found that range of other factors such as changes in family socioeconomic status childrens total news consumption across different platforms and interpersonal discussions with parents or peers appear to have no effect on later political interest The importance of proactive engagement with political information is also demonstrated by an Austrian study with children and young people aged years The study explored intentional proactive seeking and incidental coming across politics material randomly engagement in politics offline and online The study also asked whether the effects differ based on childrens motivations for internet use These include using the internet for selfexpression entertainment socializing or to look for political information Children who use the internet because they are interested in political information or selfexpression are significantly more likely to intentionally engage in politics both online and offline Children who use the internet mainly for entertainment purposes which defines most of the children in the sample are unlikely to engage in politics offline but may spontaneously engage in politics online This may be via activities such as liking sharing or commenting on political posts in random or nonproactive way Hence exposure to online political content can lead to higher engagement in politics but only for children who are already interested in politics or selfexpression and only if they come across political content online intentionally For the other children included in this study engagement with online political material did not seem to lead to active or longterm civic participation similar approach distinguishing offline and online civic participation was adopted in twowave panel study conducted in Czechia with adolescents aged years The findings show that the development of civic identity the sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens is not affected by online participation but it is positively predicted by offline participation In this study online participation involves signing an online petition expressing an opinion on social media writing blog creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll Offline participation is about taking part in demonstration distributing leaflets wearing shirt or another symbol or signing paper petition Surprisingly the study found no effect of either online or offline participation on childrens political selfefficacy trust in government and belief that they can influence politics Online participation on the other hand is linked to greater acceptance of unconventional authoritychallenging activism and to more negative attitudes towards social authorities and conventions possible explanation is that participating online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and create new and independent opinions in way that offline participation does not Moeller et al Heiss et al Heiss et al Moeller et al Machackova and Serek Machackova and Serek Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research Political participation is covered by substantial part of the literature It would benefit from more comprehensive approach whereby digital citizenship is also understood and studied in relation to child identity and belonging civic engagement childrens agency and rights and the formation of values through online engagement It would be beneficial to develop our understanding of the factors that help children to advance their engagement in digital citizenship activities This would help us to understand how the digital environment can facilitate and enhance childrens agency and rights We need to know more about groups of children who are marginalized and underrepresented or even persecuted in relation to their digital citizenship activities and identify ways in which their voices can be heard in all cultural social and political contexts Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper DIGITAL SKILLS The definition of skills in the literature we reviewed varies from the general ability to use the internet to specific skills related to the digital environment These specific skills include the ability to determine the credibility of online sources and information possession of online social skills and the ability to identify whether people met online are who they say they are More comprehensive multidimensional models include operational skills browsing skills social skills creative skills mobile skills personalsecurity skills critical skills and devicesecurity skills We reviewed seven studies on digital skills They used both qualitative and quantitative methods Two studies include parents as well as children The quantitative research ranges from large representative surveys used for crosscountry comparisons used in two studies to small and convenience samples and studies which do not clarify their sampling methods The research is mostly based in Europe except for two studies that focus on Malaysia and Latin America the Plurinational State of Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Mexico Peru and Uruguay Key findings Better digital skills are associated with more online opportunities but also more online risks Parents tend to use restrictive mediation when they or their child have lower level of digital skills Restrictive mediation reduces online risks mostly at the expense of digital skills and online opportunities In countries with low internet adoption children tend to be better internet users than their parents In such cases parents rely on their children and use the internet less on their own hence they are less able to provide support to their children when needed It is difficult to measure childrens digital skills The studies mostly rely on childrens self assessment rather than performance testing which means that some more confident children may overestimate their digital skills Several studies suggest that better digital skills are associated with more online activities but also more online risks Skills have decisive role in how children engage with the internet and in what their parents allow or encourage them to do online nationally representative survey of parents of children aged years from eight European countries shows that children who are encouraged to take advantage of online opportunities and are actively supported by their parents tend to do more Galperin and Arcidiacono Nygren and Guath Mantzouranis et al Groenestein et al Livingstone et al Teimouri et al RodriguezdeDios et al Groenestein et al Livingstone et al Galperin and Arcidiacono Mantzouranis et al Nygren and Guath RodriguezdeDios et al Teimouri et al Livingstone et al Galperin and Arcidiacono Livingstone et al Teimouri et al RodriguezdeDios et al For review of the evidence on antecedents and consequences of digital skills see Haddon et al forthcoming Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper things online and have better digital skills However they also face higher levels of risk To limit that risk parents sometimes use restrictive mediation such as taking away devices not allowing children to go online or limiting what they can do This reduces risk but it also reduces childrens digital skills and through this reduces the activities children engage in Children are more likely to be restricted when they are younger when they have lower level of digital skills or when their parents have lower level of digital skills However schoolbased survey in Spain of students aged years shows that associations between digital skills and online opportunities are stronger than those between digital skills and online risks This means that restricting children is reducing online risks mostly at the expense of online opportunities study explored the intergenerational transmission of digital skills and internet use in the context of countries with low to moderate levels of internet adoption The authors look at how childrens internet use and skills affect parental internet use and skills The study is based on largescale surveys with children and young people aged years in six Latin American countries the Plurinational State of Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Mexico Peru and Uruguay It found that the intergenerational transfer of motivation and skills from children to adults is on average outweighed by leaning effects This means that parents rely on children to perform online tasks for them Hence parents whose children are better internet users tend to rely on them and use the internet less on their own qualitative study with girls aged years and years in the Netherlands explored skills and confidence in determining whether an online stranger was an adult or peer The findings suggest that most girls are confident in their ability to identify an adult with possible sexual intentions but less than half of them per cent are actually able to do it When unsure about whom they are in contact with most girls apply strategy that does not involve interaction with the person They scan the profile page of the stranger checking the contact information the profile picture and whether they have friends in common When mutual friends are present trust increases significantly and girls are less critical If still unsure girls ask their friends in common about the stranger or more often continue the conversation with the stranger to find out more Important cues that alarm girls are when the other person ignores personal questions shows an exaggerated amount of interest acts as friend and makes sexual comments The study also found that girls in the younger group aged years report more distress when such incidents occur than those in the older group The potential unreliability of childrens selfassessment of their digital skills is addressed by Swedish study on news credibility The study asked students aged years to assess their competence in finding and evaluating online information While most respondents rated themselves as quite skilled at factchecking per cent rated their ability as good or very good and searching for information online per cent good or very good most of them per cent could not separate news from advertisements in popular online newspaper Selfreported skills of factchecking and searching ability are inversely associated with performance but children are better at recognizing manipulated images per cent and identifying such images as poor evidence per cent The students also had difficult time determining the trustworthiness of credible biased and false information online Hence the study concludes that claiming to be good at finding information online is associated with an inability to determine the trustworthiness of information Livingstone et al Livingstone et al RodriguezdeDios et al roenestein et al Nygren and Guath Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Limitations and suggestions for further research The reviewed literature offers little discussion of how particular skills may be related to higher or lower exposure to risks and to what types of risk more comprehensive model of skills is needed which can explain what role skills play if any in childrens pathways to harm and vulnerability or in the protective factors that help to build resilience The skills literature is almost exclusively digital It does not examine how offline skills such as critical thinking or social skills may support children when applied to online situations More research is needed on the possible benefits from the application of such skills in an online environment We found no longitudinal research that could explain differences between childrens digital skills Do children who acquire better digital skills at younger age have improved outcomes from their internet use and are such effects longlasting There are gaps in our knowledge of what factors from childrens offline and digital environments create the best conditions for learning digital skills and how best to support children to acquire digital skills Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper PRIVACY ONLINE Privacy relates to childrens understanding of range of related issues at the personal institutional and commercial level and their ability to mitigate privacyrelated risk The issues include knowledge of how to protect their own and others personal information online what to share and with whom how to use privacy settings and how personal data are collected by businesses or institutions and used for monitoring analyses or commerce The studies we reviewed are mostly from Europe and North America There are several studies from Asia including from China Malaysia the Philippines and Singapore The quantitative research is crosssectional with most of the studies using convenience or small samples Some studies include mixture of children and adults All findings should be considered indicative Key findings Overall children are less concerned about certain aspects of online privacy than adults and are less engaged in privacy management Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in safety strategies Girls have greater privacy concerns than boys and are more likely to have parental involvement in managing their online privacy Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect privacy behaviours eg having private profile Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age while peer mediation increases This is similar to other aspects of internet use The evidence of how skills affect privacy is inconclusive Having the relevant skills does not necessarily mean that children will engage in better privacy protection strategies Most of the studies in our sample examine privacy by exploring the relationship between privacy risks and other online risks such as sexting sexual exploitation or contact with unknown people The focus is often on children having public social media profile sharing information with people they have got to know online using privacy settings sharing passwords with friends and being concerned about privacy Mostly the studies are interested in exploring the factors that influence online privacy both positively and negatively These factors include device use media literacy mediation by parents teachers or peers and personal characteristics such as gender age and personality traits Some studies examine the violation of privacy Examples include the manipulation or dissemination of personal information or images without consent or being monitored by others such as partners or parents The findings suggest that gender and age influence online privacy behaviours web survey administered to social media users in Norway aged years investigated the impact of privacy concerns on selfie behaviours across gender and age groups The groups were adolescents For summ ary of the evidence on childrens privacy online see Livingstone et al Marret and Choo Montiel et al Reed et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper aged years young adults aged years and adults aged years The adolescents in the sample were much less concerned about privacy and less engaged in privacy management than the older groups Female users had greater privacy concerns than male users across all three age groups and the degree of privacy concern was not influenced by the use of privacy management strategies Adolescent girls who had greater privacy concerns engaged less in taking personal selfies cropping or editing photos and using photo enhancement filters There was no influence on group selfietaking and none of these factors was significant for adolescent boys United Statesbased survey of children and young people aged years though limited in terms of generalizability found that gender can be an important factor in determining privacy concerns Girls in the study were more likely to have parent who accessed their online profiles They were also more likely to have had discussion with parent about privacy settings The findings suggest that children who have privacy discussions are more likely to have private profiles on social media However this does not affect how often they use social media The children in the study who said that their parent knew their passwords were less likely to have private profile If we speculate this may be because they are already very cautious about what they post online knowing their parents will see it Those who had discussions with teachers about social media safety and privacy settings were more likely to have private profile Approximately one half of the participants reported that they discussed the importance of privacy settings with parents per cent teachers per cent and peers per cent Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age while discussions with peers increase Other exploratory studies show that significant factors for childrens online privacy practices also include device use and digital literacy Findings from survey of participants aged years living in the capital region of the Philippines which is again limited in generalizability show that children who use more devices have better online privacy behaviours The relationship is even stronger for children with better information literacy However another exploratory study looking at online privacy digital literacy and actual exposure to online risks shows that digital skills may be less important than privacy concerns in driving privacy behaviours This study comprised survey conducted in Malaysia among children aged years It shows that the participating children were less exposed to online risks when they were highly aware of the severity of online risks and had high online privacy concerns These findings may be explained by qualitative study with children and young people aged years It shows that online privacy is perceived as likely to be infringed as children struggle to maintain the boundaries between different social circles digital crowding and to control how information about them travels audience segregation Despite this lack of informational privacy there is an element of social or psychological privacy online It is based on trust in others and expectations that personal information will be handled correctly Hence whether or not children are concerned about their privacy affects how they engage with the internet and deal with risky situations Dhir et al Romo et al Bernadas and Soriano Teimouri et al Setty Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The offlineonline connection is explored in survey with children aged years in China It demonstrates the importance of differentiating between children with high and low levels of self disclosure both online and offline Children who use the online space as an extension of offline relationships and share information in more balanced way both offline and online are more likely to experience positive outcomes and to show signs of resilience low personal scores for neuroticism When online selfdisclosure occurs at the expense of offline selfdisclosure this tends to be associated with low personal scores for conscientiousness agreeableness and extroversion and high scores for neuroticism Limitations and suggestions for further research lot of privacy research proceeds with adult definitions of privacy and does little to account for what children think and know about privacy Paying attention to childrens definitions of privacy or more precisely drawing connections between their definitions and the issues that adults are concerned about on childrens behalf could help us to strengthen childrens privacy practices In previous piece of research we emphasized that the majority of research concerns privacy in interpersonal contexts with less attention paid to commercial or institutional contexts Relatedly most research conceives of data that are deliberately and knowingly provided with fewer studies recognizing that data traces and inferred data or metadata also matter for childrens privacy This evidence review found the same gaps and lack of extensive measures of online privacy which go beyond using privacy settings having public profile and sharing information with strangers More research is needed on the effect of skills on online privacy behaviours particularly in relation to privacy strategies values and behaviours or peer pressure which could inform peer training and empowerment methods Chen et al Stoilova et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper RISK OF HARM ONLINE The large majority of the studies identified by the review dealt with different aspects of online risk and harm This review includes total of studies divided into sexual risks studies which are discussed in section and nonsexual risks studies Of this latter set studies on excessive internet use online gambling and excessive gaming were coded for research theme but excluded from further analysis and this report The nonsexual risks reviewed include General or overall online risk exposure studies Seeing usergenerated negative content studies Hurtful and bullying behaviour studies Cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism studies Sexual risks include Receiving and sending sexual messages studies Viewing sexual content online studies Online sexual exploitation and abuse studies Each topic is defined and reviewed separately below Online risk exposure Online risk covers exposure to range of threats related to online content child as recipient of advertising content spam violent or hateful content pornographic or unwanted sexual content contact child as participant in situations related to being bullied harassed or stalked receiving unwanted sexual messages being groomed meeting in person contacts first met online and conduct child as an actor engaging in hacking gambling bullying or harassing behaviour sending sexual material to others Harm refers to the negative consequences some children experience from exposure to risks eg feeling bothered or upset Not all risks necessarily lead to harm and children can be affected differently by exposure to the same kind of risk The sources which for this report we allocated to the broader category of general risk include surveybased crosssectional studies with samples ranging from representative to small convenience samples The geographical area covered by the studies goes beyond Europe and the United States to also include Japan Malaysia Singapore Taiwan Province of China Thailand and Turkey Key findings Digital skills positively predict both online risks and online opportunities Better digital literacy and safety skills are associated with more engagement not only in online opportunities but also in risky online activities Hasebrink et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Parental mediation can affect childrens exposure to risks but there is no combination of enabling and restrictive mediation that both increases opportunities and reduces risks Reducing risks is always at the expense of opportunities The evidence on what types of risk lead to harm is insufficient It is often assumed rather than assessed that exposure to risk leads to harm There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks vulnerability or support influence childrens exposure to online risk and subsequent feelings of harm and the severity of that harm Many studies in the sample point out the interconnectedness of online risks with digital skills online opportunities and parental mediation survey of children aged years in Spain found that the variation in childrens exposure to online risks is not explained much by their level of digital skills The intuitive expectation that children with better skills experience fewer risks was not confirmed The authors speculate that this may be due to the greater strength of other predictors such as peer norms and pressure sensationseeking and offline victimization Similarly smallerscale survey conducted in Malaysia among child aged years found that skills were less important for exposure to online risks than awareness of risks and privacy concerns The indicative findings suggest that children who think that the internet is risky and dangerous perceived severity of an online risk are less likely to encounter risks online However whether children think that they are likely to experience online risks perceived susceptibility does not affect how much they are exposed to online risk The findings limited in terms of generalizability suggest two things internetrelated selfefficacy does not seem to reduce childs exposure to risk or affect privacy concerns and greater digital literacy and safety skills are associated with riskier online activities which may cause more harm This suggests that digital literacy education needs to find new ways to build on childrens digital selfefficacy to ensure that risk exposure or at least the experience of internetrelated harms is avoided or reduced few studies point to the protective effect of parental mediation on childrens exposure to risks However the relationship between the two is complex No combination of enabling and restrictive mediation has been found that both increases opportunities and reduces risks highquality cross national European study found that the maximum increase in opportunities occurs when parents engage in high enabling and low restrictive mediation But this also increases risks The maximum decrease in risks can be achieved by choosing high level of restrictions but this will also result in the greatest reduction in opportunities Restrictive mediation diminishes online risks through the reduction of digital skills and mostly at the expense of online opportunities Some studies found that active parental mediation is not significantly associated with exposure to online risk while active mediation by teachers and peers can reduce risk Parental and teacher Bayraktar Teimouri et al RodriguezdeDios et al RodriguezdeDios et al Teimouri et al Bayraktar Chang et al RodriguezdeDios et al Livingstone et al Livingstone et al Livingstone et al RodriguezdeDios et al Shin and Lwin Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper mediation also tends to focus more on making instructive remarks such as talking about information management while peers are more likely to engage in neutral types of active mediation such as helping or recommending The effects of parental mediation can also vary in different contexts For example active mediation is positively related with online risk exposure in Turkey but not in European countries Limitations and suggestions for further research substantial gap in the research is the lack of attention paid to the differences between online risk and harm Not all exposure to risk leads to harm and children are not equally affected More evidence is needed on what types of risk lead to harm what groups of children are more vulnerable and what the longterm effects are on childrens development and wellbeing There is little evidence on how children can build resilience and what protective factors exist Is exposure to risk necessary for the development of resilience What preventive strategies can be effective There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks vulnerability or support may influence childrens exposure to online risk and their experiences of harm more comprehensive model of online harm is needed which explores how the relationship between antecedents and consequences is mediated by the online environment Seeing negative content This refers to potentially negative usergenerated cognitive content This includes websites or online discussions where people talk about or show images of physically harming or hurting themselves committing suicide ways to be very thin such as being anorexic or bulimic taking drugs and gory or violent images The reviewed studies focus mainly on the effects of negative content on childrens behaviour Some aim to identify risk and protective factors The online content considered includes sites advocating eating disorders selfinjury and suicide or that involve exposure to violence The seven studies use variety of methodological approaches from small qualitative research to large representative surveys metaanalyses and evidence reviews The surveybased studies are cross sectional and some use convenience samples Geographically they cover European countries and the United States Bearing in mind the significant differences between the countries studied the applicability of the findings to other contexts particularly in the global South needs to be established Key findings As general pattern among the countries included here primarily European countries and also the United States it seems that older adolescents aged years are more likely to access negative content than young adults aged years and over Girls tend to be more likely to see eating disorder content while boys are more likely to access proselfharm and prosuicide content It seems more common for children to lease in passive exposure such as viewing violent content than active engagement such as liking or posting content The evidence on how where and why children come across this content is insufficient Shin and Lwin Bayraktar Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Lower levels of happiness with life previous offline and online victimization and lack of social support can increase childrens exposure to negative online content There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to negative content More analysis is needed on whether these differences are cultural related to national policies and regulation or related to other factors The interface and functionality of online platforms can make difference Imagebased anonymous and less moderated formats can facilitate the circulation of some usergenerated negative content The evidence on protective factors is somewhat limited Indicative findings suggest that happiness with life and social support can act as protective factors in relation to seeing negative content few of the studies discuss prevalence of exposure to negative content survey of respondents aged years across Finland Germany the United Kingdom and the United States suggests that sites that advocate eating disorders selfinjury and suicide are familiar to children and young people In all four countries per cent of respondents had seen selfinjury or suicide sites or both with exposure to both types of content more common than seeing only one type The same study found that girls are more likely to see eating disorder content while boys see more proselfharm and pro suicide content Intentional selfharm however is more common among young females than young males This may be explained by the fact that some boys may follow more violent content online The younger participants aged years were also more likely to access harmadvocating online content There is some evidence that exposure to harmful content varies among online platforms study of black and Hispanic youth in the United States found that it was more common on Facebook than Instagram and children usually experience passive exposure to it such as seeing content rather than active engagement such as liking or posting content lower level of happiness and previous online and offline victimization experiences are also associated with exposure to such online material Other risk factors relate to sociodemographic background variables such as not living with parents migrant background and urban residence The authors of the multicountry study conclude that those facing difficulties in their everyday life are at higher risk of accessing online sites that may foster unhealthy behaviour However the study found important crosscountry differences For example exposure rates to all three types of harmadvocating material were significantly lower in Germany possibly due to differences in regulation digital ecology and the general mental health of the youth population The different risk factors varied in significance in the different countries Some studies unpack the extent to which engagement with the internet plays an important role Using higher number of social media and online services is associated with higher risk of accessing harmadvocating online content the frequency of online activity is not Similarly qualitative study in Wales in the United Kingdom with sample of children and young people aged years with history of selfharm showed that the internet played an important part in participants selfharm Minkkinen et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Oksanen et al Stevens et al Oksanen et al Oksanen et al see also Turja et al Oksanen et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper practices The internet allows users to access information about selfharm consume images or participate in online communities of selfharmers which can normalize the practice It also allows them to seek support The participants discussed how seeing the images can provide sense of satisfaction or create desire to replicate them Sharing of ones own images was more likely to be linked to severe selfharm Those who wanted to share their own images preferred more visual platforms where posting is anonymous and less scrutinized or moderated The evidence on protective factors is scarce and needs further research It seems that happiness with life may be positively associated with lower risk of accessing negative content online on topics such as selfinjury and suicide It also seems that social support can act as protective factor Friends can create buffering effect for some young people For others closeness to family members is substantial protective factor and living without parents is risk factor Hurtful and bullying behaviour Hurtful behaviour online generally involves using digital technology and the internet to purposely share private information photos or videos in hurtful way or sending threatening or insulting messages via email instant messaging chat or texts It also includes spreading rumours and false information about the victim or purposely excluding them from online communications Cyberbullying is traditionally characterized by online harassment that is perpetrated repeatedly and involves power imbalance between the perpetrator and victim The literature reviewed here did not always differentiate between hurtful online behaviour and bullying online Bullying is not always operationalized online using the traditional defining features of repetition and power imbalance Thus this review includes online hurtful behaviour and cyberbullying jointly whether occurring repeatedly and involving power imbalance or otherwise Key findings are listed for each subsection The limitations of the material and suggestions for future research are given at the end of each subsection Cyberbullying This area of this theme produced some of the most extensive results with more than articles found To narrow the results the inclusion criteria were refined to include only surveybased research with higherquality sampling This reduced the sample to studies which were analysed and included in the review Even among the studies the majority are crosssectional and omit from their models the range of confounding variables previously shown to be significantly related to cyberbullying or online hurtful behaviour These include subjective wellbeing and social support The majority of studies cover experiences of children in the global North Australia European countries and the United States with few focusing on Asian countries and Israel Key findings Boys in the studies included here experience cyberbullying mainly through video games and text messages Girls experience it mainly through social media Boys are also more likely than girls to be perpetrators or victims who also perpetrate bullying Jacob et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Oksanen et al Turja et al Minkkinen et al Minkkenen et al Choi et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Perpetrators of cyberbullying are more likely to also be victims Online and offline perpetration and victimization are also highly correlated Cyberbullying perpetration and victimization have common predictors These include having weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family loneliness lower social likeability at school lower psychological wellbeing and having an impulsive personality Cyberbullying victimization is associated with lower psychological wellbeing and externalizing behaviours Protective factors in relation to cyberbullying include positive relationship with parents parental monitoring of childrens activities generally rather than online only teacher care enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence and resilience The evidence suggests that boys and girls experience cyberbullying differently in terms of both perpetration and victimization Overall boys are more likely to be perpetrators or victimperpetrators than girls although this is not supported by all studies Girls tend to be targeted more than boys for their appearance weight or sexuality They are also more likely to be the victims of genderbased harassment exclusion and reputational damage Boys and girls are targeted through different channels Boys tend to be victimized through video games and mobile phone text messages Girls are more likely to experience cyberbullying through social media There is strong correlation between cyberbullying victimization and perpetration as well as between online and offline perpetration and victimization Accordingly there are several common predictors of both cyberbullying perpetration and victimization These include having weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family loneliness lower social likeability at school lower psychological wellbeing and having an impulsive personality eg lack of selfcontrol While crosssectional studies show that high level of activity on social networking sites is predictor of cyberbullying victimization and perpetration longitudinal study in Germany demonstrated reverse relationship It showed that more frequent mobile and internet use was an outcome of cyberbullying victimization and perpetration Other risk factors associated with online bullying and harassment perpetration include lower self efficaciousness and empathy higher selfperceived popularity the need for popularity and the perception of high violence in childs neighbourhood Being the target of cyberbullying is associated with having physical or developmental disability living with single parent perceived poor school environment and social anxiety such as fear of negative evaluation from peers and social avoidance Backe et

Lee and Shin Abeele et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper and distress range of risk behaviours is also associated with cyberbullying victimization This includes use of alcohol or drugs at school an affiliation with gangs involving violence and engaging in risky internet behaviours such as publishing personal information on social networks The evidence on the role of parental mediation in cyberbullying is inconclusive While some studies found significant association between parental control and supervision of childrens online activities and lower cyberbullying perpetration and victimization others found no significant relationship One study even shows that parental mediation predicts higher likelihood of victimization The studies that found significant relationship show that the positive effect of parental control is mediated by less time spent online and decreased engagement in risky behaviours online On the other hand there is emerging evidence that what is important are childrens overall relationships with their parents and the monitoring of childrens activities in general rather than of their online activities in particular Looking at factors that can protect children from becoming victims of cyberbullying besides parental mediation researchers found significant impact of teacher care the presence of established and enforced school rules higher selfefficacy selfconfidence subjective wellbeing and resilience Examples of resilience include the ability to tolerate experiences such as change personal problems illness pressure failure and painful feelings Studies where cyberbullying victimization was used as predictor identified several negative outcomes among victims including the internalization of problems lower subjective wellbeing suicidal ideation depression anxiety including stress lower selfesteem physical symptoms emotional problems and actual suicide attempts One study showed that the most distressing incidents for children are those that involve both inperson and online elements multiple perpetrators and power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator Children in this study found technologyonly harassment less distressing Mixed incidents which occur both online and offline are more likely to involve repeated harassment and current or past friends or romantic partners as perpetrators This points to the potential importance of perpetrator identity in determining the negative impact of cyberbullying Cyberbullying victimization is also associated with long list of externalizing behaviours These include selfharm online and offline substance use viewing web content related to suicide and selfharm and more frequent mobile or internet use They may also involve social problems or peer problems for example children thinking that their peers do not like them Externalizing behaviours can also encompass problems with academic achievement and behavioural problems such as getting into fights damaging property and defiant behaviour GonzlezCabrera et al Choi et al Bevilacqua et al AlvarezGarcia et al Backe et al Mesch Pabian and Vandebosch

Cyberbystanders cyberbystander is someone who has observed or witnessed cyberbullying but was not its main perpetrator or victim Witnesses to bullying can take different roles They can act as assistants to the bully by following the main perpetrator and participating in bullying They can reinforce the bully by watching and laughing at the victim They can defend the victim interfering to protect or comfort the victim Or they can act as outsiders who observe but do not engage in any way Key findings More children are bystanders of cyberbullying than bullies or victims There are conflicting age and gender patterns in predicting cyberbystanding across different countries Whether bystanders intervene or remain outsiders depends on their own and the victims gender as well as their relationship with the perpetrator and the victim Bystanders of cyberbullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school Being witness of cyberbullying even if not perpetrator or victim can have an adverse effect on childrens quality of life over time We found nine studies on the topic of cyberbystanding mainly from Australia and European countries with one study from the Islamic Republic of Iran and another from Israel With couple of exceptions most studies use convenience sampling and correlational analyses Overall there is higher proportion of cyberbystanders than cyberbullies or cybervictims among children Gender seems to be predictor of cyberbystanding in some countries but not in others Girls are significantly more likely than boys to be cyberbystanders in Australia the Islamic Republic of Iran and Spain and among Jewish adolescents in Israel But there is no difference by gender among Arab adolescents in Israel and in the Republic of Korea One study found that girls in Spain are more likely to witness specific types of cyberbullying including sexual harassment online defamation and rumours insulting calls and dissemination of videos or photos With regard to the behaviours of cyberbystanders the gender of the observer and the victim of cyberbullying is an important factor Girls are more likely to take the role of defender of the victim while their male peers are more likely not to interfere study in Germany of schoolchildren aged years found that compared with boys girls are more empathetic have higher sense of responsibility and perceive more negative outcomes from cyberbystanding Boys are more likely to report feelings of moral disengagement Salmivalli et al Salmivalli Razjouyan et al Lee et al GonzlezCabrera et al LapidotLefler and Hosri Razjouyan et al Lee et al LapidotLefler and Hosri GonzlezCabrera et al Delgado and Escortel Delgado and Escortel Yudes et al Patterson et al Yudes et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Children who have larger online friendship networks are more likely to witness cyberbullying according to study on Australia and the Republic of Korea Offline friendship networks are significant predictor of cyberbystanding in the Republic of Korea but not in Australia According to another study age is significant predictor of witnessing cyberbullying in Colombia but not in Spain or Uruguay That same study showed that being an assistant to the bully was more common among younger children aged years than among young people aged years Two recent studies in Australia found that an important predictor of whether young person intervenes to help the victim is their relationship with the perpetrator andor the victim In qualitative study children mentioned that it was difficult to identify an interaction as cyberbullying or to know its harmful intentions and consequences to the target because of the vague nature of online communications Thus knowing the people involved is important for children to know how to react and whether to intervene This is confirmed in the German study which compared the emotional processes underlying the behaviour of witnesses to offline and online bullying According to this study bystanders of cyberbullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school They also perceive lower negative outcomes and lower selfefficacy than bystanders of school bullying However there was no difference in feelings of empathy between bystanders to cyberbullying and school bullying study in the Islamic Republic of Iran found no association between emotional intelligence and cyberbullying roles including cyber bystanding Only one study looked at the effect of cyberbystanding on children longitudinally It shows that cyber bystanders score higher on all dimensions of quality of life compared with cybervictims and cyber bullies Still the quality of life of cyberbystanders falls significantly over time after five months even when they have never been perpetrator or victim of cyberbullying Limitations and suggestions for further research Despite the significant amount of research on cyberbullying there is no unified definition or measurement for bullying For example some studies define bullying as involving repeated occurrences while others measure one or more incidents as bullying Similarly the measurement of cyberbystanding varies some studies include only cases where children have directly witnessed cyberbullying while others also include cases that children have only heard about or are aware of This affects the interpretation of the findings from individual studies and the ability to draw more generalizable conclusions about cyberbullying its incidence effects and protective factors Very few studies of cyberbullying investigate the relationship between victims and perpetrators and the implications of possible power imbalance only two studies did so finding that victims experience higher distress levels Hence it is important to better understand the circumstances within which cyberbullying occurs Lee et al Yudes et al Patterson et al Patterson et al Razjouyan et al GonzlezCabrera et al Mitchell et al Mitchell et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper More longitudinal studies are needed to shed some light on causality and longterm outcomes The majority of recent studies look at predictors but there seems to be much less research on the potential effect of cyberbullying and cyberbystanding on childrens wellbeing for example Many studies omit important individual and environmentallevel covariates that have proven to be significantly related to online bullying and harassment experiences in previous research These covariates include subjective wellbeing and social support Integrating childrens experiences of offline risks and protective factors with online risk experiences may be useful in developing more comprehensive models to understand cyberbullying The studies reviewed do not always distinguish between cyberbullying and cyberbystanding It is not always clear whether participants can indicate their adoption of multiple roles for example being cyberbully as well as cyberbystander Cyberhate discrimination and violent extremism Cyberhate is the use of digital technology to profess attitudes devaluing others because of their religion race ethnicity sex or gender sexual orientation national origin or some other characteristic It is distinct form of cyberviolence because it targets individuals based on their collective identity and belonging to group rather than based on their unique individuality We found only two studies that address cyberhate one comparing the United States and Finland and another based only in the United States We found none on violent extremism Both studies use an online survey and mix children with young adults in their research One is based on larger survey while the other includes quite specific groups ethnic minority from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or having history of selfharm Key findings Cyberhate materials usually pertain to group stereotyping blaming or advocating hate based on race sexual orientation religion nationality or immigration status sex or gender and politics There is some indicative evidence that greater online exposure to hate material may vary based on differences in internet use including the platforms used and the time spent online It may also vary based on user characteristics such as younger age migrant background or country of residence as well as some offline factors such as lower levels of happiness life satisfaction and trust in government The evidence gaps in this area are substantial and relate not only to prevalence but also to risk and vulnerable groups and most of all to protective factors The study based in the United States only used an online survey with sample of internet users aged years The survey produced demographically balanced panel data The researchers found that the majority of their sample had seen or heard hate material online in the previous three months Costello et al New publications that came out after the literature search was completed show large variations of cyberhate exposure between countries Machackova et al Increases in witnessing online hate are positively related to being perpetrator of online hate Wachs et al Girls tend to use strategies for coping with online hate more often than boys Younger teenagers more often use technical strategies than older teenagers Wachs et al Costello et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper In almost half of the cases the material pertained to group stereotypes followed by material blaming group for the nations problems or advocating hate towards group and material that called for violence or discrimination Mostly online hate pertained to race sexual orientation religion nationality or immigration status sex or gender and politics The respondents were most likely to encounter hate material on Facebook YouTube and Twitter the three most commonly used platforms Other risk factors include time spent online age origin and ethnicity and trust in government Each additional hour spent online increases the likelihood of seeing or hearing hate material But spending more than three hours day online reduces this likelihood This suggests both that those who view hate material online are likely to come upon it shortly after accessing the internet and that users who spend more time online tend to avoid hate material Individuals who distrust government are more inclined to view websites disseminating hate material The same is true for those from white or Hispanic background and people with at least one parent born outside of the United States Exposure to hate material decreases with age The study found no relation between exposure to cyberhate and risktaking closeness to friends and family offline gender or geographical location The second study was slightly younger online sample of individuals in the United States and individuals in Finland aged years It found that exposure to online hate was more frequent in the United States compared with Finland This was explained by the greater ethnic diversity and focus on freedom of speech in the United States The study found that people exposed to online hate were less satisfied with their lives and less happy in general This is possibly bidirectional relationship according to the authors Exposure leads to less wellbeing this can in turn lead to greater exposure the study reports If this is the case higher levels of exposure could be the result of vicious cycle Limitations and suggestions for further research The fact that we were able to identify only two cyberhate studies suggests that more evidence is needed in this area particularly on violent extremism Understanding the consequences of mere exposure compared to active engagement posting liking may be particularly important Another substantial gap relates to the lack of evidence on actual harm to children and the longterm effects Both of the studies discuss associations between different risk factors but can say very little about harm or causality particularly in relation to more durable outcomes for childrens wellbeing While the publications discuss range of background characteristics the evidence on protective factors is particularly patchy Future research should consider the potentially wide range of factors that could be examined in relation to childrens access to cyberhate and violent extremism content Costello et al Keipi et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper SEXUAL ACTIVITIES AND RISKS ONLINE Viewing or exchanging sexual content Childrens online sexual activities are mainly researched in terms of the exchange of sexual material in relation to range of activities such as cybersex exchanging sexualized content sexting chatting about sex or seeking sexual partners online The recent literature reviewed here however is dominated by research on sexting Exchanging sexual content sexting Sexting is defined as sending eceiving or exchanging selfproduced sexualized content This includes images messages or videos sent or received through mobile phones the internet or both Sexting can be positive experience and normal part of teenagers exploration of sexuality and relationships While it may be done among consenting children it may still place them at risk Sending or receiving sexual content can be nonconsensual including as result of coercion receiving unwanted sexual content through sexual bullying or harassment or sharing someone elses content without the persons consent We reviewed studies on sexting The overwhelming majority were conducted with children in European countries and the United States Most of the studies are quantitative They are predominantly crosssectional including large convenience samples of more than people and controlling only for demographic characteristics Only five studies can be considered methodologically robust with representative samples and adequate covariates or longitudinal design Key findings The factors that predict higher likelihood of sexting behaviour among children include gender male age older sexuality LGBTQI and socioeconomic status low Girls are more likely than boys to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers to have negative sexting experiences and to be vulnerable to coercive sexting victimization Most studies conceptualize sexting as deviant behaviour and do not acknowledge that it can be positive experience for teenagers who want to explore their sexuality and relationships Harm is often assumed rather than assessed One of the main limitations of the literature on childrens online sexual activities is the absence of relationship context in studying these interactions Many studies do not ask children about their relationship with their sexting or cybersex partners which precludes nuanced understanding of these interactions This is an important limitation given the evidence on differential outcomes depending on the identity of childrens sexting or cybersex partners Psychological problems reduced online safety and privacy online sexual solicitations by adults and offline risks such as sexual interactions with adults and dating violence are all associated with sexting Courtice and Shaughnessy United Nations Interagency Working Group on Sexual Exploitation of Children Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Gender age sexuality and socioeconomic status are among the factors that predict sexting behaviour among children Studies find that boys nonheterosexual children older teenagers and children from lower socioeconomic background are more likely to engage in sexting However there is evidence that girls are more likely to be asked for sexts to receive sexts from strangers and to have more negative sexting experiences Girls are also more vulnerable to coercive sexting victimization and to having their selfproduced sexual content sent to other people without their consent Boys and older children aged years are more likely to coerce partner to send messages with sexual content than girls aged years Sexting practices are shaped by broader gender and cultural contexts One study found that girls in the Netherlands but not boys who uploaded sexualized pictures of themselves on social media were more likely to engage in sexting than those who did not This is related to their sexual selfconcept of being sexually mature and efficacious and is moderated by their level of extroversion and the volume of sexual media they consume Qualitative research with children further highlights the gendered nature of the risk that comes with sexting Boys are culturally perceived as entitled to take pleasure in viewing sexual nude images of girls as way of fitting in with their peers On the other hand the unauthorized distribution of nude images of girls has more damaging impact on the girls reputations leading to them being stigmatized or slutshamed Children often place the responsibility for mitigating the risk from sexting on the person sending the sexts especially when this is girl Predictors of sexting among children include having romantic partner and trusting the person they are sexting Sexting is also associated with having an extroverted less agreeable and less conscientious personality type as well as with higher levels of neuroticism especially depression impulsiveness and vulnerability to stress Two studies conducted with representative samples in Australia and in European countries found that children who sext are more likely to have emotional problems as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours even though framing sexting as deviant and necessarily harmful behaviour was criticized by the researchers who see sexting as normal part of the teenage exploration of sexuality and relationships Milton et al Alonso and Romero Morelli et al van Oosten and Vandenbosch Wolfe et al Romo et al Patchin and Hinduja GmezGuadix et al Buren and Lunde

and Aubrey Alonso and Romero GmezGuadix et al Sevcikova Milton et al For positive view of sexting see Albury Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The Australian study examines range of covariates including time spent on the internet cyber bullying perceived social support digital literacy and information and communications technology safety skills There is some indicative evidence on possible longerterm negative effects from longitudinal study with convenience sample of about children It shows that sending sexts predicts decrease in positive emotions one year later This is without controlling for whether the initial sexting experience was positive or negative Aspects of the digital context can also be related to sexting behaviour representative study in the United States found that receiving sexts was positively linked to using phone during school hours and negatively associated with being on family mobile phone plan and going to school that supervises the use of phones Some studies found positive relationship between childrens sexting and latenight internet use disclosure of personal information online talking to people they first met online and regular viewing of online pornography In terms of online safety and privacy children who sext are less likely to have preventive privacy behaviours They are less careful with what they post online and more likely to give out personal information like their real name home address and phone number Childrens engagement in sexting is also related to their experiences offline Some studies show connection to other risktaking behaviours both sexual and nonsexual This means that some children live in culture of higher risktaking Children who send sexts are more likely to engage in other risktaking behaviours such as increased alcohol consumption having more sexual experiences having their first sexual interaction at younger age and having unsafe sex However the relationship between sexual intercourse and sexting is only significant for younger boys but not girls aged years and for adolescents aged years The relationship context within which sexting occurs is important for some outcomes study in Belgium of students aged years shows that the positive relationship between sexting and lifetime substance use and heavy drinking is only significant among children who send sexts to people other than their romantic partners Receiving and sending sexts is related to online sexual solicitations and having sexual interactions with adults such as sending sexual content or meeting offline for sexual contact It is also related to cyberbullying victimization and perpetration However longitudinal study of students aged years in Galicia Spain found that sending sexts predicted decrease in victimization in general such as being hit insulted or threatened but did not find significant relationship with cyberbullying victimization Moreover there is positive relationship between Alonso and Romero Wolfe et al Milton et al Buren and Lunde Stanley et al Milton et al Sevcikova Van Ouytsel et al Romo et al Sevcikova Van Ouytsel et al Buren and Lunde de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Alonso and Romero Machimbarrena et al Milton et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Alonso and Romero Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper the exchange of sexts and datingviolence perpetration and victimization as well as with experiencing interpersonal violence and abuse within childrens intimate relationships Examples of interpersonal violence include facetoface emotional physical and sexual violence Viewing sexual content online Viewing sexual content online includes exposure to pictures or videos of sexually explicit material such as nudity and people having sex including pornography Pornography for this review is specifically defined as sexually explicit media intended for sexual arousal While most studies test childrens intentional exposure to sexually explicit material online few also include measure of accidental exposure Eighteen studies in our review looked at viewing sexual content online The majority are from European countries Studies mainly use large convenience samples with only demographic control variables and crosssectional designs Key findings Children view sexual content online to learn about sex but tend to see mens dominance and violent behaviours against women Boys are more likely than girls to view such content Children who are more interested in sex are also more likely to view sexual content online They are also more likely to have experiences of risky sexual activities such as casual sex sexual sensation seeking and exposure to unwanted sexual solicitation This suggests multiple vulnerabilities and risk of harm for some children In the studies reviewed here boys had greater exposure than girls to sexual content online as is the case with other online sexual activities Children who view sexual content online tend to believe that they can learn something from it and are more likely to view online pornography They are more likely to engage in other sexrelated activities such as casual sex or engaging in sexual sensationseeking They are also more prone to have instrumental attitudes towards sex meaning that they perceive sex as core instrument for sexual gratification and to be exposed to unwanted sexual solicitation They are more apt to meet face to face with someone they first got to know online Several factors both internetrelated and not mediate some of these relationships For example viewing sexual content online is related to sexual sensationseeking especially for those children who engage in online sexual activities more frequently as well as those who think that internet pornography has more damaging effects on others than on themselves Viewing sexual content is related to sexting for children who have higher alcohol consumption Morelli et al Stanley et al Chen et al BallesterArnal et al Vandenbosch and van Oosten Stanley et al Chen et al Chang et al Marret and Choo Chen et al Morelli et al Vandenbosch and van Oosten Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper study in Australia that explored the content children are exposed to when watching sexual content online revealed that significantly more children see mens pleasure mens dominance and mens violent behaviours against women than vice versa It also found that girls are more likely than boys to recognize violence against women in pornography These findings are concerning given the evidence that children use pornography to learn about sex Still the findings explain the association among boys between viewing pornography and having sexually aggressive behaviour and holding negative gender attitudes There is much less evidence on protective factors and outcomes in relation to viewing sexual content online Support from parents or friends but not teachers seems to provide buffer against the negative effect of sexually aggressive behaviour associated with viewing online pornography There is no evidence that parental use of internet filtering successfully protects children from encountering sexual content online There are also significant gaps in terms of outcomes One study found no direct relationship between viewing online pornography and its impact on mental health outcomes once the consequences of general internet use are taken into account These consequences include sleep loss and withdrawal when the internet is inaccessible Limitations and suggestions for further research Childrens engagement with digitally mediated sexual activities such as sexting or viewing sexual content online need to be studied in the context of childrens intimacy partner relationships and desire to learn about sex These practices must be understood within the cultures of teenage sociality that both encourage and regulate the exchange of sexual material Future research needs to reflect more closely how children perceive online sexual activities and to remain open to the possibility that for some such activities are beneficial Studying online sexual activities as deviant and harmful behaviours does not correspond with the experiences of all children Another limitation at present relates to the different ways in which studies operationalize sexting with some studies looking only at sending sexts or only at receiving sexts This creates partial picture of the predictors and outcomes of different types of sexting For example it is not clear why some children are more likely to receive than send sexts An area that needs further exploration is the motivations and outcomes of different types of sexting especially the sharing of sexts of others without their consent With regard to the evidence on viewing sexual content future studies should link the content that children see online to outcomes Currently issues of content and outcomes are studied Davis et al Davis et al Lykens et al Doornwaard et al Shin and Lee Shin and Lee Przybylski and Nash Hokby et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper separately Studies should also distinguish between accidental and intentional viewing of sexual content online and the different kinds of sexual content that children may be exposed to Finally more evidence is needed on the impact of viewing sexual content online on childrens wellbeing in general Overall there is lack of clarity regarding the protective role of social support from family and friends in relation to patterns of childrens online sexual activities and their outcomes Studies have not found that family support reduces the likelihood of children sending sext to strangers nor that parents use of internet filtering decreases childrens exposure to sexual content online Nonetheless there is evidence that parental and friend support can act as buffer against the negative effects of viewing online pornography including against sexually aggressive behaviour Parental discussions with children about online privacy settings also reduce the risk of sexting This calls for closer investigation into the impact of different forms of social support on childrens online sexual activities Sexual exploitation and abuse online We define online sexual exploitation and abuse as including all acts of child sexual abuse child prostitution production or dissemination of child sexual abuse materials child corruption the intentional causing for sexual purposes of child to witness sexual abuse or sexual activities and solicitation of children for sexual purposes These acts can take place virtually but can be preceded or accompanied by or can develop into exploitation offline We identified studies on online sexual exploitation and abuse They generally focus on prevalence predictors and risk and protective factors The majority of studies were conducted in European countries with smaller number in the United States and in countries of East and Southeast Asia Most often these studies include older teenagers Children under years of age are generally missing from the evidence base Some studies conflate children with young adults The studies vary in the extent to which they operate within the parameters of our definition of online sexual exploitation and abuse Our search yielded no studies on children exploited infor prostitution child sexual abuse materials or child corruption There are variations in relation to who the perpetrator is and how the child regards the interaction For example some studies specify that the perpetrator is an adult Others also include peers or strangers without asking about age Some research asks children about only unwanted sexual experiences while other studies leave this open This makes it challenging at times to identify the precise definition used in the research and to establish comparability of findings Key findings Online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to combination of factors related to three areas namely the digital context online activities and skills childrelated factors gender age well being offline risks and the social context factors related to family peers and community Children who are more vulnerable offline perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have less protection and support are also more vulnerable online Council of Europe For review of the evidence on child sexual exploitation and abuse see also Radford et al and UNICEF Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Online victimization can create real risks for the offline victimization of children Being asked to do something sexual online is strong predictor of children meeting in person for sexual purposes an adult they first got to know online In assessing the risk factors the studies mainly focus on three areas The first is the digital context which covers childrens online activities and occasionally skills The second area deals with child related factors such as gender and age wellbeing and offline behaviour for example sensation seeking risktaking and experiences of violence The third is the social context which covers factors related to family peers and community An overall conclusion supported by all studies is that online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to combination of factors across all three areas but that children who are more vulnerable offline perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have less protection and support are also more vulnerable online Children who are at higher risk of victimization tend to be female older teenagers LGBTQI children and children from ethnic minority backgrounds They are also more likely to have experienced other forms of online and offline violence to lack social support and to engage in risky online behaviour such as posting personal information or pictures online and chatting to strangers Factors not significantly related to online sexual exploitation and abuse include childrens selfesteem the number of people on their contact lists and the use of and length of time spent on social networking sites We explore this further in relation to specific types of online sexual exploitation and abuse There is range of protective factors identified in this literature in relation to online sexual exploitation and abuse including enabling parental mediation helpseeking and the ability to recognize violence in personal relationships For better understanding of the incidence and impact of child sexual exploitation and abuse we need to acknowledge the interconnection of childrens existing vulnerabilities both online and offline and the presence of protective factors at both the individual and social level Below we examine the evidence on online sexual solicitation sextortion and cyber dating violence Sexual solicitation online Sexual solicitation also referred to as grooming denotes the process of establishing relationship with child either in person or through the use of information and communication technologies to facilitate online or offline sexual contact Online sexual solicitation refers to requests to child to share personal sexual information or engage in sexual activities or sexual talk through digital technologies This topic yielded the most evidence of all topics in the area of online sexual exploitation and abuse total of publications Most of the research is quantitative using schoolbased survey methods and cluster or stratified random sampling In four cases convenience sampling was used One study used an online panel Most of the research is crosssectional except for one longitudinal study in Taiwan Province of China However even when the studies use large samples overall drilling down to sexual solicitation victims produces small samples DeMarco et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix United Nations Sklenarova et al Chang et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Only one of the studies in our sample is qualitative in that it uses focus groups One study includes young adults but was retained as it is retrospective and covers the preadulthood period Geographically the research covers Asia India Japan Malaysia the Republic of Korea Taiwan Province of China and Thailand Europe Cyprus Germany Ireland Italy the Netherlands Spain and the United Kingdom and the United States Key findings Girls and older teenagers are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation according to most studies but there are exceptions Being subjected to online sexual solicitation is associated with online risk behaviours including exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online having unknown people as friends on social media voluntary sexting video chatting with strangers time spent online on weekdays but not on weekends and high levels of gaming There is connection between being vulnerable offline and online Online sexual solicitation is correlated with offline exposure to violence neglect physical punishment psychological victimization parental conflict sexual harassment and sexual solicitation Perpetrators are mixture of strangers and people known to the child Perpetrators of online sexual solicitation are less likely to be known to the child than perpetrators of facetoface sexual abuse Social support can act as protective factor Children who lack such social resources face double disadvantage they are more likely to experience online sexual solicitation and less likely to seek help The publications indicated that to per cent of those surveyed had been subjected to sexual solicitations by an adult and to per cent had received unwanted sexual solicitations regardless of the age of the perpetrator The differences are likely to be related to both methodological approaches and country specificities The majority of the studies in the review found that girls experience online sexual solicitation unwanted or not specified more often than boys including in Ireland Italy Spain Sweden and the United Kingdom But in some contexts such as Taiwan Province of China boys are more likely than girls to experience online sexual solicitation In Malaysia both genders are equally likely to be subjected to online sexual solicitation and boys are sometimes found to be more likely than girls to be perpetrators of unwanted sexual solicitation few studies explore how sexual solicitation experiences vary by childrens age There is some evidence from two studies in Spain which suggests that age is an important factor This research found that children aged years were significantly more likely to receive requests to engage in sexual activities or in sexual talk or to give out personal sexual information than their younger peers Groenestein et al DeMarco et al Montiel et al Machimbarrena et al Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin de Santisteban and Gmez Guadix DeMarco et al Chang et al Marret and Choo Marret and Choo Montiel et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper aged years Age and gender were also found to be important factors by German study with children aged years which looked at their online sexual interactions with adults and peers These interactions included having sexual conversation exchanging pictures and cybersex The study found that half per cent of children had engaged in some type of online sexual activity While this activity mostly involved peers about one in five children in this study had had sexual interaction with an adult Of the children who engage in online sexual activities about one in five have experiences of being solicited for sexual purposes Overall only per cent of their sexual interactions with peers and per cent of such interactions with adults are perceived as negative This study found that the children experiencing online sexual solicitation were more likely to be girls older teenagers gay or bisexual not living with both parents of foreign nationality and lacking in social support The majority of studies do not ask children about their relationship with the person soliciting them It can be concluded from recent evidence that the perpetrators are mixture of strangers and people known to the child study conducted in Cyprus with children and young adults aged years found that in cases of online sexual solicitation the perpetrator was less likely to be known to the individual than in cases of facetoface sexual abuse Spanish study with younger sample of children aged years showed that in two thirds of online solicitation cases children first met their perpetrator online That same study found that two thirds of the children who engaged in sexual interactions with adults reported the use of some form of persuasion strategy by their perpetrator The study tested three persuasion techniques used by adults in the sexual solicitation of children deception meaning to pretend to be someone else bribery defined as offering money or gifts and the formation of non sexual emotional relationship It found that online sexual solicitations such as requests by an adult for child to send sexual pictures or videos or to engage in cybersex were associated with the use of deception and bribery Sexual interactions for example where children agree to send an adult sexual pictures or videos of themselves or to meet an adult offline to have sexual contact are related to the formation of nonsexual emotional relationship This means that children may be groomed to develop feelings of closeness and intimacy with the adult perpetrator which can then lead directly to sexual interaction and abuse without the mediation of sexual solicitation study in Malaysia of children aged years shows that slightly more than half of the children who were in contact with an unknown person online were invited to facetoface meeting and that per cent of these children went to this meeting Nearly one third of the children reported that the person they met was an adult who posed as minor More than half of the children who met people they first got to know online went to the meeting alone and had met more than six people separately Boys are more likely to meet people face to face as are children who go online in internet cafs view pornography online and disclose personal information on the internet Not being explicitly Sklenarova et al Sklenarova et al Karayianni et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al GmezGuadix et al Marret and Choo Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper forbidden by parents to meet strangers or to use certain websites and chat rooms also increases the likelihood of meeting people offline Of the children who said they had met person they first got to know online per cent reported that they had been assaulted either sexually or physically More than half of these children experienced multiple types of assaults Forced sexual intercourse was reported by respondents in the study males females Several studies explore the role of childrens online activities in relation to the experience of online sexual solicitation longitudinal study in Taiwan Province of China shows that higher levels of online gaming exposure to online pornography posting personal information or pictures online and chatting to strangers via webcam are associated with higher likelihood of exposure to an unwanted sexual solicitation Sexual solicitation is also significantly associated with having unknown people on list of social networking friends voluntary sexting instant messaging or using video chat and time spent online on weekdays but not on weekends Comparing children who are only solicited for sexual purposes with those who are also involved in sexual interaction with an adult meaning that they sent sexual photos or videos of themselves or met face to face with an adult they previously met online the latter are more likely than the former to have played online games to have used chat and to have met new people online Other risk factors include perpetration of online harassment and aggression Being asked to do something sexual online is strong predictor of child meeting in person for sexual purposes an adult they first got to know online There is connection between being vulnerable offline and online Children who are exposed offline to sexual harassment solicitation bullying among boys and parental conflict are also more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation Both physical sexual abuse and online sexual solicitation are significantly correlated with exposure to violence neglect physical punishment and psychological victimization However children experiencing both types of sexual abuse do not experience higher odds of these outcomes than those experiencing only one of them study of children and young people aged years living in Cyprus found that those from urban areas and those whose fathers educational level was lower were more likely to report online sexual solicitation and physical abuse The vicious cycle continues as children who have experienced online solicitation are then more likely to experience sexual violence and abuse offline There is very little research on the effects of sexual solicitation on children Depressive symptoms are significantly positively associated with online sexual solicitation according to studies with children in Spain and Taiwan Province of China but this association was found only among girls in Sweden Marret and Choo Chang et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Marret and Choo Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin DeMarco et al DeMarco et al Karayianni et al Karayianni et al Nagamatsu et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Chang et al Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper Low levels of helpseeking reporting experiences of illicit solicitation to friends parents or helpline are associated with higher rates of online sexual solicitation Children who have stronger social support from parents and friends are more likely to show protective behaviour and seek help after experiencing online sexual solicitation Children who have been involved in risky behaviour offline such as intoxication illicit drug use absenteeism from school or having problems with teachers are also more likely to seek help after experiencing online sexual solicitation This suggests that children can also develop protective strategies and resilience Parenting plays key role in protecting children recent crosssectional study conducted across six countries shows that instructive parental mediation is negatively related to being victim of online sexual solicitation among children aged years while restrictive mediation predicts higher levels of victimization Sextortion Sexual extortion sometimes referred to as sextortion is the threatened dissemination of images of sexual nature without consent usually to exact revenge or procure benefits such as additional images sexual acts or money Our database search for the period yielded only one study on sextortion among nationally representative sample of children conducted by Patchin and Hinduja The study of children aged years in the United States used singleitem dichotomous questions for measuring victimization and offending The findings from this study may only be relevant for children in the United States and should not be generalized to other countries Key findings Sextortion usually occurs within existing relationships romantic or friendship and much less by among people unknown to each other Children involved in offending are also more likely to be victims of sextortion The data on sextortion are mostly inconclusive with large variation between studies According to the studies in our sample boys are more likely to be involved in sextortion than girls both as victims and perpetrators but are less likely to tell anyone about it Victims are more likely to be nonheterosexual There are no differences based on age and race The study indicates that per cent of children aged years had reported ever being victims of sextortion Three per cent had reported being offenders There is connection between offending and victimization Those involved in one role are more likely to also be involved in the other similar to online bullying Unlike other forms of sexual exploitation where girls tend to be the victims sextortion victims are more likely to be boys and to be nonheterosexual Boys are also more likely than girls to target others The study found no difference in sextortion experiences by race and no consistent Marret and Choo Zetterstrm Dahlqvist and Gillander Gdin DeMarco et al DeMarco et al DeMarco et al Wachs et al United Nations Patchin and Hinduja Patchin and Hinduja Some studies find that girls are more likely to be sextortion victims See for example sextortion Such differences may be due to reporting measurement or local differences Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper difference concerning age except that yearolds are generally more likely to be involved compared with children of other ages The victims of sextortion experience range of harms such as being stalked or harassed per cent of boys and per cent of girls being contacted repeatedly online or over the phone per cent of boys and per cent of girls or having fake profile created in their name per cent of boys and per cent of girls In about one in four cases the sextortion results in the sharing of the image with someone else without permission According to the study by Patchin and Hinduja boys are significantly less likely to tell someone including parent the police or their school about sextortion incident Only per cent report it compared with per cent of girls When boys do tell someone they most often turn to friend per cent compared with per cent of girls Girls most often turn to their parent per cent compared with per cent of boys Very few sextortion victims report the incident to the site or app on which it occurred per cent of boys and per cent of girls Intimate partner violence online Intimate partner violence online is broadly defined as abusive behaviour such as harassment control or stalking within sexual relationship or by dating partner facilitated by technology Five studies and one metareview in our sample address cyberdating violence The research is based in Europe Belgium Bulgaria Cyprus England in the United Kingdom Italy Norway and Spain and the United States It employs schoolbased surveys mostly with convenience sampling methods One study employs purposive sample stratified by community risk factors such as poverty unemployment minority populations rental housing femaleheaded households and community violence with random selection of schools and participants Key findings Girls are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence as are children transitioning to adolescence those in heterosexual relationship those who have wider age gap with their partner and those who have experienced bullying victimization or perpetration Adverse childhood experiences such as exposure to violence abuse and other trauma and risk taking such as alcohol binge drinking for boys and early and unsafe sex for girls are riskpredicting factors Girls are more negatively affected by the experience of intimate partner violence than boys and are more likely to be monitored or pressured by their partner Parental involvement such as monitoring and emotional bonding can be protective factor in relation to intimate partner violence online But there is no association with family and peer support community engagement among children or school connectedness SmithDarden et al Van Ouytsel et al Backe et al SmithDarden et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper The evidence suggests that girls are more likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence as are those who are younger than their partner those in heterosexual relationship and those who have experience of bullying victimization or perpetration Girls are more likely to be sent too many messages that make them feel uncomfortable to be pressured to share passwords or respond quickly to calls or texts or to have their messages whereabouts and activities monitored by their partner wider age gap between the partners and being the victim of such electronic intrusion are associated with higher likelihood of perpetration Girls are also more negatively affected by the experience than boys Gender plays an important role in relation to predictive risk factors study with children and young people in Belgium aged years who had been victims of cyberdating abuse found that male victims were significantly more likely to have engaged in alcohol binge drinking while girls were more likely to have been sexually active at younger age and to have had unprotected sex Another study which tested the relationship between family school and communitylevel factors and various forms of cyberdating aggression among children in the United States found that gender male predicts coercive sexting but not cyberstalking or online harassment Perpetration of intimate partner and cyberdating violence is overall more common among children transitioning to adolescence and those from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds according to United Statesbased study As with online sexual solicitation offline vulnerability and parenting are significant factors predicting victimization and protection Adverse childhood experiences such as exposure to violence abuse and other trauma significantly predict higher rates of cyberdating aggression perpetration Parental involvement in the form of parental monitoring and emotional bonding is significantly associated with lower likelihood of perpetration of all forms of cyberdating aggression Perceived safety of the community predicts lower levels of cyberstalking only There is no association between intimate partner or cyberdating violence and family and peer support community engagement among children or school connectedness Limitations and suggestions for further research As with most of the other aspects of childrens internet use more evidence is needed on the long term outcomes for children of experiencing online sexual exploitation and abuse For example more evidence is required on recovery time and on childrens capacity to form healthy attachments to trustworthy others in both the immediate aftermath and later in life We need to understand the offline context of childrens lives to identify risk and protective factors for online sexual exploitation and abuse and how to support childrens ability to cope What role do cultural taboos and poverty or inequality play in facilitating sexual exploitation and abuse online or offline Backe et al Hellevik and verlien Reed et al Reed et al Hellevik and verlien Van Ouytsel et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al SmithDarden et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper If we are to understand online sexual exploitation and abuse we need more evidence to explain the pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability their exposure to online sexual solicitation and their response to it This would entail developing model mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens background and living environment home school community with the occurrence of sexual solicitations and sexual abuse There are inconsistencies and variations in how researchers define measure and explain online sexual exploitation and abuse This creates challenges for identifying clear model of vulnerability and protection In most studies the relationship between children and the perpetrators is unclear Further gaps relate to the online platforms where such interactions happen and how they unfold There is more focus in the literature on associations between online sexual exploitation of children and other risk factors and much less on the experiences of harm and the longterm impact on childrens wellbeing and outcomes There needs to be an exploration of the nature of online platforms applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against child sexual exploitation Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING The studies we reviewed typically offer narrow measure of childrens psychological wellbeing more comprehensive model is needed promising solution can be offered by the work of Ryff an American academic and psychologist which is among the most popular conceptualizations of psychological wellbeing Her model of wellbeing incorporates measures of six dimensions self acceptance positive relations with others personal growth purpose in life environmental mastery and autonomy This model has been successfully applied by The Childrens Society in its international survey of childrens wellbeing Childrens Worlds which in wave involves child participants aged years from countries around the world This research makes connections between wellbeing and childrens lives and daily activities their time use and their own perceptions and evaluations of their wellbeing Ryffs model can be supplemented by measures of depression selfharm and life satisfaction It is worth noting that wellbeing may be positioned as an outcome or as an input for example as measure of child vulnerability We identified studies on digital technology and its relation to mental health and wellbeing most of which are based in Europe Belgium Estonia Hungary Italy Lithuania the Netherlands Northern Ireland United Kingdom Norway Spain Sweden and Wales United Kingdom and North America Canada and the United States smaller number of studies address the context in parts of Asia and the Middle East China the Islamic Republic of Iran Israel the Republic of Korea Taiwan Province of China and Thailand The research is predominantly surveybased with only one qualitative study and one metaanalysis The majority of quantitative studies are crosssectional and face methodological issues such as small or convenience samples There are several longitudinal studies in the review but some of them are limited in their findings by sampling issues Key findings Longterm outcomes related to childrens wellbeing mental health or resilience are rarely explored The evidence on how factors related to digital device and internet use may intersect with offline factors and predict child wellbeing requires development The evidence on the impact of childrens internet use on mental health and wellbeing is mixed and inconclusive Some studies show positive association between internet use and negative outcomes such as anxiety depression suicidal thoughts and panic disorder while others show negative association and some studies show no relationship at all In most cases there is only evidence about an association not causality child who uses the internet excessively and experiences poor mental health may be using digital technologies as way of coping with preexisting issues The internet can have positive effect on mental health and wellbeing Children who receive mental health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have reduced depression levels Ryff For more

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper What matters for childrens mental health is less the time spent using the internet and social media and more how children use their time online and the consequences of that use recent UNICEF review on the impact of digital technology use on childrens mental health and well being found that the evidence to date is largely inconclusive It concludes that childrens use of digital technology is more often assessed in terms of the time spent online rather than by measuring such factors as the type of online activities children engage in or the context of internet use This evidence review found similarly mixed results While some studies show positive association between internet use and mental health problems others find negative association or no association at all For example findings from crosssectional and longitudinal studies conducted in China the Islamic Republic of Iran the Republic of Korea and the United States show significant association between increased digital social media or internet use and higher levels of anxiety depressive symptoms suicidal ideation panic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD This association is stronger among children who do not live with either of their parents In contrast three longitudinal studies from Canada European countries and the United States found no significant direct impact of the time children spend using digital technologies such as social media the internet and texting on their mental health in terms of depression and anxiety Another study found that moderate social media use was associated with the highest levels of mental wellbeing compared with either too much or too little social media use It is plausible that these conflicting results stem from the different ways in which digital media use is measured Comparing longitudinal studies it seems that those that find no relationship with mental health measure use in terms of hours spent online per day or per week Studies that do find an association measure the number of times per day or per week that children use certain digital platforms or do specific activities such as sending messages or using social media Several studies show that what matters for childrens mental health is not merely the time spent using the internet and social media but rather how children use this time what they experience online and the consequences of that use More specifically it is the negative perceived impact of high levels of internet use or social media stress on sleep loss and withdrawal negative mood when the internet is inaccessible that indirectly mediates the adverse effect on mental health over time Another study found that children who report frequent daily use across all social media platforms suffer worse mental health problems compared with low social media use subgroups The possible causal relationship between intense internet use and decreased mental health and well being is rarely studied Hence it is often difficult to say whether excessive use of digital technologies is KardefeltWinther Liu et al Lee et al Khodarahimi and Fathi Zhang et al Kim Ra et al Vannucci and McCauley Ohannessian Lim et al Lee et al George et al Heffer et al Hokby et al Shimoga et al Hokby et al van der Schuur et al Vannucci and McCauley Ohannessian Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper the cause or consequence of poor mental health In fact one study found evidence of reverse causation where greater depressive symptoms predicted more frequent social media use although only among girls Most studies do not show significant gender differences in these associations study in the United States of students aged years examined digital selfharm defined as the anonymous online posting sending or otherwise sharing of hurtful content about oneself The authors found that it was significantly correlated with experiences of depressive symptoms qualitative study with children with previous history of selfharm revealed that the internet can act as catalyst for childrens selfharm behaviours normalizing them through their participation in online communities where others share selfharm practices and techniques and through easy access to images that invoke physical reaction and inspire behavioural enactment Digital selfharm is also associated with other experiences of violence and risk both offline and online such as school bullying and cyberbullying drug use and participation in various forms of adolescent deviance such as attacking someone or stealing These results tie in with the evidence of the positive association between cyberbullying victimization and online sexual solicitation among children and suicidal thoughts depression and anxiety Another group of studies demonstrates the positive impact of internet use on mental health and wellbeing Higher levels of childrens wellbeing are positively associated with receiving mental health support online and with speaking to friends online regarding personal problems Similarly decreased levels of depression are associated with freely revealing negative emotions online Social media use can be positive coping mechanism for socially rejected children because they tend to use it to share their personal difficulties positive effect on mental health is also observed when internet use is perceived to make life more meaningful improve school grades or enhance performance Thus besides time spent online it is important to understand the ways in which children use the internet and social media what they are exposed to while online and the mediating perceived consequences of that use to have better idea of the impact on their mental health An overwhelming majority of the studies we reviewed do not measure outcomes at all Instead they describe the incidence of certain behaviours but leave their consequences unexplored Among the studies that do examine outcomes most outcomes measured in online risk research are immediate and topicrelevant Longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health or resilience are rarely explored For instance in studies of cyberbystanding one outcome measured is that of expressed empathy with the victim following an intervention But the longterm consequences of being cyber Heffer et al Pa tchin and Hinduja Jacob et al Fisher et al Hinduja and Patchin Kim et al Nikolaou Chang et al de Santisteban and GmezGuadix Best et al Xie et al Ophir Hokby et al Delgado and Escortel Razjouyan et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper bystander are not examined In studies of online sexual solicitation shortterm outcome measured may be helpseeking from friends or family while longerterm outcomes that may be related to well being and mental health are not explored Efforts to tackle longterm consequences present methodological challenge for crosssectional studies Measures of wellbeing may be positioned as an outcome or as an input such as measure of child vulnerability Studies that acknowledge this problem tend to posit bidirectional or transactional process whereby more vulnerable young people may become drawn into online risk and in turn find themselves more likely to experience harm or they simply observe correlations For instance one study found correlation between sexting and negative mental health and wellbeing such as suicidal thoughts and behaviours and body image concerns Strikingly we found few studies exploring the consequences of online sexual solicitation on victims wellbeing The literature clearly assumes that these are adverse but the evidence and the measures needed are underdeveloped the Disrupting Harm project will address this gap In the research on sexting there is little examination of outcomes which is also problematic though here the outcomes are less certain since sexting can be either voluntary or coerced behaviour Limitations and suggestions for further research One substantial gap in the literature relates to the lack of comprehensive approach to studying the relationship between internet use and wellbeing and how offline factors may influence outcomes Crossnational research on childrens wellbeing in relation to the offline domain demonstrates the importance of wide range of childrelated factors These include age gender home context family relationships peer relationships school context teacher relationships neighbourhood quality health and safety and risk behaviours such as obesity substance abuse violence and sexual risktaking Countrylevel factors such as gross domestic product and income inequality are not strong predictors of child wellbeing We found no studies examining how factors related to digital device and internet use may intersect with offline factors and predict child wellbeing This highlights the need for further research With few exceptions most studies focus on the impact on mental health of time spent using the internet without considering the nature or context of the different activities that children engage in online When testing the impact of time spent online researchers rarely include variables related to the perceived quality of online experiences or issues to do with online victimization such as cyber bullying Knauf et al DeMarco et al Milton et al Newland et al UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti Newland et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA Robust highquality and comparable research is still necessary In many areas our knowledge remains tentative The large majority of studies we found are based on small or nonrepresentative samples involve correlational analyses of crosssectional data and control for limited number of background variables While such studies offer some insights their limitations make it difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the childs wider life environment We need better representation of the diversity of childrens circumstances At present most research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North Evidence on the preteenage years and from global South countries is sparse Filling these gaps will enhance our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability and the protective factors that help to build resilience We still need to learn more about the positive effects of childrens internet use Only one fifth out of of the studies we reviewed explore opportunities and benefits of internet use In contrast childrens encounters with certain online risks particularly excessive internet use cyber bullying gambling and problematic gaming feature heavily in the research literature Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet without including variables related to the perceived quality or context of online experiences or experiences related to online victimization for example cyberbullying This is serious limitation which constrains our understanding of which activities are more relevant to positive child outcomes Even more so as recent research demonstrates that subjective measures of time spent online can be highly unreliable There are significant crosscountry differences in childrens exposure to opportunities and risks We need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of childrens internet use to develop better understanding of what factors are significantly associated with positive and negative experiences and how much these matter for different groups of children To do so we also need more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable comparative research More evidence is needed on the outcomes of childrens internet use While studies may link childrens online experiences to predictive factors in their life circumstances they rarely follow up on the consequences of childrens internet use over time to document either benefits or harms The evidence is particularly scarce in relation to longterm outcomes such as wellbeing mental health and resilience which require longitudinal research To develop the longitudinal evidence base in this field we need more longterm investment funding for and research commitment to the study of childrens outcomes implementing efficient ways to account for the rapid changes in the digital environment We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are linked for example childrens online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations and generated hypotheses about how these shape childrens wellbeing in an increasingly digital world few recently published studies have tested these models We have begun this process in our recent country comparative report comparing Global Kids Online findings for crossnational similarities and differences see Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World Innocenti Discussion Paper We need better understanding of childrens digital ecology There needs to be some exploration of the nature of digital devices online platforms applications services and networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm More evidence is needed to explain the pathways between childrens online and offline vulnerability exposure to both offline and online risks and childrens responses to risk Investigating these pathways would entail developing model of mechanisms mapping the digital ecology perpetrators behaviours childrens digital skills and online activities and childrens backgrounds and living environment home school community with the occurrence of different types of risk and harm online This should be done using combination of analyses of personal countrylevel and digital ecology factors that can foster or prevent childrens exposure to risk There is an urgent need for childcentred research methods to complement the recent evidence We still do not understand anywhere near enough about how children see these issues We need research on cultures of childhood as they are experienced by children themselves For example we need research on forms of sexual exploration online that may be tolerated or even encouraged because they have positive impacts on childrens evolving identities There is need for researchers to conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences in their own words For more on childcentered research see Third et al For further suggestions see Stoilova et al Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in Digital World

million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet Of the roughly million people with Internet access be children and adolescents Digital activity has also intensified especially during the Covid pandemic There is an urgent need to increase digital literacy from an early age to minimize the risk of online harm to equip children who are future voters and consumers with the skills and understanding they need to assume those roles and to maximize meaningful use of the Internet Generally Indonesians have poor digital literacy This problem was exacerbated when Information and Communication Technology ICT was dropped from the national school curriculum in Several government initiatives including the National Literacy Movement Gerakan Literasi Nasional GLN the Siberkreasi program and reintroducing ICT to the school curriculum have yet to be implemented effectively and with specific focus on improving digital literacy skills Promoting Digital Literacy Skill for Students through Improved School Curriculum Policy Brief No by Nadia Fairuza Azzahra Felippa AmantaApril POLICY BRIEF shutterstockYos Digitalization and Digital Literacy in Indonesia The number of Internet users in Indonesia has increased significantly in recent years Between and Internet users increased by In of the million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet Statistics Indonesia While the greatest increase comes from people living in urban areas where the number of users increased by rural areas have also experienced steady rise increasing by Young people have also enjoyed increasing access to the Internet In the past four years the percentage of Indonesian students aged years who have access to the Internet increased sharply from to Statistics Indonesia Graph Slightly more than quarter of Internet users are children and adolescents To strengthen students digital literacy the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to improve the curriculum for teaching ICT This requires the participation of the Ministry of Communications and Informatics and nongovernment actors with special expertise in digital solutions It has to apply new approach of cultivating critical thinking skills in the classroom improving teachers capacities in both ICT and critical thinking and introducing basic digital literacy skills for parents The Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to cooperate with the Ministry of Communication and Informatics on expanding technology and Internet access especially for students living in rural areas This requires the cooperation of the private sector shutterstockPhunkod Digital activity has also surged survey conducted by Hootsuite and We are Social reveals that Indonesian respondents aged years old spend an average of hours and minutes on the Internet every day This is higher than the global average of hours and minutes per day Indonesia ranks th out of surveyed countries in terms of most time spent on the Internet higher than Singapore and Vietnam and lower than the Philippines and Malaysia Children are also well engaged on the Internet especially in social media Focus group interviews in Cambodia Indonesia Malaysia and Thailand conducted by UNICEF found that many children manage multiple social media accounts for entertainment communication and education purposes Some of them are not only consumers but also content creators During the Covid pandemic digital activities have expanded and intensified as many people have had to shift to online solutions For example new digital consumers in ecommerce in Indonesia increased as much as during the Covid pandemic in Google et al Ministry of Trade Due to longterm school closures educational activity has also shifted online especially in urban areas As result children are exposed to an expanded range of digital content and products and become more important segment of online consumers However the remarkable growth of Internet use in Indonesia has not necessarily corresponded with improved digital literacy This refers not only to the ability to use technology such as skills to use devices software and the basic use of the Internet It also includes digital literacy skills that revolve around the ability to understand evaluate and responsibly use information acquired from digital sources which is the subject of this policy brief Considering the premature development of digital literacy in Indonesia this brief will not engage in discussion of more advanced levels of digital literacy that require an understanding of cybersecurity digital citizenship data privacy etc According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Indonesia ranks st out of countries for its level of education and preparedness to use the Internet Indonesias position is lower than neighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia which rank nd and rd respectively The low level of digital literacy in Indonesia especially in rural areas limits what Internet users can meaningfully do when they are online and may exacerbate the digital divide Purbo Digital divide is gap between individuals families enterprises and geographical areas at various socioeconomic levels in terms of both their access to information and communication technology ICT resources and their use of the Internet for any purposes Source Statistics Indonesia bFigure Percentage of students aged years old who have access to Internet The Urgency of Digital Literacy Improvement As Internet use pervades every aspect of life the urgency of improving digital literacy increases This includes improving understanding of how to use digital products in responsible manner and taking advantage of opportunities and resources available on the Internet There is wide agreement that users must be equipped with the skills needed to maximize the benefits from their online activities Purbo Building these skills can begin at young age especially when children are already exposed to the Internet Children are quite agile in their technology use but this does not necessarily translate to maturity in content consumption and engagement Many online platforms are not designed for children and there are hardly any barriers to prevent their accessing inappropriate content Without thorough understanding of digital literacy children may be susceptible to online threats and harmful content including hoaxes and misinformation cyberbullying online fraud and even sexual exploitation Awareness of hoaxes and misinformation is especially relevant in light of the societal threats posed by populist and radical internet content that can threaten democratic norms and institutions As future voters citizens and political participants children must be prepared to confront and recognize dangerous and misleading content and sources In addition to preventing immediate online harm acquiring digital literacy at an early age prepares children to become consumers of online goods and services In the interest of future consumer protection children should be equipped with the ability to critically assess online terms and conditions and understand consumer rights and data privacy The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index Indeks Keberdayaan KonsumenIKK stood at in This score indicates that Indonesian consumers understand their role but are not yet critical in terms of using their rights and obligations Ministry of Trade Improving digital literacy among children can help to improve performance on this index in the future Digital literacy is also important because it opens the door to employment opportunities and facilitates the mastery of other essential skills Karpati Digitalization constantly creates and transforms jobs throughout the labor market Digital literacy skills give students the ability to thrive in this dynamic digital environment The Personal Data Protection Bill Rancangan UndangUndang Perlindungan Data PribadiRUU PDP under development in the Indonesian House of Representatives considers introducing minimum age of years for setting up social media account without parental consent Sari This policy is intended to protect children from harmful internet content but it will have the effect of reducing opportunities to build digital literacy that will allow them to innovate and thrive in the modern world Equipping children with digital literacy will help them to be digitally resilient to make responsible decisions and to optimize the benefits of spending their time online The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index IKK measures consumers ability to empower themselves The IKK index is grouped into scoring systems Awarerecognize their rights and obligations as consumers Understandunderstand their rights and obligations to protect themselves Capableable to decide the best choices as consumers and prioritize local products Criticalactively defend their rights and prioritize local products Empoweredactively defending consumers interest in interacting with the market Teaching Digital Literacy Skills in Indonesia Digital literacy is strongly dependent on basic literacy skillsreading and writing comprehension Unfortunately Indonesia consistently performs poorly in literacy Fifteenyearold Indonesian students surveyed in the Programme for International Students Assessment PISA ranked st out of countries Only demonstrated at least level proficiency in reading compared to the OECD average of OECD On the other hand of Indonesian adults living in Jakarta perform at or below level in literacy according to the Survey of Adult Skills PIIAC OECD These surveys highlight that while the majority of Indonesians can understand simple texts using basic vocabulary they have difficulty understanding and critically evaluating long and complex texts contributing factor toward low literacy levels is the lack of emphasis on critical thinking skills in the school curriculum The National Curriculum mandates the implementation of High Order Thinking Skills HOTS but it is not wellintegrated into or widely taught during teacher training in Indonesia Ilyas In practice Indonesian education focuses on older approaches to learning such as memorization WENR UNICEF In addition to the problems of low literacy and poor critical thinking skills in the general population digital literacy education is largely missing from Indonesian schools Information and Communication Technology ICT was included as compulsory subject in the National Curriculum also known as Kurikulum Tingkat Satuan Pendidikan or KTSP but content was limited to basic skills such as how to use computer computer applications and devices to support study activities In the Ministry of Education removed ICT from the list of compulsory subjects in the National Curriculum with the intention of integrating ICT learning across all school subjects Bona However many public schools responded by dropping the subject altogether Purbo Teachers of other subjects were unable to incorporate ICT into their lesson plans because their own ICT skills and knowledge were insufficient whereas ICT teachers were confused by the removal of the subject from the National Curriculum Subekti Yudha Luqman As result many Indonesian students have received no education in ICT The inequality of Internet access across the different regions of Indonesia and the socioeconomic conditions of Indonesians are the major structural challenges for the improvement of digital literacy First the percentage of households that can access the Internet is the highest on the most densely populated island of Java while it is much lower in the eastern parts of Indonesia Statistics Indonesia as illustrated in Figure PISA has scale of to indicate reading proficiency The scale consists of indicating the proficiency of understanding simple text with literal meaning Scale indicates the ability to identify the meaning of moderatelength text Scale indicates the ability to understand multiple texts Scale students can understand indirect cues and nuances in single or multiple texts Scale students are able to compare the meaning of multiple lengthy texts Scale indicates the ability to understand long and abstract texts and use multiple criteria to validate the information Source Statistics Indonesia bFigure Internet Access percent per Household by Province in Indonesia Internet users are predominantly households with higher incomes They are more likely to afford and access devices and internet subscriptions Bachtiar et al Lack of Internet access is strongly linked to low levels of digital literacy Inexperienced users are unlikely to be as competent or resilient as those who use the Internet on daily basis Expanding access especially to disadvantaged communities is crucial for digital literacy improvement The inequality of access is also visible in the education sector According to Statistics Indonesia only of primary and junior secondary schools and of senior secondary schools have access to the Internet This results in low and widely varying levels of ICT

Improving digital literacy is one of five priorities in the governments plan to accelerate the digital transformation in Indonesia Cabinet Secretariate of the Republic of Indonesia However there is no solid set of policies or clearly targeted outcomes related to digital literacy The Economist Intelligence Unit Efforts to increase digital literacy start from the basic level of increasing general literacy by nurturing the ability to understand interpret create and communicate texts They must also involve critical thinking skills and the ability to critically observe analyse and interpret information and the logical connection between ideas to support rational individual decisionmaking processes Finally and following more specific definition of digital literacy they require the ability to find evaluate use and create content on digital platforms Dealing with such complex set of necessary skills involves programs and activities spread across government agencies In Indonesia this includes the Ministry of Education and Culture the Ministry of Religious Affairs as well as the Ministry of Communication and Informatics In order to promote general literacy the government has initiated programs such as the National Literacy Movement Gerakan Literasi NasionalGLN established by the Ministry of Education and Culture MOEC in It includes the promotion of literacy in three areas literacy in schools Gerakan Literasi SekolahGLS family Gerakan Literasi KeluargaGLK and society Gerakan Literasi MasyarakatGLM GLN was mandated through MOEC Regulation No on Developing Character on Students with the purpose of synchronizing all literacy programs that have been running in each MOEC directorate and expanding public involvement in the development of literacy culture in Indonesia The main focus on this movement is to cultivate reading habits of students The GLN guidelines also addresses digital literacy and defines it as the skills to make use of information from digital sources in an accountable manner It includes the aim of developing digital learning habits and improving the use of digital media in school education GLN but it does not seek to increase the skills to critically analyze and navigate digital sources The evaluation of digital literacy according to the GLN guidelines merely assesses whether stakeholders have integrated digital sources and media in the learning process and their daily life MOEC Several MOEC regulations are of relevance in this context Increasing digital literacy is not being directly addressed in the National Education Standards but critical thinking skills are included MOEC Regulation No specified them as the basic competency standard required for primary and secondary school graduates MOEC Regulation No on the Standard of Content for Primary and Secondary Education also mentioned critical thinking skills as one of the indicators for mastering school subjects While MOEC Regulation No on the Standardized Process of Primary and Secondary Schools demands that the learning process must include activities of observing questioning and analysing which are essentially critical thinking skills these skills have not become an indicator to assess students competence in MOEC Regulation No on the Education Assessment Standard National Education Standards are the minimum standards in Indonesias education system They consist of eight standards Standard of content Standard of process Graduate competence standard Teachers and educational personnel standard Standard of facilities and infrastructure Management standards Financing standards Educational assessment standards basic level of digital literacy training addresses the technical competence to use digital devices and software In that regard MOEC Regulation No reintroduced ICT as an optional subject at the primary school level and made it compulsory subject for junior and secondary middle schools SMPSMA beginning in the academic year However deficiencies of the ICT curriculum with respect to digital literacy remain The curriculum puts strong focus on understanding and improving technical competence in areas such as programming using office applications and writing blog posts while there is insufficient emphasis on how to responsibly and critically use these technologies The national curriculum has to be based on the National Education Standards which include critical thinking skills However MOEC Regulation No MOEC does not integrate critical thinking skills in the ICT subject For the schools under the Ministry of Religious Affairs MORA such as Madrasah MORA Regulation No on Guideline of Curriculum Implementation in Madrasah has yet to include digital literacy in the curriculum The subject that seems most suitable to convey digital literacy is informatics informatika but it is an optional and not mandatory subject on junior and senior secondary levels of Madrasah It is not offered on the primary education level As for other institutions of Islamic education such as Pesantren the curriculum is designed by the Kyai or prominent figures in the institution without the intervention of MORA Azzahra Pesantren may teach ICT skills but the exact number of pesantren teaching ICT remains unknown Most Pesantren are traditional by nature anyway and unlikely to address digital technologies There is no information available on how many Pesantren are equipped with necessary facilities such as Internet and computers Despite the lacking focus on digital literacy skills in the national curriculum some schools especially those operated by the private sector have integrated digital literacy in advanced ICT classes They go beyond the national curriculum requirements when they teach st century skills such as digital citizenship critical thinking and problem solving Sampoerna Academy nd British School Jakarta nd Still this will only be accessible for students from upperincome families Most schools in Indonesia are not equipped with digital facilities and lack the human resources to teach students digital literacy and not just the functionalities of digital devices Mainstreaming digital literacy must therefore go beyond the initiatives of individual schools and requires significant support from the government More specifically addressing digital literacy Ministry of Communication and Informatics MOCI initiated the National Digital Literacy Movement Gerakan Nasional Literasi Digital or Siberkreasi to improve digital literacy skills in Indonesia Siberkreasi is multistakeholder initiative aimed at reducing misinformation and negative contents on the Internet through public awareness activities by private businesses civil society organizations etc As part of the movement MOCI also provides online references and digital sources through the website literasidigitalid in the form of videos articles and ebooks on digital literacy It also encourages the government to include digital literacy in the school curriculum MOCI As of people had participated in offline Siberkreasi programs including seminars workshops and talk shows in provinces Audiences included both students and adults MOCI This policy brief specifically addresses the curriculum after the ICT subject has been reintroduced Madrasah is an Islamic education institution that teaches the national curriculum and uses methods similar to formal schools but also incorporate weekly hours of Islamic instructions Madrasah are found on all levels of school education primary Madrasah IbtidaiyahMI junior secondary Madrasah TsanawiyahMTs and senior secondary Madrasah AliyahMA Pesantren is culturallyrooted Islamic educational institution in Indonesia characterized by its boarding school element and traditional method of teaching Islamic theological materials However the scope of this program remains limited and it is unknown whether it has improved digital literacy There is no program evaluation incorporated into Siberkreasi and digital literacy has not yet been added to the school curriculum In MOCI and its Siberkreasi partners plan to publish Digital Literacy Module which covers four aspects of digital literacy namely digital skills digital safety digital ethics and digital culture This module is supposed to provide practical tips on improving digital literacy skills There will also be equipped with evaluation parts in every chapter to assess users understanding The module is yet to behad not been published during the at the time of writing process of this policy brief Policy Recommendations Create comprehensive interministerial framework for digital literacy MOCI and MOEC have cooperated in organizing events on digital literacy however despite the fact that both address the improvement of digital literacy the National Literacy Movement and Siberkreasi are largely separated from one another There is need to streamline efforts in comprehensive interministerial framework Improve digital literacy education in the school curriculum As ICT education was reintroduced in schools in MOEC and MORA should adjust the curriculum to fit the demands of the digital age Students must be prepared to be responsible and literate digital citizens and consumers The curriculum should prioritize cultivating the ethical and responsible use of technology as well as navigating myriad information in the digital settings The curriculum should prioritize responsible information use and sharing identification of trustworthy sources of information and protecting students during their online activity These skills are more relevant than the dated ICT content in the curriculum Teaching material must be simplified and adjusted to the specific age groups in school while also involving parents to guide and support their children in online activities Cultivate critical thinking across all school subjects Critical thinking skills are crucial prerequisite to improving digital literacy Critical thinking is necessary for understanding and verifying information from online sources In developed countries such as Finland and Switzerland critical thinking is an integral aspect of education MOEC and MORA should rethink and provide guidance on how to better integrate critical thinking skill across all learning activities while learning lessons from the shortcomings of this strategy for ICT education Practices such as working collaboratively with peers using HOTS content and questions for assignments and exams and cultivating habit of questioning analyzing and crafting arguments in discussion should be part of every classroom Include digital literacy and critical thinking in teachers training Digital literacy materials should be included in teachers training Without improving the low overall ICT competence and critical thinking pedagogy among teachers they will not be able to play their part in improving the digital literacy of students Equipping the parents with basic digital literacy skills Developing responsible online behavior starts at home To be able to supervise the online activities of their children parents must themselves know how to navigate social media find reliable news and critically assess the content Parents need to have basic digital literacy skills because they are also not immune to digital threats MOCIs Siberkreasi needs to create training modules and offer courses that target parents Cooperating with the private sector to formulate relevant curriculum content The digital space is dynamic and everchanging The education sector has difficulty keeping up In order to improve the dynamics of digital literacy education MOEC and MORA should coordinate with MOCI and engage in partnerships with private sector experts The private sector has been engaged in public seminars and talk shows through MOCIs Siberkreasi program but not in improving the school curriculum These external experts can help the government to formulate relevant indicators for the digital literacy contents skills in the school curriculum Improving access of technology to support digital inclusion Improving Internet access and technology especially in rural parts of Indonesia should remain government priority in order to address the digital disparity and open up opportunities for disadvantaged families MOCI is planning to equip about villages with Internet access Private sector involvement which has be considered should be encouraged MOEC and MORA should also cooperate with the private sector to equip schools especially in rural areas with

has negative and positive consequences Yet factors associated with greater use remain unexplored despite the impor tance of their identi cation for intervention purposes It stands to reason that parents can in uence child MTSD use via their attitudes beliefs rolemodelling and style of parenting Here we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles speci cally with regard to child MTSD use exist Hungarian parents were surveyed about their children digital activities their own attitudes and beliefs regard ing the child MTSD use and their own attachment to and use of mobile phones Taking datadriven approach distinct digital par enting styles were identi ed and these resembled general parenting styles Findings further suggeste that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents were more permissive more authoritative and less authoritarian had lower educational level exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones and had more positive attitudes towards and attributed less harm and more bene ts to early device use These results are the rst evidence for existence of digital parent ing styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential pre vention and treatment targetsARTICLE HISTORY Received August Revised October Accepted October KEYWORDS Digital device mobile device touch screen screen time children parenting style parental attitude digital parenting style Introduction Mobile touch screen device MTSD use is becoming increasingly widespread among children Common Sense Inc Children can use touchscreen devices even before they develop advanced motor skills as they do not need to use controllers as they do with personal computers or videogames Consequently children can begin MTSD use at an increasingly early age According to US survey the average daily time children spend with mobile device use is almost an hour for yearolds and minutes for children under the age of Common Sense Inc Comparable trends are apparent in Hungary Pintr where access to internet and use of digital technologies is comparable to the European average Hungarian Central Statistical ce Yet

or built upon in any wayis available on early MTSD use despite ndings indicating that early use of other media eg TV has mainly negative ects on child development Chonchaiya Pruksananonda Zimmerman Christakis Arguably early MTSD use ie in infancy toddlerhood and preschool years is likely similarly important from developmental perspective with potentially both negative and positive ects eg Bedford Saez de Urabain Celeste Karmilo Smith Smith Li Subrahmanyam Bai Xie Liu As such better understanding of the characteristics and factors that are associated with earlier or more intensive use may have implications for psychoeducation as well as prevention and inter vention orts Direct and indirect links between parenting and child behavior Children behavior development and sociali zation are supposed to be directly in uenced by their microsystem ie family eers and school Bronfenbrenner Especially during early developmental stages eg prior to start ing school the family and in particular the parents have perhaps the greatest in uence on child behavior relative to later developmental stages eg adolescence which are characterized by increased peer in Raaelli It has been hypothesized that parents directly in uence child behavior via rule setting Steinberg Darling and also indirectly via various other means For example parents play large role in creating home environment and di erent aspects of that environment promote certain behaviors and not others eg whether or not there is TV or PC at home if there is one in the child bedroom Parental attitudes and behaviors including rolemodelling are also related to hild habits and lifestyle such as with regard to amount of physical activity Arredondo et al or sedentary behavior including as result of screen time Xu Wen Rissel Beyond shaping and reinforcing speci behaviors parenting also involves creation of socioemotional environment through speci cparenting styles that may ect child behavior Rhee Parenting styles in the context of MTSD use Parenting styles are strongly related to child development and outcomes eg Kordi Baharudin Parenting styles correspond to the emotional climate in which parents raise their children Steinberg Darling and can be characterized by dimensions of responsivenesswarmth responding to the child needs in supportive accepting nurtur ing and involved manner and demandingnesscontrol setting demands rules control expectations boundaries to integrate the child into the society Baumrind Spera Four parenting styles can be formulated along these dimensions authoritative high warmth high demand permissive high warmth low demand laissezfaire low warmth low demand and authoritarian low warmth high demand Authoritative parenting involves high warmth sensitivity responsiveness and involve ment as well as high expectations and high demands for maturity and selfcontrol from the child Authoritative parents respect the child opinion but also maintain clear boundaries They foster their demands through bidirectional communication eg expla nations of rules and encouragement of independence Permissive parenting corresponds with high warmth but low demand They set few rules or boundaries and do not have high expectation for maturity They refrain from confrontations with their children and rarely give guidance KONOK ET ALParents with laissezfaire parenting style show low warmth responsiveness and emotional involvement and also have low demands They do not set rules do not provide guidance and discipline They make no demands for maturity and impose few controls on their child behavior Authoritarian parents are not warm and responsive They have high maturity demands are strict expect obedience and assert power They express their expectations through orders and do not explain to their children the rationale behind these rules Specic parenting styles in relation to certain areas or domains of parenting may exist and these may not necessarily be the same across domains or even as general parenting styles they may nevertheless ect children behavior or functioning in that domain eg eating behavior Vereecken Legtest De Bourdeaudhuij Maes With regard to mediarelated behaviors parenting styles may also be expressed through levels of warmth and demandingness Parental responsivenesswarmth may manifest in parents supporting their child desired digital activity eg letting the child watch videos or play games helping the child engage in certain activities eg launching an application or teaching the child how to engage in such activities on their own Parental demandingness on the other hand may manifest in parents controlling and setting limits over the child digital activities or in supervising such activity Indeed parenting styles related to children internet use were found to statistically predict that use in schoolaged children Valcke Bonte De Wever Rots Children whose parents had permissive Internet parenting style used the internet the most and those whose parents adopted an authoritarian or authoritative Internet parenting style used it the least Similarly stricter parental rules regarding TV watching were found to be negatively associated with children ss nt Jago Neither the presencenature of parenting styles related to children sM Du digital parenting styles nor the associations of those with children actual use have been investigated to date Identifying and better understanding these are timely given the ever growing presence of digital media in the daily lives of families and society and thus its potential to impact child development Digital parenting styles may not only in uence the time children spend with MTSDs but also the way they use it For example parents who expect maturity from the child or who are involved in their child MTSD use may teach the child how to use the MTSD in functional way Alternatively children whose parents onl give them the device as form of engagement rw or tt eu em yu et eM Df rs pler activities or in nonfunctional way The importance of parents for children media use has been addressed in several studies on parental mediation Parental mediation includes set of strategies used by parents to control supervise or interpret media content for children Warren Previous research has suggested th at use of parental mediation is associated with less overall time spent with and less negative outcomes of media use Gentile Nathanson Rasmussen Reimer Walsh Kalmus Blinka Olafsson However the concept of digital parenting style is broader than parental mediation as it includes amount of guidance and inv olvement with child digital device use Additionally the parenting style concept ers dimensional view in which parental behavior can be placed along the dimensions of warmth and demandingness This also emphasizes the emotional nature of these parenting styles quite than focusing solely on parental behavior as in case of parental mediationJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Rolemodelling in the context of MTSD use Children learn observationally social learning theory Bandura by attending to and imitating people in their surroundings They identify with the model and take on observed behaviors values beliefs and attitudes of the person People in the immediate surrounding of the child especially parents can more easily become rolemodels for the child and rolemodelling is an important aspect of parental in uence eg on child eating habits and obesity Brown Ogden This is applicable to media consumption as parental media use has been shown to predict child media habits Bleakley Jordan Hennessy Lauricella Wartella Rideout especially in case of heavy parental use Rideout Foehr Roberts Woodard Gridina Examples include asso ciations between family TV time and child TV time Cillero Jago Duch Fisher Ensari Harrington or parental smartphone or tabletuse and child device use Lauricella et al Of note it is not only overt parental behavior ie digital device use but also attitudes and emotions that can be modelled for children to imitate Yet no study focused on whether parental attachment to these devices is associated with child MTSD use to date Furthermore beyond rolemodelling parental media use can also inuence child behavior insofar as it corresponds to less parental attention and other resources allocated to the child For example parents who watch more TV Kirkorian Pempek Murphy Schmidt Anderson and who are heavy mobile users Radesky Schumacher Zuckerman engage in less parent child interaction Other parental factors in uencing child MTSD use Parental attitudes Parents attitudes toward certain activities or habits predict whetherto what extenthow their children will engage in those activities eg eating behavior Scaglioni Salvioni Galimberti Parental rolemodelling practices rules and parenting style may all be in uenced by parental attitudes as attitudes predict behavior Fishbein Ajzen Parental attitudes toward child media use are mixed and largely depend on media type Rideout et al while parental attitudes toward TV use are mixed they are more positive toward computer use Rideout Hamel In turn more positive parental attitudes toward media are associated with longer child time with those media Cingel Krcmar Vandewater et al However to our knowl edge only two studies examined this association in case of MTSDs Lauricella et al Nikken Schols eb wi nt Parental Beliefs section Furthermore there is disproportionate focus on cognitive aspects of attitudes ie opinions about MTSD use at the expense of focus on emotional aspects of those Pooley Connor Parental beliefs Beliefs are the cognitive source of attitudes Fishbein Ajzen Parental beliefs regarding child media use traditional and digital such as whether and at what age the media have negative or positive ects on the child may in uence the degree to which parents allow or encourage their children media use which in turn can in uence how much the child uses these devices For example parents who attribute positive ects to digital media engage in couse and active mediation whereas parents who are concerned about negative ects are more likely to restrict their child sm au Nikken Jansz Nikken Schols In support parents belief that TV can be helpful is associated with increased child screen time Vandewater et al and parents who think that media provide source of entertainmentrelaxation and who think that it KONOK ET ALhas positive ects tend to have children who spend more time with MTSD use Lauricella et al Nikken Schols In addition to these aspects of parental attitudes and behaviors other aspects of the microsystem within which youth function such as socio economic status SES and parental education can also impact child habits including screen time or MTSD use For example higher SES and parental education are related to less time child spent with mobile media Common Sense Inc though others did not nd such association in much less representative sample Kabali et al Taken together some data on the associations between parental attitudes beliefs and rolemodelling and child media use including MTSD use are available but no studies to date have focused on the existence of digital parenting styles or the associations thereof with child media use In addition in most studies children media use was measured only in terms of amount of use However the type of use eg what kind of activities children are doing on these devices is also comparably important as di erent activities eg watching videos taking photos playing games could have di erent ects on cognitive development Additionally the relationship between parental factors and these speci activities is also important to explore eg whether certain parental attitudes are related to more advanced activities Aims and hypothesis Our main aim was to reveal whether parents digital parenting style general attitude and beliefs regarding early MTSD use and rolemodelling as indicated by their own mobile attachment and use are associated with child digital activity indexed by the amount of time and type of activity children engage in MTSD use Exploratory research questions To this end we rst identi ed types of MTSD use and user types in children Exploratory Research Question and investigated Exploratory Research Question whether digital parenting styles can be identi ed and conceptually determine whether these correspond to general parenting styles as described by Baumrind Following an explorative design we relied on datadriven analytic approach involving principal component analysis PCA using items selected based on highfrequency responses in an openended questionnaire survey Also exploratorily we aimed to identify di erent kinds of parental beliefs regarding the potential bene cial and harmful ects of early MTSD use Exploratory Research Question Hypotheses We hypothesized that children engage in MTSD use for greater amount of time and in more activeadvanced manner if their parents have permissive digital parenting style have more positive general attitude toward early MTSD use have more positive cognitive concepts or beliefs ie they attribute more bene cial and less harmful eects to early use also use their own mobile phone for greater amounts of time and are more attached to their phone Variables that may have confounding ects on child MTSD use such as parental educational level and child age and sex Kabali et al Lauricella et al were accounted forJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Additionally to the best of our knowledge no data are available about how the age of onset of MTSD use changed over the past years and it was our aim to investigate the existence of such trends Parents were asked to retrospectively report on when their child rst engaged in MTSD use We hypothesized that the age of onset of MTSD use has been becoming earlier and thus that younger children are more likely to be an MTSD user by given age than older children Method Participants and procedure Participants were recruited online through acebook and the website of Hungarian online magazine where the study questionnaire Digital Kids Questionnaire see below was adver tised Parents were included if they had child aged between and years This age group was chosen because we were interested in MTSD use in early childhood Nores Barnett in this age the ects of MTSD use on development could be bigger and more long lasting Schoenmaker et al dt ei uence of parents on their child behavior is relatively greater Laible et al than during later ages Additionally based on results of our openended survey see below we assumed that in children older than years there would be less variability in experience

to belong to higher cluster Sex of the child had no association with Amount of use and Hwere not supported as Parental attitude parental Mobile usage and Mobile attachment were not associated with Amount of use in the child Supplemental Material Change in the age of rst MTSD use over the last years Whether or not children started using mobile phones or tablets before their rd birthday depended on age groups in support of younger children were more likely an MTSD user by their third birthday than older children Figure Discussion Digital parenting styles and their associations with children MTSD use To our knowledge the current study is the rst to provide evidence for the existence of digital parenting styles and for the association between such styles and amount and type of child MTSD use Taking an explorative approach we identi ed comparable parenting styles in relation to children MTSD use as those identi ed in case of internet Valcke et al and general Baumrind parenting styles Parents displaying permissive digital parenting style allow their children to engage in MTSD use but they are also nurturing and inter active For example parents with this style show their child how to use the applicationdevice and answer the child questions As such permissive digital parenting is associated with low levels of demandingness and high levels ofJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA involvementwarmth From the perspective of parental mediation framework permissive parents likely engage in activeinteractive mediation Nikken Jansz Conversely authoritative digital parenting refers to parenting style where MTSD use is permitted but only under certain conditions eg only after the child has attended to hisher chores and obligations andor with certain limitations eg time limits Authoritative digital parenting is thus characterized by high levels of demandingness and high levels of involvementwarmth Additionally consistent with authoritative parenting involving encouragement of child autonomy Baumrind parents with an authoritative digital parenting style tend to not lock the device screen when they give it to the child or strictly supervise use Authoritative parents use some mixture of restrictive and activeinteractive mediation setting limits and conditions Nikken Jansz Parents exhibiting an authoritarian digital parenting style restrictprohibit child MTSD use and this parenting style is thus associated with high levels of demandingness and low levels of involvementwarmth Only one item that loaded strongly onto this component describes some level of parental involvement but even this item is combination of statements re ecting di erent degrees of involvement We do not give it to herhim we only show itwe watch the picturesvideos together Therefore authoritarian parents use restrictive mediation and supervision Nikken Jansz Parents who adopt laissezfaire digital parenting style allow their children to use the device in order to engage himher suggesting that at least in this context they are not nurturing or interactive This digital parenting style is thus characterized by low demand ingness and low involvementwarmth Laissezfaire parents do not engage in mediation Parenting styles are related to child development and outcomes eg Kordi Baharudin yet little is known about the associations between digital parenting styles and child digital device use Consistent with our hypotheses parents digital parenting style is associated with amount and type of child MTSD use Furthermore it appears that this association is driven primarily not by degree of parental demandingness but by parental Figure Ratio of children who had and had not used mobile phonetablet before their rd birthday in dierent age groups reported by Hungarian parents The ratios were calculated retrospectively from parents reports about the age when their child started to use the devices KONOK ET ALinvolvementwarmth Permissive and authoritative parenting was associated with longer durations of MTSD use and more active or advanced use in children In case of authoritarian digital parenting children use MTSDs for shorter durations of time and in rather passive or nonfunctional way The degree to which parents exhibited laissezfaire style was not associated with amount of child MTSD use This is in contrast with ndings on schoolaged children internet use whose parental demandingness permissive and laissezfaire styles was shown to be negatively associated with increased internet use zgr However in contrast with older children and adolescents who possess the necessary skills and knowledge to use Internet or digital devices including MTSDs and only need parental permission to do so young children may need guidance and support to learn MTSD use and as such use them more if their parents have warmer parenting style Associations of parental attitudes beliefs and rolemodelling with children MTSD use As expected the more positive attitude the parents have regarding early MTSD use the more time the child spends engaging in such use This result is consistent with earlier ndings indicating that positive attitudes toward media were related to higher rates of child media consumption Cingel Krcmar Parental attitudes may be in uenced by parents beliefs about potential bene ts and harm of early MTSD use In the current study the positive and negative ects parents attributed to early MTSD use were similar to those reported by Nikken and Schols it improves the child knowledge and skills is an entertainment opportunity but it can also be dangerous eg inappropriate content or inappropriate use abuse by others and developmentally inappropriate Parents in the current sample additionally reported that disadvantage of MTSDs is that they take time away from other activities In line with our hypotheses we found hat parents who attribute more bene ts and less harm to early MTSD use have children who spen dm et ew hM Du sc to prior data on TV and media which suggest th at parents who believe TV can be helpful have children who watch more TV Vandewater et al and also that parental worries about media are negatively related to chi ld TV consumption Cingel Krcmar The majority of our participants reported that they believed early MTSD use has both positive and negative ects which are also consistent with earlier ndings Radesky et al Additionally we found that parents who are less educated have children who spend more time with MTSD use consistent with what has been found with regard to child TV screen time Hesketh Ball Crawford Campbell Salmon Better educated parents may be more aware of the problematic aspects of TV or mobile phone use and thus consider these in their parenting Roser Schoeni Foerster Rsli Thus educa tional background may in uence child MTSD use through in uencing beliefs and atti tudes with regard to early MTSD use Contrary to hypotheses and the ndings of Lauricella et al dP ka McDaniel amount of parental mobile use was not but degree of parental mobile attachment was associated with amount of child MTSD use This may be because it is not only through their behavior but also through their attitudes and emotions that parents can be rolemodels for their child Parents higher mobile attachment may contribute to children developing positive attitudes toward MTSDs and as their parents are also more likely to allowJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA device use to children using MTSDs more freque ntly From another perspective parents who are highly emotionally involved in digital media may have less attentional resources to interact with their child resulting in the child engaging himherself via some other means eg with MTSD use Investigating these and other putative mediating mechanisms eg role modelling parenting styles and practices ome environment between parental mobile attachment and child MTSD use are important nex steps for future research Additionally some parents may refrain from using the smartph one in front of the child while others do not and this may depend on their mobile attachme nt those who have high mobile attachment may not be able or willing to control their mobile use in front of the child This can explain why only parental mobile attachment and not mobil use is associated with child MTSD use In the future parental mobile use should be investig ated separately based on whether it occurs in front of the child or not Age of onset of MTSD use Our results support the hypothesis that chil dren are starting to use MTSDs at younger age than was the case earlier insofar as older children were less likely to have started MTSD use et ea eo ft ny rc nc trast to the professional recommendations to discourage or prohibit digital media use in hildren under the age of American Academy of Pediatrics more than onethird of the chil dren between the ages of and in our sample were reported to have started MTSD use Given signi cant neural plasticity at this age Schoenmaker et al the observed trend calls for increased empirical study of the various ects of early MTSD use Association of children age with their MTSD use Results show that as children get older they spend more time with MTSD use as in Kabali et al Lauricella et al Roser et al The proportion of regular MTSD users also considerably increased with age perhaps because MTSDs er more opportunities for older children who have more advanced cognitive and motor capabilities the results show that they typically use the MTSDs in more advanced way Limitations and future directions Although our ndings establish important associations our research design is not suitable for causal inferences Of note we cannot rule ou tt ts ev ha sc dM Du aects parenting style parental attitudebel ief or parental mobile attachment and not the other way around or that there is bidirectional ect For example it is possible that if the child uses MTSDs more parents develop more positive attitude and beliefs either because they experience positiveno negative consequ ences of the MTSD use or because of cognitive dissonance reduction Festinger Similarly not only can parenting style in uence child characteristics but the reverse is also possible adillaWalker Carlo Christensen Yorgason Additionally it is also possible hat parent variables indirectly ect children sM use We referred to the possibility of di erent mediating and moder ating mechanisms These alternatives are hardly observable as experim ental studies in this topic are not possible to carry out but longitudinal studies may clarify some of these questions KONOK ET ALAnother limitation to our study is that we observed digital parenting styles parental reactions to child MTSD use only in parents who reported that their child shows interest toward MTSDs However parents may er MTSDs to the child even if heshe does not show interest toward it so parents can be proactive not only reactive in their behaviors regarding child MTSD use This experimental consideration should be addressed in the future One of the strength of our study is its datadriven approach Instead of preselected questions ie theorydriven approach we explored parents attitudes and behaviors exerting as little in uence on those as possible Nevertheless the questionnaire will need further validation in the future Although recent study showed that when people are call for about how often they use their mobile phone the correlations are quite high between selfreport and objective log data Boase Ling parents might have distorted their responses regarding their mobile use and mobile attachment especially given that these questions were asked after parents described their opinions attitudes and parenting behaviors related to child MTSD use Therefore the order of questions may be bene cial to reverse in future studies Variables not assessed in this study may also be linked to child MTSD use For example although we measured how much the parent uses their mobile phone and to what extent they are attached to it it would be also important to measure how much time the parent uses their mobile phone or other devices in front of the children Parental mediation techniques could be also investigated in relation to digital parent ing styles eg are digital parenting styles involve certain speci mediation techniques as we hypothesize above To what extent are the two phenomena overlapping Additionally possible contribution in future studies could be to investigate whether parents general parenting style and digital parenting style correspond or diverge For example is it possible that parent has permissive digital parenting style but an author itative general parenting style Conclusions In conclusion results suggest that parents may in uence their children sM Du modelling behavior digital parenting style attitudes and beliefs about early MTSD use and their educational level Future studies should clarify how these variables are related includ ing by assessing potential mediating and moderating mechanisms and examining whether digital parenting styles explain child MTSD use above and beyond other parental factors As children start to use MTSDs at an increasingly early age and for increasing amounts of time as they get older it is predictable that MTSD use will further intensify in children during the upcoming years Adults exhibit attachment to their mobile devices Konok et al and this attachment is not only when also observable but may be more pronounced in youth and this may potentially result in youth spending less time spent with other developmentally appropriate and important activities and toys Thus there is urgent need to examine possible ects of MTSD use on development If ndings indicate that early MTSD use has some negative consequences on child development in combination with the current results the data may suggest that reduction in child MTSD use can be achieved via changes in their parents attitudes and knowledge ie parental education Hinkley Cli Okely JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Notes The Digital Kids Questionnaire is available from the rst Author upon request For example

terminology differs across researchers and practitioners and inconsistent ways of operationalising and measuring CSAM make comparison across studies difficult This has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation and is the case with online CSAM Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by the volume of online content in the open and also hidden Internet and the reality that content may be removed but not destroyed Criminal justice data from public records as well as research surveys would suggest an increase over time in the number of CSAM crimes Youthproduced images pose problem for law enforcement in terms of resource demands alongside their ability to determine the age of the child and whether they have been produced as part of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent behaviour that is consistent with adolescent development and risktaking Mapping of existing national and international CSAM databases would suggest that they fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections While there are number of databases globally there is limited connectivity between them Differences in how data is defined and recorded means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions as to whether there have been changes in the gender age and level of violence within recorded CSAM However there is some converging evidence that the percentage of egregious images has increased over time Across three studies younger victims are associated with greater levels of sexual violence produced within family context and more likely to be widely distributed However the preponderance of images are of pubescent and prepubescent children and the numbers of images of very young children infants and toddlers remain relatively low This is in contrast to the views of experts interviewed in the current study The majority of victims and offenders are white Caucasians and while there has been an increase in other ethnic groups these numbers remain disproportionately small This does require further investigation given the increasing availability of Internet connectivity through handheld devices across handheld devices and the concerns expressed about for example live streaming of abuse TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALDefinitions of what constitutes onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation are both varied and subject to change and as noted by recent study the terms used in research are often different from those used for legally defined crimes which also differ between and on occasions within countries Differing terminology wee wee comparison across studies difficult and this is reflected in the decision by ECPAT International to work with other stakeholders to develop terminology guidelines as absence of consensus about the terms used has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation These forms may include the production dissemination and possession of child sexual abuse material CSAM which are known in many jurisdictions as child pornography online grooming or active sexual solicitation of children sexting sexual extortion of children also known as sextortion revenge pornography exploitation of children through online prostitution and live streaming of sexual abuse We can also make distinction between cyberenabled and cyber dependent crime for example CSAM would fall into the first category whereas live streaming of sexual abuse would be in the latter as it is only possible because of the technology It would be true to say that onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation has been seen as both public health and criminal justice problem There is perception that with each new technological advancement law enforcement researchers and advocates Dr Wager Nadia et al Rapid Evidence Assessment

the multifaceted nature of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation there are significant gaps in the way these crimes are understood In her December report to the Human Rights Council the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children called on States to conduct research in order to obtain comprehensive picture of the phenomena and to establish reliable and standard information on the phenomena The same month taking place in London the WePROTECT Children Online Global Summit that was convened by the government of the United Kingdom clearly highlighted the need for development of indicators and further collection of data Global indicators and standards in data collection would provide clear language and metrics for law enforcement researchers and advocates to communicate more effectively about the phenomena Currently there is growing body of data which show evidence of emerging trends in several key areas of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation However the preponderance of empirical studies has taken place within high income countries and outside of the research from the Crimes Against Children Research Center there is paucity of longitudinal data to help us understand changing patterns of offending and victimisation in this area To date bids to quantify the scale of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation have counted the number INTRODUCTIONTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALof identified offenders or suspects as well as young people who have engaged in harmful sexual behaviour identified victims reported offences including public reports as well as crime statistics and the number of confirmed CSAM images and videos By far the greatest number of publications identified in Wagner et als rapid evidence review related to selfreport victimisation studies THE AMOUNT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL The focus of this report is CSAM and questions about how much of it exists and whether there are changing patterns in the amount of new material being identified globally In absolute terms we can never quantify the amount of material that has been created or is in circulation on the Internet because new content is constantly being added and only proportion of older content some of which predates the Internet but has been scanned and uploaded will have been identified and taken down Even with the use of custommade web crawlers to aid notice and takedown of CSAM there is no guarantee that it will not be uploaded again However common metrics to assess CSAM include reports from hotlines eg the absolute number of reported cases analysts have determined to contain illegal content over period of time and criminal justice records eg how many individuals have been arrested for possessing CSAM both methods have their limitations Anecdotally it is understood that material is traded across multiple platforms and that the volume of material outstrips the resources available to law enforcement and hotline analysts to fully investigate or analyse So understandably the number of arrests and reports can never accurately represent the actual amount of CSAM in circulation at any given time Additionally parsing out what method or terminology to use when measuring the amount of identified CSAM is difficult Material could be examined by the number of children victimised in series of images or case the absolute number of images in collection or the number of offenders responsible for series of images either Ibid Keisanen Laura and VaaranenValkonen Nina

perpetrating the behaviour producing the content or distributing the material An added complication is the number of unidentified offenders and victims There are many offenders and images that will remain undetected by law enforcement or hotline analysts These offenders are not missed only because law enforcement may have limited capacity to investigate them but rather because they may use techniques to encrypt or anonymise their activities or as with the case of new commercial websites payment is only accepted by digital payment systems such as Bitcoin as an emergent trend to avoid detection by offenders Other limitations to gauging the amount of CSAM from these common metrics are the biases in the protocols and laws governing different jurisdictions For example some countries limit how proactive law enforcement agents can be in their investigations requiring them to wait until material is reported to their departments before they can begin an investigation Other countries have introduced legislation that allows law enforcement and hotline analysts to review areas of the Internet that are considered popular trading platforms ie forums on the dark net Some evidence has documented that the amount of arrests or reports stemming from the latter method of investigation has made significant difference in the number of offenders detected PUBLIC REPORTS Using the number of reports made by the public within given time period to hotlines hotline is national online resource that offers members of the public to report what they perceive as illegal online content as metric for the amount of CSAM in circulation would suggest an incremental growth in these crimes over the total period that data has been collected However Donosa argues for caution when interpreting the number of public reports as evidence of an increase in the amount of CSAM An increase in reporting may be due to other factors such as an improvement in rates of detection because of technological tools or because there has been an increase in human resources TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALavailable to manage it It may also be the case that in some countries there is growing awareness of the problem and willingness to report suspected CSAM She concludes that because of the nature of the content being dealt with and the impossibility of most hotlines to collect data directly from the source it is difficult to draw firm conclusions As long as we are unclear how much child sexual abuse material is being produced distributed and consumed out there we will not be able to know for sure whether the problem has worsened or not There are therefore caveats on how we should interpret public reporting of content not the least because in in addition to receiving reports of online CSAM of hotlines in also accepted other types of reports which included for example racismhate speech adult pornography bullying and selfharmsuicide However in this global study of hotlines approximately onethird of those surveyed indicated that CSAM reports made up the majority of their workload The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC serves as the United States of Americas clearing house for CSAM through the CyberTipline This provides an online mechanism for members of the public and electronic service providers ESPs to report incidents of suspected child sexual exploitation This includes CSAM sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism online enticement trafficking of children for sexual purposes child sexual molestation misleading domain names or words and unsolicited obscene material sent to child In the report to the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee in March it was noted that over recent years the volume of CyberTipline reports received by NCMEC had increased from over million reports in to more than million reports in to more than million reports in By the time of the report in NCMEC had already

The most substantial data set comes from the US longitudinal National Juvenile Online Victimisation NJOV study This arrest study collected data in and These studies included two phases of data collection TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALa postal survey of state county and local law enforcement agencies in the US of arrests made for technologyfacilitated sexual crimes against children over specified period of time and telephone interviews concerning cases identified in the survey There was substantial increase in the number of arrests from in to in and in although this may not indicate an actual increase as there was an overlap in the estimated ranges at the confidence interval Approximately half of the arrests were for possession of CSAM defined as child pornography in the study Arrests for crimes where the victim was known to the police through CSAM production increased by approximately between and and doubled between and This reflected large increase in offenders who were known to their victims and described in the study as family and acquaintance offenders Arrests that were made through proactive policing police posing as children online went down in although arrests for proactive investigation of CSAM offences increased in compared to in The majority of people arrested in each wave of the study were male white Caucasians although by higher proportion arrests were members of minority ethnic groups The increase in arrests for the production of child sexual abuse materials appeared to be largely driven by youthproduced sexual images which were taken by children years or under and which met the legal definitions in the US for child pornography In most of these cases the person arrested was an adult who had solicited images from minor This was also

produced by adolescents to be taken by family member as opposed to who was aged or older with victims younger than years Adult producers were likely to possess additional CSAM which had been

adolescents who had taken pictures of themselves and sent them to others over half by mobile phones In the majority of the victims of CSAM production were aged and overall more than half of the producers arrested had committed contact sexual offence documented in the images taken This data is now quite old and there is paucity of comparable offence data outside the US as many countries do not have the resources to research this area or do not disaggregate their sexual offence data In the UK it was reported that the number of offenders convicted of taking making or distributing child abuse images increased by from in to in with offences reported in for possession The Rapid Evidence assessment by Wagner also notes that in the UK the number of obscene publication offences which includes recorded offences for creating possessing or distributing CSAM has doubled across the UK between and and that these increases have been attributed to an increase in the creation or distribution of indecent or pseudophotographs of adults and children using Internet and mobile technology However others have argued that these increases may be due to more targeted and coordinated activity by the UK National Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies Earlier threat assessment reports by NCACEOP Command noted changing patterns in the types of victimisation within seized images increases in the egregiousness of the sexual assaults and the ages of the children becoming younger and involving more females However these studies provide limited information as to the methodology involved in these estimates Police data from the Netherlands was used to examine the attributes of seized CSAM and the characteristics of arrested offenders Their data was TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALdrawn from police files involving suspects investigated in The majority of their suspects had only one victim and where there were cases of multiple suspects these did not appear to be part of organised criminal networks Over of the suspects were male and ranged from years of age but were under Often these were young people who had taken sexualised pictures andor videos of themselves andor each other However it has to be acknowledged that these were largely samples of convenience and are likely to represent only proportion of those involved in CSAM PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ABUSIVE IMAGES US study of arrests for CSAM production at two timepoints and indicated an increase in adolescent victims but no increase in the proportion involving very young victims Many of the cases involved selfproduced sexual images by adolescents and involving adult sex offenders third sample indicated that arrests for CSAM production quadrupled between which was attributed to cases of selfproduced sexual images solicited from minors by adult offenders However of note is that in most youthproduced images were distributed usually by youth who took pictures of themselves and sent them to others Images were uploaded to the Internet in approximately in cases Although there has been an increase in the amount of CSAM produced by adolescents in the context of coercive relationships the NJOV survey indicated that most CSAM was still produced by adult offenders Adults either created images of minors themselves or enticed minors to produce images Adult produced images were more likely to be perpetrated by family member have victims younger than years of age be perpetrated by offenders aged or older and who also possessed CSAM images Leukfeldt Jansen and Stol Child

that the authors concluded that increases in arrests were related to high levels of lawenforcement activity by agencies trained to respond to technologyfacilitated crimes The introduction of technological landmarks such as the Internet digital cameras and smart phones over the past two decades has radically altered the way offenders sexually exploit children Currently researchers have looked at the difference between offenders using active realtime platforms ie live streaming and webcams to transmit material versus those who use passive platforms ie Torrents to distribute CSAM The complexities around determining the amount of CSAM that exists can be explored through image production through commercial exploitation An example of live streaming of child sexual abuse for payment is provided by Terre des Hommes Netherlands who conducted research in nineteen Englishlanguage public chat rooms where four researchers posed as prepubescent Filipino girls The researchers then waited for people to make contact and request webcam sex performance Contacts were reminded that they were interacting with pre pubescent child If they continued to request sex show researchers began working to identify them During the weeks observation offenders attempted to engage in live streaming of sexual abuse systematic study of US Internetfacilitated sexual exploitation was examined through data from arrests in Offenders either used the Internet to purchase or sell access to identified children for sexual purposes including CSAM production or used the Internet to purchase or sell images they possessed but did not produce qualitative study of Swedish youth commercially exploited online indicated that this included the purchase of CSAM ranging from seminude pictures to livestreaming TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALCHARACTERISTICS OF OFFENDERS It has been consistently noted across studies that CSAM offenders represent heterogeneous group who display wide variation in their sexual preoccupation with CSAM and their motivation to offend In relation to this it has been observed that fundamental problem with prevention policy in the criminal justice system is that it is largely based on stereotypical and often mistaken characterisation of sex offender populations for example the common view of them as exclusively adult males who have sexual orientation towards prepubescent children paedophiles and who are strongly motivated to offend While the majority of offenderrelated research has used samples of people convicted of technologymediated abuse and exploitation there have been few studies drawn from general population samples as well as people who were seeking help For example an online survey of German men found that reported sexual fantasies involving prepubescent children reported sexual offending against prepubescent children and reported pedophilic sexual preference Men who reported exclusive use of CSAM were identified as subgroup who differed from contact sexual offenders against prepubescent children and men who reported both CSAM use and contact sexual offenses against prepubescent children further US study recruited females and males through an online survey to examine sexual interest and adverse childhood experiences Six per cent of men indicated some likelihood of having sex with child if they could get away with it as did

Paneland of males and of females indicated some likelihood of viewing CSAM on the Internet In offender samples differences have been found between CSAM offenders and contact offenders in relation to higher levels of Internet use lower levels of antisocial behaviour differences in empathy and evidence of compulsive or addictive behaviour However much of the offenderrelated research has focused on risk of CSAM offender either having prior history of contact offending or whether they will go on to commit further contact offence Two significant studies in relation to risk come from Canada with the development of the Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool CPORT and the UK KIRAT Kent Internet Risk Assessment Tool THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF ABUSIVE IMAGES One area that has been standardised is the terminology used to grade the sexual activity depicted in CSAM An example of this would be the COPINE scale developed by Quayle and colleagues that sorts sexual activity into ten categories This scale was later adapted to point scale to grade images by the Sentencing Advisory Panel However the scale has not been incorporated into many law enforcement and hotline databases and instead is used more for prosecution and academic purposes Researchers have coded samples of images and reported trends within specific databases over given timeframe but there has yet to be global effort to code and report trends in sexual activity TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWhile anecdotally law enforcement and hotline analysts have expressed concern over sexual content of the material becoming more aggressive and the proportion of violent material increasing there is little consistent empirical evidence Though reporting the sexual activity in CSAM may appear straightforward given cases could involve multiple victims as well as multiple offenders there are tensions around what exactly is recorded Some victims may experience different levels of abuse or violence Likewise not every image or video may contain the same level of sexual activity Additionally when reporting trends it is not always clear whether only new material during timeframe will be used to generate estimates on the amount of violence or all the material seen circulating during the timeframe For instance if there is greater market for violent imagery law enforcement may find that offenders are recirculating older material that is extremely violent which would be missed if only new material was used to examine trends CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTIMS While there is extensive research on offenders very little is known about the children depicted in sexually abusive material especially in the global landscape To date much of the research has involved identified victims within law enforcement databases which may not be representative of the general population of children who are sexually exploited online particularly as limited number of countries are compiling databases of CSAM and where they do exist these tend to be from the global north We also have very little evidence to help us differentiate between identified and nonidentified children who have been abused in the production or exchange of CSAM Studies of the databases that do exist suggest there are more female victims than males significantly more white than non white victims and that most children featured in material are prepubescent CSAM can however be produced across different contexts which as previously discussed may reflect changes in our relatively recent ability to create digital content study of Swedish

IWF Operational trends Overviewthat of those who reported sexual abuse had also experienced the abuse being documented in pictures or videos In an early study by the same researcher children identified in seized CSAM were interviewed and their images analysed All of these were taken during acts of sexual abuse by the perpetrators who in some cases had also distributed the CSAM No images were produced by the children further study from Turkey examined the medical records of sexual abuse victims referred through the courts to Child and Adolescent clinic Ninetythree reported at least one of the following onlineoffline sexual acts through email cell phones text messages and Internet sites an image of the victim of sexual nature or of the sexual abuse itself recorded on mobile phonecamera with threats of distribution if she did not continue sexual acts the image shared onlineoffline and the victim subjected to online harassment or offline sexual abuse by other offenders that knew about the image For these children digital technology was significantly associated with more severe forms of abuse such as penetrative sex recurrent sexual abuse and multiple offenders This victimfocused research reflects evidence also seen in offender studies of the production and use of CSAM images as part of the offence process By the end of the International Child Sexual Exploitation Database ICSE DB included data on more than identified victims from nearly countries but still little was known about these children ChildBase is database developed by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre CEOP and consisted of CSAM images gathered from police seizures across the United Kingdom In randomised sample of unique sexualised images of children from the database approximately it was found that the images contained four times more girls than boys and almost times more white than nonwhite children The UK Internet Watch Foundation reported that after analysing all child sexual abuse URLs in of all the children were years or younger The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image Database ICSE DB contains important information about TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALchild abuse image crimes recent study quantified the characteristics of children in identified illegal images from the UK claimed cases from the database and described the differences between cases of selftaken images and those whose images had been taken by others The analysis showed an increase in identified victims during the study years Almost two thirds of the children identified were female the majority were white and were selftaken taken in coercive and in noncoercive relationship The data also indicated that since the number of self taken images each year exceeded more than of the total number of images in the database Although selftaken images could potentially be perceived as less worrisome twothirds of all the images within this study were classified as coercive However the yearly reports of organisations such as the Internet Watch Foundation would suggest that there are fluctuations in the characteristics of the children depicted in CSAM In the IWF reported that material involving prepubescent children made up smaller fraction of all reports than was seen in with pubescent victims increasing however the amount of material involving children two years old or younger remained constant over the same fouryear span about By the IWF had seen further overall drop in the children assessed as being or younger and an increase in reports of children This proportionate drop was felt in part to be related to the increase in selfproduced content which had been shared online alongside of the fact that the IWF also actively searches for images which exceeded public reports in and therefore were more likely to encounter more images of year olds In their report there were also fewer images falling into categories penetrative sexual activity or nonpenetrative activity in either or Differences were also seen between data from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in which showed that of child victims were under the age of eight years old when compared with the ChildBase study which showed relatively low numbers of very young victims only of females and of males were infanttoddlers Quayle Jonsson Cooper

UNIDENTIFIEDVICTIMSINCHILDSEXUALEXPLOITATIONMATERIALpdf further study examined two different datasets from the NCMEC database of identified children This included actively traded cases cases involving victims which were seen in or more reports to NCMEC from and identified child victims cases including one offender and one victim and cases involving multiple offendersvictims from July June whether traded or not The most notable finding from the first dataset was trend towards more egregious sexual content over time more abusive sexual content in later years but with no obvious trends in relation to child victim age or gender In the second dat set involving single offender and victim cases that were actively traded involved prepubescent victims more egregious sexual content and more likely to involve familial offenders particularly nuclear family members However in the second dataset of cases of cases involving single victims and where there were multiple relationships the children were pubescent Most cases involved male offenders who were unrelated to the child but cases that involved female offenders younger children or more extreme content were likely to involve family members In further analysis of the ICSE database of unidentified victims conducted by ECPAT International and Interpol were girls were boys and the remaining included children of both genders Where boys were depicted the content was more egregious Within this dataset of the children were white and where age could be determined the largest group were prepubescent Similar to the NCMEC analysis there was also relationship between the age of the victim and the severity of the abuse Across the three studies NCMEC ICSE UK and ECPATInterpol very young children were in the minority and

speak with experts in this field to uncover why trends in the data may be occurring We were particularly interested in experts opinions on trends in the age of victims of online child sexual exploitation OCSE and the severity of the sexual activity being depicted in CSAM Furthermore we intended to explore national databases in order to contribute to establishing standards and global metrics of CSAM to promote evidencebased advocacy and programming We wished to document the interaction between key variables amount of material the production and distribution of material offender characteristics the sexual content of material and victim characteristics MAPPING EXISTING DATABASES Collections of data that relate to CSAM fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections The hashing process is mathematical algorithm that produces hexadecimal numeric value relating to binary data hash value is small convenient number used to track or sort an arbitrary block of data Each image file hash value is represented by unique string of characters effectively without visible order sequence or connection to the actual file name or content of the image According to Microsoft data can be compared to hash value to determine its integrity Usually data is hashed at certain time and the hash value is protected in some way At later time the data can be hashed again and compared to the protected value If the hash values match the data has not be altered If the values do not match the data has been corrupted For this system to work the protected hash must be encrypted or kept secret from all untrusted parties However it is also important to distinguish between image databases and image libraries The former is fully searchable and contains associated metadata related to cases within data such as hash sets that can be exported and shared with others An image library is more akin to flat filefolder structure where material may be grouped together on case by case basis but crosscomparison of the data is not really possible and there are significant limits to what can be exported from it There are Quayle and Jones Sexualized images of children on

approach to child exploitation investigations by developing innovative technologies and victimcentric methodologies See Griffiths personal communication Victim Identification Manages Queesland Policea number of international national and regional organisations that have image databases andor databases and number of other organisations maintain permanently or over period of time image libraries For instance this may be the case with number of national hotlines as well as some smaller police agencies around the world or those who are just starting victim identification unit Other organisations maintain their own hash sets which may facilitate workload management in terms of recognising material that has already been seen so that it can either be discounted from the victim identification process or that it can be precategorised for the court process because it has already been categorised previously for example through determining the age of the child or the nature of the image content At present there is limited connectivity between databases At an international level as referred previously INTERPOL houses and maintains the ICSE Database and also the ICCAM database on behalf of INHOPE EUROPOL hosts and maintains IVAS Investigation Video and Audio System which is database of material generally seized by law enforcement agencies in EU member states or countries with third party agreements with EUROPOL eg Australia Canada or the USA or seized as result of joint investigations in these countries Project Vic maintains hash and associated metadata database for material seized and held in the US and administers rules of engagement for the various Project Vic members around the world Law Enforcement Agencies NonGovernment Organisations Industry etc While there is no international hash database provided by Project Vic international collaboration may take place under the auspices of Project Vic but this currently take place on bilateral basis The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children acts as the clearing house for seized material from federal and local law enforcement agencies in the USA and in doing so contributes to both NGO and Industry hashsharing platforms which extend beyond the USA into International organisations At national level of the countries currently connected to ICSE the following maintain databases of seized

Federal Bureau of Investigation also have their own collections as do other agencies such as the US Postal Service and the Department of Justice It is likely that there are other image libraries in Austria Finland Ireland Israel Italy Japan Moldova Norway Spain and Switzerland used as an aid to victim identification An example of hash database is provided by INHOPE an international network of hotlines as described below BOX INHOPE and the ICCAM system INHOPE is the global umbrella organisation uniting national Internet hotlines engaged in combating online child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material The mission of INHOPE is to support and enhance the work of these hotlines to strengthen international efforts to combat child sexual abuse using multi stakeholder approach The network consists of hotlines in countries worldwide When members of the public come across child sexual abuse material on the Internet they can anonymously report the suspected illegal content to the hotline in their country The aim of the INHOPE Hotline Network is to streamline processes for reporting illegal online content when it involves the sexual abuse or exploitation of child Hotlines often encourage reporting even for suspected exploitation such as child modelling INHOPE In INHOPE with the support and funding from the European Commission developed and launched the ICCAM ISee cChildAbuseMaterial system initially as pilot project and ultimately was rolled out to the full INHOPE network The Hotlines receive reports from the public on potentially illegal content These reports that contain URL pointing at the content are entered in the ICCAM system Crawling and assessment ICCAM crawls the URL and downloads images and video to centralised infrastructure based in INTERPOL The system then allows the Hotline analyst via browser to remotely classify the content under predetermined criteria eg baseline and national Once the content has been confirmed as child sexual abuse material the relevant elements of the report are forwarded to the INHOPE Hotline in that country Hashing technology As part of this hashing technology is deployed to fingerprint reported images and video which allows for more rapid action in the work flow and automatic flagging of new confirmed CSAM content that has not been reported to or seen by law enforcement previously New confirmed CSAM content is automatically flagged to law enforcement victim identification team in INTERPOL This also minimises duplication of effort as analyst can see what has already been assessed as illegal baseline or national even if the content reported was totally separate report to another Hotline at any point in the past All of these elements speed up report handling plus reduce the amount of traumatic CSAM material that Hotline analysts must view simple reflection of these factors is the Notice Takedown statistic which has improved dramatically to where of confirmed CSAM reports were removed from the Internet within hours INHOPE Annual Report Data ICCAM has the ability to gather almost realtime global data on the trends and statistics on the dissemination of online CSAM and the consequential actions by hotlines eg notice and takedown times This allows for periodbyperiod comparison and analysis TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALAn example of an image database is provided below BOX Interpol ICSE Database The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image database ICSE database It was launched in March as the successor to the Interpol Child Abuse Image Database ICAID which had been in use since To meet the challenges of technological change the ICSEDB has been updated on several occasions and version four of the database is currently under development through financial support from the European Commission to enhance connectivity with national child abuse material databases ICSEDB is the only global platform of its kind which enables specialist lawenforcement officers to use image and video comparison software to identify victims abusers and locations through an analysis of images videos and hashes The ICSE Database is available through INTERPOLs secure global police communications system and certified users in member countries can access the database directly and in real time providing immediate responses to queries related to child sexual exploitation investigations This both facilitates the identification of children but also manages potential duplication of efforts that would occur if multiple law enforcement agencies were attempting to identify the same victim or victims Countries seeking access to the database need to demonstrate the existence of national legislation in relation to child sexual abuse material CSAM specialist national victim identification unit and sufficient connectivity to support the use of the database This database is managed by Interpol and provides powerful intelligence and investigative tool that allows specialised investigators to share information with colleagues on global basis The information in the database relates to children identified through image analysis and specialist and routine policing whose images meet the criteria for indecency across most jurisdictions see Gillespie as well as indicative material that may not meet these criteria but may be valuable source of intelligence In the ICSE DB included data on identified victims from more than countries as well as data related to numerous unidentified victims whose cases are yet to be investigated areasCrimesagainstchildrenVictim identification By January Interpol reported that the network of countries had identified sexual abuse victims in the last seven years NewsandmediaNewsN Images or videos that are uploaded to the ICSEDB are verified as to whether they are already known to the system or whether the child or children within the media or the suspect or offender is already known to the system These constitute known cases As can be seen from the previous section on public reports number of the hotlines provide yearly information on public reports and proactive searching brief overview of this data from the IWF CyberTipline and Cybertipca is presented here IWF In reports were received which were assessed as criminal content from total of reports representing decrease from Age profiles of children suggested an increase in selfproduced content with public reports more likely to be of children years old and under The IWF classification of the images indicated that nearly half of children under years of age were in either Category or the two most egregious categories although this represented decline from previous years Their report indicated an increase in the number of domains hosting CSAM and of these of all webpages that contained CSAM were concentrated across five domains com net se io and cc Social networks were the least likely to contain CSAM and image hosting sites the most consistent for hosting CSAM saw Europe hosting more identified pages containing CSAM than any other region representing increase for The top five countries hosting CSAM URLs were the Netherlands the US Canada France and Russia There was decline in the number of newly identified hidden services and large decrease in the number of web pages deemed to be commercial CyberTipline This is USbased service and is hosted by NCMEC Their data showed an increase of between to in reports alleged child sexual exploitation or sexual extortion with sexual extortion reports being made between October to April The majority of these reports came from Internet companies but came from child victims TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALCybertipca This is operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection Between the hotline responded to over CSE reports from the public with arrests Data from their Survivors Survey of adults indicated that all had been subjected to child sexual abuse and videorecorded of those responding to the online survey felt that it was likely their images had been distributed The primary perpetrators were family members or part of the extended family said they were under years when the abuse started and for the abuse lasted over ten years Over the last years over reports had been received by cybertipca with over forwarded to

In URLs were reported to this global network of hotlines which was increase from In most CSAM was identified on image hosting sites websites file hosting sites social networking sites and banner sites Ninetyone per cent of images were hosted for noncommercial purposes The INHOPE report indicated that the network received reports with confirmed as CSAM and suggested that the majority of CSAM encountered by hotlines depicted predominantly prepubescent females TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE There have long been calls for global metrics for CSAM but these are very difficult to establish given the complexity of these crimes Specifically global metrics would aid in evidencebased advocacy and programming Research continues to be limited by lack of standards size of sample or generalizability of findings For range of reasons most research and analysis of CSAM has previously focused on single databases or even subsets of images from within database However as technology rapidly advances CSAM is more and more becoming globalised concern and the need for bigger picture analysis is strong This study therefore aimed to frame the analysis of CSAM trends in much more global perspective The design therefore was to broaden our net as much as possible for global perspective We aimed to gather detailed perspectives from sample of CSAM experts from all over the world We sought to establish and understand trends in victim offender and content characteristics over time We sought also to examine the trends identified in our qualitative data with preliminary analysis of complementary quantitative data from multiple sources wherever we could QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS Semistructured expert interviews with the primary objective of investigating perceived trends in the age of victims and the severity of the sexual activity in CSAM formed the basis of this study An interview guide was developed that covered breadth of topics thought to impact OCSE Appendix The interview guide covered victim profiles common characteristics of CSAM offender profiles changes in the sexual content of CSAM changes in production and distribution methods and questions about how policy and practice around online sexual exploitation could be improved We chose these topic areas given their relevance to developing global metrics as well as their potential to identify both the age of victims and the sexual activity in the material We wished to explore whether there were Bryant Antony and Charmaz Kathy Eds The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory Los Angeles Sage accessed February changes in the ages of the children or the severity of sexual activity as evidenced in CSAM We interviewed law enforcement agents and hotline analysts who had at least one year of current experience working with CSAM since they would be able to speak to current incidents and recent changes This population was also selected because they would be familiar with material involving both undetected and detected offenders as well as unidentified and identified victims Respondents were recruited with invitations and flyers that were distributed to key stakeholders and organizations Once participants were recruited and screened for eligibility they were consented into the study Studies were primarily conducted in English with small portion being conducted in Spanish While it was requirement that the participants fluently speak English or Spanish it was often not the participants primary language Two participants used professional translators to participate in the study Interview extracts from all the participants have been edited with brackets for readability The research team was composed of Research Leader and Research Assistant Both team members had Masters degrees in public health or health sciences and several years of research experience Both team members had conducted national and international research on the prevention of child sexual abuse and were knowledgeable in OCSE They both were certified in ethical human subject research and had previous training in qualitative interviewing transcription and analyses The Research Assistant had professional qualifications in Spanish language skills and had conducted previous interviews in Spanish Interviews were analysed using the grounded theory method The team members were trained to conduct semistructured interviews following the interview guide Appendix Interviewers walked the participant through series of discussion topics related to the study goals and objectives but had flexibility to probe further on topics in which the participant was particularly knowledgeable Interviews took approximately thirty minutes to one TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALhour Following the interview audio files were transcribed In the case of Spanish interviews transcripts were also translated Two initial transcripts were coded line by line and then line codes were compiled into codebook After the codebook was developed three transcripts were double coded to check for consistency and understanding in applying codes Codes were then applied to the remaining transcripts These codes were analysed and organised to identify emergent themes total of qualitative interviews were conducted Participants were from EUROPOL and INTERPOL as well as hotlines and agencies in Australia Colombia Finland France Mexico New Zealand the United Kingdom Slovenia Spain South Africa and Taiwan COMPLEMENTARY QUANTITATIVE DATA Our search for such quantitative data encountered some expected barriers Many agencies around the world simply lack the resources to generate and maintain complex databases and where they do data provides particular picture based on local priorities Where databases do exist access is usually closely limited for obvious and justified reasons Comparisons between these sources can also be complicated given it is collected along procedural rather than research priorities See eg NetClean important insights into child sexual abuse crime the NetClean report Invitations and flyers were initially distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe requesting data on CSAM This recruitment method failed to yield significant data The team then instead asked law enforcement and hotline analysts who participated in the qualitative portion of the study to provide quantitative data Four agencies agreed to supply data for the project These agencies varied greatly in the type of data they shared See Appendix for added detail of what was supplied by the four agencies Cautions on the reliability of existing CSAM databases being used to draw conclusions about trends have been noted previously The quantitative data that we were able to collect for this study therefore doesnt allow for representative conclusions However it is presented throughout the results section in parallel to the trends identified by the experts in the qualitative dataTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL RESULTS Qualitative interviews with experts from around the globe were used to discuss trends in OCSE specifically interviews were focused on trends in the age of victims of OCSE and the severity of the sexual activity being depicted in CSAM To fully understand how and why these changes were taking place the qualitative interview guide sought to develop framework around participants background and experience working with CSAM characterise the typical victim depicted in material discuss changes in the sexual content production and distribution methods of material and review current policy and practice methods that could be improved or built upon Below each component is further explored UNDERSTANDING WHO PARTICIPATED Participants were law enforcement agents and hotline analysts who had at least year of experience working with child sexual abuse material however most of the participants had served their departments considerably longer with the upper limit being approximately years of service Participants described their roles as incredibly demanding with many taking on far more responsibilities than merely investigating or analysing material They often worked with small teams of individuals and felt their departments were underfunded or in need of additional staff The individuals spoke to the variety of activities they performed including analysing material investigating perpetrators identifying victims coding material and educating the public Below one investigator describes the educational aspect of his position in my department we are also responsible for going out to provide public education where we are warning the public about the dangers of cyber space clearly emphasising the issue of distribution of child pornography creation of child pornography and also production Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths The NetClean Report Similar demands on law enforcement were noted in NetCleans qualitative study with one of their eleven truths being supported by the fact that of police say identifying victims is not prioritized in their organization and say they have too much material to go through to have time to work on identifying victims Being responsible for so many different aspects of the investigation greatly affected what participants could accomplish We asked our participants about their current caseload and they ranged widely in how many cases they investigated the past year Some participants reported their teams focused on very small number of cases while others had the resources to analyse hundreds of reports We discussed whether the current caseload was similar or different than previous years and most agreed they were receiving more material but were not always able to investigate more cases They felt that advances in technology and changes in reporting procedures had led to their agencies receiving more reports or uncovering more imagery than they had previously As one hotline analyst described suppose the workload increases because we do lot of work where we will work with our local police forces who may come to us for advice and assistance As weve become more established team and people know who we are and the mechanisms are in place for people to make referrals we see an increase in the work because more people want to come and ask for our help basically While an increase in reports seems like good thing given the apparent increase in material being circulated participants felt they could not keep up with the demand Consistently lack of funding prevented law enforcement from investigating the additional reports TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALThe amount of referrals that are coming in are increasing From an output capability point of view because our resources havent increased we havent been able to increase the number of investigations that weve done which are tied to the level of resources that we have If we had more staff we would have greater output As said certainly the number of cases that have been through to us has increased over the last three or four years Some participants described hierarchies their agencies had in place for prioritising cases Investigators discussed new material and younger children as the main reasons to prioritise case It is important to note that some participants did not prioritise any case over another since they felt any material featuring subject who was under the age of eighteen necessitated an investigation The following quote gives an example of the investigative hierarchies that one team leader used We look at variety of factors We look at for example any new material so if theres content that we havent seen before where theres potential for abuse taking place we look at the severity of the material we look at the number and unity of subject matter If somebodys presenting initially from intelligence as clear established boy lover for example into very young children into babies that kind of thing those sorts of elements get prioritised Acting in distribution capacity that would get priority over position element The lifelong extent and length of offending type of material those would be the main priority And ultimately if we identified that the username has been seen before or the person have been seen as previous offender or had previous criminal behaviour we would look to prioritise it as wellPrioritising cases only makes sense if there are victims or offenders that pose greater risks to community safety However the interaction between these variables has not been welldocumented or standardised Clearly this department saw benefit in prioritising cases based on hierarchy but that was not always the case Understanding risk profiles or the interaction between variables such as victim age the newness of the material or the distribution method used and their potential to lead to an arrest or identified victim would help establish best practice CHARACTERISING THE TYPICAL VICTIM Every participant agreed that victims were predominantly white Some participants reported they handled small number of cases involving Asian and Hispanic children as well but black children were by far the rarest No explanation was given for the race disparity amongst victims Also despite the recent abundance of teen imagery and underage selfproduced material participants still anecdotally reported most victims were prepubescent children The profile described by the reports and our participants did differ on the gender of victims The three reports consistently show more female victims However some of our participants noticed that in their experience there was an even split between male and female victims while others reported that their cases were mostly female Participants were also quick to point out each perpetrator typically had type and that the online location at which the perpetrator was discovered corresponded to certain gender preferences ie being on boylovers forum The majority of our participants reported that they had witnessed decrease in the average age of the victim or alternatively stated this as an increase in very young victims although proportionately there were still more prepubescent and pubescent victims TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWHY AND WHEN DID THE AGE OF VICTIMS CHANGE Participants were unable to give an exact time the perceived change had taken place but it seems to have been very recent For example one participant attributed the change to being within the past few years would say that there are more offenders who are interested in prepubescent children and now increasingly in the last number of years in younger than prepubescent so in infants and children basically Another participant described the same change in victims ages but instead of an increasing amount the participant saw it as widening of an age preference that already existed amongst offenders think initially the ages were probably in or heading towards just prepubescent probably in the to kind of age group Were now seeing lot that are shifting slightly downwards towards the to age group and again slightly smaller portion that are under that infants and toddlers If you consider it bell curve type of situation the ages have shifted slightly younger simply because in the early days the bulk of the material presented was in that higher age group and now were looking at them being younger and in many cases prepubescent Another participant attributed the change to being global phenomenon lately the victims are at younger ages There is tendency would say an early sexualisation of children and it is true that we are seeing victims of increasingly early ages that has also been the case elsewhere Given the international perspective of this project it was interesting that some participants distinguished between the materials being produced in their country versus abroad participant from Colombia remarked Younger material is produced in other countries Its not Colombian pornography the pornography with younger kids are always produced in other countriesBOX CHILD CYBER CRIME GROUP Colombia The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is law enforcement agency dedicated to investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia The Group provided us with database of thousands of victims of commercial exploitation Our analyses were limited to the cases that involved victims of child sexual abuse material The average age of victims is presented as well as the proportion of male versus female victims in the table below Victims ages ranged from years old to years old with the total average age of victims being years old across all five years Also of note the majority of their victims were female with only total of victims being males across all five years Victim information from the Colombian Police Force Category thru July Avg Victim Age years Victim Gender Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Number of Cases TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALBOX POINT DE CONTACT France Point de Contact is hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network to combat OCSE In the year French Point de Contact handled cases of online child sexual abuse material Of these the victims ages were categoriaed as infant in cases prepubescent in pubescent in and indeterminate in The victims gender was determined in cases and skewed heavily towards female victims with of cases involving girls involving boys and involving both Age by gender was not available from the summary report Likewise some participants felt changes in the age of victims might be because the laws in their country surrounding CSAM and the subsequent enforcement of those laws were the reason they were seeing certain types of victims As one participated explained In redacted we see more kids because sometimes they can avoid being caught Because usually they upload the content over foreign website or crowdhost platform so they can easily get away with distributing material without being caught According to our law child sexual abuse content if your only possession is very minor crime and the penalty is you just have to pay fine When asked why they thought the age of victims was getting younger there was not consistent answer as to why this change occurred notable response was the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net targeting those with attractions to very young children The following are participants commentary on the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net On most of the boards it is actually forbidden to post anything under two but in this board redacted its actually the only thing that you can post You have two categories You have the babies which is between zero and two and then you have the toddler category which is between two and five This is new actually Maybe there were boards before didnt know of but this very popular board dedicated to baby lovers is kind of new The name of the country has been redacted to keep perpetrators from further exploiting this countrys laws would say were seeing more new material than we have ever seen before That is down to number of factors Its down again to the increased access to the Internet and increased access to devices through which it can be produced Thats one of the less important factors for this material Whats more important is call it the focusing factor When you have facilities or services like we have on the Dark Net and have had for the last number of years where individuals can come together They can talk about their sexual preferences openly They can admire the abuse that each other have perpetrated on children through the material that theyre able to contribute to one another and to distribute between one another When you have forums and website available where they cannot be or at least believe that they cannot be traced then those factors all become multiplied The willingness of individuals to encourage others to produce material to produce the material themselves and to post it and then to talk about that among each other is increased in those forms Further discussion around Dark Net forums dedicated to extremely young victims suggested that they did not exist few years ago and investigators are only now uncovering these sources for younger content Furthermore participants implied perpetrators might feel sense of safety in discussing their attraction to extremely young children within these forums as well as encouraging each other to produce this material since such topics had previously been too taboo to even discuss on prepubescent forums TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALHowever the Dark Net was not the only reason cited for the decrease in age Another participant reported that the change may be due to mandatory reporting laws Mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report if they learn or suspect child has been abused or neglected These laws have led to significant increase in reports of child sexual abuse The rationale is that perpetrators might find it is easier to molest child who is too young to speak and thus cannot complain or suggest they have been abused If they are unable to express that they have been abused an adult or caregiver in that childs life is unlikely to make report to the authorities Another explanation was that perpetrators and consumers are seeking new and more extreme content The victims can only get so young We have seen the abuse of babies and very very young toddlers depicted Thats going to play off because they cant get any younger than that Were seeing that it has We are at that point where the material is depicting the abuse for what it is rather than trying to sugar coat is as smiling happy faces happy family time kind of thing We also asked about the youngest victim participants had seen and every participant had come across material involving an infant or toddler during their career even those who did not think there had been change in the age of victims Several participants reported that the youngest child they had seen was days weeks or only few months old These extremely young children prompted the law enforcement agents to prioritise cases that involved younger children especially when they believe the content was new or that the child may still be alive Probably itd be couple of weeks agoIntervieweeWeve seen infants new born babies probably couple of days oldInterviewee InterviewerInterviewer Whats

tier severity score to rate child sexual abuse content Cases involving infants tend to feature more severe content ie penetration and adult on child activity instead of suggestive posing andor child on child activity These differences were statistically significant using the Chisquare test see bottom tableTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALEXPLORING CHANGES IN THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF MATERIAL In addition to the age of victims decreasing there may be connection between younger victims and more aggressive sexual content Egregious sexual content was often limited to investigations on more private platforms or platforms that protected offenders identities such as the Dark Net The Canadian Centre for Child Protection also found correlation between the age of victims and the severity of content in their report They found that younger victims experienced higher proportions of explicit and extreme sexual assault Similar findings have been reported by the recent study conducted by ECPAT and Interpol on unidentified victims in child sexual exploitation material stored in the ICSE Database Descriptions of the sexual behaviour perpetrated against younger children by our participants ranged from closeups of genitals to forceful and sadistic activity Some investigators felt there had been shift from older CSAM methods that would involve dressing up children and making the engagement seem enjoyable or pleasurable for the child whereas images nowadays depicted the abusive nature of act themselves would say that the material is becoming more and more aggressive For example before August we didnt analyse any images in TOR so that might change my opinion Because in torrent of content is penetrative In TOR the images and the videos are the worst Differences in distribution methods have been linked to differences in offenders and offense types in USA based investigation Likewise NetCleans qualitative study similarly found that of police say anonymization technologies were crucial challenge to identifying offenders who have produced child sexual abuse material They specifically comment on the difficulty that TOR presents which was expressed by some of our participants as well Several participants attributed the more aggressive activity to the false sense of security that the Dark Net gave them Canadian Centre for Child Protection Child Sexual Abuse

of America InternetFacilitated Sexual Offending Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths The NetClean Report and The dark net is really difficult for law enforcement They do enforce the law and work there and they try to get the offenders caught but its really difficult because its difficult to trace In way you can share totally illegal material and its not safe but in way its easier You dont get caught so its easy Why is it aggressive They have the opportunity to produce aggressive material and they think its really difficult to get caught think its also the fact somebody will pay great amount of money if you produce aggressive material One participant perceived the online culture as apparently rewarding the production of younger more aggressive material The participant described the behaviour by saying think the more you can produce or exchange the worst you can show to your other groups or to the other members of these groups you can rise in the ranking or you get more members Beyond sexual activity alone another noticeable change was perpetrators disgracing their victims bodies with words In recent years the content the photos by themselves are getting high and the sexual activity is getting lewd so we can see offenders put objects into childrens vaginas or they will over We saw some cases lately offenders writing some words on childrens bodies not good words words like bitch She loves to be doing this So its not just sexual activity its getting cruel Writing words phrases and usernames on childrens bodies was also suggested as way to prove to other members the material was new belonged to certain producer or fulfilled sort of bragging right Anecdotally it has been suggested that producers are scrubbing images of identifiers and EXIF data to protect themselves from being traced so it is surprising that producers would be willing to risk purposefully placing an identifier to recruit new members or achieve higher rank within their member groupsTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALBOX CHILD RESCUE COALITION USA Child Rescue Coalition is nonprofit organization that partners with US and nonUS investigators police officers and other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers They mainly provide technological assistance as well as host large database of CSAM hash values The US Child Rescue Coalition were able to provide us with summary of categorised new file hash values for the past years across five categories summarised in the table below hash value in this context represents an image that is known to contain illegal content The data show the proportion of child notable material compared with other categories of values Child notable material involves children age and under However the organisation primarily focuses their investigative efforts on prepubescent children Therefore it is expected that the majority of images they collect will be denoted as child notable New file hashes detected by Child the Protection System by year Category thru June June Child Notable Age Difficult Child Erotic Child Cartoon Erotic Total While the majority of participants felt the sexual activity had become more severe some felt there had not been noticeable difference They still saw aggressive sexual activity being perpetrated against victims of all ages but not stark increase in violence or violence against specific age group participant who felt the activity had remained constant no more or less aggressive than in previous years described content relating to age in the following way Weve seen cases of toddlers being abused Rarely rarely to the point of actual penetration but clearly the offenders genitals are visible placed somewhere over the victim That is the kind of aggressive material we can witness with regards to toddlers find that the content involving male offenders and young prepubescent victims particularly aggressive because of the nature of the act Because these children are clearly under age In comparison it does seem lot more shocking than when you see Child Notable Abuse imagery depicting visually prepubescent children typically years of age or younger Age Difficult Abuse imagery depicting postpubescent victims still believed to be under years of age Child Erotic Imagery depicting nude children not considered to be lewd display Child Cartoon Erotic Cartoon images produced to show children or children characters in sexual situations pubescent victim who could be but appears to be minor We are still obliged to qualify it as child abuse material Its not exactly the same type of abuse we witness in that case Differences in experience and perspectives of the trends such as these highlight the utility in assessing sexual activity with the scales that have been developed UNCOVERING THE TYPICAL OFFENDER While the literature has focused on convicted sex offenders the law enforcement agents and hotline analysts we spoke with gave insight into both detected and undetected offenders They suggested offenders continue to grow more and more protective of their identities as technologies and investigative techniques advance Every participant said it was rare to see an offenders face nowadays and when an offenders face is visible those tend to be adolescent offenders or rookie offenders For the most part offenders only showed body parts TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALand made sure no personal identifiers ie scars tattoos deformities were visible Its extremely rare that we can see the offender If we can see him its only parts of his body or if its the whole silhouette his face will usually be hidden under mask We hardly ever see the face of an offender Consensus amongst interviewees was that most men acted alone either purchasing sex from children problem in lowincome countries extorting children online through social media or grooming children they were close to ie family members The relationship between offender and child changes depending on which of the aforementioned situations is taking place Offenders of younger children tend to be intimate with one participant acknowledging You know with younger kids it often is either some kind of familial relationship or something close to that like boyfriend or something in terms of having actual access to the child especially at younger age or maybe weve seen couple where its babysitters but Id say mostly its more familial relationships for the younger ages because of course as soon as you get into the online abuse and grooming and things like that its going to be total strangers rather than somebody that they actually know Unlike victims where participants discussed common characteristics giving profiles that were supported by other reports many participants felt there was no common characteristic amongst offenders The participants who gave an offender profile often mentioned older males probably in their to who were white typology of convicted offenders Women appear to be very rarely involved in the production of material though some said they were starting to see women produce CSAM especially when being coerced by man such as boyfriend or for money One participant echoed this notation stating would say there is tendency for female offenders to accept for profit because we now see an area where mothers are abusing children on webcam or live shows for money would say the CSAM produced by women is always as know of coordinated by man Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths few participants did imply there were times they saw women acting of their own volition but again women were considered maybe in every offenders if that Some participants reported that they never actually saw women IDENTIFYING PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION METHODS Though it is generally understood that child sexual abuse material is produced and distributed in variety of ways participants described investigative efforts as being constant race to outpace new methods notable difference between todays producers and old producers are the number of mediums available Participants mentioned that technology like digital cameras laptops and cell phones have greatly influenced who produce images Though there may be some evidence that higher quality images are considered more valuable cell phones and webcams seem to have become the norm This finding is again supported by the qualitative study of police that found mobile phones and videos are becoming increasingly common in investigations In particular they allow perpetrators to offend in their own homes and at their convenience which may contribute to the age of children decreasing participant explained the biggest change he had experienced From the top of my head Id say more and more amateur content is being produced Meaning home self produced content unfortunately This is parting with the given impression that CSAM is something that you maybe find in more exotic countries typically Eastern Asia with sex tourism The fact is we see more if were talking about ethnicity here weve seen lot of Caucasian white children being abused by what seems to be parent or close relative within the framework of household Thats what refer to when say amateur content Likewise distribution methods have grown Distributors were characterised as being fluid and step ahead of investigators They often exploited new technologies and deftly used apps and other networks privacy policies to their advantage participant described distribution in the following way TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALIt changes all the time mean the last couple of weeks we had high number of cases in Snapchat Its very newly used by offenders Yeah think it changes lot It changes every week think by the numbers and every application think the dark net is still high number Peer to peer is same constantly used Another participant explained the popularity of live streaming distribution method that has only very recently become prominent think yes distribution changed little bit Not just little quite bit Live streaming is think big issue live stream abuse or distance abuse when children are put into prostitution or forced into prostitution in different parts of the world Southeast Asia Africa South America things like that And somebody in other continents would pay to view this So those observers payers watchers whatever they would gather those videos for their own purposes as they paid for them Live streaming presents particularly challenging situation to law enforcement because if produced properly there is no evidence that the crime ever existed even though law enforcement may see evidence of money transfers and call times Likewise without witnessing the abuse it is difficult to charge consumers with possession of CSAM since there is no actual recording left Furthermore it has the potential to cross international jurisdictions as well as involve requesting assistance from the webcasting service There also seems to be vast differences in the type of content hosted on each platform As mentioned earlier more aggressive and younger content are found on more secure places like the Dark Web The younger victims would tend to be in the areas that have the greater levels of security and that community element The overt kind of open platforms such as social networks and your standard Internet platforms would tend to be slightly older victims It comes down to the degree of comfort that the individual has in terms of the platform theyre using and the way they discern the age of the victim Interviewee it has differences because the pornography or the materials that you can find on the deep web on the dark web is more aggressive than the pornography that you can find on the social media Interviewer Are they different with ages and gender as well not just sexual content Interviewee They are younger Interviewer Why do you think that they are different Why is social media different than the other places Interviewee It depends On the social media they have to be more discreet They have to be careful with the things that they are doing versus other areas of the web Because on the other websites they dont have to be careful because the material is very dark like they are very safe Anonymity sense of safety and more extreme content tend to be common characteristics of material distributed on the dark web Social media seems to be place where participants found older victims or less aggressive CSAM These differences in content and victims suggest that there may be room for further investigation to develop risk profiles and investigative hierarchies IMPACTING POLICY Participants expressed improving policy on three levels globally nationally and locally Globally participants wanted greater collaboration between law enforcement agencies during investigations Some investigators related frustrations over their inability to secure search warrants in timely manner or hitting severe roadblocks due to paperwork and legalities that inhibited them from effectively cooperating with other investigators on crossboarder cases Furthermore participants had mixed feeling about industry partners Some felt they made their job easier while others found them to be obstacles participant eloquently stated his opinion on the topic TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWeve all heard the phrase You cant prosecute your way out of this issue There is need for multidisciplinary approach to looking at this type of thing especially where we overlay the idea that lot of the material is generated out in areas where extreme poverty exists and this is way of remedying that poverty as way of physically trafficking children or digitally trafficking children through like webcams In terms of the offending there needs to be tools that allow law enforcement to work together across jurisdictional boundaries much more effectively There needs to be tools in place that allow the investigations to be done in timely and effective way There needs to be tools that allow case referrals to happen very quickly Legislative tools that allow law enforcement to get subscriber information from other jurisdictions easily and quickly and get information out of service providers easily and quickly Nationally participants wanted databases to be implemented and maintained They also desired stricter laws for people who perpetrate these crimes They felt they were often stunted by the ways they were allowed to investigate material online in comparison to other fields and wanted to be given more freedom in their approach to taking down material conducting sting operations and probing leads participant highlighted this notion This is topic really feel that it hurts everyone that as societies makes us look very bad And at the end of the day the effort and the sum of all not only the police This is job that must be done from different areas from different strata Both in society and government and industry in the private sector in companies We all have substantial responsibility in this And think that the dissemination of information of what is happening really is fundamental Let people know that simply downloading single image containing such is crime and therefore can go to jail think that is fundamental think people need to know that this is crime crime that is paid and paid dearly People go to jail for doing this kind of behaviour Locally participants consistently brought up needing more resources and funding They felt that while many people and politicians recognise online child sexual exploitation as problem they never allocate the appropriate funds for training staffing and new technologies Addressing those concerns would be paramount in ensuring that law enforcement can effectively do their jobs TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALAs noted across the reviewed literature the interviews with law enforcement and the limited complementary quantitative data presented here CSAM crimes are varied and subject to change terminology differs across researchers and practitioners and inconsistent ways of operationalising and measuring CSAM makes comparison across studies difficult This has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation and is evidenced to be the case with online CSAM Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by the volume of online content in the open and also hidden Internet and the reality that content may be removed but not destroyed and copied endlessly To date we have been dependent on criminal justice records and public reports to hotlines as well as proactive searching for data but both are subject to biases and are likely to underestimate the volume of CSAM in circulation Studies using data sourced from existing databases such as ICSE also face challenges as the data was not collected for research purposes but rather for operational reasons and reflects the vagaries of reporting and managing missing information What we can conclude is that criminal justice data from public records as well as research surveys would suggest an increase over time in the number of CSAM crimes However some of this data is now quite old and public records also reflect changes in legislation and recording of crimes across different jurisdictions It is also difficult to unpick whether the increases in recorded CSAM crimes reflect an overall increase in these crimes or greater investment by law enforcement possibly aided by technological tools to detect and prosecute them Youthproduced images also pose new challenges for law enforcement in terms of resource demands alongside their ability to determine the age of the child and whether they have been produced as part of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent behaviour that is consistent with adolescent development and risktaking Mapping of existing national and international CSAM databases would suggest that they fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections While there are number of databases globally there is limited connectivity between them Differences in how data is defined and recorded means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions as to whether there have been changes in the gender age and level of violence within recorded CSAM There is some suggestive evidence that the percentage of egregious images has increased over time but inconclusive evidence in whether there are changes in the ages of children except that since there appears to have been an increase in the volume of CSAM involving pubescent children thought to be linked with trends in growth of self produced content facilitated by wider access to new technologies Across three studies younger victims are associated with greater levels of sexual violence produced within family context and more likely to be widely distributed However the preponderance of images is of pubescent and pre pubescent children and the numbers of images of very young children infants and toddlers remain relatively low What is consistent across different datasets is that the majority of victims and offenders are white Caucasians and while there has been an increase in other ethnic groups these number remain disproportionately small This does require further investigation given the increasing availability of Internet connectivity through handheld devices and the concerns expressed about for example live streaming of sexual abuse The qualitative results from expert interviews confirm the study hypothesis that victims of OCSE appear to be getting younger and the decline in age has happened recently However this is far from clearly confirmed The report from the IWF suggested decline in the percentage of reported images of children under from in to in and corresponding increase in victims aged to respectively The IWF concluded that this may relate to the increase in youthproduced images alongside the fact that since IWF analysts have been allowed to proactively search for content The public are more likely than analysts to report children under the age of and where there is more severe abuse When IWF analysts find forum with thousands of images of child sexual abuse they work to remove the forum as well as capture the URLs of every image CONCLUDING DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONSTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALon there which might be pulled from another site They then seek to remove each image hosted on the other sites as well The IWF conclude that this technique appears to be associated with finding more images of to yearold children The experts within the study had not reached consensus as to why they concluded that the age of victims is decreasing but one suggestion was the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net specifically dedicated to younger children which did not previously exist Such market place was thought to naturally encourage the production of new material as well as facilitate its sharing The Dark Net is seen as notorious safe house for some of the most egregious content and as law enforcement and hotline analysts begin to specifically target these forums it is speculated that they will undoubtedly see an increase in young victims Another explanation given for the decreasing age of victims was that offenders have gained sense of safety and confidence on private platforms eg live streaming that make it easier to produce violent material When participants discussed distribution methods some mentioned outdated policies and legislation that inhibited them from being proactive in investigations Similarly few participants suggested that investigative efforts have continued to be blocked by companies and countries that do not fully cooperate with law enforcement Despite the ongoing international dialogue around child online sexual exploitation participants believed that the public appears to misunderstand the gravity and implications of restricting investigations Participants also emphasised the fact that additional funding would significantly help their investigative teams Funding would address the majority of issues participants had with current practices it would allow them to add staff members in turn processing more cases build national databases of images and videos and appropriately train staff It was felt that drastic increases in the number of cases reported each year and lack of funding have left professionals with little ability to implement valuable resources such as the development of national image databases as well as annual staff training Furthermore it was suggested that efforts should be made to encourage collaboration between researchers advocates and law enforcement agents so that the field can continue to grow and promote best practices LIMITATIONS When recruitment began for the quantitative portion of the study invitations and flyers were distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe requesting data on online sexual abuse images These initial invitations yielded very few responses Upon further probing it appeared many countries lacked the funding and staff needed to maintain national databases especially databases that would retain the level of detail our research team desired to establish standards for evidencebased advocacy and programming As one agent acknowledged even if his department was presented with additional funding he would probably dedicate the funds to more investigative staff rather than sacrifice team member to data entry and management Other departments and organisations were advocating for or had recently received funds to establish national databases but were still in the beginning phases of designing and implementing their databasesTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL RECOMMENDATIONS Law enforcement agents and hotline analysts are seeing changes in CSAM However expert opinions are not sufficient to establish global metrics substantial quantitative data is necessary As the limitations of this study suggested there are still many barriers to overcome before global metrics andor indicators can be developed RECOMMENDATION Invest in the development and maintenance of national database of CSAM in each country It is difficult to determine the costbenefit ratio of agencies dedicating staff time as well as their often limited funds to maintaining national database However to more effectively establish global trends in OCSE it is crucial that law enforcement agencies throughout the world have databases or the ability to track relevant information about the material they process and investigate including characteristics of offenders victims and the sexual activity depicted in the imagery RECOMMENDATION Track and analyse trends in CSAM data nationally and globally Governments must track and analyse trends in CSAM data both at national levels and in cooperation with international law enforcement to better understand and therefore more effectively fight OCSE RECOMMENDATION Promote participation in research by law enforcement agencies The benefits of evidencedbased advocacy and action are far reaching but collaboration is often restricted by the need to negotiate complex ethical processes associated with sharing sensitive data or simply from lack of resources There are clear opportunities to foster collaboration between law enforcement agencies and professional researchers that would benefit both partners Researchers and advocates should work to strengthen their relationships with law enforcement agencies and hotlines in order to facilitate such projects RECOMMENDATION Move towards standard variables for collecting storing and analyzing CSAM data Analysis of limited quantitative data allowed the research team to test assumptions about how law enforcement agencies collect and store CSAM data It was assumed that agencies would vary slightly in how they collected coded and defined variables However vast differences were noted in what organisations considered important to include in their databases and how they maintained them Some variables will need to be standardized across databases for global metrics to be achieved RECOMMENDATION Consult stakeholders from around the globe to develop set of basic shared variables and promote agreement to store CSAM data in line with these Bringing together key stakeholders to define variables and standardise the way data is captured within databases would assist investigators advocates and researchers in establishing and comparing trends It is not enough to have large databases with lots of variables rather we need robust databases with useful and carefully defined variables to better understand and more effectively act to prevent this crime from happening Bringing together key stakeholders around the globe to define variables and standardise the way data is capture within databases would assist investigators advocates and researchers in establishing and comparing trends It is not enough to have large databases with lots of variables rather we

the content of child sexual abuse materials over your career Why do you think these changes have occurred Victim Profile Can you describe the typical victim in the child sexual abuse materials that you analyze What is the average age of children in child sexual abuse materials What is the youngest child youve seen When was this How often do you see children this age ii What would you say the proportion of Infant Toddler Prepubescent Pubescent children are in the material you analyze What is the common gender and ethnicity of children in child sexual abuse materials How does the gender and ethnicity relate to the different age categories For example do infant victims tend to be male while prepubescent victims tend to be female Are victims different age gender ethnicity in cases where youre able to identify child versus cases where youre unable to identify child Why do you think those differences exist Infant Toddler Young Child Have you noticed any changes in the content of infant toddler prepubescent child sexual abuse materials or in the amount of such materials either in absolute terms or relative to pubescent abuse materials Why do you think these changes are happening What policies or resources do you think would help to prevent this from happening Offender Profile How often is an offender visible in the material Does the presence of an offender change depending on the age or gender of the child When visible can you describe the typical offender in cases with either infants toddlers or prepubescent children How old would you estimate the average offender to be Is there common gender Are there typically multiple offenders If so how many If there are multiple offenders are they the same gender or opposite gender What is the common ethnicity of the offender Does it normally match the ethnicity of the child Are the offenders in cases with young children different than the cases with pubescent childrenTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALSexual Content Has the sexual content of child sexual abuse images changed over time Is it more or less aggressive than in the past Why do you think those changes are happening How does the sexual activity relate to the age categories Meaning will you please describe the differences in content between infants toddlers prepubescent pubescent Does it normally involve child on child adult on child or solo activity

material was produced eg grooming of contact child prostitute covert filming Have the production methods changed webcam cell phone hidden camera Have the distribution methods changed Meaning what mediums do individuals use to trade the material PP Email deep web websites Are different types of sexual content or ages traded on different platforms Why do you think that is Where are materials typically filmedproduced eg on the street in hotels in house Does the location change when the material involves younger children How often would you say series of images or videos is traded meaning do you mostly come across private collections or do you see series circulating What would you consider an actively traded case of child pornography Are there differences between cases that are actively traded and cases that are not actively traded ii Do you think the age of the child influences whether the case is actively traded If yes why do you think that is Policy Impact What do you

Association of French Internet Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network to combat OCSE Point de Contact provided summary report on cases reported to the hotline by year from This report describes the total number of reported cases by Internet service type eg website PP forum etc the number of cases in each broad content category eg child pornography child nudism adult pornography accessible to children etc the number of cases from each country of origin and the action taken by the agency on each case Point de contact was unable to provide victim details such as age or gender However these data can be used to inform how CSAM comes to the attention of national reporting hotline and to help identify gaps that might exist in law enforcements current approach to identifying exploitive images Point de Contact also provided summary report of information hosted in France provided by INHOPE for the months of JanNov The report describes the total number of actions taken by French authorities as well as the gender and age distributions infant prepubescent pubescent of cases The data supplied only spans the past year so it was impossible to determine temporal trends Guardia Civil Spain The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation of Children is law enforcement agency in Spain Guardia Civil provided partial database from to that describes online material that the police have investigated At the time of data collection this agency is in the process of categorising their data and so additional data might be available at future point From the data provided it was unclear how much data from each year had been included in the dataset For all investigated material this database included the sixmonth window in which the material was identified eg JulyDec both broad content description eg sexual activity between childrensexual activity between an adult and child and more specific content description victim age categories years years and whether an infant appears in the content These data are the most pertinent to the primary research question While offender information and other victim demographic information eg race are missing the content descriptions may provide an opportunity to examine temporal trends in content severity and the presence of young children Child Cyber Crime Group Colombian National Police The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is law enforcement agency dedicated to investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia The Child Cyber Crime Group provided database of Colombian victims of sexual exploitation from to July Given that not all the cases pertained to online child exploitation our investigation was limited to cases denoted as victims of CSAM Victim age and gender are summarised by year These data are extremely useful for our primary research question however there are too few cases to detect statistically significant differences However we do see agreement between interviewers and the national database TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD

llamado revisar radicalmente la niez el desarrollo la luz de vivencias luchas contextos reales Introduction The communication strategies which accompanied modernisation interventions in the field of devel opment from the onwards were topdown decontextualised and technologically determinist One of the assumptions on which they were premised was that dissemination of information alonecan lead to substantial change and more specifically that technical innovation can radically trans form remote rural communities in developing nations by pulling them towards Western urbanised modernity and comparable economic prosperity Manyozo When largescale expensive development interventions consistently failed to provide these intended results instead exacer bating economic and social inequalities in their target areas the premise and foundation of their design and implementation were questioned Escobar Friere Melkote and Steeves While some critiques of modernisation rationales and practices for using mass media such as television have gained purchase among media and development practitioners resulting in theemergence of more participatory approaches Kleine Hollow and Poveda many of the assumptions of the modernisation paradigm persist In relation to children and young people expectations regarding the promise of ICTs are often at their highest building on the hugely appealing rhetoric of the digital native Banaji Brown and Czerniewicz Many policymakers and practitioners hope that the proliferation of ICTs and digital media in developing countries can expand the participatory potential of communicationfor development CD programming But others argue that the rhetoric around ICTs has provided anew and alluring guise for technocentric modernisation thinking in development Mazzarella and is becoming ever more entrenched as the notion of digital imaginary Third and Collin gains purchase Given this contested context this article addresses two overarching questions What does the available evidence reveal about adolescents access use and everyday contact with media and digital technologies in low and middleincome countries including about devel opment programmes use of digital media to target adolescents Does the available evidence also indicate how problematic practices and modernising assump tions of development projects using digital media with adolescents in low and middleincomecountries could be addressed and transformed These questions concern the intersections among several domains of knowledge ICTs and digital media and adolescence both domains heavily led by research in the Global North and CD and ICTD programmatic interventions in low and middleincome countries LMICs Each is contested even with regard to terminology In this article we identify the central terms debates and findingsthat have shaped these fields in the past decade and examine the gaps between what is known about adolescents everyday mediadigital usage in LMIC contexts and the messy realities of devel opment interventions using ICTs with adolescents To answer our research questions we draw on rapid evidence review of the literature on ado lescence media use ICTs and CD interventions in range of low and middleincome countries see Livingstone et al in press undertaken as part of the Overseas Development Institute longitudinal research project Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE We include material from subDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE Saharan Africa South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa MENA with some insights from Latin America and EastSouth East Asia The experience of undertaking this review in itselfbrought us face to face with intellectual and political tensions between the perspectives of scholars and practitioners familiar on the one hand with international development discourses or on the other hand with digital media and ICTs or again with childhood and adolescence Methodology We searched databases for research published from to The original focus was on girlsaged but this was widened to include girls and boys aged when initial searching revealed paucity of research on young girls and ICTs For reasons of quality control priority was given to research published in peerreviewed journal but recognising that much of the research in this field derives from NGOs government reports and industry sources we also included nonpeerreviewed grey literature and unpublished reports Our search terms were internet OR online OR digital OR mobile phone OR app OR comput OR cell phone OR ICT OR social networking OR platform OR broadband OR connect AND child OR young OR youth OR teenage OR adolescen OR minor OR kid OR girl OR boy OR student AND developing countr OR low and middle income countr OR low income countr OR middle income countr OR Africa OR Asia OR MENA OR Middle East and North Africa ORMiddle East OR North Africa These were tested on preidentified databases with the results limited to English and to the period This resulted in total of studies which was supplemented by consulting international experts of whom replied as shown in Table The total of studies represents the cumulative total of hits on each database prior to the exclusion of duplicates Some expert recommendations were also captured in the database searches The overlap and duplicates between the expert recommendations and database searches were removed The studies were then screened on thebasis of titles and abstracts to judge their relevance to the inclusion criteria about children media tech nologies development and LMICs which led to streamlined batch of studies The majority of the results that were excluded pertained entirely to adults or university students over the age of This canbe explained by the different definitions of adolescence in different countries Despite the filters and the search terms many results still pertained to countries in the Global North some of these results were retained where they provided useful insights on the digital media uses of adolescents from marginalised populations in those countries and could thereby provide an indication of access and uses and practices of digital media of adolescents from underserved communities The studies were screened down to studies by reviewing the sections on methodology and study design of eachfull text article in order to check their compatibility with the inclusion criteria We included few studies from highincome countries HICs on the grounds that they captured transnational phenomena or relevant conditions for digital media use in LMICs We read and codedfull texts of these studies according to type of study type of data design of evaluative studies geographical distribution and income classifications as applied by DFID UK We coded each study thematically in terms of focus on digital access skills and practices opportunities online risks andmediation by parents educators and peers Finally we selected the studies employing

relevant research designs and evaluated their findings by means of standardised analytical template that identified the research questions placegeographical location method includingsample and age group claimsfindings study evaluation and critical and discursive comment on epistemology framing of ICTs and adolescence We complemented the resulting insights with selected case studies of ICTrelated programme interventions targeted at the capability developmentof children in LMICs We note in reflecting on this process that it was disappointing to find so little empirical research on children and adolescents experiences of ICTs in LMICs given the optimistic hyperbole in many inter national policy statements regarding their being supposedly at the forefront of adoption and creative appropriation It was also disappointing to find ourselves documenting as below the limitations in conception design and quality of the available research far more often than we could celebrate inspir ing studies or programmes with insightful implications for future research and good practice Despite the wealth of sophisticated literature on children in education studies and childhood studies see Ennew we suspect this situation reflects the relative invisibility of children experiences for development researchers and policymakers it being easier to impose adultcentric assumptions than to engage seriously with children themselves It may also reflect the sense endemic in the study of ICTs in development that technology and indeed children uses of it is chan ging too fast for indepth investigation or especially longerterm evaluation of interventions Last it was often the case that although study was included in our review for its relevance to ICTs for the researchers or practitioners involved the ICTs were often blackboxed as merely convenientand uptodate means of distributing resources so that the specific relation between children litera ciesincontext and the affordances of the ICTs deployed would go unnoticed Unseen children messy realities beyond the official statistics Given that children up to years old comprise one third of the population in less developed countries UN it is surprising but indicative of children low status that neither the Inter national Telecommunications Union nor any other source eg UNICEF is able to document children internet access in terms of official statistics for more than handful of countries Best available estimates suggest that children are also around one third of the world internet users Livingstone Carr and Byrne going online roughly in the same proportion as adults albeit fewer when very young and up to twice as much as adults when adolescent ITU This makes it impossible to break down the category of children in terms of gender age household income or any other factor although for adults often misleadingly described as individuals orthe population plenty of sources document persistent forms of inequality within as well as between countrieseg GSMA ITU World Bank It is also of course difficult to break down the cat egory of ICTs using official statistics ICTs take different forms including online networked mobile and also more established media radio television film press and so on all of which areincreasingly accessible via online platforms online itself includes diverse internet services includ ing information gaming social media streaming and other services But even if the statistics were available qualitative research reveals the many reasons why bald percentages should be scrutinised qualified and contextualised It charts the manifold ways in which access and use depend on resolving host of challenges associated with electricity connec tivity cost digital skills social acceptability spatial privacy and adult permission at the communityand individual levels as well as with commercial viability investment and government regulation at the level of the state or region Chigona Kamkwenda and Manjoo Hilbert For many children access is absent limited sporadic or otherwise problematic and it varies by age gender socioeconomic status caste and other important sources of inequality Banaji Bosch For example in their sizeable multimethod study of to yearolds mobile phone use in Ghana Malawi and South Africa Porter et al found that mobile phone ownershipusageDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE varies according to the income level of each country with Malawi scoring the lowest followed by Ghana then South Africa There is the same pattern across locations in each country with theremote rural being the lowest Distinctively certainly by comparison with children experiences in much of the Global North many young people across Africa obtain work and live off resources provided by social contacts kin and friend ship networks are crucial in this respect This requires careful nurturing of social relationships over time and mobile phone contact is extremely valuable Porter et al Porter et al sndings caution against the assumption of linear progression between the spread of ICTs and mobile devices across the globe and access as optimistically assumed in industry and policyreports eg GSMA They demand recognition of the crucial distinction ever less meaningful in the Global North between access and use In their research most young people did not own personal phones and so had to ask for or borrow them most commonly from afamily member with phone ownership sometimes facilitated as gift from urbanbased family members But such phone ownership can be transient since young people phones are also sold to obtain daily essentials when in need Moreover borrowing is in ected by family status eg foster status household resources and livelihood patterns and intergenerational relationships Forexample restrictions on borrowing are widely reported in Ghana and Malawi Porter et al and also in India Banaji Even when access is feasible care should be taken in presuming use In their smallscale compari son of two cases with South African youth one with lowincome older urban teens and one with younger boys from an affluent suburb Walton and Pallitt provide nuanced sense of digital media in everyday life For the poorer adolescents it emerged that poverty constrains mediause in key ways One boy listened to his neighbour music through the wall and he rationed daily game playing to minutes to save his phone battery as he pays to charge it It seems too that he only used some phone functions again to save money Another boy used such an old phone that his peers ridiculed him so he tried to use it in ways that his friends wouldn notice eg on silentvibrate to avoid being shamed Furthermore the boys in this study selected their games because they were free or very cheap and they were ingenious in locating freecheap downloads and in avoiding com mercial tactics to steal their prepaid airtime The older teenage girls too had developed strategies to manage their stringent lack of resources for instance deleting their games to make phone space for messages from boyfriends saved to cherish intimate memories Between the older boys and girls local instant messenger app permitted playful and flirtatious interactions offering way toshow off by competing to collect contacts Walton and Pallitt observe that gaming is popular local appropriation of mobile phones Unlike expensive console games they do not require specialised hardware or negotiations with other household members Significantly this led them to explore how game literacy permits young people to articulate and reappropriate their lived experi ences of gender class and ethnicity with energy and creativity although the consequence is thereproduction of existing inequalities for example boys using gaming to reassert the value of mascu line subcultures and the exclusion of girls from this Good intentions backfire struggles to deploy ICT to overcome inequality Particularly problematic as amply illustrated in our corpus of research studies are those policy andprogrammatic interventions which focus on access alone as the solution to inequality without due attention to context and consequences intended and unintended For example Hansen et al examined whether provision of laptop for educational purposes enabled the cognitive development of to yearolds in Ethiopia comparing them after six months of use to children without such provision Perhaps surprisingly there were no systematic increases in student perform ance due to laptop use But this overall finding was on more detailed examination qualified by finding that use of laptops did benefit the performance of students on measures of abstract BANAJI ET ALreasoning in higher grades but not in lower ones possibly because the older children used the laptops more and for more activities In other words providing access without attention to preexist ing skills and social contexts can result in exacerbating rather than ameliorating inequality While this problem is known in ICTD circles the troubling case of One Laptop per Child being the most telling instance James recent literature remains replete with studies that see mingly discover anew that merely providing access is unlikely to deliver intended goals quite the contrary benign interpretation suggests tha this reflects insufficient knowledgesharing among the different expert fields that infor intervention programmes the dual myths of potent new technologies and digitally savvy children holding sway for many even when evidencecontradicts them less benign interpretation points to the political and economic interests behind interventions focused on the highly visible and newsworthy distribution of expensive and shiny technologies while underinvesting in muchne eded accompanying programmes for literacy and training and saliently failing to consult the views of the supposed beneficiaries especially whenthese are merely children Sometimes it simply seems beyond the scope of study to examine why wellintended interven tion fails For instance consider Pfeiffer et al puzzlement when providing to year olds in urban Tanzania with health information They found that even though the adolescents weremediasavvy almost none of them made use of sexual and reproductive health information on the sites targeted at youth Instead they went into search engines such as Google where they entered keywords and screened the websites that came up similar instance is Nwalo and Anasi study of adolescent girls access to and use of reproductive health information in Nigeria they found that interpersonal means of communication and mass media were the sources through which the respondents accessed reproductive health infor mation notwithstanding the availability of more reliable indepth and con dential information online While these studies presumed that digitally savvy young people would bene if resources were simply provided for Gouws Banaji and Brown and Czerniewicz the digital native discourse has more pernicious consequences in compounding existing inequalities by directing learning resources uncritically towards those who are already at home in digital environ ments even though they are often already privileged This is not to argue against the importance and value of support for digital resources and skills but rather to urge attention to empirical research on how such resources and skills are distributed unequally and then to ask critical questions aboutwhich should be fostered with whom and to further which or whose goals To counter the problematic emphasis on access alone Larghi et al frame their study of Argentinian teenagers in terms of the digital divide distinguishing the firstorder digital divide inaccess to hardware and connectivity as function of age gender and social class the second order digital divide in digital media appropriation within families and the development of digital skills and literacies and the thirdorder digital divide in terms of actual practices of use andthereby the benefits that might accrue In the Global North attention to the firstorder divide is fading as access becomes taken for granted although the importance of the second and third order divides remains important In the Global South all three are important demanding distinctbut interrelated research on access social contexts and consequences of use But addressing such challenges demands nuanced and contextualised research For instance Lemphane and Prinsloo ethnographic comparison of the digital literacy practices of to yearolds living in wealthy white and poor black slum households outside Cape Town South Africa acknowledged the ways in which these resources have become part of rhetoricof progress and modernity in order to grasp how and why provision of digital tools entrenched ratherthan overcame social and economic inequalities digital media were at least partially complicit in widening of the gap to the extent that the differential uses and availability of resources across social classes produce different imaginings of self social ambitions andDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE investments and differing ways with social semiotics Such differences translate into and contribute to the main tenance of social inequalities in school settings that coincide with language and social class divides In short in the context of South Africa where English is the language of privileged white elite merely going online was implicated in reinforcing hierarchies of power While the privileged Bolton children are learning to think of themselves as legitimate participants in local online globally connected middleclass English languagebased culture the poor Mahlale children are acquiring linguistic resources that are localised indexical of their subelite status and not associated with success in school ingLemphane and Prinsloo Lemphane and Prinsloo are critical of calls for digital outofschool interventions that use mobile phones or multiplayer games but pay little attention to the way in which limited access and unsympathetic surroundings lack of food time parents with little interest in digital media can frame and alter poor nonwhite children experiences of pleasure and learning online As one of the few studies designed to examine these differences in qualitative and comparative ways Lem phane and Prinsloo work suggests template for other future studies in different locales In other words if insights from wealthy homes are to be applied in less privileged contexts considerable criticality and adaptation will be vital Countering adultism the importance of childcentred contextualised and participatory approaches InGirls Speak Out based on fasttalk process with girls aged from countries in Asia West Africa and Latin America across mix of rural and urban locations de Pauw see also Raftree and Bachan found that on the one hand the girls faced substantial problems including teen pregnancy child labour health risks poor sanitation and sexual violence but they nonethelesshave big dreams for their future careers and see education as the foundation for their success in life Asked specifically about ICTs they were eloquent about both the difficulties of access adding new insights on for instance how domestic chores took up all their time and how boys edged them away from the computers in school while cybercafs could be site of sexual harassment and also theopportunities they hope for They talked about valuing ICT to research issues they care about includ ing their rights community development physical and mental health information economic oppor tunities news gaining job skills or finding work They wanted to share experiences discuss problemsor use ICTs for activities related to awarenessraising campaigning civic engagement and student mobilisation Girls proposed solutions to increasing their access to ICT are also noteworthy they highlighted the need to address genderbased inequalities injustice and stereotypes both in general and inrelation to technology They thought it would be necessary to educate parents teachers and com munities on the importance of girls access to digital media as well as to make access to ICTs better Girls were also interested in ICTs being better integrated in the curriculum having technology content and curricula in their own languages and in more opportunities for peertopeer learning Yet in our rapid evidence review we found few studies exploring these topics or seeking ways toempower girls in the ways they themselves wish for good example of an initiative seeking to empower adolescents to discuss the issues that concern them while informing local governance policies is UNICEF mobilebased platform UReport This text messaging communication platform was launched in Uganda in Kleine Hollow and Poveda as local initiative allowing young people to contribute ideas to governance and decision making processes that impact on their local communities Users have an average age of and those who sign up share opinions on topics ranging from job skills to disaster management UNICEF and respond to questions sent out by UNICEF staff twice week These are then aggre gated and shared with media and policymakers Since its inception UReport has spread to several other countries and has reportedly reached million active users UNICEF Although in some BANAJI ET ALcountries the platform is also used by policymakers crucially for our argument evidence that young people voices expressed on the platform have any impact on or response from policymakers is slim in the evaluations and children are not included either in evaluation or policymaking In another case the Kenyabased nonprofit organisation AkiraChix partnered with large develop ment organisations and the corporate sector to address the underrepresentation of women and girlsin ICTrelated fields Its programmes target girls of different ages and backgrounds and include kids camps weeklong intensive boot camp training sessions for high school girls and yearlong trainingin programming design and entrepreneurship for young women from underprivileged backgrounds followed by placements in different tech organisations at the end of the programme Since young women trained by AkiraChix have gone on to get internships jobs or to start their own businesses AkiraChix nd The programmes raise the capabilities of these young women equip them with employability skills open up opportunities of possible career in ICTs and bring them into contact with highly skilled women ICT mentors all of which are in themselves huge opportunities However the intensive effort required to reach this relatively small number ofgirls over several years makes such an initiative difficult to sustain or implement at scale Other challenges and criticisms also exist One is that the widespread fascination with digital tech nologies risks that the focus and analysis becomes mediacentric losing sight of the bigger picture ofthe contexts and meanings of children lives within which digital media may or may not find their place and contribute constructively or otherwise This problem seems particularly evident in thefield of health and information seeking where the convenience and confidentiality of digitalmedia is particularly appealing to practitioners There is little doubt that adolescents want such infor mation Global Kids Online found that around fifth of to yearolds and of to year olds in South Africa looked for health information online at least every week Byrne et al But initiatives often promote narrow adultdefined forms of information rather than responding to adolescents interests or they provide generic access to the internet with little check on the types of information gleaned in terms of accuracy or relevance No wonder they chart lessthanhoped for success while their target audience sought the required information from peers parents or the morefamiliar mass media Livingstone et al in press Relatedly and keen to benefit from the fact that adolescents access to digital media is growing significantly in many low and middleincome contexts Mitchell et al recommend not an eitheror approach but rather that education programs delivered facetoface such as in school or religious settings could be enhanced with SMS reminders and additional information about program content An example of programme designed for flexible delivery is the World Starts with Me WSWM computerbased interactive sex education programme developed in for secondary school students aged in Uganda and implemented in over schools since Rijsdijk It aims to promote sexual and reproductive health by educating young people to make independent decisions about sexual practice The programme supports the efforts of Ugandan educators to inte grate ICTs into the school curriculum Evaluation of the WSWM programme involved quasiexperimental design including pre and posttest intervention and comparison groups and was conducted using schoolbased selfadministered questionnaire Outcomes varied based on the way the WSWM programme was implemented at each school but overall students from the intervention group who had considerable exposure to the programme completed at least the first out of lessons had better outcomes on several indicators including awareness of pregnancy pre vention methods intention to delay sexual intercourse and to use condoms and selfefficacy indealing with sexual violence Yet the evaluation also found that the limited number of available working computers sporadic lack of electricity and insufficient teacher training were major implementation problems faced by most of the schools In her ethnographic account of children in Western India Banaji urges research policy and practice to look behind the hitech fetish Only then too can one recognise how children use and value or not ICTs in practice for instance seeing that knowledge and skills in apps games scams jokes and memes constitutes one evident facet of media literacy Banaji OtherDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE qualitative studies tell similar story of creative reappropriations in the face of highpressure norma tive expectations from adults regarding children ICT use PathakShelat and DeShano explain how Indian families in rural areas and small towns experience clash of expectations between how digital media technologies are promoted and how they are experienced our emphasis Thus while families explicitly associate digital media with work educational opportunity andinformation this perception seems to come from the media and other external sources rather than directly from personal experiences with new media technologies because when they talked about their own practices playing games on computers and cell phones was the most frequent response This is not entirely matter of children preferences digital technologies are marketed as youth oriented technologies giving power to youth youth agency but we observed web of school and par ental controls surrounding their use Other studies critique the tendency to underestimate children capabilities to negotiate and navi gate digital environments For instance systematic formal educational initiatives to teach younger children about the complex risks and opportunities in digital environments in lowincome communities of the Global South are few and far between and significantly hampered by norms governing the discussion of sexuality pornography and other sexual content with children Further focusing on young people living in marginalised contexts in South America Europe and Australia Snyder andPrinsloo argue that subtle cultural disjunctures between school home and community often mean that knowledge and experiences about ICTs health or sexuality gained in one site donot transfer or are not recognised and valued in another Yet Cook et al challenge the wide spread tendency to infantilise children as incapable of understanding the risks involved their study showing that not only are some children aware of the risks but they deal with them on daily basis Conclusion ICTs are often intended and even assumed to act as an enabler or facilitator of equity and partici pation but often they do not Given the paucity of evidence about adolescents digital media uses between and among regions in LMICs international development policy informing programmes tar geting adolescent capability development need to be critical and cautious in how ICTs are harnessed to promote child rights While ICTD interventions have some limited successes eg ITU Sachs et al their engagement with issues pertaining to adolescent capability development and child rights is particularly wanting Our review suggests problematic divergence between what adult stakeholders expect children particularly those from lowincome areas to do with digital media andwith what they actually do as well as between development interventions assumptions about the potential and the realities of many children access to skills with and interest in ICTrelated interven tions Too often interventions have tended to focus on the supply side while ignoring dynamics thatstructure demand and use and therefore condition practices they thereby risk perpetuating hierar chies of gender and agerelated power In this article we have tried to highlight promising studies of interventions respecting the good intentions of many of those working to improve children lives through the use of ICTs However few if any cases show evidence of longlasting social change even though it is crucial that development interventions are sustained beyond the rudimentary achievement of programme objectives in order tolearn the significance of ICTs for adolescents capability development especially their potential to con tribute towards social justice by expanding the equity participation and agency of young people indetermining their futures Most worryingly some fear that through the fascination with ICTs the global corporate players through new gadgets schemes and advertisement as well as the government through rhetoric and development schemes are raising normative expectations to be part of global markets that are impossible to meet in their rural location with infrastructural limitations PathakShelat and DeShano emphasis added BANAJI ET ALIn one study to yearold students in urban Brazil concluded that they had grown up under the inuence of the Internet and under the logic of cultural consumption associated with it Ferraretto et al This logic was barely addressed in the literature reviewed and yet ICTs are usually proprie tary leaving programme providers dependent on the terms of service of the ICT provider cost data security user privacy commercial exploitation of data etc Further ICTs are regulated by statebodies either directly or through corporate franchises and quite often in restrictive manner involving censorship and can be used as tools for surveillance Chattopadhyay It is therefore important to ask critical questions in the face of growing enthusiasm for the use of ICTs within program matic interventions in LMICs Banaji Kleine Hollow and Poveda We have shown how maximising the positive potential of ICTs requires grounded understanding of how technology interacts with social political and economic factors important for developmentBanaji World Bank While this conclusion is already established in the field of ICTD it seems that each generation of researchers policymakers and practitioners must rediscover suchfindings if they and we are to sustain critical lens on the muchhyped and yet reasonably hopedfor prospects for new forms of online learning and information for the exposure or protection of children from online risks and in relation to children rights to participate in community leisure civic and political realms Livingstone and Bulger Such efforts must include attention to the lifeworld and its preexisting inequalities also to find participatory strategies to recognise the particular meanings and practices that shape the lives and concerns of the children who are after all the intended beneficiaries Given the continued innovation and adoption of ICTs and digital mediaacross LMICs it is no longer possible to conceive of development without ICTs At the same time the role of ICTs needs to be critically assessed rather than assumed and evaluated alongside the nondigital development opportunities relevant to children and their life contexts Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE

['Introduction Ethiopia has undergone rapid transformation over the past two years Soon after being appointed in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed an ethnic Oromo effectively dissolved the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front the party that had wielded absolute power since promising restoration of political freedoms and peace with neighbouring Eritrea that was recognised with Nobel Peace Prize Gardner Nobel Prize That same year saw the appointment of Ethiopias first female president SahleWork Zewde and cabinet in which half the positions are held by women This new era has seen improvements in peoples rights to voice and association but has also been accompanied by increased insecurity and violence which first erupted in and then spread throughout the country leaving hundreds of people dead and millions displaced Human Rights Watch This policy note synthesises findings from the Gender and Adolescence Global Evidence GAGE programmes round data collection to explore changes in Ethiopian adolescents access to voice and agency in the midst of the countrys dramatic political transformation It uses mixedmethods research that includes survey with adolescents and their caregivers and qualitative interviews with adolescents parents and service providers Respondents were from three diverse rural regions South Gondar Amhara East Hararghe Oromia and Zone Afar as well as three very different urban areas Debre Tabor in Amhara Batu in Oromia and Dire Dawa City Administration We pay careful attention to gender and regional differences in how young people between the ages of and are accessing decisionmaking opportunities within the family and community We also explore changes in adolescents mobility and access to safe space and social interactions with peers their access to ageappropriate information and digital Children are future leaders of the country Ethiopian adolescents access to voice and agencyPolicy Brief October Authors Elizabeth PreslerMarshal Nicola Jones Rebecca Dutton Sarah Baird and Workneh Yadete Suggested citation PreslerMarshal EJones Dutton Baird and Workneh Children are future leaders of the country Ethiopian adolescents access to voice and agency Policy Brief London Gender and Adolescence Global EvidenceSecondary school girls club in Amhara region Ethiopia Nathalie BertramsGAGE technology and to inspirational role models We then discuss key actions needed to accelerate progress especially for girls if Sustainable Development Goal SDG womens full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels is to be achieved United Nations Key findings The broader changes unfolding across Ethiopia are reflected in myriad ways in adolescents lives Since our baseline research in adolescents have become more comfortable speaking up for what they need more involved in their communities have more say over when they leave the house and where they go enjoy better access to information and are more likely to have role model who inspires them Changes have not however accrued uniformly to all groups of adolescents Voice and decisionmaking in the household and community There has been substantial change over the past two years in adolescents ability to contribute to the decisions that shape their own lives their households and their communities although the patterning is complex As expected given that they are now two years older considerably more younger adolescents aged years reported feeling comfortable expressing their opinions to adults at midline than at baseline As also expected girls were less comfortable voicing their opinions than boys and especially in the case of older adolescents years where the gender divide was greater for girls compared to for boys This difference in the survey was however more muted than in the qualitative findings Our qualitative research suggests that this relative parity between girls and boys reflects girls lower expectations rather than their actual input to decisions with fathers admitting that they have very limited communication with their daughters and girls explaining that even their mothers have limited say What can talk about with my daughter There is nothing talk about with her exclaimed father from Debre Tabor Some mothers exercise their rights The power goes to fathers mostly explained married yearold girl from East Hararghe Our findings further highlight that girls have very little say in the decisions that shape their lives including whether and when to marry see Box cannot refuse If refuse the man who is going to marry me he would constitute given permission to take me by force emphasised yearold married girl from Zone Afar Our survey found that differences in adolescents voice by location were more notable than gender and age differences with those living in rural Amhara and urban areas far more comfortable with speaking up to adults than those living in rural Oromia approximately onehalf versus onethird This same patterning is reflected in an index capturing adolescents perceived input into household decision making which was higher in rural Amhara than in any other location especially compared to East Hararghe Our qualitative work suggests that differences are shaped by both cultural norms and access to services In Box can take care of myself Marta is yearold girl married at age and now divorced living in rural South Gondar She is exceptional not because of the age at which she was married but because of her determination to make her voice heard against formidable family and community pressures Marta was unable to refuse her marriage which was arranged by her grandfather because he wanted to see the family line continue But she drew the line at being made to leave school by her husband who was nearly years older and still studying himself said to him What am going to do if you finish your school and become government worker and leave me Am going to end up being farmer and take care of your babies Indeed having heard that girls can get pregnant even before menarche as soon as she was forced to become sexually active she went to the local health extension worker and demanded contraceptive implant asked her for the implant that lasts for three years didnt want to give birth before become mature and know myself better and become selfsufficient she explained Determined to escape her marriage and illiteracy and to realise her aspiration of going to university Marta stole grain from her inlaws and sold it to finance her escape When she was caught by cousin she fought back was beaten and forced to go back but refused told them that would commit suicide Although her father and her inlaws tried to intimidate her into returning to her husband Marta persisted She was allowed to divorce and was preparing before the disruptions brought by covid to start secondary school cannot refuse If refuse the man who is going to marry me he would be given permission to take me by force yearold married girl from Zone AfarMarried girls ha ve le ss access to friends information and technology than their unmarried peers have trust ed friendhave phonelisten to radioread the newspaperMarried girls ar less lik ely to East Hararghe whereas initial explanations surrounding school dropout and child marriage emphasised adolescents voice and adults inability to exercise control broader narratives highlighted how adolescent choices are shaped by adults demands She has quit on her own She doesnt want to go to school explained yearold inschool boy of his sister But there must be somebody to prepare foods and do all these tasks so that our mother orders her to do those tasks This view was reinforced by key informants As community leader in East Hararghe noted When boys and girls reach the age of adolescence conflict arises between the mother and such children Once mothers initiated the girls for marriage girls will go with someone for marriage In South Gondar where school enrolment rates are higher of younger adolescents enrolled compared to in East Hararghe and in Zone and schools are more likely to have active clubs on topics including gender and civic participation young people are more regularly exposed to messages about their rights including their rights to an education and to remain unmarried They teach us about discipline our rights and responsibilities and so on observed yearold girl who is member of her schools civics club take part in school clubs It is to get better knowledge added yearold girl who explained that she had drawn on this awareness to refuse marriage arranged by her parents In Zone Afar pastoralist realities shape dayto day adolescent decisionmaking Young people reported that they largely did as their parents told them because livestock need herding but that they have final control over the animals gifted to them by their parents If want to give them livestock can give them can also refuse to give them goat When refuse my family accepts my word noted yearold girl There have been increasing opportunities in recent years for adolescents to participate in their communities In our midline research this was most evident in East Hararghe where the regional youth movement known as qeerroo helped usher Abiy to power calling for redress of Oromo political and socioeconomic marginalisation While there is considerable debate about the role and nature of the qeerroo movement Jalata in our research sites our findings revealed qeerroos taking on some positive roles For example qeerroos were working beside government officials to provide for internally displaced persons and locating truant children and returning them to the classroom In addition in communities where it has been banned they were also involved in hoard fines from the parents of adolescents caught participating in traditional shegoye dances some areas have banned shegoye given its negative consequences for participants school attendance and performance The chairperson of the qeerroo in our kebele has connections and communications with kebele administrators explained an yearold boy participant Qeerroos work dayin and dayout and bring children to school Qeerroo enable us to solve the serious problems that we have emphasised father from remote community The index measures adolescents perception of having say about household issues such as how much time they spent helping around the house how much education they will get when and who they will marry who their friends are what they do in their free time when they can leave the house and their involvement in incomegenerating activities with higher scores indicating more perceived input into household decision makingGraphics made for GAGE by Ottavia PastaAlthough adolescents actions and voices are increasingly visible in and respected by communities in East Hararghe girls remain comparatively shut out by gender norms that position them as subservient yearold girl who is member of female qeerroo group now led by young man noted that when he asked her to take over the groups leadership she declined because she knew the community would never listen to her refused believing that this village will not accept my leadership In South Gondar Amhara and Zone Afar adolescents engagement in the community tends to be less formal and relatively rare In Zone yearold divorced girl added that her generation is completely ignored by local leaders Children are future leaders of the country but no one seems to think that way No one is concerned about the development of the area Even in our high school no one contacted us about what we need and what we are doing yearold boy from South Gondar noted that he and his friends had recently come together to fight desertification and climate change after hearing about the issue on the radio We got the information from the radio we planted number of trees Mobility access to safe spaces and peers Adolescents ability to control their movements outside of the home to access safe spaces and spend time with friends is also highly variable Overall and to be expected given that they are now two years older than at baseline adolescents mobility is improving Our midline survey found that of young people had left their kebele community at least once in the past three months and that fewer had had to seek permission to do so dont ask them and dont want their permission to go everywhere explained yearold boy from Zone Afar who noted that where he goes depends more on his livestock than his parent In line with the broader evidence base however this was far less true for girls Over half of boys but less than quarter of girls reported having recently left their communities Indeed girls were quite likely to report even greater restrictions on their mobility over time due to parents concerns about girls reputations and how they reflect family honour Our mothers do not let us get out of home once we are becoming older observed yearold girl from East Hararghe The boys are set free added girl of the same age from South Gondar Regional differences were also marked Adolescents from Zone Afar were least likely to have left their communities largely because they live in remote areas but also due to clan and interethnic violence that has made travel risky Those from East Hararghe were most likely to have travelled out of their kebele due to girls need to fetch water from distant water holes and adolescents greater engagement with the cash economy and markets There is no limit and can go to market based on need observed yearold girl from remote community in East Hararghe Box Marriage multiplies girls disadvantage across all domains Our survey found that married girls have significantly less access to mobility friends and information and communications technology ICT than their unmarried peers Compared to their unmarried peers older married girls years are less likely to have trusted friend versus have phone versus or listen to the radio versus Our qualitative work found that the limits on married girls worlds are shaped by social norms around the intrahousehold gender division of labour and husbands control of his wife Married girls across the regions in our study emphasised that they simply did not have time to engage with the world beyond their home We spend most of our time searching for firewood fetching water and working on the farm so we dont get time explained yearold married girl from East Hararghe It is those unmarried girls who attend school that have happiness Married girls have lot of household responsibilities and worries about their household added yearold married girl from South Gondar More important girls agreed was that husbands exert almost total control over their young wives lives say that have to wash clothes today have to fetch water or collect firewood These things know and decide on my own explained married yearold from South Gondar When asked whether she was allowed to have say in larger decisions she replied It is the man who knows Married girls added that while technology could help expand horizons even for those who are homebound it tends to be controlled by men Most of the time men sit and listen to the radio while chewing khat plant that acts as stimulant common in parts of Ethiopia together Females do not join them and listen to the radio never sit with them to listen to the radio reported married yearold girl from Zone Afar Children are future leaders of the country but no one seems to think that way Even in our high school no one contacted us about what we need and what we are doing yearold divorced girl in Zone AfarYounger adolescents were less likely to report having trusted friend at midline than at baseline compared to presumably because they are less likely to be enrolled in school and for some girls because they are more likely to be married see Box There were no differences between unmarried girls and boys However those living in urban areas or in East Hararghe were more likely to have confidant approximately than those living in South Gondar approximately and especially those living in pastoralist Zone Afar approximately The latter figure could be capturing the fact that due to more limited school enrolment in Afar adolescents are missing out on opportunities to forge relationships with school peers However our qualitative findings suggest that they have opportunities to build friendships with agemates many Afar adolescents are active participants in sadah cultural dance where boys and girls dance outside at night without parental supervision Adolescent boys also join faema tightly knit group of peers who support the elders in enforcing clan rules and sanctions and commonly reported on the close relationships that they enjoy with their faema Our qualitative work suggests that the violence unfolding across Ethiopia during midline data collection was often formidable barrier to friendship Younger adolescents years in South Gondar reported that gun violence and local deaths encouraged them to limit social interactions in East Hararghe their peers remained wary following the border conflict of late early that left hundreds of thousands displaced and in Afar as already mentioned clan and interethnic tensions have disrupted community mobility over the past two years Similarly older adolescents in urban areas specifically detailed how friendships had been disrupted by intercommunity violence In Dire Dawa in late our qualitative findings highlighted that students from different groups were unable to learn in mixed ethnic groups due to harassment and fighting and that some parents were forced to withdraw their children and move them to other schools For example yearold boy from Dire Dawa reported that he changed schools midyear to isolate myself from the daily violence that took place even inside classrooms yearold young woman with physical disability added that she can no longer use social media to communicate with her friends because her phone was stolen in melee at Debre Tabor University had mobile phone which is used to access Facebook but my phone was stolen during the conflict in this university was with my friends in the cafeteria and when the students commence throwing stones forgot my phone and left it on the table Access to ageappropriate information and digital technology Adolescents access to information and digital technology is also increasing as technology filters further into rural areas young people mature and the need to be aware of current events has taken on new urgency as political events unfold and violence spreads Although there are considerable differences by gender see Box residence location and age are the primary delimiters pattern established by our baseline research Among older adolescents of those living in urban areas and of those living in rural areas have read newspaper at least once in the past month Similarly of those in cities and only of those in rural areas have phone for their own use Among younger adolescents who are less likely to work and to be able to contribute to the purchase price figures for phone ownership are much lower and respectively Adolescents in our qualitative sample reported that improved access to digital technology is shaping not only their daily lives allowing them to communicate with friends and listen to music but also enabling them to invest in their futures used to download books explained yearold girl from Batu after noting that her phone had recently run out of charge Somewhat surprisingly given that they receive relatively little guidance from parents and educators adolescents quite often also saw the downsides Box The gender digital divide Across age groups and locations girls have significantly less access to information and digital technology than boys This is true of older forms of technology such as radio with of boys having listened at last once in the past month compared to only of girls It is also true of newer forms of technology with of boys but only of girls having mobile phone for their own use The gender gap is larger still in terms of phones with internet connectivity In urban areas of older boys have smartphone compared to of girls Our qualitative work highlights that gender norms prevent girls from using the digital technology that would allow them to access information First parents and then husbands are afraid that girls will use phones to illicitly communicate with boys and men In our area females do not have phones It is usually males who can have cell phone It is to prevent women from cheating with other men by calling through the phone explained yearold girl from Zone Afar Even in urban areas girls often reported that they must rely on word of mouth to learn what is going on around them collect information from people replied year old girl from Batu when asked how she learnt about current events In rural areas where girls mobility is more tightly restricted and their friends are just as likely to be deprived of information many girls have no exposure to political affairs Politics is like umm it is like umm dont know what it is confessed yearold girl from South Gondar of improved connectivity yearold girl from Dire Dawa admitted that while her phone helps her study it also facilitates timewasting There is chance of anything to be good or bad But our brain tends to balance towards the negative Even myself do not use it properly could download books and read but that is not what do In an attempt to capture the dynamic changes unfolding across Ethiopia our midline tools included new modules to explore adolescents political knowledge and beliefs These tools highlighted that while some young people primarily boys from rural East Hararghe and South Gondar are embracing active citizenship others are almost completely disenfranchised In East Hararghe of older adolescents reported that politics were very important to them Our qualitative findings underscored that the ascension of Prime Minister Abiy has been personally salient for many young people in these communities However his administration is increasingly seen as grave disappointment given perception of limited gains for Oromo communities coupled with increased ethnic violence and insecurity Moreover there have been campaigns by political activists to resist the Prime Ministers efforts to promote panethnic unity Nearly as many young people in South Gondar agreed that politics is very important There is now freedom of expression and transparency This is since the government changed and Dr Abiy came to power observed an yearold boy By contrast in Zone Afar of adolescents reported that politics were completely irrelevant to their lives and in the qualitative findings only one adolescent was able to name the Prime Minister when asked Urban adolescents despite their increased access to information were far less likely to report that politics were very important to them than rural adolescents Only of boys and of girls answered in the affirmative versus of boys and of girls in rural areas Our qualitative work found that for that minority social media serves as venue through which young people can discreetly engage in political movements Facebook users inform us about the political situation in the town person who uses Facebook can get access to new information like the violence that occurs in town explained yearold boy from South Gondar Similarly yearold adolescent boy from Dire Dawa noted have two Facebook pages use one of them to communicate with friends and to download videos However use the second one to upload secret political messages and to share videos of ethnic violence within our community The majority of urban adolescents reported either that they followed politics but do not really care of boys and of girls or that politics were completely irrelevant of boys and of girls Our qualitative work strongly suggests that urban adolescents apparent apathy is an attempt to disguise fear dont need to talk about politics only want peace and stability What matters is not the one who leads it must be about peace and stability explained yearold boy from Batu after noting that gangs had led to recent chaos in the city yearold girl from Debre Tabor agreed observing that university students have been fleeing to avoid violence It wasnt that much of problem in the past but now it is big problem These days university students are withdrawing because of the security issues and conflicts Role models In part driven by the changing world around them young adolescents were far more likely to report having role model at midline than at baseline versus Improvements were more marked among boys of whom reported an inspirational role model compared to only of girls and among those living in South Gondar where had role model compared to in East Hararghe and in Zone There is no one that consider as role model reported yearold girl from remote community in South Gondar Gender and regional divides were also apparent in the type of characteristics adolescents valued about their chosen role model Girls and boys alike admired those who were smart and successful though those from South Gondar tended to emphasise educational success and those from East Hararghe financial success My sister finished her education and started job she brings blankets for my father He blessed her so much when she gave him her gift When see her status started to focus on my education to be like her explained yearold boy from South Gondar when asked why he wanted to be like his sister Boys however and especially those from Zone Afar admired those whom they saw as strong while girls were attracted to those with good personality The individuals that girls and boys chose as role models spoke volumes about girls relative disadvantage While of boys who had role model said that that role model was from outside the home this was the case for only of girls Furthermore while boys were likely to choose someone famous of those with role models outside of the home or male friend or relative girls were far more likely to choose male relative than female friend and were very unlikely to choose someone famous This was also captured in our qualitative work Facebook users inform us about the political situation in the town yearold boy from South Gondarwhere boys singled out political leaders for emulation while girls did not want to be like Jawar an influential political activist because he is analyst of the entire world want to achieve like that goal stated younger boy from East Hararghe want to be like PM Abiy Ahmed add another from the same region Although Ethiopias president is woman no girl in either the quantitative or qualitative data spontaneously mentioned her as role model and few admitted to knowing about her even when pressed We heard her name stated yearold girl from East Hararghe Girls instead tended to mention uncles and older brothers and male cousins as having inspired them along particular path saw some who went to Addis Ababa University My cousins were also educated When saw them learning said would not be fool reported yearold divorced girl from Zone Afar now finishing secondary school after being married against her will at age Indeed even in South Gondar where there are more girls who could serve as role models girls remain likely to choose man on whom to pattern their aspirations He treats us well and he is polite and doesnt mistreat us explained yearold girl from South Gondar when asked why she chose her male English teacher as her role model famous man male elativ male elativ female friendGirls are less lik ely than boysto have role models and most often look up to men rather than women Who do adolesc ents look up to BOYS GIRLS saw some who went to Addis Ababa University My cousins were also educated When saw them learning said would not be fool yearold divorced girl from Zone Afar Graphics made for GAGE by Ottavia PastaThis

progress In order to capitalise on the opportunities opening up to adolescents in this time of rapid political and social change and yet also to keep them safe it is vital to balance young peoples growing pauperism for independence and connection with their need for protection In the case of adolescent girls given their marked disadvantages as highlighted by our findings across the domains of voice agency and mobility it is especially important to invest in addressing the barriers they face at household and community levels to set the foundations for the realisation of SDG ambitious vision of equal participation of women in the political arena Our research suggests the need for five broad actions to increase adolescents access to voice and agency and facilitate their maturation into empowered adults who can make decisions about their own lives and contribute meaningfully to their communities and country Invest in adolescent clubs and safe spaces that provide young people with opportunities to foster their own voices in childfriendly venues that over time segue into scaffolded community interactions Provide adolescents with school and community based opportunities to spend time with peers and with adults who can mentor them through the transition from childhood to adulthood Clubs including municipal youth centres should promote programming that endeavours to foster confidence and voice supports boys to become champions of gender equality and helps young people find meaningful and age appropriate ways to contribute to their communities Provide parents with parenting education courses that help caregivers balance adolescents needs for protection and participation Support parents to help them understand the importance of allowing adolescents to make ageappropriate decisions about their own lives and contribute to household decision making Focused attention should be paid to gender norms and the myriad ways they disempower girls and women Recognise that married girls are the most silenced and step up crosscommunity efforts to eliminate child marriage and support married girls agency Work with community leaders parents and adolescents to help them understand the advantages of adult marriage especially visvis investments in education and to cancel adolescentplanned marriages as well as sanctioning adults who facilitate these unions Simultaneously provide programming for young married couples aimed at fostering more egalitarian forms of communication and addressing gender inequities Foster an engaged citizenry by ensuring that civics education fosters democratic and peaceoriented beliefs and behaviours and counters misinformation Whether delivered by school curriculum andor in grassroots venues civics education for young people needs to focus on encouraging democratic and peace oriented beliefs and behaviours including in the home school and community It is also vital to teach young people how to critically consume information and detect misinformation Inspire girls by creating campaigns aimed at providing them with female role models These should include regional and nationallevel role models publicised on posters and billboards and in the school curriculum given girls limited access to other sources of information There should also be concerted efforts at the local level to highlight successful girls and women including to girls families and communities References Gardner Will Abiy Ahmeds bet on Ethiopias polit ical future pay off FP January https foreignpolicy comwillabiyahmedeprdfbetethiopia

focus on western and developed countries Where countrylevel pre valence data or largescale research exists rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and nonwestern countries than their western and developed counterpartsObjective We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their ectiveness Methods Following PRISMA guidelines we conducted systematic search of six databases and identied eight studies to include in our analysis Results Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on pre school and primary schoolaged children Most have focused on interventions delivered in edu cational settings with lack of focus on populationlevel interventions to prevent child sexual abuse Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self protection and helpseeking not deployment of those skills actual reduction in prevalence ofCSA or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contextsConclusions If the focus on schoolbased strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries signi cant gap in knowledge of the ecacy of populationlevel inter ventions outside of school contexts and consistency across the application of interventions willremain Evaluations are needed that address the cacy of broader governmentled or wholeof community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse or thatcan link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization Introduction Child sexual abuse CSA is global social problem with growing research and media attention Many researchers in developed countries have investigated prevalence rates Mathews et al risk and protective factors Kaufman et al and prevention strategies Morley Higgins to mitigate the occurrence of CSA particularly within the context of youthserving organizations Concern regarding the signi cant issue of CSA has begun to be echoed by research in developing and nonwestern lowtomiddle income countries in recent years Abeid Muganyizi Massawe Mpembeni Darj et al AlSaif et al Plummer Njuguna Veenema Thornton Corley Although some authors refer to lowtomiddle income countries we use the term August Received in revised form January Accepted January Corresponding author Email address RussellChild Abuse Neglect Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Tdeveloping countries based on the nomenclature set out in the UN country classi cation United Nations The World Health Organization WHO de ned CSA as the involvement of child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend is unable to give informed consent to or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent or that violates the laws or social taboos of society Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in relationship of responsibility trust or power the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person World Health Organisation It is also widely accepted that the de nition of sexual abuse includes both contact and noncontact forms of abuse Kloppen Haugland Svedin Maehle Breivik Mathews CollinVezina Numerous systematic reviews exist of research on topics related to CSA such as prevalence rates Barth Bermetz Heim Trelle Tonia Pereda Guilera Forns GomezBenito Stoltenborgh BakermansKranenburg Alink van Ijzendoorn risk factors Putnam Whitaker et al and the ectiveness of di erent prevention strategies Letourneau Schae er Bradshaw Feder Walsh Zwi Woolfenden Shlonsky These reviews however have largely focused on research conducted in developed countries Therefore our aim here is to focus on what research evidence is available about CSA preventioneorts in developing countries and identify implications for improving prevention orts globally Many developing countries have begun implementing laws with local and international nongovernment organizations supporting the prevention of CSA In recent years developing countries have broadly adopted policies and laws that directly and formally address violence against children including sexual abuse United Nations This has been achieved through national plans of action on children the inclusion of children protection from sexual violence in broad child protection initiatives and the devel opment of speci national agendas on violence against children United Nations In recent years more than countries have adopted di erent types of action plans for children United Nations However there are varying degrees of comprehensiveness with approximately of countries surveyed by the UN not fully adopting laws to protect children against all form of violence Since Angola Bolivia the Dominican Republic Ecuador Kenya Montenegro Serbia and South Sudan have adopted or amended their constitutions to include prohibition on violence against children United Nations Regarding sexual violence the United Nations noted that signi cant progress has been made in recent years on legislation against sexual abuse and exploitation of children Of the member states of the United Nations that responded to the UNs Global Survey highlighted that prohibition on sexual exploitation of children including prostitution is in place These initiatives are promising considering the high prevalence rates of CSA in developing countries However holisticapproach to understanding the right policy mix for CSA is warranted This systematic literature review of CSA in developing countries is the rst step toward more researchinformed and targeted policy development ects of child sexual abuse The eects of CSA have been found to be both immediate and long term In childhood researchers have identi ed eects including cognitive impacts Barrera Calderon Bell mental health including depression anxiety Olafson Wurtele and posttraumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation Cashmore Shackel Fergusson Boden Horwood Longterm ects into adulthood include mental ill health Amado Arce Herraiz Fergusson et al Lindert et al as well as detrimental impact on individuals adult roles such as employment parenting education and relationships de Jong Alink Bijleveld Finkenauer Hendriks Despite the risk of child sexual abuse being lower for males than females although not necessarily in institutions see Quadara Nagy Higgins Siegel the ects of CSA on men have been widely researched One reason for this apart from the need to understand the lifelong ects of abuse for male survivors is fears of cycle of abuse based on the fact that the majority of adult child sexual enders and adolescents with harmful or concerning sexual behaviors are male Plummer Cossins These issues may be of more concern in developing countries that have patriarchal societal norms CSA has vicarious ects on families and communities Blakemore Herbert Arney Parkinson which could be ex acerbated in societies that emphasize the needs of group members and place importance on interconnectedness between societal members over individual priorities due to the value placed on community engagement Such lifelong ects for male and female victims coupled with concerning prevalence rates globally indicates the need to have ective interventions policies or strategies targeted at the prevention of child sexual abuse for both boys and girls in developed and developing countries Prevalence Few countries have good prevalence data Mathews et al Where prevalence data do exist they are usually expressed as range given the disparate de nitions methodologies and data reporting mechanisms employed in studies Many researchers as well as international development organizations also suggest that CSA rates are consistently underestimated due to the inherent chal lenges of disclosure and reporting Kloppen et al Radford Corral Bradley Fisher Recent metaanalyses have estimated global rates of CSA to be between for boys and for girls Pereda et al Stoltenborgh et al Where data are available strong contrast exists between developed and developing countries in terms of prevalence data Studies from developed countries show lower prevalence rates for boys and higher for girls compared to developing countries ForD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect example prevalence in Scandinavia is reported to be between and for boys and between and for girls Kloppen et al in Japan for boys and for girls for nonpenetrative CSA Tanaka Suzuki Aoyama Takaoka MacMillan and in the United States for boys and for girls Finkelhor Shattuck Turner Hamby This considerable international variability may be explained at least in part by gender di erences in prevalence of CSA in the two key contexts in which it occurs organizational vs familial abuse As Quadara et al noted Child sexual abuse occurring within institutional settings including residential care education sporting or religious organi zations generally see higher rates of boys being victims of abuse than girls however girls are victims of teacherstudent sexual abuse at higher rate than boys Knoll Moulden Firestone Kingston Wexler Sullivan Beech Generally sexual abuse committed by educators occurs at similar rate globally In recognition of the negative ects of segregated institutional care and the bene ts of familybased care progressive de institutionalization of many care environments in western countries has occurred such as homebased services to replace psychiatric institutions and segregated homes for children and adults with disability and mental illness eg see Torrey and the de velopment of foster care and kinship care in the child protection system to replace children orphanages Innocenti Research Centre Given such institutional care for children has been associated with high levels of neglectful and abusive behaviour including child sexual abuse this might then lead to di erent gender mix in overall prevalence of CSA in developed compared to developing countries Based on the limited research that does exist prevalence rates in developing countries paint poorer picture than is the case for developedwestern countries For example Croatia has an overall prevalence of Ajdukovi ac Rajter Rates are even higher for countries in Asia Africa and South America with rates of in Saudi Arabia AlEissa et al between Zolotor et al and Kacker Varadan Kumar in India in Colombia in Russia Zolotor et al and for boys and for girls in Tanzania Abeid Muganyizi Mpembeni Darj Axemo In some cases these rates may be comparable to data from developed countries however data from developing countries are often not able to be disaggregated by gender In other cases there is distinct and concerningly higher rates in many developing and nonwestern lowto middle income countries which has led to investigations of not only shared risk factors globally but also speci cultural and contextual risk factors in these localities Risk factors Although much of the research on risk factors has occurred in developed western countries similar factors have been identi ed across range of developing countries including Indonesia Pakistan and many African countries Ali Ali Khuwaja Nanji Bridgewater Meinck Cluver Boyes Mhlongo Rumble et al In addition to the general risk factors associated with CSA see Kaufman et al Putnam developing countries face speci risk factors due to their context These contextual di erences are associated with the strong communitycentric thinking of many societies in developing countries Meinck Cluver Boyes LoeningVoysey Plummer Njuguna and the economic situations faced by individuals families and communities World Health Organization Research suggests these contextual risk factors play more signi cant role in the risk of CSA occurring than the individual or familylevel factors prominent in both developed and developing countries Plummer Njuguna These contextual risks include the patriarchal nature within communities Whitehead Ro ee stereotyped and discriminatory gender norms Bridgewater and the perceived role of children within tribal communities Plummer Njuguna Exacerbation of risk factors as result of the absence of governance processes the absence of screening mechanisms to identify those who have already ended against children and poor adultchild supervision ratios Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse provide additional credence to the higher prevalence rates in developing countries Prevention recent shift in how to address the issue of child sexual abuse has seen an increase in the desire to prevent abuse before it occurs rather than focus on better responses once CSA has already occurred in order to reduce the likelihood of harm and ongoing trauma Letourneau et al Levine Dandamudi This shift has required an investigation into how those outside of law en forcement responsible for responding after CSA has occurred can play role in preventing abuse from occurring in the rst place CSA has been widely cited as public health problem Letourneau Brown Fang Hassan Mercy Mathews Numerous researchers have suggested that populationlevel prevention initiatives ie public health approach are the best way toprevent CSA including researchers from both Englishspeaking western countries Letourneau Eaton Bass Berlin Moore McMahon Puett and developing countries Skeen Tomlinson Veenema et al Public health approaches recognize that prevention occurs at three levels Primary before it occurs secondary when risks are evident and tertiary after harm has occurred to ameliorate its impact and prevent future harm Quadara et al Due to the community and macrolevel approaches utilised in public health approach models it is often led at the governmental or national level Herrenkohl Lonne Scott Higgins However WHO noted that no national plans to prevent CSA existed across South East Asian countries raising questions as to whether any populationlevel initiatives were being applied in developing countries The target of primary CSA prevention activity can range from individuals through to wholeof community interventions Interventions such as delivery of CSA prevention education or protective behaviors programs Quadara et al are focused onD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect the individual knowledge and skill of children and young people to understand their bodies their right to safety and how to seek help if confronted with concerning or abusive behaviour at the earliest possible opportunity On the other hand communitylevel pre vention initiatives such as parenteducation strategies are typically largescale governmentled initiatives reaching much larger audiences To complement the focus on the knowledge attitudes and skills of individuals more recently there has been stronger focus on situational and cultural risk factors in youthserving organizations and other community settings Kaufman Erooga Higgins Zatkin Morley Higgins Prevention initiatives need to be comprehensive considering not only the broad range of risk factors but also the potential sources of protective strategies Although there is good evidence for the ectiveness of prevention strategies to address other forms of familial child maltreatment such as homevisiting during the prenatalinfancy period seeHolzer Higgins Brom eld Richardson Higgins there is no available evidence to show that such generic family support initiatives are ective at preventing CSA Prevention initiatives also need to be targeted to the unique risks for CSA As well as strategies to increase skills awareness and obligations of individual childrenyoung people and their parentscaregivers safety concerns also need to be ad dressed at macrosocietal level These strategies should be focused on equipping large numbers of young people with skills to resist thus increasing the ort required of enders to engage in ending behavior training adult workers who work in youth serving organizations to better understand the risk factors and signs and how to implement situational risk mitigation to addressprevent or interrupt grooming behaviour and increasing obligations surrounding reporting of child sexual abuse and those who engage in potentially grooming behavior eg see Pagesexpolitationgroomingaspx Systematic reviews of prevention methods in western and developed countries such as that by Walsh et al have con tinued to support the development of programs and strategies to prevent child sexual abuse within these countries Training programssuch as the Child Abuse School Liaison program Hanson et al and the Enough Preventing Child Sexual Abuse in My School online training program Gushwa Bernier Robinson have shown positive results in improving knowledge and skills related to preventing child sexual abuse Whether such improvements in knowledge lead to reduction in actual occurrence of child sexual abuse is debated in the literature Walsh et al With the identi cation of speci contextual risk factors in developing countries some researchers have begun looking at the ectiveness of prevention methods at the individual country level in developing and nonwestern countries We are not aware of any existing review of evaluations of CSA prevention strategies being applied in de veloping countries However knowledge of what prevention strategies are available and their ectiveness in preventing CSA is needed to support the work of researchers practitioners and policy makers wanting to improve the safety and wellbeing of childrenand young people globally Many western countries have had formal inquiries and government reviews and in response many prevention activities have been implemented through regulation by government as well as voluntarily by organizations and the nature of youthserving organizations having changed radically through major process of deinstitutionalization of disability and child welfare services Innocenti Research Centre Torrey It is important now to see what the application of these lessons might be for developing countries where there may not have been governmentled review of system failures and where greater proportion of the population of children are spending time in institutional care of the kind subject to these inquiries Our aim is to systematically review the available evidence on the ectiveness of CSA prevention strategies in developing countries The research question that guided the analysis is What type of sexual abuse prevention interventions or initiatives are being implemented in developing countries and are they ective In conducting this review our aim is to better understand the types of prevention strategies that ectively support individuals organizations and communities in these countries We hope to highlight best practice knowledge gaps and implementation gaps where we may have good evidence of ectiveness but limited takeup of interventions in relation to prevention of CSA and to identify implications for how best to support the safety of children and young people in developing countries from sexual abuse Method To guide

the eight studies included in this review as well as considering the results of each study we focused on the methodology and design study characteristics including year and size of study sample population age gender etc and the country of research Data were extracted using an Excel spreadsheet based on the Cochrane Public Health Group Data Extraction and Assessment Template Using these data indirect comparisons where interventions used in separate studies are compared were made to identify what types of interventionsinitiativesstrategies are being used in developing countries to prevent CSA and howeective these interventions are when considering the outcomes measured in each individual study Findings Overview of studies Two studies were from Africa ve were from Asia and one from Latin America All the studies reviewed used quantitative methodology using quasiexperimental or experimental designs Three studies were largescale over participants whereas the remaining six were smallscale studies Only one study Citak Tunc et al made reference to any funding provided for the research which was provided by university scienti research projects management unit This is not to say the other research or indeed interventions weren provided funding but this was not explicitly stated within the research articles All but one study included both male and female participants Across the studies interventions were implemented by range of people includingteachers nurses trained facilitators and childrenyoung people themselves We now describe which groups of participants were the focus of attention within the studies the types of interventions and whether they were focused on evaluating cacy of those interventions Participants As can be seen in Table most research on interventions to support the prevention of child sexual abuse in developing countries has been focused on younger children either in primary school Dunn Fitriana Suryawati Zubaidah Hurtado Katz Ciro Guttfreund Nosike Neherta Machmud Damayanti Afrizal or preschool Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al One study focused on increasing the sexual abuse prevention knowledge of children living with disability Kucuk Platin Erdem One evaluated program that supported women and children at risk of sexual abuse Sinclair et al Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect Types of interventions Most of the interventions used within the studies included in this review focused on improving children knowledge of what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate touching and selfe cacy to act ie to speak up and seek help if hypothetically they were exposed to an abusive behaviour Many of these educational interventions included the use of story books and other devel opmentally appropriate materials One study focused on improving selfdefense capabilities in young people and three utilized one of two intervention programs developed overseas in western countries Within the literature included in this review there was evidence of only one investigation into the cacy of largescale governmentled intervention to prevent CSA in developing country Dunn Similarly there was little evidence of inter ventions that went beyond just increasing knowledge andor skills of children and young people regarding how to stay safe from potential abuse Such studies have been questioned in relation to whether they contribute to decrease in actual CSA victimization not just an increase in knowledge or skills Walsh et al What was evident through this review was the orts by researchers to use strong methodologies such as

These measures included the What if Situations Test Wurtele Hughes Owens the Personal Safety Questionnaire Wurtele Gillispie Currier Franklin Neglect and the Children Knowledge of Abuse QuestionnaireRevised Tutty Sinclair et al was the only study we identied that used incidence rates in both an intervention and control group to measure the reduction in sexual abuse as result of the intervention being tested while the remaining studies used their own outcome measure developed for the study with no re porting on reliability or validity of the measure Discussion The aim of this systematic review was to understand the state of primary prevention strategies being used and evaluated in developing countries We identify the nature of child sexual abuse prevention strategies and interventions in developing countries understand the typical settings and population groups in which intervention strategies are being used to investigate the ectiveness of the interventions used Nature of prevention policies and interventions In the few interventions outlined in the research papers included in this review most prevention work is targeted at the local level typically in education settings for children at preschool and primary school These interventions focused on improving chil drens understanding of their bodies appropriate and inappropriate touch and who they could reach out to if they have concerns about someone behavior Given the reach of school systems these interventions could be classi ed as being based on public health approach to primary prevention Herrenkohl et al Numerous researchers Letourneau et al Quadara et al have discussed the importance of utilizing public health approach to prevent child sexual abuse As it involves both policy setting andcommunitywide activities such as awareness raising and behavior change strategies public health strategies are typically led at the national or state government level Of the studies included in this review only one study was governmentled intervention Dunn Two studies Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al focused on an intervention the Body Safety Training Pro gram developed in the US in the mids and revised in and which has been tested for cacy when compared to control groups and other intervention options see Wurtele Saslawsky Miller Marrs Britcher Wurtele Kast MillerPerrin Kondrick Both studies discussed the translation of the program into the respective language of the participants Mandarin and Turkish using psychologists educators and other experts to support the translation of either the entire program or the key titles The use of western interventions in developing countries comes with advantages and disadvantages On the one hand these pro grams have often been evaluated in experimental trials and been found to enhance knowledge about sexual abuse and protective skills On the other hand it is yet to be investigated whether sexual abuse prevention programs developed and shown to be cacious in one cultural or social context can be as ective in di erent cultural or social context Considering the use of Body Safe Training Program westerndeveloped locallevel intervention in these two studies it is reasonable to consider that an expansion of interventions in developing countries could include westerndeveloped community andsocietallevel interventions Already there has been orts to introduce child maltreatment prevention strategies from western developed countries such as parent education and early home visiting however these were not identi ed through our literature search because they are broader in their goals and not designed to speci cally to prevent CSA and no data exist to demonstrate their ecacy at reducing the risk of CSA These kinds of societal and communitylevel interventions would most likely be based on governmentled prevention policies in developed countries but would have to take into consideration the cultural factors relevant to the context in which interventions were being implemented Typical settings and population groups Although the eight studies re ected variety of intervention types speci information was not always available Where it was schoolbased interventions or interventions delivered by teachers were the most common This trend has been previously noted within the wider literature Letourneau et al Evidence of the ectiveness of schoolbased interventions aimed at preventing CSAlargely in developed countries has been identi ed through recent systematic review Walsh et al However Walsh et al questioned whether children gains in knowledge and skills translates to an actual reduction in CSA This has implications for developing countries where not all baby are in school The outofschool rate in primary schoolaged children in lowincomecountries is relative to in their highincome counterparts the lower secondary outofschool rate is and respectively Of children not attending school globally approximately are from developing countries UNESCO Vul nerable groups such as poor girls are more likely to be out of school Mertaugh Jimenez Patrinos Thus there is agreement that public health model including populationlevel prevention strategies and situational prevention approach would be better placed to improve prevention of child sexual abuse across di erent settings Kaufman Erooga Higgins Zatkin Quadara However we did not identify any populationlevel interventions within the search parameters of this review With so fewD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect studies meeting the criteria we set concern regarding the ectiveness of programs to reduce the high rates of CSA in developing countries is warranted Most interventions in developing countries appear to focus on very young children The development and empirical in vestigation of interventions aimed at preschool aged children is warranted considering the research showing that children under the age of seven constitute signi cant proportion of CSA victims Finkelhor The intervention most used in developing countries for children this age identi ed in our review is the Body Safety Training program Wurtele et al evaluated by two of the papers Citak Tunc et al Zhang et al We were non able to uncover any peerreviewed evaluation work conducted by any NGO in this review Despite many interna tional aid and development agencies recognizing the importance of child protection in their work it was surprising to see no published evaluations of the cacy of such programs This could be because assessing outcomes as opposed to delivering in itiatives is not as highly valued the di culties in translating evaluation results for peerreview publication or the general challenges of outcome evaluation designs makes such an activity very di cult Intervention cacy in developing countries Overall the studies provided positive picture about the ectiveness of the interventions in increasing abuse prevention knowledge and when tested the selfe cacy of children and young people to take protective action should they encounter an unsafe situation All six studies that measured knowledge andor skills showed signi cant improvements in participants capabilities The evidence suggests that interventions that aim to improve young people knowledge andor skills regarding keeping themselves safe can be successful in that goal however researchers have not gone further to measure whether that increased knowledge andorskill in the longer term leads to decrease in sexual abuse victimization as result Such evidence would be di cult to obtain without strong existing country or regional prevalence data or at least incidence data for CSA reported to authorities against which tocompare Considering the average delay between abuse and disclosure of CSA is estimated to be in the order of years Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse this is signi cant barrier to comprehensive evaluation of current prevention orts The studies included in our review give evidence that range of individuals both professional and peers can support the improvement of sexual abuse prevention knowledge in young people As prevalence and incidence are notoriously di cult to measure in relation to child sexual abuse Mathews et al it is perhaps not surprising that only one study within the scope of this review used incidence rates to measure success Sinclair et al Incidentally in that study rates of sexual abuse dropped signi cantly as result of the intervention In the months following participation in the program sexual assault incidence rates showed statistically signi cant reduction within the intervention group of The control group saw no change in incidence rates across the same time Verbal defense skills were identi ed as the rst skill learned followed by physical selfdefense skills The authors attributed the decline in incidence for the intervention group to this They acknowledged that if CSA did occur the intervention group would also be more likely to disclose that assault had occurred noting that this opened the door to potential support and intervention Sinclair et al The results from developing countries con rm what has also been shown in developed countries that prevention strategies focused on knowledge can ectively increase the sexual safety knowledge and skills of young children However there is lack of evidence that supports the link between an increase in knowledge and decrease in incidence of CSA Walsh et al This lack of evidence is not because of lack of data to show no relationship but because of the absence of an agreed proxy outcome measure and the di culty in tracking actual incidence of CSA particularly in the absence of national prevalence or representative surveillance data on sexual abuse incidence in most countries The challenge of attributing direct outcomes to preventionoriented policies and interventions apply equally in developed and developing countries Mathews et al Seven of the eight studies focused on acquisition of knowledge andor skills as the primary outcome measure Only one evaluation Sinclair et al looked at the implementation of that knowledge the con dence and selfe cacy of participants to take action based on knowledgeskill or other emotional factors that might in uence implementation of the knowledge gained Few studies followedup with participants One study Dunn that measured knowledge gains conducted followup tests after six weeks The study that measured disclosures of child sexual abuse and rape Sinclair et al collected postintervention data after months Other than these followup procedures there were no followup studies that examined the retention of knowledge use of skills or changes in con dence over time State of knowledge of CSA primary prevention activities in developing countries The number of experimental or quasiexperimental designs is major strength of the approach being taken by researchers in developing countries to evaluate the ectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing CSA Most of the studies had random allo cation to intervention and control groups with some utilizing prepost evaluation design measuring the intended outcomes bothbefore and after intervention One of the key weaknesses of the research we identi ed is the lack of comparative analysis of two or more programs using the same implementation protocol and outcomes evaluation strategy Currently no data exist to suggest whatworks better All that can be said given the range of speci intervention programs is that prevention knowledge and skills canbe taught and achieve statistically signi cant increases in children knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts in developing country contexts as has been seen in western Englishspeaking research on schoolbased interventions second key weakness is the lack of outcome variables measured in research investigating CSA prevention strategies Most research regarding the cacy of interventions has focused on the increase of children prevention knowledge and skills Investigation into the conditions of safetyD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect that support situational crime prevention approach to preventing child sexual abuse could be gained by measuring additional variables such as children perceptions of safety within settings where abuse can potentially occur Moore McArthur Heerde Roche OLeary the safeguarding capabilities of sta and volunteers working with children and young people Russell Higgins or parent carer and family empowerment and awareness of CSA prevention being used in organizations and within the community Conclusion Safeguarding children from CSA has continued to receive increasing attention globally due to high incidence and prevalence rates While developed countries such as the US Australia and countries across Europe have years experience researching and de veloping interventions to prevent CSA developing countries have only seen empirical evaluation of the ectiveness of such in terventions in the past decade Although data are limited as developing countries appear to have higher prevalence of CSA compared to developed and western countries it is heartening to see that schoolbased prevention interventions can result in increased knowledge and skills for children in these countries Despite the importance assigned to safeguarding activities by international aid organizations however there is scant evidence in English language peerreview journals of rigorous quality evaluations of the policies and related intervention strategies they can or do employ when working in developing countries Although there are considerable orts internationally to prevent CSA that exist however they have not been subject to empirical evaluation and the ndings published in peerreview journals The sizeable gap between the prevention orts and the formal research evaluating their ectiveness suggests an area of focus for funding and further research orts to understand whether and how such prevention initiatives are or are not ective in their goal of preventing CSA in developing and nonwestern lowto middle income countries Considering the global scale and growing interest in addressing the problem of CSA it is disappointing to have not found more evidence of largescale governmentled initiatives to combat this abuse in developing countries Compared to developed nations fewevaluations of governmentled initiatives or institutional standard practices such as curriculum have been undertaken in developing countries It is given that individual nations hope to make di erence and reduce CSA but further work and the requisite funding is needed to apply rigorous public health approach with an evaluation component Most programs being evaluated in developing countries were isolated interventions or programs Although there are some limited local schoollevel programs in de veloping countries even in that context we did not nd reference to there being an overarching public health or systemlevel model behind the interventions on which teaching about prevention of sexual abuse can be based at wholeofpopulation level We foundno evaluation of national or regional initiative or of an integrated prevention framework in developing country There was relatively poor geographical coverage of evaluative research regarding CSA prevention with no international com parisons undertaken No evaluations were published from South America North Africa Paci ca or the Middle East Given our systematic search of multidisciplinary databases found so few eligible studies research into CSA prevention in developing countries and evaluation of interventions is global need For prevention strategies to ectively support individuals organizations and communities in developing countries more rigorous evaluations need to be conducted and reported so that the internationalcommunity can identify best practice for implementation Implications To support locallevel activities in developing countries aimed at reducing CSA the accessibility of primary prevention programs should be focus of governments and nongovernment organizations operating in developing countries who are funded directly by governments international aid agencies and overseas donors Countrywide policiesprograms are needed supported by partner ships with research experts to conduct evaluation research on their prevention ortswhether they be at community or societal levels As is the case in dealing with related areas of interpersonal violence such partnership activities between international agenciesand governments must also recognize and promote equality and the human rights of women and children which underpin many of the intervention activities CSAspeci prevention also needs to be situated within the context of child maltreatment prevention more broadly from public health perspective Herrenkohl et al By recognizing the crossover between CSA prevention and broader child maltreatment prevention as well as issues related to gender and patriarchal social norms prevention initiatives would be able to relate speci cally to the risk factors identi ed as being more relevant in the developing nations in which they are being implemented This review highlights the need for prevention programs that are broader and go beyond schoolbased sexual abuse prevention knowledge of children particularly given the higher outofschool rates in developing countries linked to framework for com prehensive CSA prevention and preferably an even broader child maltreatment prevention framework Considering the opportunities orded through technological solutions where these can be appropriately used research is needed to investigate the cacy of how these can be applied in developing countries with consideration to the limitations and risks that come with internet access in relation to CSA could support broader rollout of ective prevention interventions With the use of westernled interventions in developing countries to reduce CSA it is essential to consider cultural adaptation of such interventions based on solid examination of cultural beliefs that may be barriers or enablers of prevention orts As well as development of new culturally appropriate and speci CSA prevention strategies such adaptations would need to ensure con sideration of the perceived role of children and young people within the societies that interventions are being applied in as well asthe level of importance placed on community and societal cohesionD Russell et al Child Abuse Neglect The primary prevention programs that governments and nongovernment agencies begin utilizing should go beyond schoolbased protective behaviors programs measuring only the increase in knowledge and skills but rather be linked to broader framework for comprehensive prevention that includes improving conditions of safety for children such as addressing workforce capabilities and building engagement with parents and the broader community Those leading prevention orts should include within their pro grams research including qualitative methodologies to evaluate the ectiveness of prevention orts in speci contexts For example this could include programs delivered in contexts where children may not be attending school regularly and where other risks to their safety and wellbeing from poverty neglect child labor etc may intersect with their risk of CSA and the capacity of prevention initiatives to be ective

['Parenting in the Digital Age The Challenges of Parental Responsibility in Comparative Perspective Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrne Abstract As children in high middle and even lowincome countries gain access to the internet via range of digital devices and services most often via mobile phone parents are feeling challenged in their competence role and authority In response parents draw on their available resources socioeconomic and cultural and their preferred parenting styles as well as some of the principles of positive parenting In high income countries shift is underway from restrictive towards enabling forms of parental mediation In middle and lowincome countries the evidence suggests that restrictive mediation is generally favoured by parents although this brings costs in terms of childrens opportunities online especially for girls In all countries the rapid pace of technological innovation undermines parental competence this is in turn undermining childrens willingness to turn to parents for support We conclude with suggestions to support parents in meeting the growing challenge of empowering their children online in diverse contexts Keywords positive parenting parental mediation digital media Global South Global Kids Online crossnational comparisons Introduction Who is responsible for enabling childrens internet use and protecting them from risks Generally the first answer is parents especially when it comes to keeping children safe Parents are held responsible for teaching their children about values social norms and accepted behaviour They are also expected to enable their children to study help in the family keep healthy cross the road and make good judgements about people places and information In enacting these responsibilities parents we include here Livingstone Sonia Byrne Jasmina Parenting in the Digital Age The Challenges of Parental Responsibility in Com parative Perspective in Giovanna Mascheroni Cristina Ponte Ana Jorge eds Digital Parenting The Challenges for Families in the Digital Age Gteborg Nordicom Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrnestep parents grandparents and any other adults and older siblings taking on caring role have always been able to draw on their own life experience and the traditions and knowledge of their community But as children in high middle and even lowincome countries gain access to the internet parents are feeling challenged especially as their children use mobile devices that are difficult for parents to supervise and technologically complex services that parents may not understand They are also influenced by popular worries about screen time internet addiction stranger danger and so on So whatever is normatively expected of parents there are practical limits to what they can do No wonder that in whichever country has recently gained widespread internet access there is groundswell of con cern from parents as they struggle to enact their responsibilities and about parents as governments worry about the digital divide child protection and cybercrime on the one hand and on the other the digital skills of the future labour force Also under pressure are schools expected to teach the digital literacies needed for children to benefit from the expanding digital opportunities welfare and mental health services now expected to address problems children face in proprietary online services law enforcement dealing with networked crimes involving child victims at considerable scale and businesses striving to expand into digital markets but undermined by issues of consumer literacy and trust From the perspective of these organisations the more that parents can take on to prepare their children for the digital age the less the bur den on them Conversely the less able parents are to enable and protect their children the greater are the calls for appropriate education regulation public expenditure and corporate social responsibility Parenting offline and online how do they relate What kinds of parenting styles are likely to be effective in relation to the digital environ ment There is growing body of evidence especially from high and middleincome countries that demonstrates the importance of positive parenting for child development including early childhood physical cognitive and emotional development educational outcomes improved communication and trust reduction in risk taking behaviour among adolescents improved social competence of adolescents and reduction of violence Daly Knerr Gardner Cluver Moore Whitney Kinukawa What is often considered positive parenting includes stimulation and affection clear and focused praise supporting increasing autonomy encouraging healthy habits goal setting establishing firm rules and consequences De Stone However when children enter adolescents from around the age of there are also changes in parentchild relationships with adolescents seeking more autonomy and independence Patton et al and parenting styles must adapt In the World Health Organization WHO developed framework that ex amines key dimensions of parenting or parental roles that positively affect adolescent Parenting in the Digital Agewellbeing connection behaviour control respect for individuality modelling ap propriate behaviour and provision and protection WHO These parental roles can be easily applied to all situations and environments including to childrens digital world as follows Connection positive stable emotional bond between parents and adolescents is an important factor contributing to child and adolescent health and development In the digital world that means that child or an adolescent who feels connected with their parents is more likely to share their offline and online experiences without fearing their access will be blocked Our Global Kids Online study shows that where children say they have positive relationship with parents in general manifested through support and praise they are more likely to share with them when negative things happen online Georgiev et al Logar et al Behaviour control this includes supervising and monitoring adolescents ac tivities establishing behavioural rules and consequences for misbehaviour and conveying clear expectations for behaviour WHO When it comes to children and the digital technologies this could include rules astir time spent on the internet use of digital devices after bed time in childrens bedrooms during meal time as well as understanding what children do online how they set up their privacy controls with whom they share personal information etc South African parents surveyed through Global Kids Online on average exhibit the digital skills of to year olds making it relatively difficult for them to support and supervise their childrens online behaviour Phyfer et al The Bulgarian Kids Online survey shows that parental engagement in childrens online activities declines with childrens age with per cent of parents engaging with to year olds and only per cent with year olds and older Kanchev et al Respect for individuality this means allowing the adolescent to develop healthy sense of self apart from his or her parents This includes listening to what ado lescents have to say trusting them to complete their responsibilities or to take on new roles in the family In the digital domain this means allowing children and adolescents to explore the internet independently in much the same way we would allow them to explore the physical world The age and capacities of the child matter as younger children will clearly need more guidance than the older ones The Global Kids Online research shows that the to year old group finds it particularly difficult to know what information online is true and what is not Byrne et al Modelling appropriate behaviour children and adolescents identify with their parents absorb the values and norms established in the home and try to emulate parental behaviour If parents spend most of their free time online there is strong likelihood that the children will do too If parents share too much information Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrneonline will that affect how children share their own personal information or information about their friends Through development of their sense of agency children may depart from the established norm in the family and decide to take different approach to that of their parents We have seen examples of children disagreeing over sharenting or parental sharing of content and images of their children online BlumRoss Livingstone Provision and protection parents cannot meet all the needs of the growing adolescent Their role is also to seek the resources for their children that they cannot provide or to ensure that they have access to appropriate services When it comes to protection of children online parents still have an important role to play But so do peers teachers and other adults in childrens lives When asked who they turn to if they experience something hurtful online children would turn to peers first and then parents second as we show below Byrne et al To what extent these parenting roles will be fulfilled what parenting style will be adopted and what parenting practices will prevail will depend on many factors including parental education beliefs and culture as well as the individual and institutional support avail able to parents As we discuss in what follows this varies in different parts of the world In high income countries In the early days of internet access in Europe and North America many children be came confident and competent internet users before their parents and teachers This resulted in considerable generation gap parents underestimated their childrens use and the risk of harm they encountered online As consequence few parents supported their childrens internet use beyond the fact of providing access By the same token few children turned to their parents for support when they encountered problem on the internet culture rapidly developed in which to generalize many parents felt disempowered ignorant of their childrens experiences online susceptible to media panics about internet predators or pornography and therefore restrictive in managing their childrens internet access But the situation is now changing recent survey of European parents of children aged to in France Germany the Netherlands Spain Poland Italy Sweden and the UK found parents to be fairly concerned about their childrens online experi ences especially exposure to violent images and being bullied online but also about their children being exposed to data tracking digital identity theft and advertisements for unhealthy lifestyles Livingstone et al However analysis of what parents said they actually did to manage their childrens internet use revealed two styles of parental mediation Parenting in the Digital Age Restrictive mediation Parents restricting or banning or insisting on supervising any of long list of online activities Enabling mediation Parents undertaking active strategies such as talking to child about what they do online or encouraging their activities as well as giving safe advice also activities that might seem restrictive use of technical controls and parental monitoring but are better interpreted as building safe framework precisely so that positive uses of the internet can be encouraged In terms of outcomes more enabling mediation by parents was positively associated with childrens experience of online opportunities but also with more online risks Conversely more restrictive mediation was associated with fewer online risks experi enced by children but also they enjoyed fewer opportunities This makes it problematic if policymakers concerned with risk urge parents to restrict childrens internet use without recognising the costs to their online opportunities But also problematic is the tendency of educators to urge parents to enable childrens internet use without recog nising that this may bring more risk In addition both parents and policy makers need to be aware that risks do non necessarily translate to harm and that enabling mediation helps children to build resilience and adopt strategies that can help them stay safe both offline and online Further analysis of the European parent survey showed that parents prefer risk averse restrictive strategy for their less skilled children presumably doubting their childs ability to cope with risk if they encounter it while being more encouraging of if their children or they themselves are more competent internet users Thus in the Global North it is time to recognize that many parents are also gaining digital skills and they can use these to enable their child online However parents who are less confident of their own or their childs digital skills take more restrictive approach keeping their child safe but at the cost of online opportunities so to avoid vicious cycle of disad vantage parents every bit well as children could be provided with digital literacy education To sum up what we learned in the Global North suggests the value of an open dia logue between parent and child so that each comes to understand and respond to the online experiences competences and concerns of the other However insofar as parents or children lack digital skills inequalities in childrens online opportunities may open up EU Kids Online research shows other ways in which disadvantages in home life offline may extend online children more vulnerable to risk of harm offline also tend to be more vulnerable online also around one in eight parents does not provide sup portive or safety mediation last around half of parents whose child has encountered an online risk is unaware of this and this in countries where twothirds of children say their parents know fair amount about what they do online So even in the Global North many parents and carers lack time knowledge or other resources to manage their childrens internet use as well as they would wish either to promote opportunities or minimize risks And their responses both reflect and repro duce socioeconomic inequalities in childrens life changes now online as well as offline Sonia Livingstone Jasmina ByrneMoreover the continual flow of technological innovations further destabilizes parental competence and confidence while placing children at the cutting edge of experimental forms of technological innovation Lupton Williamson Add to this the con tradictory exhortations on the one hand to minimize screen time and on the other to buy the latest device to ensure children keep up and parental anxieties become intense BlumRoss Livingstone this book In low and middleincome countries It seems likely that the above problems are exacerbated in low and middleincome countries for several reasons UNICEF First even though close to billion peo ple mostly in the Global South are not connected of those who are young people below the age of are nearly three times more likely than the general population to be using the internet ITU So while kid are often pioneers in exploring the internet they may lack support from knowledgeable adults As Gouws comments about South African teenagers use of technology although perceived to be streetsmart arrogant knowitalls and technological experts they are also young lonely insecure and find themselves in life period of major developmental challenges Many children in developing countries are brought up by single parent or even by relatives often grandparents In CentralSouth America and subSaharan Africa children are more likely to live with either one or neither of their parents than children in other regions Child Trends Factors such as migration illness parental death poverty affect these family units functioning and parents or caregivers are often left with little resources and time to help with their children with the digital skills The digital divide between children and their grandparents is even more pronounced and it is hard to expect that year old will be able to monitor his or her grandchilds internet use or support them with the development of digital skills Sometimes parental mediation techniques are based on the cultural norms prevail ing in society tending to restrict childrens digital use even further Bulger et al which may in turn lead to children hiding from their parents what they do online For instance Davidson and Martellozzo found in their study in Bahrain that Young people use digital media in much the same way regardless of the social and cultural contexts but that culturally gendered perspectives place restrictions upon us age Specifically they note that parental expectations about girls use of digital media led girls to conceal acts that would be judged unacceptable such as communicating with boys online or that would be harshly punished if discovered Indeed parenting restrictions can fall particularly heavily on girls Livingstone et al As Porter and colleagues note in their study of three African countries These constraints on girls by parents and communities often imposed at least in part from positive welfare motives can be substantial barrier to accessing education and improved livelihoods especially but not only in rural areas study Parenting in the Digital Ageof parental mediation practices in South Africa found that girls received less parental mediation with regard to their internet use which was associated with fewer online risks but also with lower levels of digital skills and fewer online opportunities Phyfer KardefeltWinther forthcoming The degree to which parents and carers are often reluctant to discuss sexual matters with teenagers can leave them vulnerable to online and offline risks as they search for answers online potentially finding problematic content as result Nwalo Anasi No wonder that girls themselves call for efforts to educate parents teachers and communities on the importance of their access to the internet and to having ICTs better integrated in the curriculum de Pauw Parents may also not understand the nature of the risks online In Turkey smallscale survey of toyearolds found that the most reported form of exposure to cyberbullying students experience is being insulted and being threatened Aricak et al yet that parents and teachers tend to see verbal threats as less serious than physical bullying facetoface notwithstanding research which shows harms from cyberbullying United Nations In South Africa parents do worry about children experiencing of bullying online yet sizeable percentage of children said they experienced bullying in person which parents did non mention as concern Such onesided worries stem from the lack of parental knowledge of both digital technologies and their childrens life experiences so their mediation practices may go from total restriction and no access to device to access to device with little guidance on how to use the internet safely Phyfer et al In addition since in the least developed countries school attendance is low pupil teacher ratios are high and the overcrowded classrooms and untrained teachers are common UNESCO It seems fair to conclude that in many countries children lack supportive andor informed adult in their lives who can teach them to navigate the internet safely or offer support when needed What is being done what can be done Policy and practice must respect the different conditions that apply in different parts of the world The Global Kids Online GKO project is interviewing and surveying parents and children aged across different continents to benchmark and track childrens online access skills opportunities risk and safety and the skills and protective actions of their parents Recent findings from partners research reveals the different sources of support that children themselves turn to in different contexts Byrne et al Cabello et al Georgiev et al Kanchev et al Logar et al Phyfer et al Popadi et al Figure shows that in Bulgaria and Montenegro parents are more likely to be childrens first recourse for help when something is problematic on the internet com pared with in the Global South countries surveyed In Chile children seem less likely Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrneto tell anyone at all while in South Africa and the Philippines friends are preferred over parents though both are helpful In no country do children turn to teachers or other professionals in significant numbers This suggests that it is difficult to provide alternative adult sources of support to parents but that children might be supported by peerbased mentoring systems Figure The last time something happened online that bothered or upset you did you talk to anyone of these people about it per cent yes by country Comments to year old in all countries In Bulgaria Chile and Montenegro representative national samples are used Caution is needed for the findings from the Philippines and South Africa which are based on pilot data in the Philippines the sample is very small For methodological details see Multistakeholder discussions often express the hope or expectation that parents will take primary responsibility for child safety online Parental mediation can be tailored according to the age maturity cultural or psychological circumstances of each child It doesnt limit adults freedoms online and it is cheap Moreover parents are already on hand willing to play their role But they also expect that their childs school will offer them advice and safety education and that the government will police the internet so that parental lapses in effort or effectiveness dont have disastrous consequences In Europe Insafe is the awarenessraising network for national centres that coordi nates the annual Safer Internet Day and provides parental steering regarding the latest popular site or newest online fashion among children Furthermore there are numerous multistakeholder initiatives that draw together the combined expertise of educators parenting groups child welfare bodies industry and law enforcement see for example the work of the ICT Coalition in bringing together the internet industry Croll Coordinated accessible parentfocused efforts in the Global South are few and far between Livingstone et al Although there are many parenting education pro grams in this region very few address childrens online experiences Integrating online issues into existing programs may be way to reach more parents and address their needs holistically Also likely to be useful is peer mentoring given childrens preference Bulgaria Chile Montenegro South Africa Philippines Friend Paretscarer Sibling Another adult trust Teacher professional Parenting in the Digital Ageto turn to friend for support especially when it comes to marginalized groups of children eg children with disabilities or adolescent girls in societies where gender inequality undermines girls opportunities to benefit from ICT use For instance in Iraq provision of online resources allowed adolescent girls to access information also linking them to peertopeer support networks where they could discuss issues usually considered private or taboo in their society UNICEF Conclusion We have drawn on the available and new research to argue that in both the Global North and the Global South while it is entirely appropriate to call on parents to play key role since they are ideally positioned to address the particular best interests of their child policies which leave the bulk of the responsibility to parents will find that this works better for relatively privileged families than for the majority including for those particularly vulnerable or at risk thereby leaving many challenges for the rest of society to address The problems are multiple First parents are usually not the first people children wish to tell about their relational emotional or sexual concerns Second the internet is hugely complicated and fastchanging making it difficult for busy parent to grasp what children need to know Third some parents do not take on this responsibility and they are hard to reach by awareness campaigns Fourth small minorities of parents are truly neglectful of or abusive to their children making it inap propriate to rely on them to ensure their childs safety However for those seeking to prevent or manage the risks of harm to children it is important to empower all parents and to provide safety net for circumstances of childhood vulnerability Some trends in the Global North have implications for experience in the Global South For instance the growing understanding and willingness of parents to engage with their childrens internet use as they catch up with their early adopter children Some trends in the Global South have implications for experience in the Global North We can point the trend towards mobile first replacing first use via desktop or laptop computer which is now also spreading in the Global North reducing parents ability to monitor their childs internet use Mascheroni lafsson Other trends invite us to recognise that also in the Global North some children escape parental oversight by going online outside the home or lack reliable parenting or adult figures in their lives The WHO five parental roles have resonance for families everywhere for most parents struggle with the tension between protecting their children versus giving them the freedom to explore learn and grow independently In addition most parents can be encouraged to draw on what they know about their child and the wider society as often this knowledge is also applicable in the digital domain Therefore in considering the stakeholders supporting parents there are questions about balance In future it will also be critical to include parenting in the digital age as component of parenting programmes currently being offered in the North and the South and to evaluate them Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrnefor impact Such examples of evidencebased programmes include Triple or Sinovuyo Teen parenting programme Haggerty et al Cluver et al indicating the positive impact of specific interventions in relation to parenting support In seeking answers to these dilemmas we would refer to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which clearly specifies that parents have the primary responsibility for childrearing but it also places obligations on states and communities to support parents in these endeavours It seems that the old saying it takes village to raise child still applies in digital world Its just that the village is now both local and Global

Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile Chile Abstract This article presents study that applies integrated and multifactor path analysis to report the direct and indirect effects of young Brazilian individual and home factors on their online opportunities and risks The results show that engaging in more online opportunities being older and having lower level of parental mediation are associated with higher number of online risks At the same time being older having Internet access at home having parents with higher educational level possessing more digital skills and receiving higher level of couse and active parental mediation are positively associated with online opportunities Although restrictive parental mediation is negatively associated with online risks it also reduces opportunities In addition couse and active mediation are positively associated with parental educational level These findings offer starting point to understand childrens online behaviour and digital inclusion in Latin America and analyse its differences with other regions Corresponding author Tania CabelloHutt Department of Sociology University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Hamilton Hall CB Chapel Hill NC USA Email NMS new media societyCabelloHutt et al researcharticle Article new media society Keywords Brazil digital skills online opportunities online risks parental mediation structural equation modelling Introduction significant number of young people have grown up with the Internet and digital devices as part of their everyday lives Erstad Facer et al Furlong and Davies Livingstone et al Livingstone and Helsper Researchers policy makers and other stakeholders have focussed on the opportunities and risks that the Internet can offer to children and young people and on the factors that may facilitate or condition them Hasebrink et al The type of activities children engage in online cannot be described as beneficial or harmful because such judgments depend on the outcome of the activity rather than the activity itself Livingstone et al However some activities are more likely to lead to beneficial outcomes while others will increase the likelihood of harm Livingstone et al The former can be conceptualised as online opportunities and the latter as online risks Hasebrink et al claim that although opportunities and risks are moving target they can be associated with certain activities online opportunities can include access to global information educational resources entertainment social networking with friends privacy for the expression of identity content creation and civic or political participation while online risks include illegal content or activities sexual violence bullying invasions of privacy offensive content biased information and contacting and meeting strangers As Livingstone and Helsper emphasise there is lack of research analysing the multiple and integrated factors associated with young peoples Internet use considering online risks and opportunities which are commonly studied separately Furthermore the focus has been placed more on online risks and safety Smahel and Blinka and how children cope with online risks Vandoninck et al Since those who encounter more opportunities also tend to face more risks online Livingstone and Helsper it is important to consider both aspects especially to avoid concluding that certain factors reduce risks without accounting for their possible negative effect on opportunities In addition to the importance of access frequency of use and time spent online evi dence supports an association between personal factors such as age gender digital skills emotional and psychological characteristics and online opportunities and risks Helsper et al Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch Smahel and Blinka Sociocultural factors such as socioeconomic status SES educational resources and parental mediation of Internet use have also been found to be strongly associated with opportunities and risks Cho et al Hargittai Helsper et al Lee and Chae Livingstone and Helsper Robinson et al Among these factors such as digital skills and parental mediation of Internet use are especially relevant since they are subject to public policy intervention The purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of new research approach analysing multiple and integrated factors associated with young peoples Internet use CabelloHutt et al Livingstone and Helsper Considering that research in this area has developed more in the Northern Hemisphere Livingstone and Bulger this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how these phenomena arise in Latin American country Internet users have rapidly increased in Latin America in the past decade on average from to In contrast in the United States and the United Kingdom the increase during this time was smaller but reached significantly higher proportion of users from to and from to respectively International Telecommunication Union ITU Despite the fast increase in access studies in Latin America related to the impact of digital technologies in peoples everyday lives particularly that of children are still scarce In this sense Brazil as the first country to offer international comparable data on childrens uses opportunities and risks in the region is an interesting case to study Nevertheless to further understand this phenomenon in Latin America and analyse its differences with Europe or other regions data from more countries are necessary This will be possible in the near future as new Latin American countries are increasingly implementing the Kids Online survey including Argentina in Chile in and Uruguay in In Brazil children face inequalities and specific features in their digital ecology as complex and multilevel phenomenon that are closely related to opportunities and risks Cabello etal Based on Brofenbrenners ecological model Livingstone et al claim that in order to frame childrens use of digital media it is necessary to adopt digital ecology approach defined by at least two systemic levels First the level of family dynamics and personal beliefs of parents and children and second the level of structural factors such as income access to technology and cultural values The case of Brazil Between and Internet users some who used the Internet in the past months increased in Brazil from to ITU Access and use of information and communication technology ICT are highly determined by the area where people live and their SES PausHasebrink et al In fact and of the households of two highest SES groups respectively have Internet access at home versus an of the lowest SES group households CGIbr The proportion of young Internet users in Brazil is among yearolds and among yearolds Despite this relatively high proportion of users one out of four children or teens is excluded from the Internet CGIbr Sozio et al The proportion who uses the Internet daily is of high SES children of medium SES children and only of low SES children Sozio et al Therefore Brazil still faces an important challenge regarding the universalisation and democratisation of access and use of the Internet Barbosa et al Literature review Opportunities and risks online Childrens Internet use has been amply studied and classified Many of these classifica tions are based on childrens motivations and frequency of use and come up with new media society generally similar categories entertainment communication information seeking and productivity among others Facer et al Furlong and Davies Hinostroza etal Ito etal Johnson Nevertheless most of these studies have limited to describe childrens uses without considering the consequences or potential consequences of the use of the Internet Livingstone et al propose that types of Internet use can be understood as online opportunities and risks The activities that are more likely to turn into beneficial outcomes can be classified as opportunities while those that are more likely to turn into harmful or disturbing outcomes as risks Online opportunities can bring risks and online risks may or may not turn into negative experiences or harm Livingstone and Bulger There is vast scholarship on the risks and negative experiences that children can encounter by using the Internet such as cyberbullying online grooming unwanted sexual material or excessive use or Internet addiction Aboujaoude et al Kowalski et al Mitchell et al Smahel and Blinka Whittle et al However enquiry on online opportunities is scarce and more recent Evidence shows that older children engage in more online opportunities Livingstone and Helsper and also tend to face more risks Livingstone and Helsper Mitchell et al Sasson and Mesch Age also has an indirect effect on risks mediated not only by access and use but also by digital skills Livingstone and Helsper In general boys tend to encounter more risks than girls Mitchell et al Sasson and Mesch even disregarding their skill level Livingstone and Helsper Boys also tend to engage in more opportunities online although gender intersects with age as children get older the gender gap widens in terms of diversity and amount of use Livingstone and Helsper The type of risks children and teenagers face online is also differentiated by gender Livingstone et al found that boys are more exposed to sexual images online while it is more common for girls to receive hurtful messages and also to be upset by the risks they experience However the evidence in being victim of cyberbullying based on gender differences is mixed Aboujaoude et al Kowalski et al In relation to SES there is some evidence about its association with different types of Internet use specifically in terms of enhanced life chances Robinson et al and gratifications gained from Internet use Cho et al Also the SES can be strong predictor of the way people engage on the Internet where those with higher SES tend to use it in more diverse and informed way Hargittai Livingstone and Helsper found that middleclass teenagers benefit more from online opportunities than workingclass teenagers However SES did not have direct effect on opportunities or risks but rather it was mediated by access Finally parental education is also relevant factor in explaining childrens online risks and opportunities Parents with less education tend to apply more restrictive technical mediation Sonck et al while more educated parents apply more active mediation PausHasebrink et al Digital skills Digital skills are set of abilities required for information society Van Dijk and Van Deursen They are not homogeneously distributed generating the socalled CabelloHutt et al secondlevel digital divide Hargittai and Hinnant Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Age grammatical gender and SES have been found to be associated with digital skills Research shows that lesseducated andor lowerincome people tend to have lower levels of digital skills Aesaert and Van Braak Correa Hargittai Van Deursen and Van Dijk Regarding gender some evidence shows that girls have higher levels of digital skills technical and higherorder skills Aesaert and Van Braak and regarding age older children tend to have higher skill levels irrespective of access or use Livingstone and Helsper Parental mediation of Internet use Research has reported different parental mediation strategies related to media The most commonly reported strategies include active restrictive and coviewing Nathanson as well as couse mediation Livingstone and Helsper Valkenburg et al Valkenburg et al recently developed validated model to evaluate the adolescents perceptions on restrictive and active parental mediation They found that these perceptions are more diverse than most researchers assume Restrictive mediation can be perceived not only as way to control but also as supportive mediation style Meanwhile active mediation can be perceived as way to control The authors discuss that parental mediation has not been properly analysed yet considering the wider context of parental styles The European Union EU Kids Online framework defines and measures five types of parental mediation on which this study is based active or instructive mediation talking about media content while the child is online restrictive mediation setting rules that restrict the use of the medium cousing remaining present while the child is online thus sharing the experience but without commenting on the content or its effects monitoring checking childrens online activities afterwards and restricting by technical bans or filters using software and configurations for time control and to ban or filter specific content Drager and Sonck Although this classification of types of mediation differentiates between various practices it is still limited as it does not incorporate the nuances of how these practices are taking place or being perceived by the child In relation to SES research has shown that students online activity is shaped by their parents differential access to what Bourdieu calls economic and cultural capital and also by their different experiences with technology Hollingworth et al In wealthier families parents tend to have more experience with technology and to be more digitally skilled providing their children with more guidance and support than in less wealthy families Vekiri As children get older parents reduce the frequency and diversity of the mediation practices Livingstone and Helsper Nikken and Jansz Sonck et al Valcke et al Data regarding the relationship between gender and the amount or type of parental mediation are mixed Some research has found that the childs gender has no association with the overall amount of parental mediation Livingstone and Helsper while others have found that girls are more subject to parental mediation new media society than boys Nunes De Almeida et al Sonck et al and others have found the inverse Nikken and Jansz Digital skills and online risks and opportunities Digital skills play significant role in Internet use Eastin and LaRose Hargittai and Hinnant Van Dijk and Van Deursen Evidence shows that they play direct role not only in online opportunities but also as mediator between those oppor tunities and the effect of sociodemographic factors and access Hargittai and Hinnant Livingstone and Helsper Digital literacy is associated with both opportunities and risks encountered online Livingstone and Helsper Specifically it is important in terms of online coping strategies when encountering upsetting situations Vandoninck et al and in whether certain uses become harmful negative experience or an opportunity Smahel and Blinka Vandoninck et al Parental mediation and risks and opportunities online supportive style of mediation is associated with safer Fleming et al use of the Internet and also with more positive interactive behaviour online Lee and Chae Norms such as time of use or websites that children can visit seem ineffective Lee and Chae Vandoninck et al As Livingstone and Helsper show restricting Internet use with the aim of reducing risks will most likely also reduce opportunities Similarly countries with the highest proportion of restrictive mediation practices are not systematically lower risk and harm countries Helsper et al Parental mediation and digital skills There is lack of evidence regarding the possible effect that any parental mediation of Internet use can have on the digital literacy level of children or teenagers However the EU Kids Online study shows that active monitoring and technical parental mediation of the Internet are positively associated with digital skills while restrictive mediation is negatively associated Drager and Livingstone Livingstone et al Hypothetical model Most of the studies reviewed did not perform an integrated and complex analysis For this study we develop multivariate approach integrating wider range of variables The following questions drove this research RQ What is the association between young Internet users demographics age and gender home factors Internet access at home parental education

available were in age groups instead of years of age These items were originally ordinal but were dichotomised in terms of nonrestriction can do this anytime and any type of restriction can only do with permission or supervision and can never do this This also allowed having the same scale for both types of mediation These items are originally ordinal Many times Sometimes and No but were dichotomised the first two categories were merged in order to use the same scale for opportunities and risksTable ContinuedCabelloHutt et al The parental mediation measures are conceptualised and validated by Drager and Sonck in European sample Originally these questions were intended to the dif ferent types of mediation separately active couse and restrictive However an explor atory factor analysis using tetrachoric correlations showed the existence of two main factors factor eigenvalue of variance explained factor eigen value of variance explained where all items of active and couse mediation grouped in factor and all items of restrictive mediation grouped in factor Path model estimation structural equation model SEM was fit to the data using path analysis model with observable endogenous and exogenous variables Due to the nonnormal distribution of some of the endogenous variables the model was fit using the maximum likelihood method MLM estimator where standard errors and chisquare tests are robust to nonnormality Rossel This method allows for the modelling of correlated error terms several endogenous variables and estimation of direct and indirect effects Bollen Recently research on the digital divide has used the SEM methodology Livingstone and Helsper Van Deursen and Van Dijk obtaining relevant results which were taken into account in the model hypothesised for this study The analyses were performed using the lavaan Rossel and lavaansurvey Oberski packages with software Core Team All analyses were conducted with the corresponding probability weights

comparative fit index CFI TuckerLewis index TLI After checking the modification indices the covari ance between couse and active intermediation and restrictive parental mediation was included in the

Correlation matrix for continuous standardised variables Online risks Online opportunities Digital skills Couse and active parental mediation Restrictive parental mediation Parental educational level new media society third model was fit by fixing the nonsignificant paths to zero and while the CFI improved significantly for the other indices the nonfixed model had better fit Thus the final model was adjusted without fixing the parameters All endogenous variable variances were estimated but were omitted from the tables Effects on online opportunities and risks RQ The direct effects on risks and opportunities are presented in Tables and respectively The hypothesis that online opportunities are associated with online risks is confirmed and it is the strongest direct path to online risks Another significant direct path to online risks is belonging to the olderage group to years in comparison to belonging to the youngerage group to years Belonging to the middleage group to years had no significant effect in comparison to the younger age group The hypothesis of negative association between being girl and online risks was not confirmed However there is an indirect path between gender and online risks mediated by online opportunities Table In other words the fact that girls tend to engage in less online opportunities reduces their chances of experiencing risks The hypotheses regarding the negative effect of both types of mediation were con firmed Interestingly the direct effect of couse and active mediation is slightly stronger than the effect of restrictive mediation Digital skills turned out to have nonsignificant direct association with online risks however they did have an indirect effect mediated Figure Path model for online opportunities and risks Note Standardised estimates are displayed for the endogenous variables are in parentheses The signs of the associations are represented by different arrows solid for positive and dashed for negative For clarity nonsignificant paths were omitted from the figure All path coefficients are thicker to represent importanceCabelloHutt et al by online opportunities Table This means that higher level of

society chance are from restrictive mediation which has negative effect and from Internet access at home and digital skills which both have positive effect Couse and active mediation have no direct significant effect on online opportunities however they have significant indirect effect when mediated by digital skills In other words this type of mediation may increase the level of digital skills resulting in higher engagement with online opportunities Belonging to either of the older age groups and higher parental education are both positively associated with opportunities Finally girls tend to engage in fewer online opportunities When looking at the total effects sum of all direct and indirect effects on each vari able presented in Table we confirm the importance of the effect of online opportunities age and parental mediation on online risks When looking at the total effects on opportunities we confirm that restrictive mediation reduces opportunities and that Internet access at home and higher level of digital skills increases opportunities Effects on digital skills RQ Age has strong effect on digital skills especially when comparing the older age group to years with the younger

of the predictor variables included in this study The contribution of this study is testing the persistence of these associations in more complex model and in Latin American country The result that online opportunities seem to be associated with online risks is consist ent with the results of Livingstone and Helsper and it strengthens the relevance of analysing them together and of revising the factors associated with them Our findings confirm the relevance of personal characteristics in online opportunities and risks age gender and digital skills seem to shape childrens and adolescents experiences on the Internet As in previous studies Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch older teenagers engage in more online risks than younger children and older children engage in more opportunities Livingstone and Helsper Considering that younger children run to be more receptive to parental intervention while older children often perceive mediation as an invasion of privacy Smahel and Wright age should be crucial in the discussion regarding parental mediation opportunities and risk policies Contrary to prior findings Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch Vandoninck et al gender and digital skills seem not to have direct influence on online risks but rather operate through online opportunities Brazilian boys are more likely to engage in opportunities online which results in greater likelihood of encountering risks On the contrary the level of digital skills increases online opportunities leading to an increase in online risks The lack of direct relationship of digital skills with risks may be explained by the indicators used in this survey to measure digital skills which are more focussed on managing opportunities than risks We also found that family factors such as parental educational level and parental Internet use are important mainly due to their influence through parental mediation The finding that parental mediation seems to be reducing the number of risks is consistent with some previous studies Fleming et al Lee and Chae Valcke et al and contrary to others in Europe Helsper et al Livingstone and Helsper The latter studies showed that increasing mediation did not necessarily reduce risks and also that countries with higher restrictive mediation did not have lower levels of online risk In Brazil both types of mediation were found to be negatively associated with the amount of online risks although couse and active mediation had stronger effect compared to restrictive mediation Couse and active mediation do not have direct effect on online opportunities but as they are positively associated with the level of digital skills they may increase the online opportunities indirectly The fact that restrictive mediation reduces risks but also reduces opportunities questions the effectiveness of restrictive mediation on helping children and adolescents with an overall positive online experience However this should be further explored considering personal andor cultural factors that have been found to affect this association Kirwil Lee Parents who use the Internet tend to practice more mediation with their children espe cially couse and active mediation These parents may be more selfconscious about the different opportunities and risks online and tend to prefer explaining and discussing the media content andor sharing media activities with their children rather than restricting their useCabelloHutt et al Higher educated parents seem to practice more couse and active parental mediation However parental education did not have significant effect on restrictive mediation This is consistent with European findings Drager and Livingstone Livingstone et al As Livingstone et al noted highly educated parents seem to be replacing regulatory approaches with more supportive styles that encourage the childs empowerment These results suggest that couse and active parental mediation are in some way related to the cultural capital of the family as defined by Bourdieu It could be hypothesised that through active or couse mediation practices parents are transmitting to their children certain cultural capital in the form of advice criteria and guidelines on Internet use as proposed by Frow and Emmison Children with higher educated parents also engage in more online opportunities and have higher levels of digital skills Thus children from more highly educated families could be benefiting from Internet use to greater extent than those who have fewer resources resulting in increased inequality De Haan This result is particularly relevant for digital inclusion policies in Brazil and other Latin American countries which tend to focus only on providing access and promoting Internet use Social and especially educational policies in these countries should also work on implementing school and teacher Internet mediation strategies and on developing childrens digital skills Otherwise as these findings suggest digital opportunities may potentially become new source of inequality and could even result in the amplification of existing social and cultural inequalities Toyama In addition we found that structural factor Internet access at home was associated with greater number of online opportunities This finding in addition to the importance of parental education shows that the socioeconomic characteristics at home are still an important condition for online opportunities Livingstone and Helsper This represents relevant gap in country like Brazil where Internet access is far from universal and there are important social inequalities On the contrary the importance of digital skills on online opportunities is consistent with previous findings in Europe and North America Eastin and LaRose Hargittai and Hinnant Van Dijk and Van Deursen Finally general overview of the results of this model shows that as in other contexts of child development access to material resources parents education and mediation role and childrens skills are all important factors in the digital context More specifically parents who dedicate more time to active and couse can provide more opportunities for their children These parents also tend to be more skilled and more educated which is very important finding facing the inequalities in Brazil and other countries in the Global South These results support the importance of adopting an ecological per spective that combines personal family cultural and structural factors to study this phenomenon At the same time they stress the need to design overarching policies to support childrens development and wellbeing in the digital environment Some limitations of this study should be considered First the use of SEM posed some methodological challenges when using survey weights Second digital skills were based on selfreport rather than actual achievement which could be reflecting other personal characteristics such as selfefficacy and social desirability leading to an over or underestimation of the skill level Third the influence of teachers or peers was new media society not considered which may be obscuring the way that other socialisation agents shape childrens experiences on the Internet Fourth information on technical and monitoring mediation was only available for children with Internet access at home and therefore these types of mediation were not included in the analysis Fifth the mediation measures available fail to incorporate the nuances of the parenting style possibly hiding restrictive but supportive or active but controlling types of mediation Valkenburg et al Future studies should also consider these extended frameworks to study parental mediations Finally the definition of risks and opportunities only refers to the likelihood of harm or of benefit respectively and the classification of some items in each one of them could be argued One example is the inclusion of contacting strangers online as risk To avoid normative approaches in these types of classifications further qualitative and quantitative research in this area is needed Acknowledgements The authors gratefully

['Effectiveness of Digital Platforms to Reduce VAW Dr Erika Fraser and Caroline Enye January Query What is the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms eg soap operas radio programmes Facebook Apps YouTube and Instagram to reduce violence against women Purpose To test soap opera approach to drive behaviour change to address deeply ingrained socio cultural norms that enable very high levels of VAWG in Bangladesh Reaching women and girls through traditional outreach and training has had some impact but digital technology presents an opportunity to increase and widen our reach Digital and mobile phone penetration is high in Bangladesh particularly amo ng young people At this stage we envisage the soap opera would primarily target young people years with the scripting of the story youth led and broadcast on digital platforms used by young people in Bangladesh Introduction Traditional and digital media platforms can be important pproaches to reach young people with social messaging with huge potential to transform harmful social norms around gender and violence through public discussion and social interaction However these tools are not without risks and challenges This document provides rapid review of the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms including soap operas radio programmes Facebook Apps YouTube and Instagram to reduce violence against women and girls VAWG As these digital platforms are still relatively new this query also includes any evidence on the effectiveness of more traditional me dia approaches eg radio television This report begins by setting out the methodology and strength of the evidence base Section before pulling out the key lessons from the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms to reduce VAWG Section Further details on case studies are provided in Annex Methodology and evidence base The review prioritised existing syntheses where possible in order to draw on the fullest range of evidence possible given time constraints Search strategy Studies were identified through searches using Google and relevant electronic databases PubMed Science Direct and Google Scholar for priority sources Key search terms included soap opera radio television TV Facebook Apps YouTube Instagram technology digital AND violence against women GBV rape AND adolescent youth young people Criteria for inclusion To be eligible for inclusion in this rapid mapping studies had to fulfil the following criteria Focus Research evaluations and studies of digital platforms and soap opera programmes to reduce violence against women Time period January Language English and Portuguese Traditional media refers to television radio and print media DFID refers to the word digital within its strategy as the tools techniques technology and approaches of the internet age Typically digital media is used to describe internet forums blogs wikis podcasts and social media applications eg YouTube Instagram Facebook VAWG Helpdesk Research Report No Publishing status publicly available in almost all cases pub lished online Geographical focus low and middle income countries but opened up to high income countries in areas where evidence was lacking Overall the evidence base on the effectiveness of digital platforms and media programming to reduce VAWG is limited according to DFIDs How to Note on Assessing the Strength of Evidence ie moderate to low quality studies medium size evidence body low levels of consistency The most rigorous studies are over ten years old eg Soul City in South Africa Programme in Brazil or currently awaiting results eg Change Starts at Home in Nepal Most other studies are either lowquality observational studies or are based primarily on monitoring data on the reach of programme for example ow many viewers or listeners rather than impact The few systematic reviews that exist on VAWG point to the scarcity of high quality rigorous research in this area and particular ly lack of research measuring changes in violent behaviour or experiences of VAWG Fulu et al Trabold et al There is particularly limited data on the effectiveness of digital platforms partly due to this being relatively new approach and the rapidly evolving technological context Various apps and online tools have been developed but these are mostly not evaluated There is also an vidence gap in understanding he effectiveness of different approaches for women and girls who are particularly vulnerable to violence online and offline such as adolescent girls women and girls with disabilities and young people of diverse sex ualities and gender identities Faith and Fraser Examples of soap opera and digital platforms used to address VAWG see Annex for further examples and details Programme

driving behaviour change around VAWG but research suggests that it should be linked with more intensive engagement via offline activities and local action Key lessons include the importance of providing opportunities for young people to put new norms and behaviours into practice India soap opera whose themes include acid attacks and omestic violence Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon MKBKSH Woman Can Achieve Anything used communication approach across wide range of communication platforms to engage the audience As part of this it formed community outreach groups Research found that the groups were spurring interpersonal conversations beyond the group for example of group Including television and radio serial an interactive voice response system social media outlets and on theground activities The programme partnered with NGOs in the states of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh to infuse MKBKSH viewinglistening with community outreach groups groups in Districts of Bihar and groups in Districts of Madhya Pradesh These groups were called Sneha Groups named afte Dr Sneha the protagonist in the soap opera members reported talking about the issues raised in the soap opera to family to friends and to frontline health or social workers Wang and Singhal In India Bell Bajao found that mobile video vans accompanied by staff and youth advocates were extremely effective in mobilising communities nd enabled the public to ask questions about domestic violence and womens rights Breakthrough In Nigeria Voices for Change VC observed that people that had physical interaction with the programme had the most intense change but that others who were targeted indirectly through mass media also sometimes reached position from where they are able to act on gender inequality brandmass edia campaigns are an important part of creating change but may not be enough by themselves to create profound change in most cases Rather they can create the conditions for further influencing by those that experienced intensive inputs they are the next generation of low hanging fruit Milward and Nelson Other examples of mediadigital programmes involving offline discussion groups include Soul City South Africa Change Starts at Home Nepal Programme and Entre Ns Brazil and bey ond and Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales We Are Different We Are Equal Nicaragua Evidence suggests the type of communications platform visual vs verbal appears to play role in influencing behaviour change although further research is needed and attributing change within multi media programme can be complex Data from Nigerias VC programme found difference in attitude and behaviour associated with hearing the media talk of the town about violence against women in the Purple Tinz radio show versus seeing violence portrayed in the media This suggests that seeing or hearing depictions of violence can reinforce harmful descriptive norms the sense that violence is common and acceptable In contrast hearing violence being discussed provides lis tenersviewers the space to analyse and challenge their own perceptions and harmful norms see box below Influencing Behaviour Change Lessons from DFIDs Voices for Change VC programme Whilst the results are not clear cut and there is more to learn about how to effectively use mass communications communications platforms which specifically created space for discussion and interrogation were shown to be particularly effective For example findings from VC suggests that seeing more scenes of violence against women portrayed on TVradio corresponds with higher VAWG perceptions and behaviour whereas discussion of VAWG on TV and the radio correlates with decline in VAWG at home This hy pothesis is consistent with findings from VCs qualitative surveys where interviewees credited discursive spaces as being particularly influential in the development of new ideas and shifting personal attitudes and behaviours The impact of online content is mixed Evidence generated by VC finds that individuals participating in the Purple Academy and Purple online Purple Spaces felt more willing to speak up against violence Yet findings from VC show very different results from light versus intensive web engagement People with intensive online Purple Academy exposure completion of module reported four to eight times greater change in their support for gender equality including their willingness to speak up against VAWG compared to thos with general Purple Academy recognition Analysis of the Attitudes Practice and Social Norms Survey APSN results suggest that people who had only light exposure to online Purple content are consuming digital media from much broader range of sources as well and this wider online engagement is different from people who have no exposure to online Purple con tent This matters because simultaneously with programming online there were many other spaces and forums where gender was being discussed in unmoderated and often negative ways Sources VC DennyE et all Storylines and essaging Storylines and essages should be piloted with target audiences to ensure they are understood correctly and to minimise any unintended negative effects Avis The evaluation of Soul City soap opera in South Africa highlighted the importanc of formative research with both audiences and experts to develop and field test storylines and materials to ensure their effectiveness DFIDs VC programme also gained valuable lessons about messaging both in pre test and in the annual communications eview At the launch of the brand whilst users found the Purple brand appealing and the communications relevant there was no association with gender equality This resulted in the programme re branding to Purple the suggesting gender equa lity which created dramatic shift in users understanding of the core brand message The most effective messaging is tailored to audiences using social marketing principles and creating supportive environment that enables the intended audience to make hanges Avis eg by mobilising communities in support of the campaign For example VCs Purple lifestyle brand unified communications encouraging sense of wider gender equality movement ather than disparate activities VC and Identifying how gender equal ity and non violent behaviour will benefit the audience was at the core of communication Programmes should avoid reinforcing harmful descriptive norms that VAWG is widespread and instead look to reinforce protective norms or put positive norms in place For example in Nicaragua Paluck and Ball note that it appears possible that the plot of the television series and radio call in programme Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales We are Different We are Equal may have reinforced negative descriptive norms such as the perception that sexual and physical abuse are widespread problems By advertising how common problem is there is risk of norma lising this behaviour For example in Nigeria positive messages around self fulfilment career success and loving romantic relationships were developed from VCs research into the values young people held The meta narrative of gender equality within rel ationships was promoted by the Purple tagline creating sense of identity as person who will be the best they can be and support others to reach their full potential It is also important to channel individuals into opportunities to act on messages such as supporting and advertising hotline to report violence For example Soul City in South Africa partnered with national toll free helpline with online counsellors and comprehensive national database to refer callers to ongoing support at community level approx imately calls were answered on lines over months When raising awareness or trying to change social norms it is an ethical imperative to ensure that details of local keep services are accessible for peopl who have experienced violence see later section on safeguarding single brand identity unifies communications encouraging wider sense of movement for change For example the Girl Effect programme developed different brands in close association ith girls Ni Nyampinga in Rwanda meaning the beautiful girl inside and out who makes good decisions in Kinyarwanda and Yegna in Ethiopia ours in Amharic In Ethiopia the Yegna brand focuses on branded edutainment package radio drama talk show music and network of Yegna ambassadors who hold weekly listening parties that creates platform to have national conver sation about some of the cultural norms holding girls back such as violence against girls Nigerias VC Purple brand was effective in its ability to attribute individuals change and to which particular media platform through the annual Social Norms At titude and Practice Survey The findings informed programming choices to maximise impact and value for money Descriptive norms are what people think other people do Saturation or intensity of messaging is key to changing behaviours For example research in Burkina Faso on using radio programming concluded that up to ten messages day are required to be able to scientifically prove subsequent related change in behaviour Murray et al However such high intensity broadcasting is challenging to achieve in practice instead the study recom mend developing messages across range of channels short second advertising spots combined with longer dramas and opportunities to interact Broadening ccess to digital platforms Rigorous enquiry can help identify which communications platform are most accessible and used by the target audience National data may be out ofdate or not disaggregate by factors such as gender age religionculture disability Small scale pilots can help with understanding diversity and nclusion Evidence suggests that it is also important not to rely solely on digital platforms the most effective programmes provide alternative options to ensure young people who are not digitally connected are not being left behind For example in Br azil Promundos Entre Ns Between Us radio soap opera aired on community radio and was broadcast in places you ng people frequented schools beauty salons cyber cafes In rural Sierra Leone Media Matters for Women MMW broadcasts udio podcasts at Listening Centres that MMW builds and manages through community promoters in and around towns often attracting around people to hear the weekly broadcasts People with disabilities can face particular barriers to accessing traditional and digital media DFIDs Strategy for Disability Inclusive Development notes the importance of considering the differential needs of girls and women with disabilities and ensuring they can access the same opportunities to participate DFID No examples were found during this query of media or digital tools on VAWG which have considered the needs of people with disabilities DFID have highlighted various ways tha digital technologies can overcome barriers includ ing voice recognition magnification and text tospeech functionality for people with visual cognitive learning and mobility disabilities text messaging telephone relay and video captions for pers ons with hearing and speech disabilities and hands free navigation and gesture controlled interfaces for people with severe mobility impairments DFID World Bank Programmes can also work offline with Disabled Peoples Organisations DPOs to reach people with disabilities who cannot access digital platforms Further advice and information can be accessed at DFIDs new disability helpdesk Working with young people around digital platforms Formative research is important in understanding how young men and women use different digital platforms In Nigeria VCs legacy paper on using digital spaces noted that young people often engage for short periods of time while they multitask with other activities view different sites at once messag friends as well as being regular interrupted by bad connection Programmes need to take these habits into account when designing content for digital platforms and when evaluating impact Such as Kenema Makeni and Waterloo located in three different provinces Contact email Note that VC findings refer to digital onlinemobile only Usage of radio tv tc is less complex Cocreation with young people is important to get the content and messaging right For example the Springster online mobile first platform formally Girl Effect Mobile was designed for and created by irls Girl readers submit their own stories via monthly Your Words contest and connect with each other using features such as commenting threads polls and reactions In DFIDs VC programme in Nigeria young people were engaged in user experienc and content design workshop to design the look feel and initial content of the am Purple website and employed young people as core staff to support content creation and moderate social media Young people engage in different ways depending on their age evidence suggests it is important to ffer range of ageappropriate opportunities In India Must Bol used creative digital media platforms for young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it Must Bol ound that different online activities attracted different age groups photo contests attracted young er people whereas blogathon attracted an older group Liou Evidence suggests that usical and artistic approaches are effective ways of engaging young people as are celebrities and other influencers In Brazil Entre Ns soap opera was accompanied by set of comic books and soundtrack In Viet Nam celebrities participated in digital campaign Love Journey by being models in ample photo essay creating campaign music video and writing songs on healthy relationships that they performed at musical concert In Ethiopia Girl Effect created the Yegna girl pop group to accompany ra dio drama and talk show that championed the potential of girls In Nigeria popular musicians created music video supported the campaign through live appearances and promoted Purple through their social media channels Challenges to engaging young people around digital platforms to prevent VAWG include literacy cultural norms only reaching certain young people who have access to digital technology as well as risks to privacy and safety see following section Avis For example VC Purple mobile platform had consistently lower numbers of young women engaging on the site closely reflecting the national statistics of malefemale online users Additional investment went into women targeted advertising nd content that spoke directly to young women As result overall user numbers dropped but resulted in almost equal number of male and female users Whilst being equally popular and relevant amongst the wealth groups the purple radio show was most successful in reaching the lower wealth quintiles Denny and Hughes Safeguarding Risks with digital mobileonline spaces need to be carefully planned for monitored and mitigated against Risks associated with the use of digital platforms include trolling grooming and abusive content as well as risks to digital privacy all of which need to be carefully managed and mitigated For example the VC Purple website and social media platforms were closely monitored for signs of backlash and abuse and in response to abusive content posted on the Facebook page number of users were banned from the platform Importance of moderators and rules to ensure digital space are safe for young people For example the closed Facebook group Female in Nigeria Fin with over million members gets hundreds of applications for posts every day but they are managed and approved by group of volunteers About make it on the page It also has strict rules including not judging each other removing negative comments and no religious themed advice Fin is not place of worship For more information see wedomobile platformsspringster Ensure digital platforms provide way for young people who have experienced violence to access support For example in Nigeria the VC Purple website featured dedicated page with links to organisations and services for survivors of VAWG In South Africa Soul City partnered with national toll free helpline staffed by counsellors Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation of traditional and digital media approaches to reduce VAWG remains key evidence gap where investment is needed to avoid the risk of programmes being unable to demonstrate impact Of the examples reviewed for this query only nine had evidence of impact on attitudes and two on violence perpetration or victimisation DFIDs review of the VAWG portfolio cautioned of the risks for innovative DFID media programmes which are not able to demonstrate impact eg attracting ne gative public attention and being shut early Evaluations of traditional and new media programmes often generate complex results which can take time to interpret Both Somos Diferentes Somos Iguales in Nicaragua and VC in Nigeria found mixed changes in attitudes behaviours and norms relating to VAWG which var ied by geographic and programming areas In Nigeria there was strong evidence that VC has brought about significant change amongst individuals who engaged in phy sical and virtual Safe Spaces targeted trainings and mass media communications Evidence suggests the most effective programming builds in opportunities for learning and adapting in response to audience feedback and wider changes in the political and socio economic context In Nepal the DFID funded Change Starts at Home programme hich aims to reduce intimate partner violence between married couples uses Listening and Discussion Groups to ensure that the radio drama content is relevant and applicable as well as to explore issues in greater depth Listener reactions and feedback ar shared with the radio production team to guide the content of future episodes and adapt messaging accordingly Clark et al Digital platforms can provide transparent and accessible mechanisms to generate real time beneficiary feedback at scale lose feedback loops and provide pulse check for offline activities For example the Indian soap opera Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon MKBKSH Woman Can Achieve Anything present pioneered the use of an Interactive Voice Response System IVRS which provided discussion forum for viewers and way to share feedback The IVRS platform had million calls from more than unique headphone numbers across out of Indias states Independent analysis of the IVRS data noted that IVRS as reached media dark areas through Mobile Vaani networks and Community Radio Stations giving voice to less privileged audience members No media initiative anywhere in the world has received such high level of audience participation in real time such scale Wang and Singhal Costs and alue for Money High upfront costs are often incurred by programmes using digital platforms and communications approaches to allow for design testing and adaptation according to review of DFIDs VAWG portfolio It also noted that the timeframe needed to achieve social norm change and the front loading of inputs can skew Value for Money assessments in the early stages of programming VAWG Helpdesk So while costs may come down over time it should also be noted that costs may increase in subsequent years if additional investments are needed to male and female groups per study site meet weekly for weeks develop the intervention based on programmatic learnings as was the cas with VC in Nigeria More costing information is forthcoming in from DFIDs What Works to Prevent VAWG research programme Digital platforms can be resource intensive during implementation For example in India the Must Bol digital campaign for young people noted that they needed more staffing During the last quarter of the campaign when both on and offline work was the strongest there were only three fulltime people working on the campaign larger group would have been much better Liou In Cambodia key lesson rom DFID and Asia Foundation support to three mobile apps which aim to end violence against women is that apps often have hidden costs requiring investments to maintain complex backend systems and websites It is therefore important to fully understand from the outset the process and the time cost requirements involved as well as whether any other imilar digital platforms exist which could be adapted Costing studies of soap opera approaches have calculated low unit costs due to the large number of people reached For example South Africas Soul City soap opera cost US per person reached by television US per person reached by print media and US per person reached by radio in These low costs were largely due to the massive reach of the programme Soul City the series on violence against women reached of the population in South Africa However data on unit costs should be used with caution as other approaches may have more evidence of effectiveness Evidence reviews have concluded that although edutai nment approaches may have lower unit costs per beneficiary they are not necessarily more cost effective than more intensive activities such as community mobilisation eg ASA in Uganda Fulu et al Sustainability and scale up Schools and educational institutions provide entry points to scale up programming for young people as well as offline discussions For example in Brazil Promundo began collaborating with the Education Secretariats and schools in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Bah ia to adapt and integrate Entre Ns Between Us radio soap opera into the public education sector Similarly in China the Man campaign united more than students across top universities campuses in Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Hunan in both digital and virtual activities In Viet Nam the Department of Education supported Love Journey activities in schools There are several examples of promising practice in partnering with private sector organisations to leverage distribution networks nd expertise in social marketing branding and communications For example in Ethiopia Girl Effect partnered with the leading water company Ambo Mineral Water to further publicise the Yegna brand Ambo Water printed the Yegna logo and programme schedule of the Yegna radio show on the stickers of five million bottles as well as on Ambo trucks Distribution of the bottles was mainly targeted at girls in For example VCs unit costs of social media reach was per person reached by social media decreasing to but then However other parts of the programme came down consistently for example the physical safe space costs Armitage and Hughes Must Boi encouraged young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it The campaign specifically targeted mainly urban middle class youth aged and consciously aimed to work more with young men The three apps are Krousar Koumrou animated features and sharable quiz which aims to change negative attitudes and be an educational tool to increase knowledge to end domestic violence Safe Agent personal network notification app for users to be able to discreetly and quickly contact up to trusted family and friends if they feel unsafe and Plus to help food and service sector workers feel confident and able to claim their rights to be free from harassment and violence in th workplace rural areas of Amhara region where the Ye gna marketing director noted that Ambo reaches everywhere in the country and this creates an opportunity for us to connect to the inner society that we could not reach only through receiving set and television Partnering with Ambo means that we can leverage the ir extensive distribution network to increase awareness of Yegna and drive more listeners to the show In Brazil Promundo partnered with SSL International to design new brand of Durex condom that spoke for and to young people Promundos peer educat ors young men recruited from the community developed the Hora condom which translates as in the heat of the moment after young men reported hearing their peers saying Everyone knows you shouldnt hit your girlfriend but in the heat of the momen you lose control Ruxton Evidence suggests that programmes that partner with local organisations and build capacity are the most sustainable For example in Nepal the VOICES project combined an innovative Samajhdari Mutual Understanding radio programme with comprehensive community outreach initiative that provided legal literacy training formed listener and dialogue groups and trained women leaders as community reporters and community leaders Local radio stations and organisations also benefitted from enhanced professionalism on talking about violence against women An impact assessment of the programme noted that the sustainability of radiodigital technology is improved by offline activities such as outreach and training in communiti es Although the program has now ended these organisations and media reporters will continue to play crucial role in reporting and preventing violence Equal Access

terminology differs across researchers and practitioners and inconsistent ways of operationalising and measuring CSAM make comparison across studies difficult This has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation and is the case with online CSAM Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by the volume of online content in the open and also hidden Internet and the reality that content may be removed but not destroyed Criminal justice data from public records as well as research surveys would suggest an increase over time in the number of CSAM crimes Youthproduced images pose problem for law enforcement in terms of resource demands alongside their ability to determine the age of the child and whether they have been produced as part of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent behaviour that is consistent with adolescent development and risktaking Mapping of existing national and international CSAM databases would suggest that they fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections While there are number of databases globally there is limited connectivity between them Differences in how data is defined and recorded means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions as to whether there have been changes in the gender age and level of violence within recorded CSAM However there is some converging evidence that the percentage of egregious images has increased over time Across three studies younger victims are associated with greater levels of sexual violence produced within family context and more likely to be widely distributed However the preponderance of images are of pubescent and prepubescent children and the numbers of images of very young children infants and toddlers remain relatively low This is in contrast to the views of experts interviewed in the current study The majority of victims and offenders are white Caucasians and while there has been an increase in other ethnic groups these numbers remain disproportionately small This does require further investigation given the increasing availability of Internet connectivity through handheld devices across handheld devices and the concerns expressed about for example live streaming of abuse TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALDefinitions of what constitutes onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation are both varied and subject to change and as noted by recent study the terms used in research are often different from those used for legally defined crimes which also differ between and on occasions within countries Differing terminology wee wee comparison across studies difficult and this is reflected in the decision by ECPAT International to work with other stakeholders to develop terminology guidelines as absence of consensus about the terms used has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation These forms may include the production dissemination and possession of child sexual abuse material CSAM which are known in many jurisdictions as child pornography online grooming or active sexual solicitation of children sexting sexual extortion of children also known as sextortion revenge pornography exploitation of children through online prostitution and live streaming of sexual abuse We can also make distinction between cyberenabled and cyber dependent crime for example CSAM would fall into the first category whereas live streaming of sexual abuse would be in the latter as it is only possible because of the technology It would be true to say that onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation has been seen as both public health and criminal justice problem There is perception that with each new technological advancement law enforcement researchers and advocates Dr Wager Nadia et al Rapid Evidence Assessment

the multifaceted nature of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation there are significant gaps in the way these crimes are understood In her December report to the Human Rights Council the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children called on States to conduct research in order to obtain comprehensive picture of the phenomena and to establish reliable and standard information on the phenomena The same month taking place in London the WePROTECT Children Online Global Summit that was convened by the government of the United Kingdom clearly highlighted the need for development of indicators and further collection of data Global indicators and standards in data collection would provide clear language and metrics for law enforcement researchers and advocates to communicate more effectively about the phenomena Currently there is growing body of data which show evidence of emerging trends in several key areas of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation However the preponderance of empirical studies has taken place within high income countries and outside of the research from the Crimes Against Children Research Center there is paucity of longitudinal data to help us understand changing patterns of offending and victimisation in this area To date bids to quantify the scale of onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation have counted the number INTRODUCTIONTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALof identified offenders or suspects as well as young people who have engaged in harmful sexual behaviour identified victims reported offences including public reports as well as crime statistics and the number of confirmed CSAM images and videos By far the greatest number of publications identified in Wagner et als rapid evidence review related to selfreport victimisation studies THE AMOUNT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL The focus of this report is CSAM and questions about how much of it exists and whether there are changing patterns in the amount of new material being identified globally In absolute terms we can never quantify the amount of material that has been created or is in circulation on the Internet because new content is constantly being added and only proportion of older content some of which predates the Internet but has been scanned and uploaded will have been identified and taken down Even with the use of custommade web crawlers to aid notice and takedown of CSAM there is no guarantee that it will not be uploaded again However common metrics to assess CSAM include reports from hotlines eg the absolute number of reported cases analysts have determined to contain illegal content over period of time and criminal justice records eg how many individuals have been arrested for possessing CSAM both methods have their limitations Anecdotally it is understood that material is traded across multiple platforms and that the volume of material outstrips the resources available to law enforcement and hotline analysts to fully investigate or analyse So understandably the number of arrests and reports can never accurately represent the actual amount of CSAM in circulation at any given time Additionally parsing out what method or terminology to use when measuring the amount of identified CSAM is difficult Material could be examined by the number of children victimised in series of images or case the absolute number of images in collection or the number of offenders responsible for series of images either Ibid Keisanen Laura and VaaranenValkonen Nina

perpetrating the behaviour producing the content or distributing the material An added complication is the number of unidentified offenders and victims There are many offenders and images that will remain undetected by law enforcement or hotline analysts These offenders are not missed only because law enforcement may have limited capacity to investigate them but rather because they may use techniques to encrypt or anonymise their activities or as with the case of new commercial websites payment is only accepted by digital payment systems such as Bitcoin as an emergent trend to avoid detection by offenders Other limitations to gauging the amount of CSAM from these common metrics are the biases in the protocols and laws governing different jurisdictions For example some countries limit how proactive law enforcement agents can be in their investigations requiring them to wait until material is reported to their departments before they can begin an investigation Other countries have introduced legislation that allows law enforcement and hotline analysts to review areas of the Internet that are considered popular trading platforms ie forums on the dark net Some evidence has documented that the amount of arrests or reports stemming from the latter method of investigation has made significant difference in the number of offenders detected PUBLIC REPORTS Using the number of reports made by the public within given time period to hotlines hotline is national online resource that offers members of the public to report what they perceive as illegal online content as metric for the amount of CSAM in circulation would suggest an incremental growth in these crimes over the total period that data has been collected However Donosa argues for caution when interpreting the number of public reports as evidence of an increase in the amount of CSAM An increase in reporting may be due to other factors such as an improvement in rates of detection because of technological tools or because there has been an increase in human resources TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALavailable to manage it It may also be the case that in some countries there is growing awareness of the problem and willingness to report suspected CSAM She concludes that because of the nature of the content being dealt with and the impossibility of most hotlines to collect data directly from the source it is difficult to draw firm conclusions As long as we are unclear how much child sexual abuse material is being produced distributed and consumed out there we will not be able to know for sure whether the problem has worsened or not There are therefore caveats on how we should interpret public reporting of content not the least because in in addition to receiving reports of online CSAM of hotlines in also accepted other types of reports which included for example racismhate speech adult pornography bullying and selfharmsuicide However in this global study of hotlines approximately onethird of those surveyed indicated that CSAM reports made up the majority of their workload The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC serves as the United States of Americas clearing house for CSAM through the CyberTipline This provides an online mechanism for members of the public and electronic service providers ESPs to report incidents of suspected child sexual exploitation This includes CSAM sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism online enticement trafficking of children for sexual purposes child sexual molestation misleading domain names or words and unsolicited obscene material sent to child In the report to the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee in March it was noted that over recent years the volume of CyberTipline reports received by NCMEC had increased from over million reports in to more than million reports in to more than million reports in By the time of the report in NCMEC had already

The most substantial data set comes from the US longitudinal National Juvenile Online Victimisation NJOV study This arrest study collected data in and These studies included two phases of data collection TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALa postal survey of state county and local law enforcement agencies in the US of arrests made for technologyfacilitated sexual crimes against children over specified period of time and telephone interviews concerning cases identified in the survey There was substantial increase in the number of arrests from in to in and in although this may not indicate an actual increase as there was an overlap in the estimated ranges at the confidence interval Approximately half of the arrests were for possession of CSAM defined as child pornography in the study Arrests for crimes where the victim was known to the police through CSAM production increased by approximately between and and doubled between and This reflected large increase in offenders who were known to their victims and described in the study as family and acquaintance offenders Arrests that were made through proactive policing police posing as children online went down in although arrests for proactive investigation of CSAM offences increased in compared to in The majority of people arrested in each wave of the study were male white Caucasians although by higher proportion arrests were members of minority ethnic groups The increase in arrests for the production of child sexual abuse materials appeared to be largely driven by youthproduced sexual images which were taken by children years or under and which met the legal definitions in the US for child pornography In most of these cases the person arrested was an adult who had solicited images from minor This was also reflected in the fact that there were more adolescent victims in and ones where they were facetoface acquaintances with the person arrested Adultproduced images were more likely than the images produced by adolescents to be taken by family member as opposed to who was aged or older with victims younger than years Adult producers were likely to possess additional CSAM which had been downloaded from the Internet and to be discovered through law enforcement activity One quarter of the adults producing images distributed them Wolak Janis Finkelhor David and Mitchell Kimberly Trends

adolescents who had taken pictures of themselves and sent them to others over half by mobile phones In the majority of the victims of CSAM production were aged and overall more than half of the producers arrested had committed contact sexual offence documented in the images taken This data is now quite old and there is paucity of comparable offence data outside the US as many countries do not have the resources to research this area or do not disaggregate their sexual offence data In the UK it was reported that the number of offenders convicted of taking making or distributing child abuse images increased by from in to in with offences reported in for possession The Rapid Evidence assessment by Wagner also notes that in the UK the number of obscene publication offences which includes recorded offences for creating possessing or distributing CSAM has doubled across the UK between and and that these increases have been attributed to an increase in the creation or distribution of indecent or pseudophotographs of adults and children using Internet and mobile technology However others have argued that these increases may be due to more targeted and coordinated activity by the UK National Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies Earlier threat assessment reports by NCACEOP Command noted changing patterns in the types of victimisation within seized images increases in the egregiousness of the sexual assaults and the ages of the children becoming younger and involving more females However these studies provide limited information as to the methodology involved in these estimates Police data from the Netherlands was used to examine the attributes of seized CSAM and the characteristics of arrested offenders Their data was TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALdrawn from police files involving suspects investigated in The majority of their suspects had only one victim and where there were cases of multiple suspects these did not appear to be part of organised criminal networks Over of the suspects were male and ranged from years of age but were under Often these were young people who had taken sexualised pictures andor videos of themselves andor each other However it has to be acknowledged that these were largely samples of convenience and are likely to represent only proportion of those involved in CSAM PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ABUSIVE IMAGES US study of arrests for CSAM production at two timepoints and indicated an increase in adolescent victims but no increase in the proportion involving very young victims Many of the cases involved selfproduced sexual images by adolescents and involving adult sex offenders third sample indicated that arrests for CSAM production quadrupled between which was attributed to cases of selfproduced sexual images solicited from minors by adult offenders However of note is that in most youthproduced images were distributed usually by youth who took pictures of themselves and sent them to others Images were uploaded to the Internet in approximately in cases Although there has been an increase in the amount of CSAM produced by adolescents in the context of coercive relationships the NJOV survey indicated that most CSAM was still produced by adult offenders Adults either created images of minors themselves or enticed minors to produce images Adult produced images were more likely to be perpetrated by family member have victims younger than years of age be perpetrated by offenders aged or older and who also possessed CSAM images Leukfeldt Jansen and Stol Child

that the authors concluded that increases in arrests were related to high levels of lawenforcement activity by agencies trained to respond to technologyfacilitated crimes The introduction of technological landmarks such as the Internet digital cameras and smart phones over the past two decades has radically altered the way offenders sexually exploit children Currently researchers have looked at the difference between offenders using active realtime platforms ie live streaming and webcams to transmit material versus those who use passive platforms ie Torrents to distribute CSAM The complexities around determining the amount of CSAM that exists can be explored through image production through commercial exploitation An example of live streaming of child sexual abuse for payment is provided by Terre des Hommes Netherlands who conducted research in nineteen Englishlanguage public chat rooms where four researchers posed as prepubescent Filipino girls The researchers then waited for people to make contact and request webcam sex performance Contacts were reminded that they were interacting with pre pubescent child If they continued to request sex show researchers began working to identify them During the weeks observation offenders attempted to engage in live streaming of sexual abuse systematic study of US Internetfacilitated sexual exploitation was examined through data from arrests in Offenders either used the Internet to purchase or sell access to identified children for sexual purposes including CSAM production or used the Internet to purchase or sell images they possessed but did not produce qualitative study of Swedish youth commercially exploited online indicated that this included the purchase of CSAM ranging from seminude pictures to livestreaming TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALCHARACTERISTICS OF OFFENDERS It has been consistently noted across studies that CSAM offenders represent heterogeneous group who display wide variation in their sexual preoccupation with CSAM and their motivation to offend In relation to this it has been observed that fundamental problem with prevention policy in the criminal justice system is that it is largely based on stereotypical and often mistaken characterisation of sex offender populations for example the common view of them as exclusively adult males who have sexual orientation towards prepubescent children paedophiles and who are strongly motivated to offend While the majority of offenderrelated research has used samples of people convicted of technologymediated abuse and exploitation there have been few studies drawn from general population samples as well as people who were seeking help For example an online survey of German men found that reported sexual fantasies involving prepubescent children reported sexual offending against prepubescent children and reported pedophilic sexual preference Men who reported exclusive use of CSAM were identified as subgroup who differed from contact sexual offenders against prepubescent children and men who reported both CSAM use and contact sexual offenses against prepubescent children further US study recruited females and males through an online survey to examine sexual interest and adverse childhood experiences Six per cent of men indicated some likelihood of having sex with child if they could get away with it as did

risk of CSAM offender either having prior history of contact offending or whether they will go on to commit further contact offence Two significant studies in relation to risk come from Canada with the development of the Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool CPORT and the UK KIRAT Kent Internet Risk Assessment Tool THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF ABUSIVE IMAGES One area that has been standardised is the terminology used to grade the sexual activity depicted in CSAM An example of this would be the COPINE scale developed by Quayle and colleagues that sorts sexual activity into ten categories This scale was later adapted to point scale to grade images by the Sentencing Advisory Panel However the scale has not been incorporated into many law enforcement and hotline databases and instead is used more for prosecution and academic purposes Researchers have coded samples of images and reported trends within specific databases over given timeframe but there has yet to be global effort to code and report trends in sexual activity TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWhile anecdotally law enforcement and hotline analysts have expressed concern over sexual content of the material becoming more aggressive and the proportion of violent material increasing there is little consistent empirical evidence Though reporting the sexual activity in CSAM may appear straightforward given cases could involve multiple victims as well as multiple offenders there are tensions around what exactly is recorded Some victims may experience different levels of abuse or violence Likewise not every image or video may contain the same level of sexual activity Additionally when reporting trends it is not always clear whether only new material during timeframe will be used to generate estimates on the amount of violence or all the material seen circulating during the timeframe For instance if there is greater market for violent imagery law enforcement may find that offenders are recirculating older material that is extremely violent which would be missed if only new material was used to examine trends CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTIMS While there is extensive research on offenders very little is known about the children depicted in sexually abusive material especially in the global landscape To date much of the research has involved identified victims within law enforcement databases which may not be representative of the general population of children who are sexually exploited online particularly as limited number of countries are compiling databases of CSAM and where they do exist these tend to be from the global north We also have very little evidence to help us differentiate between identified and nonidentified children who have been abused in the production or exchange of CSAM Studies of the databases that do exist suggest there are more female victims than males significantly more white than non white victims and that most children featured in material are prepubescent CSAM can however be produced across different contexts which as previously discussed may reflect changes in our relatively recent ability to create digital content study of Swedish

IWF Operational trends Overviewthat of those who reported sexual abuse had also experienced the abuse being documented in pictures or videos In an early study by the same researcher children identified in seized CSAM were interviewed and their images analysed All of these were taken during acts of sexual abuse by the perpetrators who in some cases had also distributed the CSAM No images were produced by the children further study from Turkey examined the medical records of sexual abuse victims referred through the courts to Child and Adolescent clinic Ninetythree reported at least one of the following onlineoffline sexual acts through email cell phones text messages and Internet sites an image of the victim of sexual nature or of the sexual abuse itself recorded on mobile phonecamera with threats of distribution if she did not continue sexual acts the image shared onlineoffline and the victim subjected to online harassment or offline sexual abuse by other offenders that knew about the image For these children digital technology was significantly associated with more severe forms of abuse such as penetrative sex recurrent sexual abuse and multiple offenders This victimfocused research reflects evidence also seen in offender studies of the production and use of CSAM images as part of the offence process By the end of the International Child Sexual Exploitation Database ICSE DB included data on more than identified victims from nearly countries but still little was known about these children ChildBase is database developed by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre CEOP and consisted of CSAM images gathered from police seizures across the United Kingdom In randomised sample of unique sexualised images of children from the database approximately it was found that the images contained four times more girls than boys and almost times more white than nonwhite children The UK Internet Watch Foundation reported that after analysing all child sexual abuse URLs in of all the children were years or younger The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image Database ICSE DB contains important information about TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALchild abuse image crimes recent study quantified the characteristics of children in identified illegal images from the UK claimed cases from the database and described the differences between cases of selftaken images and those whose images had been taken by others The analysis showed an increase in identified victims during the study years Almost two thirds of the children identified were female the majority were white and were selftaken taken in coercive and in noncoercive relationship The data also indicated that since the number of self taken images each year exceeded more than of the total number of images in the database Although selftaken images could potentially be perceived as less worrisome twothirds of all the images within this study were classified as coercive However the yearly reports of organisations such as the Internet Watch Foundation would suggest that there are fluctuations in the characteristics of the children depicted in CSAM In the IWF reported that material involving prepubescent children made up smaller fraction of all reports than was seen in with pubescent victims increasing however the amount of material involving children two years old or younger remained constant over the same fouryear span about By the IWF had seen further overall drop in the children assessed as being or younger and an increase in reports of children This proportionate drop was felt in part to be related to the increase in selfproduced content which had been shared online alongside of the fact that the IWF also actively searches for images which exceeded public reports in and therefore were more likely to encounter more images of year olds In their report there were also fewer images falling into categories penetrative sexual activity or nonpenetrative activity in either or Differences were also seen between data from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in which showed that of child victims were under the age of eight years old when compared with the ChildBase study which showed relatively low numbers of very young victims only of females and of males were infanttoddlers Quayle Jonsson Cooper

UNIDENTIFIEDVICTIMSINCHILDSEXUALEXPLOITATIONMATERIALpdf further study examined two different datasets from the NCMEC database of identified children This included actively traded cases cases involving victims which were seen in or more reports to NCMEC from and identified child victims cases including one offender and one victim and cases involving multiple offendersvictims from July June whether traded or not The most notable finding from the first dataset was trend towards more egregious sexual content over time more abusive sexual content in later years but with no obvious trends in relation to child victim age or gender In the second dat set involving single offender and victim cases that were actively traded involved prepubescent victims more egregious sexual content and more likely to involve familial offenders particularly nuclear family members However in the second dataset of cases of cases involving single victims and where there were multiple relationships the children were pubescent Most cases involved male offenders who were unrelated to the child but cases that involved female offenders younger children or more extreme content were likely to involve family members In further analysis of the ICSE database of unidentified victims conducted by ECPAT International and Interpol were girls were boys and the remaining included children of both genders Where boys were depicted the content was more egregious Within this dataset of the children were white and where age could be determined the largest group were prepubescent Similar to the NCMEC analysis there was also relationship between the age of the victim and the severity of the abuse Across the three studies NCMEC ICSE UK and ECPATInterpol very young children were in the minority and

traded cases between the number of infants victimised varied between years but the lowest value related to TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALOBJECTIVE The objective of this report was to speak with experts in this field to uncover why trends in the data may be occurring We were particularly interested in experts opinions on trends in the age of victims of online child sexual exploitation OCSE and the severity of the sexual activity being depicted in CSAM Furthermore we intended to explore national databases in order to contribute to establishing standards and global metrics of CSAM to promote evidencebased advocacy and programming We wished to document the interaction between key variables amount of material the production and distribution of material offender characteristics the sexual content of material and victim characteristics MAPPING EXISTING DATABASES Collections of data that relate to CSAM fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections The hashing process is mathematical algorithm that produces hexadecimal numeric value relating to binary data hash value is small convenient number used to track or sort an arbitrary block of data Each image file hash value is represented by unique string of characters effectively without visible order sequence or connection to the actual file name or content of the image According to Microsoft data can be compared to hash value to determine its integrity Usually data is hashed at certain time and the hash value is protected in some way At later time the data can be hashed again and compared to the protected value If the hash values match the data has not be altered If the values do not match the data has been corrupted For this system to work the protected hash must be encrypted or kept secret from all untrusted parties However it is also important to distinguish between image databases and image libraries The former is fully searchable and contains associated metadata related to cases within data such as hash sets that can be exported and shared with others An image library is more akin to flat filefolder structure where material may be grouped together on case by case basis but crosscomparison of the data is not really possible and there are significant limits to what can be exported from it There are Quayle and Jones Sexualized images of children on

Identification Manages Queesland Police Ibid Project VIC is coaltion of law enforcement and private sector partners providing solutions to realworld challenges It champions transformation in the approach to child exploitation investigations by developing innovative technologies and victimcentric methodologies See Griffiths personal communication Victim Identification Manages Queesland Policea number of international national and regional organisations that have image databases andor databases and number of other organisations maintain permanently or over period of time image libraries For instance this may be the case with number of national hotlines as well as some smaller police agencies around the world or those who are just starting victim identification unit Other organisations maintain their own hash sets which may facilitate workload management in terms of recognising material that has already been seen so that it can either be discounted from the victim identification process or that it can be precategorised for the court process because it has already been categorised previously for example through determining the age of the child or the nature of the image content At present there is limited connectivity between databases At an international level as referred previously INTERPOL houses and maintains the ICSE Database and also the ICCAM database on behalf of INHOPE EUROPOL hosts and maintains IVAS Investigation Video and Audio System which is database of material generally seized by law enforcement agencies in EU member states or countries with third party agreements with EUROPOL eg Australia Canada or the USA or seized as result of joint investigations in these countries Project Vic maintains hash and associated metadata database for material seized and held in the US and administers rules of engagement for the various Project Vic members around the world Law Enforcement Agencies NonGovernment Organisations Industry etc While there is no international hash database provided by Project Vic international collaboration may take place under the auspices of Project Vic but this currently take place on bilateral basis The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children acts as the clearing house for seized material from federal and local law enforcement agencies in the USA and in doing so contributes to both NGO and Industry hashsharing platforms which extend beyond the USA into International organisations At national level of the countries currently connected to ICSE the following maintain databases of seized material Australia the Australian Police and the Queensland Police Service both have TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALseparate databases and there is project in place to provide national solution giving direct access to all states and territories Belgium Canada the Royal Canadian Mounted Police maintain national database which has limited functionality from the various provincial and

Zealand Sweden United Kingdom UK Child Abuse Images Database CAID United States Homeland Ibid Howard personal communication Network Services Training Manager INHOPESecurity Investigations and the Federal Bureau of Investigation also have their own collections as do other agencies such as the US Postal Service and the Department of Justice It is likely that there are other image libraries in Austria Finland Ireland Israel Italy Japan Moldova Norway Spain and Switzerland used as an aid to victim identification An example of hash database is provided by INHOPE an international network of hotlines as described below BOX INHOPE and the ICCAM system INHOPE is the global umbrella organisation uniting national Internet hotlines engaged in combating online child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material The mission of INHOPE is to support and enhance the work of these hotlines to strengthen international efforts to combat child sexual abuse using multi stakeholder approach The network consists of hotlines in countries worldwide When members of the public come across child sexual abuse material on the Internet they can anonymously report the suspected illegal content to the hotline in their country The aim of the INHOPE Hotline Network is to streamline processes for reporting illegal online content when it involves the sexual abuse or exploitation of child Hotlines often encourage reporting even for suspected exploitation such as child modelling INHOPE In INHOPE with the support and funding from the European Commission developed and launched the ICCAM ISee cChildAbuseMaterial system initially as pilot project and ultimately was rolled out to the full INHOPE network The Hotlines receive reports from the public on potentially illegal content These reports that contain URL pointing at the content are entered in the ICCAM system Crawling and assessment ICCAM crawls the URL and downloads images and video to centralised infrastructure based in INTERPOL The system then allows the Hotline analyst via browser to remotely classify the content under predetermined criteria eg baseline and national Once the content has been confirmed as child sexual abuse material the relevant elements of the report are forwarded to the INHOPE Hotline in that country Hashing technology As part of this hashing technology is deployed to fingerprint reported images and video which allows for more rapid action in the work flow and automatic flagging of new confirmed CSAM content that has not been reported to or seen by law enforcement previously New confirmed CSAM content is automatically flagged to law enforcement victim identification team in INTERPOL This also minimises duplication of effort as analyst can see what has already been assessed as illegal baseline or national even if the content reported was totally separate report to another Hotline at any point in the past All of these elements speed up report handling plus reduce the amount of traumatic CSAM material that Hotline analysts must view simple reflection of these factors is the Notice Takedown statistic which has improved dramatically to where of confirmed CSAM reports were removed from the Internet within hours INHOPE Annual Report Data ICCAM has the ability to gather almost realtime global data on the trends and statistics on the dissemination of online CSAM and the consequential actions by hotlines eg notice and takedown times This allows for periodbyperiod comparison and analysis TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALAn example of an image database is provided below BOX Interpol ICSE Database The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image database ICSE database It was launched in March as the successor to the Interpol Child Abuse Image Database ICAID which had been in use since To meet the challenges of technological change the ICSEDB has been updated on several occasions and version four of the database is currently under development through financial support from the European Commission to enhance connectivity with national child abuse material databases ICSEDB is the only global platform of its kind which enables specialist lawenforcement officers to use image and video comparison software to identify victims abusers and locations through an analysis of images videos and hashes The ICSE Database is available through INTERPOLs secure global police communications system and certified users in member countries can access the database directly and in real time providing immediate responses to queries related to child sexual exploitation investigations This both facilitates the identification of children but also manages potential duplication of efforts that would occur if multiple law enforcement agencies were attempting to identify the same victim or victims Countries seeking access to the database need to demonstrate the existence of national legislation in relation to child sexual abuse material CSAM specialist national victim identification unit and sufficient connectivity to support the use of the database This database is managed by Interpol and provides powerful intelligence and investigative tool that allows specialised investigators to share information with colleagues on global basis The information in the database relates to children identified through image analysis and specialist and routine policing whose images meet the criteria for indecency across most jurisdictions see Gillespie as well as indicative material that may not meet these criteria but may be valuable source of intelligence In the ICSE DB included data on identified victims from more than countries as well as data related to numerous unidentified victims whose cases are yet to be investigated areasCrimesagainstchildrenVictim identification By January Interpol reported that the network of countries had identified sexual abuse victims in the last seven years NewsandmediaNewsN Images or videos that are uploaded to the ICSEDB are verified as to whether they are already known to the system or whether the child or children within the media or the suspect or offender is already known to the system These constitute known cases As can be seen from the previous section on public reports number of the hotlines provide yearly information on public reports and proactive searching brief overview of this data from the IWF CyberTipline and Cybertipca is presented here IWF In reports were received which were assessed as criminal content from total of reports representing decrease from Age profiles of children suggested an increase in selfproduced content with public reports more likely to be of children years old and under The IWF classification of the images indicated that nearly half of children under years of age were in either Category or the two most egregious categories although this represented decline from previous years Their report indicated an increase in the number of domains hosting CSAM and of these of all webpages that contained CSAM were concentrated across five domains com net se io and cc Social networks were the least likely to contain CSAM and image hosting sites the most consistent for hosting CSAM saw Europe hosting more identified pages containing CSAM than any other region representing increase for The top five countries hosting CSAM URLs were the Netherlands the US Canada France and Russia There was decline in the number of newly identified hidden services and large decrease in the number of web pages deemed to be commercial CyberTipline This is USbased service and is hosted by NCMEC Their data showed an increase of between to in reports alleged child sexual exploitation or sexual extortion with sexual extortion reports being made between October to April The majority of these reports came from Internet companies but came from child victims TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALCybertipca This is operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection Between the hotline responded to over CSE reports from the public with arrests Data from their Survivors Survey of adults indicated that all had been subjected to child sexual abuse and videorecorded of those responding to the online survey felt that it was likely their images had been distributed The primary perpetrators were family members or part of the extended family said they were under years when the abuse started and for the abuse lasted over ten years Over the last years over reports had been received by cybertipca with over forwarded to Canadian law enforcement agency Bunzeluk Child Sexual Abuse Images An Analysis of Websites by cybertipca Winnipeg Canadian Centre for Child Protection accessed January novemberhtml INHOPE Foundation In URLs were reported to this global network of hotlines which was increase from In most CSAM was identified on image hosting sites websites file hosting sites social networking sites and banner sites Ninetyone per cent of images were hosted for noncommercial purposes The INHOPE report indicated that the network received reports with confirmed as CSAM and suggested that the majority of CSAM encountered by hotlines depicted predominantly prepubescent females TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE There have long been calls for global metrics for CSAM but these are very difficult to establish given the complexity of these crimes Specifically global metrics would aid in evidencebased advocacy and programming Research continues to be limited by lack of standards size of sample or generalizability of findings For range of reasons most research and analysis of CSAM has previously focused on single databases or even subsets of images from within database However as technology rapidly advances CSAM is more and more becoming globalised concern and the need for bigger picture analysis is strong This study therefore aimed to frame the analysis of CSAM trends in much more global perspective The design therefore was to broaden our net as much as possible for global perspective We aimed to gather detailed perspectives from sample of CSAM experts from all over the world We sought to establish and understand trends in victim offender and content characteristics over time We sought also to examine the trends identified in our qualitative data with preliminary analysis of complementary quantitative data from multiple sources wherever we could QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS Semistructured expert interviews with the primary objective of investigating perceived trends in the age of victims and the severity of the sexual activity in CSAM formed the basis of this study An interview guide was developed that covered breadth of topics thought to impact OCSE Appendix The interview guide covered victim profiles common characteristics of CSAM offender profiles changes in the sexual content of CSAM changes in production and distribution methods and questions about how policy and practice around online sexual exploitation could be improved We chose these topic areas given their relevance to developing global metrics as well as their potential to identify both the age of victims and the sexual activity in the material We wished to explore whether there were Bryant Antony and Charmaz Kathy Eds The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory Los Angeles Sage accessed February changes in the ages of the children or the severity of sexual activity as evidenced in CSAM We interviewed law enforcement agents and hotline analysts who had at least one year of current experience working with CSAM since they would be able to speak to current incidents and recent changes This population was also selected because they would be familiar with material involving both undetected and detected offenders as well as unidentified and identified victims Respondents were recruited with invitations and flyers that were distributed to key stakeholders and organizations Once participants were recruited and screened for eligibility they were consented into the study Studies were primarily conducted in English with small portion being conducted in Spanish While it was requirement that the participants fluently speak English or Spanish it was often not the participants primary language Two participants used professional translators to participate in the study Interview extracts from all the participants have been edited with brackets for readability The research team was composed of Research Leader and Research Assistant Both team members had Masters degrees in public health or health sciences and several years of research experience Both team members had conducted national and international research on the prevention of child sexual abuse and were knowledgeable in OCSE They both were certified in ethical human subject research and had previous training in qualitative interviewing transcription and analyses The Research Assistant had professional qualifications in Spanish language skills and had conducted previous interviews in Spanish Interviews were analysed using the grounded theory method The team members were trained to conduct semistructured interviews following the interview guide Appendix Interviewers walked the participant through series of discussion topics related to the study goals and objectives but had flexibility to probe further on topics in which the participant was particularly knowledgeable Interviews took approximately thirty minutes to one TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALhour Following the interview audio files were transcribed In the case of Spanish interviews transcripts were also translated Two initial transcripts were coded line by line and then line codes were compiled into codebook After the codebook was developed three transcripts were double coded to check for consistency and understanding in applying codes Codes were then applied to the remaining transcripts These codes were analysed and organised to identify emergent themes total of qualitative interviews were conducted Participants were from EUROPOL and INTERPOL as well as hotlines and agencies in Australia Colombia Finland France Mexico New Zealand the United Kingdom Slovenia Spain South Africa and Taiwan COMPLEMENTARY QUANTITATIVE DATA Our search for such quantitative data encountered some expected barriers Many agencies around the world simply lack the resources to generate and maintain complex databases and where they do data provides particular picture based on local priorities Where databases do exist access is usually closely limited for obvious and justified reasons Comparisons between these sources can also be complicated given it is collected along procedural rather than research priorities See eg NetClean important insights into child sexual abuse crime the NetClean report Invitations and flyers were initially distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe requesting data on CSAM This recruitment method failed to yield significant data The team then instead asked law enforcement and hotline analysts who participated in the qualitative portion of the study to provide quantitative data Four agencies agreed to supply data for the project These agencies varied greatly in the type of data they shared See Appendix for added detail of what was supplied by the four agencies Cautions on the reliability of existing CSAM databases being used to draw conclusions about trends have been noted previously The quantitative data that we were able to collect for this study therefore doesnt allow for representative conclusions However it is presented throughout the results section in parallel to the trends identified by the experts in the qualitative dataTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL RESULTS Qualitative interviews with experts from around the globe were used to discuss trends in OCSE specifically interviews were focused on trends in the age of victims of OCSE and the severity of the sexual activity being depicted in CSAM To fully understand how and why these changes were taking place the qualitative interview guide sought to develop framework around participants background and experience working with CSAM characterise the typical victim depicted in material discuss changes in the sexual content production and distribution methods of material and review current policy and practice methods that could be improved or built upon Below each component is further explored UNDERSTANDING WHO PARTICIPATED Participants were law enforcement agents and hotline analysts who had at least year of experience working with child sexual abuse material however most of the participants had served their departments considerably longer with the upper limit being approximately years of service Participants described their roles as incredibly demanding with many taking on far more responsibilities than merely investigating or analysing material They often worked with small teams of individuals and felt their departments were underfunded or in need of additional staff The individuals spoke to the variety of activities they performed including analysing material investigating perpetrators identifying victims coding material and educating the public Below one investigator describes the educational aspect of his position in my department we are also responsible for going out to provide public education where we are warning the public about the dangers of cyber space clearly emphasising the issue of distribution of child pornography creation of child pornography and also production Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths The NetClean Report Similar demands on law enforcement were noted in NetCleans qualitative study with one of their eleven truths being supported by the fact that of police say identifying victims is not prioritized in their organization and say they have too much material to go through to have time to work on identifying victims Being responsible for so many different aspects of the investigation greatly affected what participants could accomplish We asked our participants about their current caseload and they ranged widely in how many cases they investigated the past year Some participants reported their teams focused on very small number of cases while others had the resources to analyse hundreds of reports We discussed whether the current caseload was similar or different than previous years and most agreed they were receiving more material but were not always able to investigate more cases They felt that advances in technology and changes in reporting procedures had led to their agencies receiving more reports or uncovering more imagery than they had previously As one hotline analyst described suppose the workload increases because we do lot of work where we will work with our local police forces who may come to us for advice and assistance As weve become more established team and people know who we are and the mechanisms are in place for people to make referrals we see an increase in the work because more people want to come and ask for our help basically While an increase in reports seems like good thing given the apparent increase in material being circulated participants felt they could not keep up with the demand Consistently lack of funding prevented law enforcement from investigating the additional reports TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALThe amount of referrals that are coming in are increasing From an output capability point of view because our resources havent increased we havent been able to increase the number of investigations that weve done which are tied to the level of resources that we have If we had more staff we would have greater output As said certainly the number of cases that have been through to us has increased over the last three or four years Some participants described hierarchies their agencies had in place for prioritising cases Investigators discussed new material and younger children as the main reasons to prioritise case It is important to note that some participants did not prioritise any case over another since they felt any material featuring subject who was under the age of eighteen necessitated an investigation The following quote gives an example of the investigative hierarchies that one team leader used We look at variety of factors We look at for example any new material so if theres content that we havent seen before where theres potential for abuse taking place we look at the severity of the material we look at the number and unity of subject matter If somebodys presenting initially from intelligence as clear established boy lover for example into very young children into babies that kind of thing those sorts of elements get prioritised Acting in distribution capacity that would get priority over position element The lifelong extent and length of offending type of material those would be the main priority And ultimately if we identified that the username has been seen before or the person have been seen as previous offender or had previous criminal behaviour we would look to prioritise it as wellPrioritising cases only makes sense if there are victims or offenders that pose greater risks to community safety However the interaction between these variables has not been welldocumented or standardised Clearly this department saw benefit in prioritising cases based on hierarchy but that was not always the case Understanding risk profiles or the interaction between variables such as victim age the newness of the material or the distribution method used and their potential to lead to an arrest or identified victim would help establish best practice CHARACTERISING THE TYPICAL VICTIM Every participant agreed that victims were predominantly white Some participants reported they handled small number of cases involving Asian and Hispanic children as well but black children were by far the rarest No explanation was given for the race disparity amongst victims Also despite the recent abundance of teen imagery and underage selfproduced material participants still anecdotally reported most victims were prepubescent children The profile described by the reports and our participants did differ on the gender of victims The three reports consistently show more female victims However some of our participants noticed that in their experience there was an even split between male and female victims while others reported that their cases were mostly female Participants were also quick to point out each perpetrator typically had type and that the online location at which the perpetrator was discovered corresponded to certain gender preferences ie being on boylovers forum The majority of our participants reported that they had witnessed decrease in the average age of the victim or alternatively stated this as an increase in very young victims although proportionately there were still more prepubescent and pubescent victims TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWHY AND WHEN DID THE AGE OF VICTIMS CHANGE Participants were unable to give an exact time the perceived change had taken place but it seems to have been very recent For example one participant attributed the change to being within the past few years would say that there are more offenders who are interested in prepubescent children and now increasingly in the last number of years in younger than prepubescent so in infants and children basically Another participant described the same change in victims ages but instead of an increasing amount the participant saw it as widening of an age preference that already existed amongst offenders think initially the ages were probably in or heading towards just prepubescent probably in the to kind of age group Were now seeing lot that are shifting slightly downwards towards the to age group and again slightly smaller portion that are under that infants and toddlers If you consider it bell curve type of situation the ages have shifted slightly younger simply because in the early days the bulk of the material presented was in that higher age group and now were looking at them being younger and in many cases prepubescent Another participant attributed the change to being global phenomenon lately the victims are at younger ages There is tendency would say an early sexualisation of children and it is true that we are seeing victims of increasingly early ages that has also been the case elsewhere Given the international perspective of this project it was interesting that some participants distinguished between the materials being produced in their country versus abroad participant from Colombia remarked Younger material is produced in other countries Its not Colombian pornography the pornography with younger kids are always produced in other countriesBOX CHILD CYBER CRIME GROUP Colombia The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is law enforcement agency dedicated to investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia The Group provided us with database of thousands of victims of commercial exploitation Our analyses were limited to the cases that involved victims of child sexual abuse material The average age of victims is presented as well as the proportion of male versus female victims in the table below Victims ages ranged from years old to years old with the total average age of victims being years old across all five years Also of note the majority of their victims were female with only total of victims being males across all five years Victim information from the Colombian Police Force Category thru July Avg Victim Age years Victim Gender Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Number of Cases TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALBOX POINT DE CONTACT France Point de Contact is hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network to combat OCSE In the year French Point de Contact handled cases of online child sexual abuse material Of these the victims ages were categoriaed as infant in cases prepubescent in pubescent in and indeterminate in The victims gender was determined in cases and skewed heavily towards female victims with of cases involving girls involving boys and involving both Age by gender was not available from the summary report Likewise some participants felt changes in the age of victims might be because the laws in their country surrounding CSAM and the subsequent enforcement of those laws were the reason they were seeing certain types of victims As one participated explained In redacted we see more kids because sometimes they can avoid being caught Because usually they upload the content over foreign website or crowdhost platform so they can easily get away with distributing material without being caught According to our law child sexual abuse content if your only possession is very minor crime and the penalty is you just have to pay fine When asked why they thought the age of victims was getting younger there was not consistent answer as to why this change occurred notable response was the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net targeting those with attractions to very young children The following are participants commentary on the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net On most of the boards it is actually forbidden to post anything under two but in this board redacted its actually the only thing that you can post You have two categories You have the babies which is between zero and two and then you have the toddler category which is between two and five This is new actually Maybe there were boards before didnt know of but this very popular board dedicated to baby lovers is kind of new The name of the country has been redacted to keep perpetrators from further exploiting this countrys laws would say were seeing more new material than we have ever seen before That is down to number of factors Its down again to the increased access to the Internet and increased access to devices through which it can be produced Thats one of the less important factors for this material Whats more important is call it the focusing factor When you have facilities or services like we have on the Dark Net and have had for the last number of years where individuals can come together They can talk about their sexual preferences openly They can admire the abuse that each other have perpetrated on children through the material that theyre able to contribute to one another and to distribute between one another When you have forums and website available where they cannot be or at least believe that they cannot be traced then those factors all become multiplied The willingness of individuals to encourage others to produce material to produce the material themselves and to post it and then to talk about that among each other is increased in those forms Further discussion around Dark Net forums dedicated to extremely young victims suggested that they did not exist few years ago and investigators are only now uncovering these sources for younger content Furthermore participants implied perpetrators might feel sense of safety in discussing their attraction to extremely young children within these forums as well as encouraging each other to produce this material since such topics had previously been too taboo to even discuss on prepubescent forums TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALHowever the Dark Net was not the only reason cited for the decrease in age Another participant reported that the change may be due to mandatory reporting laws Mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report if they learn or suspect child has been abused or neglected These laws have led to significant increase in reports of child sexual abuse The rationale is that perpetrators might find it is easier to molest child who is too young to speak and thus cannot complain or suggest they have been abused If they are unable to express that they have been abused an adult or caregiver in that childs life is unlikely to make report to the authorities Another explanation was that perpetrators and consumers are seeking new and more extreme content The victims can only get so young We have seen the abuse of babies and very very young toddlers depicted Thats going to play off because they cant get any younger than that Were seeing that it has We are at that point where the material is depicting the abuse for what it is rather than trying to sugar coat is as smiling happy faces happy family time kind of thing We also asked about the youngest victim participants had seen and every participant had come across material involving an infant or toddler during their career even those who did not think there had been change in the age of victims Several participants reported that the youngest child they had seen was days weeks or only few months old These extremely young children prompted the law enforcement agents to prioritise cases that involved younger children especially when they believe the content was new or that the child may still be alive Probably itd be couple of weeks agoIntervieweeWeve seen infants new born babies probably couple of days oldInterviewee InterviewerInterviewer Whats

CIVIL Spain The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation of Children is law enforcement agency in Spain Only partial descriptive analysis was possible with this limited dataset While conclusions should not be drawn the analysis did not seem to indicate an increase in the number or proportion of cases involving infants The first table below shows infant cases as percentage of total cases over sixmonth period Overall among unique hashes had an infant victim Victims again skewed towards being female and cases involving infants still more so of noninfant cases were female compared to of infant cases of noninfant cases were males and had victims of both genders compared to male and both for infant cases The Guardia Civil uses tier severity score to rate child sexual abuse content Cases involving infants tend to feature more severe content ie penetration and adult on child activity instead of suggestive posing andor child on child activity These differences were statistically significant using the Chisquare test see bottom tableTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALEXPLORING CHANGES IN THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF MATERIAL In addition to the age of victims decreasing there may be connection between younger victims and more aggressive sexual content Egregious sexual content was often limited to investigations on more private platforms or platforms that protected offenders identities such as the Dark Net The Canadian Centre for Child Protection also found correlation between the age of victims and the severity of content in their report They found that younger victims experienced higher proportions of explicit and extreme sexual assault Similar findings have been reported by the recent study conducted by ECPAT and Interpol on unidentified victims in child sexual exploitation material stored in the ICSE Database Descriptions of the sexual behaviour perpetrated against younger children by our participants ranged from closeups of genitals to forceful and sadistic activity Some investigators felt there had been shift from older CSAM methods that would involve dressing up children and making the engagement seem enjoyable or pleasurable for the child whereas images nowadays depicted the abusive nature of act themselves would say that the material is becoming more and more aggressive For example before August we didnt analyse any images in TOR so that might change my opinion Because in torrent of content is penetrative In TOR the images and the videos are the worst Differences in distribution methods have been linked to differences in offenders and offense types in USA based investigation Likewise NetCleans qualitative study similarly found that of police say anonymization technologies were crucial challenge to identifying offenders who have produced child sexual abuse material They specifically comment on the difficulty that TOR presents which was expressed by some of our participants as well Several participants attributed the more aggressive activity to the false sense of security that the Dark Net gave them Canadian Centre for Child Protection Child Sexual Abuse

of America InternetFacilitated Sexual Offending Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths The NetClean Report and The dark net is really difficult for law enforcement They do enforce the law and work there and they try to get the offenders caught but its really difficult because its difficult to trace In way you can share totally illegal material and its not safe but in way its easier You dont get caught so its easy Why is it aggressive They have the opportunity to produce aggressive material and they think its really difficult to get caught think its also the fact somebody will pay great amount of money if you produce aggressive material One participant perceived the online culture as apparently rewarding the production of younger more aggressive material The participant described the behaviour by saying think the more you can produce or exchange the worst you can show to your other groups or to the other members of these groups you can rise in the ranking or you get more members Beyond sexual activity alone another noticeable change was perpetrators disgracing their victims bodies with words In recent years the content the photos by themselves are getting high and the sexual activity is getting lewd so we can see offenders put objects into childrens vaginas or they will over We saw some cases lately offenders writing some words on childrens bodies not good words words like bitch She loves to be doing this So its not just sexual activity its getting cruel Writing words phrases and usernames on childrens bodies was also suggested as way to prove to other members the material was new belonged to certain producer or fulfilled sort of bragging right Anecdotally it has been suggested that producers are scrubbing images of identifiers and EXIF data to protect themselves from being traced so it is surprising that producers would be willing to risk purposefully placing an identifier to recruit new members or achieve higher rank within their member groupsTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALBOX CHILD RESCUE COALITION USA Child Rescue Coalition is nonprofit organization that partners with US and nonUS investigators police officers and other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers They mainly provide technological assistance as well as host large database of CSAM hash values The US Child Rescue Coalition were able to provide us with summary of categorised new file hash values for the past years across five categories summarised in the table below hash value in this context represents an image that is known to contain illegal content The data show the proportion of child notable material compared with other categories of values Child notable material involves children age and under However the organisation primarily focuses their investigative efforts on prepubescent children Therefore it is expected that the majority of images they collect will be denoted as child notable New file hashes detected by Child the Protection System by year Category thru June June Child Notable Age Difficult Child Erotic Child Cartoon Erotic Total While the majority of participants felt the sexual activity had become more severe some felt there had not been noticeable difference They still saw aggressive sexual activity being perpetrated against victims of all ages but not stark increase in violence or violence against specific age group participant who felt the activity had remained constant no more or less aggressive than in previous years described content relating to age in the following way Weve seen cases of toddlers being abused Rarely rarely to the point of actual penetration but clearly the offenders genitals are visible placed somewhere over the victim That is the kind of aggressive material we can witness with regards to toddlers find that the content involving male offenders and young prepubescent victims particularly aggressive because of the nature of the act Because these children are clearly under age In comparison it does seem lot more shocking than when you see Child Notable Abuse imagery depicting visually prepubescent children typically years of age or younger Age Difficult Abuse imagery depicting postpubescent victims still believed to be under years of age Child Erotic Imagery depicting nude children not considered to be lewd display Child Cartoon Erotic Cartoon images produced to show children or children characters in sexual situations pubescent victim who could be but appears to be minor We are still obliged to qualify it as child abuse material Its not exactly the same type of abuse we witness in that case Differences in experience and perspectives of the trends such as these highlight the utility in assessing sexual activity with the scales that have been developed UNCOVERING THE TYPICAL OFFENDER While the literature has focused on convicted sex offenders the law enforcement agents and hotline analysts we spoke with gave insight into both detected and undetected offenders They suggested offenders continue to grow more and more protective of their identities as technologies and investigative techniques advance Every participant said it was rare to see an offenders face nowadays and when an offenders face is visible those tend to be adolescent offenders or rookie offenders For the most part offenders only showed body parts TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALand made sure no personal identifiers ie scars tattoos deformities were visible Its extremely rare that we can see the offender If we can see him its only parts of his body or if its the whole silhouette his face will usually be hidden under mask We hardly ever see the face of an offender Consensus amongst interviewees was that most men acted alone either purchasing sex from children problem in lowincome countries extorting children online through social media or grooming children they were close to ie family members The relationship between offender and child changes depending on which of the aforementioned situations is taking place Offenders of younger children tend to be intimate with one participant acknowledging You know with younger kids it often is either some kind of familial relationship or something close to that like boyfriend or something in terms of having actual access to the child especially at younger age or maybe weve seen couple where its babysitters but Id say mostly its more familial relationships for the younger ages because of course as soon as you get into the online abuse and grooming and things like that its going to be total strangers rather than somebody that they actually know Unlike victims where participants discussed common characteristics giving profiles that were supported by other reports many participants felt there was no common characteristic amongst offenders The participants who gave an offender profile often mentioned older males probably in their to who were white typology of convicted offenders Women appear to be very rarely involved in the production of material though some said they were starting to see women produce CSAM especially when being coerced by man such as boyfriend or for money One participant echoed this notation stating would say there is tendency for female offenders to accept for profit because we now see an area where mothers are abusing children on webcam or live shows for money would say the CSAM produced by women is always as know of coordinated by man Netclean Eleven Unbelievable Truths few participants did imply there were times they saw women acting of their own volition but again women were considered maybe in every offenders if that Some participants reported that they never actually saw women IDENTIFYING PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION METHODS Though it is generally understood that child sexual abuse material is produced and distributed in variety of ways participants described investigative efforts as being constant race to outpace new methods notable difference between todays producers and old producers are the number of mediums available Participants mentioned that technology like digital cameras laptops and cell phones have greatly influenced who produce images Though there may be some evidence that higher quality images are considered more valuable cell phones and webcams seem to have become the norm This finding is again supported by the qualitative study of police that found mobile phones and videos are becoming increasingly common in investigations In particular they allow perpetrators to offend in their own homes and at their convenience which may contribute to the age of children decreasing participant explained the biggest change he had experienced From the top of my head Id say more and more amateur content is being produced Meaning home self produced content unfortunately This is parting with the given impression that CSAM is something that you maybe find in more exotic countries typically Eastern Asia with sex tourism The fact is we see more if were talking about ethnicity here weve seen lot of Caucasian white children being abused by what seems to be parent or close relative within the framework of household Thats what refer to when say amateur content Likewise distribution methods have grown Distributors were characterised as being fluid and step ahead of investigators They often exploited new technologies and deftly used apps and other networks privacy policies to their advantage participant described distribution in the following way TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALIt changes all the time mean the last couple of weeks we had high number of cases in Snapchat Its very newly used by offenders Yeah think it changes lot It changes every week think by the numbers and every application think the dark net is still high number Peer to peer is same constantly used Another participant explained the popularity of live streaming distribution method that has only very recently become prominent think yes distribution changed little bit Not just little quite bit Live streaming is think big issue live stream abuse or distance abuse when children are put into prostitution or forced into prostitution in different parts of the world Southeast Asia Africa South America things like that And somebody in other continents would pay to view this So those observers payers watchers whatever they would gather those videos for their own purposes as they paid for them Live streaming presents particularly challenging situation to law enforcement because if produced properly there is no evidence that the crime ever existed even though law enforcement may see evidence of money transfers and call times Likewise without witnessing the abuse it is difficult to charge consumers with possession of CSAM since there is no actual recording left Furthermore it has the potential to cross international jurisdictions as well as involve requesting assistance from the webcasting service There also seems to be vast differences in the type of content hosted on each platform As mentioned earlier more aggressive and younger content are found on more secure places like the Dark Web The younger victims would tend to be in the areas that have the greater levels of security and that community element The overt kind of open platforms such as social networks and your standard Internet platforms would tend to be slightly older victims It comes down to the degree of comfort that the individual has in terms of the platform theyre using and the way they discern the age of the victim Interviewee it has differences because the pornography or the materials that you can find on the deep web on the dark web is more aggressive than the pornography that you can find on the social media Interviewer Are they different with ages and gender as well not just sexual content Interviewee They are younger Interviewer Why do you think that they are different Why is social media different than the other places Interviewee It depends On the social media they have to be more discreet They have to be careful with the things that they are doing versus other areas of the web Because on the other websites they dont have to be careful because the material is very dark like they are very safe Anonymity sense of safety and more extreme content tend to be common characteristics of material distributed on the dark web Social media seems to be place where participants found older victims or less aggressive CSAM These differences in content and victims suggest that there may be room for further investigation to develop risk profiles and investigative hierarchies IMPACTING POLICY Participants expressed improving policy on three levels globally nationally and locally Globally participants wanted greater collaboration between law enforcement agencies during investigations Some investigators related frustrations over their inability to secure search warrants in timely manner or hitting severe roadblocks due to paperwork and legalities that inhibited them from effectively cooperating with other investigators on crossboarder cases Furthermore participants had mixed feeling about industry partners Some felt they made their job easier while others found them to be obstacles participant eloquently stated his opinion on the topic TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALWeve all heard the phrase You cant prosecute your way out of this issue There is need for multidisciplinary approach to looking at this type of thing especially where we overlay the idea that lot of the material is generated out in areas where extreme poverty exists and this is way of remedying that poverty as way of physically trafficking children or digitally trafficking children through like webcams In terms of the offending there needs to be tools that allow law enforcement to work together across jurisdictional boundaries much more effectively There needs to be tools in place that allow the investigations to be done in timely and effective way There needs to be tools that allow case referrals to happen very quickly Legislative tools that allow law enforcement to get subscriber information from other jurisdictions easily and quickly and get information out of service providers easily and quickly Nationally participants wanted databases to be implemented and maintained They also desired stricter laws for people who perpetrate these crimes They felt they were often stunted by the ways they were allowed to investigate material online in comparison to other fields and wanted to be given more freedom in their approach to taking down material conducting sting operations and probing leads participant highlighted this notion This is topic really feel that it hurts everyone that as societies makes us look very bad And at the end of the day the effort and the sum of all not only the police This is job that must be done from different areas from different strata Both in society and government and industry in the private sector in companies We all have substantial responsibility in this And think that the dissemination of information of what is happening really is fundamental Let people know that simply downloading single image containing such is crime and therefore can go to jail think that is fundamental think people need to know that this is crime crime that is paid and paid dearly People go to jail for doing this kind of behaviour Locally participants consistently brought up needing more resources and funding They felt that while many people and politicians recognise online child sexual exploitation as problem they never allocate the appropriate funds for training staffing and new technologies Addressing those concerns would be paramount in ensuring that law enforcement can effectively do their jobs TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALAs noted across the reviewed literature the interviews with law enforcement and the limited complementary quantitative data presented here CSAM crimes are varied and subject to change terminology differs across researchers and practitioners and inconsistent ways of operationalising and measuring CSAM makes comparison across studies difficult This has had negative impact on global efforts at data collection across different forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation and is evidenced to be the case with online CSAM Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by the volume of online content in the open and also hidden Internet and the reality that content may be removed but not destroyed and copied endlessly To date we have been dependent on criminal justice records and public reports to hotlines as well as proactive searching for data but both are subject to biases and are likely to underestimate the volume of CSAM in circulation Studies using data sourced from existing databases such as ICSE also face challenges as the data was not collected for research purposes but rather for operational reasons and reflects the vagaries of reporting and managing missing information What we can conclude is that criminal justice data from public records as well as research surveys would suggest an increase over time in the number of CSAM crimes However some of this data is now quite old and public records also reflect changes in legislation and recording of crimes across different jurisdictions It is also difficult to unpick whether the increases in recorded CSAM crimes reflect an overall increase in these crimes or greater investment by law enforcement possibly aided by technological tools to detect and prosecute them Youthproduced images also pose new challenges for law enforcement in terms of resource demands alongside their ability to determine the age of the child and whether they have been produced as part of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent behaviour that is consistent with adolescent development and risktaking Mapping of existing national and international CSAM databases would suggest that they fall largely into two groups hash collections and image collections While there are number of databases globally there is limited connectivity between them Differences in how data is defined and recorded means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions as to whether there have been changes in the gender age and level of violence within recorded CSAM There is some suggestive evidence that the percentage of egregious images has increased over time but inconclusive evidence in whether there are changes in the ages of children except that since there appears to have been an increase in the volume of CSAM involving pubescent children thought to be linked with trends in growth of self produced content facilitated by wider access to new technologies Across three studies younger victims are associated with greater levels of sexual violence produced within family context and more likely to be widely distributed However the preponderance of images is of pubescent and pre pubescent children and the numbers of images of very young children infants and toddlers remain relatively low What is consistent across different datasets is that the majority of victims and offenders are white Caucasians and while there has been an increase in other ethnic groups these number remain disproportionately small This does require further investigation given the increasing availability of Internet connectivity through handheld devices and the concerns expressed about for example live streaming of sexual abuse The qualitative results from expert interviews confirm the study hypothesis that victims of OCSE appear to be getting younger and the decline in age has happened recently However this is far from clearly confirmed The report from the IWF suggested decline in the percentage of reported images of children under from in to in and corresponding increase in victims aged to respectively The IWF concluded that this may relate to the increase in youthproduced images alongside the fact that since IWF analysts have been allowed to proactively search for content The public are more likely than analysts to report children under the age of and where there is more severe abuse When IWF analysts find forum with thousands of images of child sexual abuse they work to remove the forum as well as capture the URLs of every image CONCLUDING DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONSTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIALon there which might be pulled from another site They then seek to remove each image hosted on the other sites as well The IWF conclude that this technique appears to be associated with finding more images of to yearold children The experts within the study had not reached consensus as to why they concluded that the age of victims is decreasing but one suggestion was the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net specifically dedicated to younger children which did not previously exist Such market place was thought to naturally encourage the production of new material as well as facilitate its sharing The Dark Net is seen as notorious safe house for some of the most egregious content and as law enforcement and hotline analysts begin to specifically target these forums it is speculated that they will undoubtedly see an increase in young victims Another explanation given for the decreasing age of victims was that offenders have gained sense of safety and confidence on private platforms eg live streaming that make it easier to produce violent material When participants discussed distribution methods some mentioned outdated policies and legislation that inhibited them from being proactive in investigations Similarly few participants suggested that investigative efforts have continued to be blocked by companies and countries that do not fully cooperate with law enforcement Despite the ongoing international dialogue around child online sexual exploitation participants believed that the public appears to misunderstand the gravity and implications of restricting investigations Participants also emphasised the fact that additional funding would significantly help their investigative teams Funding would address the majority of issues participants had with current practices it would allow them to add staff members in turn processing more cases build national databases of images and videos and appropriately train staff It was felt that drastic increases in the number of cases reported each year and lack of funding have left professionals with little ability to implement valuable resources such as the development of national image databases as well as annual staff training Furthermore it was suggested that efforts should be made to encourage collaboration between researchers advocates and law enforcement agents so that the field can continue to grow and promote best practices LIMITATIONS When recruitment began for the quantitative portion of the study invitations and flyers were distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe requesting data on online sexual abuse images These initial invitations yielded very few responses Upon further probing it appeared many countries lacked the funding and staff needed to maintain national databases especially databases that would retain the level of detail our research team desired to establish standards for evidencebased advocacy and programming As one agent acknowledged even if his department was presented with additional funding he would probably dedicate the funds to more investigative staff rather than sacrifice team member to data entry and management Other departments and organisations were advocating for or had recently received funds to establish national databases but were still in the beginning phases of designing and implementing their databasesTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL RECOMMENDATIONS Law enforcement agents and hotline analysts are seeing changes in CSAM However expert opinions are not sufficient to establish global metrics substantial quantitative data is necessary As the limitations of this study suggested there are still many barriers to overcome before global metrics andor indicators can be developed RECOMMENDATION Invest in the development and maintenance of national database of CSAM in each country It is difficult to determine the costbenefit ratio of agencies dedicating staff time as well as their often limited funds to maintaining national database However to more effectively establish global trends in OCSE it is crucial that law enforcement agencies throughout the world have databases or the ability to track relevant information about the material they process and investigate including characteristics of offenders victims and the sexual activity depicted in the imagery RECOMMENDATION Track and analyse trends in CSAM data nationally and globally Governments must track and analyse trends in CSAM data both at national levels and in cooperation with international law enforcement to better understand and therefore more effectively fight OCSE RECOMMENDATION Promote participation in research by law enforcement agencies The benefits of evidencedbased advocacy and action are far reaching but collaboration is often restricted by the need to negotiate complex ethical processes associated with sharing sensitive data or simply from lack of resources There are clear opportunities to foster collaboration between law enforcement agencies and professional researchers that would benefit both partners Researchers and advocates should work to strengthen their relationships with law enforcement agencies and hotlines in order to facilitate such projects RECOMMENDATION Move towards standard variables for collecting storing and analyzing CSAM data Analysis of limited quantitative data allowed the research team to test assumptions about how law enforcement agencies collect and store CSAM data It was assumed that agencies would vary slightly in how they collected coded and defined variables However vast differences were noted in what organisations considered important to include in their databases and how they maintained them Some variables will need to be standardized across databases for global metrics to be achieved RECOMMENDATION Consult stakeholders from around the globe to develop set of basic shared variables and promote agreement to store CSAM data in line with these Bringing together key stakeholders to define variables and standardise the way data is captured within databases would assist investigators advocates and researchers in establishing and comparing trends It is not enough to have large databases with lots of variables rather we need robust databases with useful and carefully defined variables to better understand and more effectively act to prevent this crime from happening Bringing together key stakeholders around the globe to define variables and standardise the way data is capture within databases would assist investigators advocates and researchers in establishing and comparing trends It is not enough to have large databases with lots of variables rather we

In child on child are the children similar ages How does the sexual activity relate to the gender of the victim Why do you think these differences exist Production and Distribution Do you know how the material was produced eg grooming of contact child prostitute covert filming Have the production methods changed webcam cell phone hidden camera Have the distribution methods changed Meaning what mediums do individuals use to trade the material PP Email deep web websites Are different types of sexual content or ages traded on different platforms Why do you think that is Where are materials typically filmedproduced eg on the street in hotels in house Does the location change when the material involves younger children How often would you say series of images or videos is traded meaning do you mostly come across private collections or do you see series circulating What would you consider an actively traded case of child pornography Are there differences between cases that are actively traded and cases that are not actively traded ii Do you think the age of the child influences whether the case is actively traded If yes why do you think that is Policy Impact What do you think would be helpful to disrupt the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material Are there resources that would be helpful for you that do not currently exist Do you have any recommended changes or addition to the policies surrounding child sexual abuse material Insight Is there any information other resources or policies that we havent discussed that would help you more

enforcement agency in Spain Guardia Civil provided partial database from to that describes online material that the police have investigated At the time of data collection this agency is in the process of categorising their data and so additional data might be available at future point From the data provided it was unclear how much data from each year had been included in the dataset For all investigated material this database included the sixmonth window in which the material was identified eg JulyDec both broad content description eg sexual activity between childrensexual activity between an adult and child and more specific content description victim age categories years years and whether an infant appears in the content These data are the most pertinent to the primary research question While offender information and other victim demographic information eg race are missing the content descriptions may provide an opportunity to examine temporal trends in content

investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia The Child Cyber Crime Group provided database of Colombian victims of sexual exploitation from to July Given that not all the cases pertained to online child exploitation our investigation was limited to cases denoted as victims of CSAM Victim age and gender are summarised by year These data are extremely useful for our primary

Recommendations Recommendations on reporting mechanisms Recommendations on support services INTRODUCTION Photo by LeeAnn Cline Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaDefining child sexual exploitation and abuse online Child sexual abuse refers to various sexual activities perpetrated against children persons under regardless of whether the children are aware that what is happening to them is neither normal nor acceptable It can be committed by adults or peers and usually involves an individual or group taking advantage of an imbalance of power It can be committed with or without explicit force with offenders frequently using authority power manipulation or deception Child sexual exploitation involves the same abusive actions However an additional element must also be present exchange of something eg money shelter material goods immaterial things like protection or relationship or even the mere promise of such Child sexual exploitation and abuse online includes an evolving range of practices including Child sexual abuse material The production distribution dissemination importing exporting offering selling possession of or knowingly obtaining access to child sexual abuse material online even if the sexual abuse that is depicted in the material was carried out offline Grooming children online for sexual purposes Identifying andor preparing children via online technology with view to exploiting them sexually whether the acts that follow are then carried out online or offline or even not carried out at all Live streaming of child sexual abuse Sexual exploitation which involves the coercion threat or deception of child into sexual activities that are transmitted streamed live via the Internet for viewing by others remotely Other practices Related concepts can include online sexual extortion the nonconsensual sharing of selfgenerated sexual content involving children unwanted exposure to sexualised content among othersChild sexual exploitation and abuse online refers to situations involving digital Internet and communication technologies at some point during the continuum of abuse or exploitation It can occur fully online or through mix of online and in person interactions between offenders and children Interagency Working Group on Sexual Exploitation of Children Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse Bangkok ECPAT International Ibid ECPAT International Summary Paper Online Child Sexual Exploitation Bangkok ECPAT International Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaBackground Research about child sexual exploitation and abuse online has received increased attention recently particularly as our lives shifted further online during responses to the Covid pandemic Research from global north countries is over represented on this topic with far fewer studies taking place in low and middleincome countries continuum exists for our online and offline lives which also impacts this issue with blurred boundaries between our physical and digital worlds Sexual violence is also taking place in different ways online as well as in situations involving online and inperson elements of grooming facilitation and sharing Furthermore childrens voices about their experiences of these crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online nor the responses they receive Much of the existing research has also focused on identifying potential risks to children rather than directly measuring the evidence of harm that some have faced This is understandable as its ethically more complex to conduct research with young people who have experienced harm Yet fully understanding online harms is important to inform preventions and responses It must also be remembered that in reality the vast majority of cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse go unreported making it difficult to truly determine the scope of this problem in the first place Researchers have used qualitative methods like online surveys to examine childhood experiences of sexual exploitation and abuse online predominantly focused on survivors of child sexual abuse material production In one such study approximately half of those who responded felt that the images were associated with specific problems that were different to those caused by the actual abuse Nearly half of the respondents worried that people would think that they were willing participants or that people would recognise them Interestingly in this study onethird refused to talk about the images and denied that there were images Three themes were identified from the data guilt and shame their ongoing vulnerability and an empowerment dimension the images sometimes brought An additional study of adult survivors came from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection who conducted an online survey with female respondents whose child sexual abuse was recorded andor distributed online Seventy per cent of that sample also expressed anxieties about being recognised from the images further qualitative study of children who were referred following suspected online sexual abuse found that only were willing to talk about what had happened The remainder denied that anything had taken place in spite of the fact that there were digital images of their abuse The interviews with these children indicated that they were very critical of themselves and often had strong feelings of loyalty towards their offender The reluctance to accept disclose and attributions of selfblame have been evidenced in other research with children who have experienced online sexual exploitation both in relation to abuse through sexual image production as well as online grooming These are important lessons not only for Childrens voices about their experiences of sexual crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online nor the responses they receive Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in Colombiaresearch studies with these hardtoreach populations but also in relation to the recovery needs of these individuals Breaking down these common phenomena which may be heavily internalised is clearly required These studies notwithstanding qualitative research with children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse online is still relatively rare Such children are difficult to both identify and recruit which in part may reflect the ethical challenges of approaching children directly and also because many professionals act as gatekeepers to children and are reluctant to approach them for research due to justifiable fears of further traumatisation Crucially any such research must also be completed using ethically appropriate and safe techniques for engaging survivors However growing numbers of children are being supported by support services around the world for issues related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Seeking to understand and build on the strengths of such services and address their weaknesses is priority Amplifying the voices of young people who have had these experiences is vital for this work The increasing problem of child sexual exploitation and abuse online requires detailed extensive and sustained attention This is especially the case in middle and lowincome countries where the issue often lacks visibility and few studies have been conducted to date Specific evidence about the quality and effectiveness of support services will enable targeted responses in which governments nongovernmental organisations and the private sector can cooperate to address this problem Ensuring that the voices of children who have had experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are part of the evidence as was achieved in this project enables childcentred and informed approaches that better prevent this issue from occurring and better support those young people subjected to these crimes Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Subsister Perspectives in ColombiaThe project in Colombia To explore child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia this project undertook two research activities The conversations with young survivors focused on their recommendations for improving prevention and support services for children not their abuse as explained below The approach ensured that the research was informed directly by survivors who were drawing on their own experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation and abuse online Including their perspectives in the research bridges the conspicuous gaps noted above that sometimes persist in the evidence in this sensitive area Surveying frontline support workers aimed to provide substantial and nuanced understanding of how child sexual exploitation and abuse online is presenting in social support services Data from these professionals indicates knowledge and perceptions of the problem amongst workers caregivers and the general public identifies key vulnerabilities for children and assesses accessibility of care to support children subjected to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Data from Colombia was presented alongside data from five other countries involved in the project to panel of experts at an online roundtable held on th July Insights from the roundtable helped frame the data in the overall project report and this and other countries national reportsQualitative oneonone conversations with young people who had experienced child sexual exploitation and abuse onlineAn online survey of frontline support workers who were working with child survivors of sexual exploitation and abuse The project was implemented in Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Colombia Mexico Moldova and Peru This report solely includes the findings of the activities conducted in Colombia Similar national reports are available for all project countries along with project report summarising the findings across the six target countriesMETHODOLOGY Photo by Saul Mercado Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaConversations with survivors The conversations with young survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are of foremost importance to this project They were conducted with the intention to shed light on the conspicuous gaps that persist when survivors perspectives are excluded from work to shape policy and legislation in this area The conversations explored the survivors perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of existing support services and gathered recommendations for improvements Rationale Engaging survivors of child sexual exploitation in research requires substantial care to accommodate range of ethical considerations Such research must place significant value on survivors having the right to safely actively and meaningfully participate in discourse on issues that impact upon them Therefore the design for the survivors conversations in this project was built on the principle that the participants had and perceived themselves to have significant control over the process including the decisions of what they shared range of measures were taken that reinforced that survivors had full control over sharing their perspectives on their terms To ensure that the perspectives of young survivors were meaningfully included in this project ECPAT International developed comprehensive participantcentred ethically sound and traumainformed approach to engaging them with the help of an expert who had extensive experience working with survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation The conversations approach is thus dialogue with young survivors on issues which matter to them and which explore their experiences of the support that they received Participants were invited to speak freely about their personal experiences of support services through their recovery process and the facilitators used active listening to engage with the young persons and understand their story exploring particular gaps in understanding and drawing out the detail needed to represent young peoples perspectives of these issues Probing questions eliciting narratives across their experiences were only done responsively and to prompt discussion This was not structured interview with set questions which can feel like an interrogation Participants were invited to tell only the parts of their story that they wanted to The conversations in Colombia were facilitated by two psychologists male and female all with experience in therapeutic care for child and adolescents survivors of sexual exploitation Sample In Colombia the facilitators carefully identified possible young people that could be invited to participate Inclusion criteria included inter alia being aged between to years old having had an experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse before turning years of age as well as need for participants to have current access to support structures and for adequate time to have passed since the exploitation occurred ECPAT International Guidelines for Ethical Research on Sexual Exploitation Involving Children Bangkok ECPAT International Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaOf those identified and reached out to by the facilitators and their networks nine survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online young women and young men between the age of to years old agreed to take part in the conversations The participants were identified through the work carried out by Fundacin Renacer in association with the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare Conversations approach The conversations were carefully planned to be conducted in an interactive and unstructured style rather than traditional form of research interview The advantages of this design are that it is attentive to the nature and sensitivities of the topic and promotes choice and empowerment placing high value on the fact that participants have and perceive themselves to have significant control over what they share with the researchers Participants were also asked if they preferred to take part in conversations oneonone or in small groups for example in case they already knew some of the other participants because of participation in the same support groups The nine young people decided to conduct oneonone conversations Following initial agreement to take part conversations were then held in two stages premeeting was carried out and then the main conversation few days later This twostage process was deliberate symbolically indicating trusting relationship controlled by the participant from the outset The premeeting involved explaining the process answering queries about consent and seeking any preferences that the facilitators could accommodate in setting up the main conversation eg time of day room and seating preferences who was present etc Arrangements remained flexible and up to the local facilitators and the young people to determine together also in light of the fastchanging contextual circumstances caused by the Covid pandemic Facilitators took every measure to make sure that the survivors felt as comfortable as possible during the course of conversations The conversational nature open questions allowing enough time to respond regularly giving permission not to respond all helped shape the outcomes of the conversations As per the conversations approach the young people were able to contribute verbally but also encouraged to use range of visual tools to facilitate the conversations Past Now Future flip charts speechthought bubbles emoji drawings etc The possibility of carrying out the conversations in three moments past present and future seemed to be appreciated by the participants as it represented an opportunity to verbalise their empowerment processes The visual representation method however was not applied in all cases as some of the participants were more comfortable with verbally expressing their thoughts Their choices were fully accepted and respected While the Covid pandemic meant lots of interactions had to be virtual the researchers were adamant that psychological safety would be hard to maintain in such an approach Conversations were therefore all held facetoface Although the research did not seek to determine the specifics of the exploitation andor abuse that the young women were subjected to in this way the facilitators trained and experienced in working with trauma were physically present to provide psychological support if distress was encountered Some flexibility was needed to adapt to changing movement requirements and Covid safety plans were applied Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis Following the conversations the facilitators reflected on what they had heard their notes and recordings of the sessions They developed brief preliminary report in Spanish that focused on specific themes across the seven conversations such as barriers to disclosing the quality usefulness and accessibility of services and summarised the young womens recommendations for improvements This preliminary report was then reviewed and discussed between the facilitators the project expert and the ECPAT research team Once finalised it was made available to those participants who had indicated they wanted to see the output to offer their feedback and additional inputs Ethical considerations Before beginning the research activity ECPAT International convened panel of three global experts for an independent thirdparty review of the proposed methodology detailed research protocol that included mitigations for ethical risks was developed along with draft tools Detailed feedback from the panel was accommodated in two rounds of review before the project commenced As detailed above the local facilitators participated in extensive preparations together with the project expert prior to conducting the conversations Moreover the process for obtaining informed consent was conduct in two steps so the young people had time to consider their involvement not signing consent just prior to commencing and could control some of the circumstances of the conversations Frontline support workers survey The engagement of frontline support workers through completion of workforce survey was aimed at adding data to flesh out comprehensive picture of child sexual exploitation and abuse online by exploring the perceptions knowledge and practices influencing disclosure and support provision Rationale Workforce surveys have increasingly been used in research to gain an understanding of the effectiveness of social support systems Most commonly these surveys are used by health and social work professions to measure service delivery effectiveness Social support to children who are subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse is generally provided within the broader context of child protection We therefore developed and delivered survey for child protection workers The survey explored perceptions related to the sexual exploitation of children in general and online factors related to childrens access to support services perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of such services as well as details about the nature of their direct work with children Magadzire et al November

exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSample Fundacin Renacer utilised their national contacts to identify organisations supporting children from which to invite staff working at the frontline of providing support While the research focus was child sexual exploitation and abuse online very few services focus exclusively on support for child sexual exploitation and abuse with an online component or even exclusively on general child sexual exploitation and abuse The sample therefore included range of frontline support workers who had supported at least some children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse over the last year convenience sample of Colombian frontline workers was surveyed The sample should not be considered representative of the diversity of frontline workers in the country however attempts to represent different types of services both in terms of geographic location as well as type of services were made In order to be eligible to complete the survey frontline workers needed to be Over years of age At least last months working in the field of social work psychology or other social support At least last months managing own case load directly Case load over last months included at least some children Case load over last months included at least some cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of children The survey Selfadministered online surveys emailing link have notoriously low participation rates Thus the design for this project opted for inperson administration though using an online tool with limits and designated required items for clean dataset While restrictions related to the Covid pandemic meant the Colombian administrators staff members from Fundacion Renacer had to support participants remotely via an introductory Zoom or phone call and then remained on standby to support offer guidance and troubleshoot as the participants completed the survey The personal connection helped motivate participants to complete the survey Data collection took place between AprilJune The online survey consisted of multiple choices and short openanswer questions The tipple tool in English language was translated to Spanish and ECPAT International and Fundacion Renacer collaborated to check and contextualise the survey which was then pilottested with small number of frontline workers in the country before being fielded The full survey in English and Spanish can be provided on request Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis Following data collection data was cleaned and openended responses were translated to English Survey output was integrated into custom analytical framework where analysis was then conducted based upon exigent themes and patterns that arose from the data Qualitative analytical components were then added Quantitative and qualitative themes and patterns were explored with direct translated quotes from the open text responses used to illustrate dominant narratives emerging from the quantitative data along with occasional dissenting views Care was taken during analysis not to present any qualitative responses that may have identified participants It should be noted that the data are not statistically representative of the experiences of all frontline support workers in Colombia However the estimates perceptions and experiences reported here offer valuable insight into the access and quality of social support for Colombian children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse Ethical considerations Informed consent was obtained as an integrated part of the online survey tool To protect confidentiality names were not requested at any stage of completing the survey Care is also taken when presenting qualitative data in this report so that participants are not identifiable by the content of the quotes Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaChallenges and limitations The Covid pandemic meant movement restrictions varied at different times during the data collection period which had an impact both on the survivors conversations as well as the frontline workers survey The facilitators overcame this challenge for the conversations with survivors by conducting the premeeting on the phone two weeks before the main conversation Survivor conversations were audiorecorded but transcriptions were not completed with the intention that as facilitators themselves were producing the preliminary reports key insights would be easily surmised However in hindsight and as the young peoples direct words were focus transcriptions would have helped to facilitate direct quotes being incorporated more easily The team in Colombia also noted that while the approach to conversations was carefully created to centre the participants this was challenging for the facilitators to negotiate The team suggested that key lines of enquiry are maybe considered as basis for future use of the approach Regarding the frontline workers survey limitation occurred as result of our inclusion criteria Our intent was to include support workers who worked directly at the frontline not higher up managers Thus hurdle question sought experience of working directly with children within the last months As data collection occurred in the first half of the impacts of the Covid pandemic had restricted some frontline workers from doing direct client work for some time so it is likely that some of the participants who began the survey but were disqualified by hurdle questions may have been false positives Weak Internet connections in areas such as La Guajira and the Amazon resulted into difficulties in administering and completing the survey Connection issues also extended dramatically the time to complete the survey for some respondents rather than minutes some reported it had taken them as much as minutes or more to complete For some government respondents working from the office at the time an additional challenge was gaining access to the survey online platform as their work computers blocked access to the website Finally during the data collection period widespread national protests were occurring and some potential respondents lost their employment Rescheduling appointments was necessary throughout this time to meet the sample requirements Photo by Yaopey Yong FINDINGS Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe perspectives of the young people who had direct experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation and abuse online are the primary data used to structure this report Quantitative and qualitative data from the surveyed frontline support workers is then integrated amongst their perspectives to enhance comprehensive picture of the ontheground situation for preventing and responding to child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia Public perceptions and beliefs the knowledge and practices of workers availability and quality of reporting mechanisms and the resource levels of support services are all presented The report concludes with recommendations for action these stem primarily from what the young people told us but are expanded in places with other data and analysis from the project partners Trends in child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia Gender The survey data suggest that there is higher proportion of girls than boys utilising formal reporting mechanisms and accessing support services in Colombia In an open question participants were asked if they thought there were trends related to gender and sexual exploitation generally and online Figure shows that almost half indicated that they perceived more girls than boys were affected Figure Gender trends identified by frontline workers generally and online More boys More girls Other trends No trends No commentThe most reported cases have to do with the females The tendency is for the majority of girls to be the most vulnerable to the offenders Please note that text in green boxes refers to quotes from the young survivors who took part in the conversations Text in purple boxes refers to the qualitative input shared by frontline workers who completed the surveyA number of respondents assumed that the low access of support services by boys would probably be because girls are overwhelmingly seen as more at risk in the country for full range of concerns but also for sexual exploitation One of them commented that Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaHowever it seems that despite the perception that girls are more at risk boys too are clearly seeking assistance for range of things including for child sexual exploitation and abuse online Indeed survey data also show that most of the frontline workers had provided some support for boys Eighty three percent of the respondents said that they had boys among their caseloads and of these workers said that they had supported boys for sexual exploitation and abuse online This was actually quite similar to the participants who had provide support to girls and most had supported girls related to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse In line with global research these numbers confirm that while perspectives might be boys are less impacted caseloads suggest more boys than is commonly thought are impacted On top of that there were some interesting departures from expectations in the Colombia data number of respondents said that nonbinary people are identified within the support services They also mentioned that These data confirm other research indicating that young people with diverse sexual and gender identities are vulnerable to sexual exploitation In some cases their diverse status may contribute to risks Indeed in the conversations one young man who identifies himself as gay said that the feeling of loneliness led him into risky situations He was manipulated by older men and got involved in relationships that he could not identify as abusive due to the need to reaffirm his sexual identity Age The frontline workers who had worked with boys for online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse reported that nearly half were targeted between the ages of years old The five young men who took part in the conversations were at similar age to this majority when they were abused all were between and there are confusions on sexual orientation in many of the children and adolescents served and that it is harder for the LGTBTQIA population to recognise their vulnerability to sexual exploitation and abuse ECPAT International Global Boys Initiative global review of existing literature on the sexual exploitation of boys ECPAT International See eg ECPAT International Global Boys Initiative Thailand Report ECPAT InternationalFigure Age of boys who had experienced online sexual exploitation years years years years Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSimilarly the frontline workers who had supported girls reported that they tended to be targeted at similar age with subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online between and Figure Age of girls who had experienced online sexual exploitation years years years years However the data showed that greater proportion of the impacted boys were younger Eighteen percent of the reported cases involving girls involved children under the age of eleven years old compared with of the cases involving boys As one worker said while violence against girls is mostly based on gender age is what makes boys more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse Yes there are more women and girls victimised with sexual exploitation by saying this dont mean to say that there are no cases with boys or men however these are evidenced in relation to age that is there are more boys compared to adult men Reporting mechanisms Awareness Conversations with the young survivors generally illustrated little awareness of the formal reporting mechanisms that are available During the conversations all the young people said that they had not received information about where to look for help when they were subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse There is no information on how to report The girls and boys dont report it scares them because of the process they are going to face One must have support in order to report someone to accompany the survivor Family support and psychological help are needed VoSCOL They also demonstrated fear of facing the bureaucratic processes often involved in formal reporting mechanisms Five of the nine young people spoken to had disclosed sexual exploitation to school or community members who at the time were in charge of promoting awareness campaigns about this form of violence The young people said that once they reached out these adults not only demonstrated empathy but also acted to end ongoing situations of exploitation and abuse Non judgemental attitudes careful and genuine listening persistence patience and friendly treatment Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe family and community members acted as mediators between the children and the formal reporting mechanisms so they could gain access to the support they needed Unfortunately sense that these issues were well understood was not the rule within the young peoples communities In fact in the conversations the young people pointed out the needs to raise awareness and promote knowledge on how to disclose The lack of general public awareness was reiterated by the frontline workers who participated in the survey When asked about the level of public awareness regarding online forms of child sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia the majority considered it poor smaller fraction of the respondents answered that it was either fair or good while only one person considered it excellent Although this question was not specifically related to the awareness of reporting mechanisms the fact that most of the frontline workers who responded to the survey believed that there is little awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online in the first place confirms what survivors explained that there is likely to be very little knowledge on how to report if it occurs An interesting finding was that respondents with more years of work experience were particularly negative about public awareness as shown in Figure below This could be an indication that their perceptions about how informed is the society changes over time as they gain more experience in the fieldwere some of the characteristics mentioned by the young people when describing those who received their disclosures One young woman said that her family members told her Always count on us here we will be family waiting for you so that you can recover VoSCOL Because can tell you if case happens in the neighbourhood they choose violence because they dont know what else to do If they call the police the police in some cases do almost nothing people make violence justice by their own hands VoSCOL Figure Level of public awareness of online child exploitation and abuse according to the surveyed frontline workers Poor Excellent Fair Good Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaFigure Level of public awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online according to the surveyed frontline workers by years of experience Poor Fair Good Excellent years years years years number of surveyed frontline workers proposed that more education and training is needed in order to increase public awareness in Colombia In fact this was recurrent topic on survey qualitative responses as well as in the conversations Both sources of data strongly suggest the need for knowledge and skills development amongst frontline support workers on how to identify and work with online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse Another frontline worker said thatFrom the training academy of the universities there should be chair covering awareness in this dimension of protection towards children and adolescents The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence Having the support of reporting portals creates awareness among the police and state agencies to address these problems Information technology is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence it is important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of sexual violence in joint manner this includes the family the state and the society Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people consistently mentioned the need to promote information and prevention on topics related to the use of digital environments number of them believe that information about it is not disseminated widely and as consequence it does not reach those who are most at risk of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse Some young people specifically raised the need to inform parents and adult family members so they become able to educate their children about the risks involved in the use of the Internet According to one young person the usage of mobile phones and particularly of social media should be monitored by caregivers who are the utmost responsible for childrens safety online One young person said that promoting information about this type of violence is useful not only to alert people of the risks but also to increase the reports Knowing about cybercrimes that would have made me stop bit and would have realized that what was happening to me was that was being the victim of crime For us as young people it is important to recognise the strategies that these people use to manipulate and deceive and thus achieve to identify and stop them Not knowing how they act gives them an advantage to be able to deceive us VoSCOL Parents give their children access to cell phone to entertain themselves and they use it for other things its way for exploiters to get closer Parents need to pay more attention and have more

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaBarriers to disclosure Seeking help may be challenge due to the stigma and judgments surrounding reporting mechanisms and support services Unfortunately this stigma can come from those who were supposed to protect and support children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse Fear of being recognised judged and stigmatised were main barriers to disclosure that came up in the conversations with young people They described situations where they were blamed by frontline support workers while reporting Fear of revictimisation and distrust of formal reporting mechanisms were also mentioned by the young people as barriers to disclosure They mentioned situations in which they were forced to repeat their statements due to the high turnover of frontline workers and consistently referred to fears of their abuse andor exploitation being reduced to scandal as one of the reasons that led them to think The barriers to disclosure were also explored in the survey with frontline workers as indicated in Figure The respondents were presented with list of factors that could potentially limit childrens disclosure of on line sexual exploitation and abuse By far the two most commonly selected barriers to reporting were related to pervasive culture of silence the stigma and shame that victims often experience at and to fears about how others will respond to disclosure These accounts confirm the fears of anticipated shame and stigma associated with sexual exploitation and abuse The attitudes and responses of those people charged with receiving these disclosures may have enormous impacts on childrenA cousin sought help for me and went to the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare psychologist

Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people also mentioned that they feared being threatened and blackmailed by the offenders One young woman said that over time children subjected to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse As shown in Figure coincidentally psychological support was one of the most common services provided by the frontline workers When asked about the different types of direct support services provided by their organisations to children who have experienced sexual exploitation twothirds reported offering oneonone counselling The other most common service provided was support for families and caregivers Describing the type of service provided one surveyed frontline worker said She said that although she recognised the situation of sexual exploitation and abuse and wanted to escape she could not disclose because the offender threatened her and her family Support services It is essential to understand the perceived quality usefulness and accessibility of support services related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online This section presents some insights on these elements followed by more detailed overview of the different types of support services provided in Colombia taking into account both the experiences of young survivors within these services as well as the views of frontline workers providing them Usefulness quality availability and awareness of support services All of the young people who engaged in the conversations accessed support services from Fundacin Renacer and Colombian Institute of Family Welfare in the city of Cartagena They said that once they knew about and accessed the services the availability of support was very useful for them to recover One young man said that the psychological support was what helped him the mostAre trapped in fear of harming their families VoSCOL came to Renacer through friend At first didnt want to come but wanted to see the light at the end

exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaWhen asked about the quality of government activities to address child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia frontline workers provided some criticisms particularly of government financial support Most of the respondents rated the quality of government funding on this topic as either poor or nonexistent The frontline workers also expressed dissatisfaction with both the availability and quality of medical psychological legal and reintegration services for children who have experienced online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia Responses on medical and psychological services were more positive with around of frontline workers rating the availability and quality of these services as either good or excellent However all four sets of services were rated as poor in terms of availability and quality by between of frontline workers suggesting broad need for improvement One of them commented Figure Frontline workers views on the quality of government activities Poor None Fair Good Excellent Awareness raising Funding Training Speaking publicly about child sexual exploitation think there is long way to go before the quality to respond to the needs of the victims is achieved together with the proper handling of the information Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaTypes of support services Psychological support As previously mentioned in this report psychological support was very much appreciated by the young people who engaged in the conversations All of them recognised this type of support as key to helping them overcome the impacts of online sexual exploitation and abuse In the conversations the young people expressed appreciation and emphasised the importance of these services for survivors in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration Referring to his psychologist one young man said She arrived and brightened my life VoSCOL She the psychologist treated me like human being she made me understand that was important she showed me the things had to overcome she touched my heart We made good connection it helped me to tell my mother that was homosexual it helped me to be free VoSCOLThey mentioned personal growth selfacceptance and selfknowledge as the main accomplishments after going through psychological assistance Indeed surveyed frontline workers said that children who experienced online sexual exploitation and abuse most commonly identified counselling among their biggest needs respondent

AssistanceInformationEducation Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaPsychological support was also considered essential by the frontline workers who responded to the survey In the hypothetical scenarios counsellingpsychotherapy was frequently noted For example providing qualitative input on one of the scenarios worker said that In Colombia it was really encouraging to see that in some cases family members also had access to psychological support In the conversations one young woman said that in family therapy session she could tell her mother about the sexual exploitation that she had been subjected to Another one mentioned that all members of her support network including mother father siblings and aunt participated in psychotherapy sessions which she considered essential for her recovering process as they created caring and trusting relationship young man mentioned that the psychological support that he and his family received helped them to accept his sexual orientation and understand his situation Describing the impact of the family therapeutic process he said Commenting about situation where the family members were not involved one young person mentioned feeling lonely and once their father was included in the sessions the situation became better However some young people felt that family members could be better supported and monitored particularly when they lived in other cities or were not motivated in participate in the therapeutic process Scenario question Bernard who lives in Australia pays yearold in Colombia Ana to undress while they are on video call Do you believe that Ana is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse What practical steps would you take if you were the service provider supporting yearold AnaA therapy process would have to be carried out with the adolescent so that she can understand that she was sexually exploited online taking into account that they used this medium to obtain the material as well as psychosocial process that allows the adolescent to be in safe space They care about me but they give me freedom can go out alone they trust me VoSCOL Thanks to that am who am VoSCOL My family wasnt there at the beginning nobody found out had no one was on the street Later my father got involved thanks to the intervention of social workers They improved many things The involvement of the family changed lot however the families lacked more followup after discharge telephone call isnt sufficient VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe psychological support services secured the young peoples emotional and psychological state in the aftermath of the online sexual exploitation and abuse experiences and were considered essential for their recovery process It is worth noting however that the young people also noted that psychological services are not sufficiently accessible and available to all children who have gone through the experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse Indeed this was the case for number of young people who engaged in the conversations who lost interest in studies after facing such trauma Some young people mentioned in the conversations that as part of the psychological support that they accessed they were encouraged to go back to school and to improve their academic performance Emphasising the importance of the personal growth obtained in her recovery process one young woman said The young people highlighted in the conversations the need to strengthen sexual education in schools One of them described the type of sexual education that she had at school as only focused on avoiding pregnancy with no mention to the risks involved in the use of the Internet or how to identify situation of sexual exploitation and abuse There were lot of children and very few psychologists more therapy which is more continuous intense and frequent was needed single psychologist had to attend many children This having more psychologists would have helped them to overcome their problems more quickly VoSCOL If they prepare our personal growth we have solid basis to go out into the world later on Personally want to finish school study interior design or psychology VoSCOL Apart from studies and professional training first you have to be person VoSCOLEducational and pedagogical support When asked what were the biggest problems shared to them by children who experienced sexual exploitation and abuse online most of the surveyed frontline workers mentioned fear trauma and anxiety followed by social isolationmarginalisation and lack of assistance informationservices Providing qualitative inputs to the survey about social isolation one frontline worker commented that it is Not easy to go back to school Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSexuality is not discussed in the family between parents and their children at school with teachers If sexuality was discussed more frequently children would not see it as sin as bad thing and they would not be deceived so easily VoSCOL The school can play an important role psychologists can train students as peer support Older students can train children among young people they understand each other more but they must be supervised by someone VoSCOLThe frontline workers survey included hypothetical scenario involving educational institutions quarter of the frontline workers expressed that the school should be informed whenever child is subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse When asked about the practical steps that should be taken to deal with such situations one of the respondents answered The import role that schools could play in preventing child sexual exploitation and abuse online was mentioned in the conversations One young woman proposed that educational spaces could organise peer support trained by specialised psychologists Unfortunately school teachers and the pedagogical staff were mentioned as not supportive of or cooperative with children in their experiences One young woman told us that she used to go to school to escape from situations of violence within her family but no one at school was attentive to the changes in her behaviour at the time She did not know the school psychologist and did not have anyone to talk School psychologists are often the first point of call for young people and can facilitate referral to other services Additionally the education system should work as protection mechanism for children enabling sense of belonging and stability Without easy access to these professionals gaining entry to the support structures can be difficult particularly as children simply do not know how and where to start Scenario question Carmen is yearold student Carmen has struggled to make good grades this year and is worried that Juan teacher who is close family friend will tell Carmens dad Carmen offers to send Juan naked pictures if he promises not to talk to the family Do you think that Carmen is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse London Metropolitan University Key messages from research on child sexual exploitation Professionals in school settings Psychosocial approach to obtain data on the exploitation situation report to directors of the Institution carry out an approach with the family activate legal channels awareness so that Carmen is recognised as victim and establish the relevance those practices Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaLegal support Even though all nine young people who engaged in the conversations had received legal support only three mentioned this type of assistance In all these three cases the young people said that the legal support helped them to understand that they had been subjected to form of sexual exploitation and abuse For instance one young woman said that the legal support that she received helped her to feel relieved and to recognise herself as victim after long time of selfblaming and selfharming behaviour In another situation young man considered that the police and prosecutors acted diligently initiating the process of restoration of his rights and prosecuting the offenders who were arrested for these crimes Unfortunately noy all the experiences involving legal support were positive One young man mentioned that although he did have access to this type of support he felt left in the dark about the process as those providing legal services did not communicate often with him or his family As shown earlier in this report in Figure of the surveyed frontline workers reported that their organisations offer legal support for children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse Legal assistance was among the very first steps that should be taken according to the surveyed frontline workers in all the scenariobased questions which involved cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse online When asked about the practical steps to take as service providers to help fictitious female adolescent subjected to live streaming of child sexual abuse legal action was raised by of the surveyed frontline workers Describing the necessary steps one respondent listed Immediate activation of the health channels Initial care Guidance to the family on legal actions complaint and process for the restoration of rights Referral to psychotherapeutic care Scenario question Bernard who lives in Australia pays yearold in Colombia Ana to undress while they are on video call Do you believe that Ana is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaFinancial support Frontline workers were asked whether child victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse have the possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings whether from convicted perpetrators or countrymanaged funds More than half of the respondents indicated that they did not know the answer while responded positively In Colombia article of the Code of Penal Procedure states that all victims of any crime once the conviction is final have the right to receive compensation for the crime suffered Government of Colombia Code of Penal Procedure Law of Article When asked in the survey if they know of any children who had been subjected to online sexual exploitation and abuse and had received compensation for the crimes they suffered Colombia the majority of surveyed frontline workers either indicated that they did not or that they didnt know how to answer the question The young people who engaged in the conversations did not talk about benefiting or not from financial compensation Figure Do child victims of online child sexual exploitation or abuse have the possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings from convicted perpetrators or countrymanaged funds Figure Based on your work experience do you know if any child subjected to online sexual exploitation and abuse have received compensation for the crimes they suffered in ColombiaYes YesDont know Dont knowNo NoPhoto by Flavia Carpio RECOMMENDATIONS Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe recommendations presented below are primarily drawn from the conversations with the young people who took part in the conversations While the survey with frontline workers raised important issues and supported the analysis this report seeks to privilege the voices and perspectives of survivors Additional clarification and explanations from the analyses are provided in places from the project partners contributed during the analysis and writeup stage Recommendations on reporting mechanisms Promote information and awareness about risks in the online environment related to sexual exploitation and abuse as well as about reporting mechanisms and available support services when harm occurs It is necessary to Provide educational programmes for communities and family members about prevention of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse For all of the young people who engaged in the conversations the family plays an important role both in the prevention and protection of children Therefore it is crucial that family members have the capacity to educate children about the risks of Internet usage It is also important that they create spaces of dialogue where children feel confident to disclose and know how to guide children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse in the process of reportingReach the communities with the message of prevention recognition of these crimes and promote reporting allowing more and more people to learn about the issue commit themselves and support the defence of childrens rights and the report of the offenders VoSCOL Today its easier for the problem to arise because parents ignore the role of educating their children they dont see the dangers on social media VoSCOLThis recommendation was supported by the surveyed frontline workers When provided the opportunity to share any last thoughts at the end of the survey almost half emphasised the lack of general public awareness related to this topic as major issue in Colombia One of them said that It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence it is important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of sexual violence in joint manner this includes the family the state and the society Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe surveyed frontline workers also mentioned family members need to be better informed in order to prevent such crimes In order to create these resources one frontline worker recommended consulting children to make sure that their needs are taken into account Improve the availability and dissemination of reporting mechanisms creating childfriendly tools and making use of digital methods The reporting mechanisms should be as accessible as possible and available in easytouse online formats Impose legal duties on and promote collaboration with Internet service providers and social media companies These requirements ensure that providers will promptly comply with law enforcement requests for takedown of child sexual abuse material as well as to comply promptly with law enforcement requests for information This will assist investigations into crimes and limit the wide distribution of child sexual abuse material In the conversations young people said that social networks and other digital media do not display any prevention suggestions According to the young people they also do not respond to complaints other than sometimes blocking content They therefore recommend that Internet providers should have visible information on the risks associated to Internet usageI believe that victims should be heard Many formulations are made based on the thoughts of some people without considering the needs of the victims Resources for the care of children and adolescents are scarce and governments are resorting to stringer campaigns to position themselves politically and to ensure resources reach the childhood To large extent crimes related to technological means give merit to the lack of knowledge from the legal assistance and guidance perspective and the support that the family provides and to prevent children from becoming network victims Information must be increased the permanent dissemination of digital channels or complaints Create an easily accessible chat to report or make an application VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaRecommendations on support services Better promote the availability of full range of specialised support services for children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online Any child who goes through such an experience should have access to specialists who can help them These professionals should be specialised and know the specifics of these cases The care programmes which exist are insufficient there is need for more because there are many children who come to services for help and information and they dont know how to talk and who to tell Care centres should be developed in the most vulnerable sectors VoSCOL Lack of specialised support services was also highlighted by one surveyed frontline worker surveyed frontline worker emphasised the limited trained professionals One of the challenges that children and adolescents victims of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation face is the late psychology support from the health sector due to the poor quality provided by this service and they do not have professional hired to do so The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence Having the support of the pages for the reporting purposes creates awareness among the police and state agencies to address these problems Officials dont have empathy they dont understand the consequences of violence they revictimise They lack training VoSCOL Commit financial resources to provide training and capacity building opportunities to law enforcement officers and legal professionals on topics related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Both the young people who engaged in the conversations and the frontline workers who responded to the survey spoke about the need to improve the capacities of service providers Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in Colombia Improve the investigation and prosecution of online sexual crimes against children Law enforcement should improve approaches to conducting investigations of online forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation Improvements are needed to ensure offenders are brought to justice and that those who have been subjected to such crimes are able to access compensation and other legal remedies This would also encourage other children to report sexual abuse and exploitation believe that for this crime despite the increased number of victims the actions implemented are insufficient the victims are unknown there is lack of commitment of parents regarding prevention there is lack of reaction of legal entities for the prosecution of the offenders and this last point involves series of terrible consequences for the victims on how much the population believes in the importance of the complaint and increases the probability of having new victims You can nd more

increase the application opportunities of content across platformsThe use of trusted and credible influencers spokespersons and champions is wellestablished practice in the field of social and behaviour change including within the digital sphere BOX ENGAGING MEN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF HARMFUL PRACTICES In Senegal UNICEFs supported programme used combination of education and social mobilization to empower women and communities to reduce FGM and child marriage The strategic approach involve seeking the buyin of male village leaders employ local facilitators to teach education sessions tap into local communication channels and use community dialogue with both men and women The programme purposely targeted men to enlist their support and mobilized male community and religious leaders as well as engaging women and girls in an effort to ensure that abandoning FGM was collective and explicit decision involving wholecommunity approach Evaluation results from the male engagement component of this work showed positive changes in knowledge attitudes and behaviours which ultimately led to public declaration against FGM and early marriage as well as slight reduction in child marriages COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGEPRETEST YOUR CONCEPTS Factor in time and money to pretest your concepts with your intended audiences to ensure they resonate and are received and understood the way you expect them to be For guidance on pretesting you can refer to this pretesting guide developed by UNICEF during the COVID pandemic Try to personalize data and feeds based on your users characteristics generated from clickdata research that indicate the type of content they are more likely to engage with To learn more about this see this story from UNICEF Senegal on rural outreach on health and human rights infobycountrysenegalhtml THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT LANGUAGE AND LITERACY Assess the level of literacy of your intended audiences to determine how to engage with them digitally and what language and terms to use Where literacy levels are low IVR and audiovisuals may be more appropriate Ensure that your content is available in relevant languages and remember that language can also be politicizing factor in some contexts FACTOR IN COSTS AND DATA LIMITATIONS For greater and more equitable reach and utilization of your digital platforms explore how to minimize data consumption Your programmes should be cognizant that portion of your audience sometimes the majority will have limited minutes data and text message allowances Consider also that smartphones often come equipped with preinstalled applications for example Facebook Lite and with free minutes available for specific platforms Knowing the common standard free applications supported by data packages will help you select digital channels that are more likely to be accessed by your intended users Webbased solutions often have greater potential to reach remote or lowincome communities than application based solutions as many lowend devices do not have access to an application store but come with builtin web browsers BUDGET FOR MODERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTENT AND COMMENTS If your platforms include an interactive component discussion groups virtual sessions questions and answers etc allocate the required resources to respond to and moderate those activities Moreover in recent years online platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp have been increasingly used to spread false and misleading information including during the current COVID pandemic Women and girls are especially likely to face harassment online in particular when they speak out on gender discrimination or against deepseated cultural and social norms It is recommended that you budget sufficient resources to monitor moderate and manage content within your digital communication platforms looking out for and removing any harmful content and comments If your country benefits from UReport consider engaging existing UPartners for content moderation Often these partners are trained in comment moderation AVAIL CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL DEMAND GENERATED It is likely that your digital activities will generate increased demand for services and information Indicate clearly in your online communication where users can go andor call for support and ensure you have the capacity in place to respond Inability to respond to increased demand for services will frustrate your participants reduce their trust in your activities UNICEFUNIMAWA COVID

the UNICEFsupported Guidance on Responsible Data for Children documents CONSIDER HOW TO ENGAGE WITH OFFLINE USERS THROUGH MOBILE TECHNOLOGY IVR and RapidPro systems allow you to engage with offline users using lowend mobile phones IVR for example allows people to call and leave messages or to listen to prerecorded messages left by other users Such system enables information sharing and collection of feedback and opinions by encouraging intended audiences to call and leave message These messages can then be used to inform massmedia programming for example radio or TV which in turn encourage audiences to callin and answer or ask questions or provide comments thus generating continuous dialogue with intended audiences For an example on how IVR technology can be used please refer to Box MAKE PLAN FOR FEEDBACK As your digital solution inquiries about users preferences and opinions inform your activities and services make plan to share feedback with your users as often as possible Inform them about how improved information sharing services are available to them or how what they share will be used This creates virtuous data cycle incentivizing your users to share more information more frequently with greater honesty and accuracy USING COMPLEMENTARY CHANNELS FOR GREATER IMPACT Despite the extensive reach of digital approaches and their flexible options for various degrees of engagement there is little evidence that they will succeed in changing behaviours and social and gender norms if used in isolation For effective engagement digital approaches need to be complemented by other channels and reinforced through multiple media Even in times of physical distancing interventions should continue to operate across levels of the socioecological model SEM Table provides some examples for engaging remotely with intended audiences across the SEM Many of the examples listed are digital however some nondigital remote engagement channels are also suggested for message reinforcement BOX MESSAGING FOR MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH THE APONJON EXAMPLE FROM BANGLADESH Aponjon meaning dear one in Bangla is the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Actions MAMA programme in Bangladesh aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality through mobile communication technology Adaptable timesensitive and stagebased information on maternal and infant health issues is delivered directly to expectant and new mothers through SMS or interactive voice response IVR Almost of users from rural areas selected to receive messages through IVR indicating the popularity of this approach among rural populations Aponjon delivers twice weekly messages that are entertaining and educational formatted in miniskits with actors playing out real life scenarios as characters such as pregnant women doctors husbands and mothersin law MAMA Bangladesh also created unique messaging service specifically for husbands to reinforce messages provided to their wives and encourage their involvement in decisionmaking on pregnancy birth and infant care An evaluation of Aponjon indicated that women reporting at least months use of the service were approximately times more likely than nonusers to score high on both maternal healthcare knowledge and related practices such as attending antenatal care visits taking ironfolic acid during pregnancy or taking vitamin after delivery Further women reporting receiving and listening to at least messages per month were almost twice as likely to have higher knowledge score and better related practices for maternal health compared to nonusers For

UNICEFUNITYLLE COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE MONITORING AND EVALUATION Even in the realm of digital engagement it is important to put in place key metrics that allow you to monitor if and how your digital engagement activities are contributing to the programme goals Many social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter come with builtin analytic dashboards Thirdparty software platforms also exist that can help you monitor social media analytics Both the inbuilt and thirdparty platforms can track metrics such as clicks likes tags shares and reposts In most cases these metrics give information about reach with little insight into uptake interest or actual changes in attitudes or behaviours Social media sentiment analysis metrics go beyond reach to measure user interest by grouping together different actions by users such as comments and engagement with content and categorizing them as negative neutral or positive In social norms programming this can give sense of the users attitudes and feelings about the topic When choosing the metrics for your digital activities consider the following tips nUse few carefully selected core metrics Define key metrics that can help you measure your intervention Understand the user journey and how metrics along the way engagement with particular content journey completion can provide insights into their experience with and response to your digital content nMeasure quickly and often Digital technologies are iterative and fast changing with users accessing and interacting with them in constantly evolving ways Short iterative evaluations at regular intervals help you monitor the user experience and make prompt required adjustments to your digital content nExplore ways to investigate impact Find ways to explore how online engagement translates into offline behaviour Online surveys comment analysis and analysis of usergenerated content can help understand feelings intention and impact among users If you are conducting regular assessments as described at the start of this note add some questions on respondents engagement with your digital content for example utilization and recall Coupled with the other questions in your assessment information about respondents engagement with your digital activities can give an indication of its contribution towards any changes in other metrics measured by the assessments attitude intention beliefs feelings In Nepal the Rupantaran empowerment programme for example has been adapted to run through the radio and changes in girls knowledge are being assessed through random SMS messages after each show nOffline measurement is still important Where possible supplement your digital data with offline approaches such as case studies focus group discussions observations and other qualitative methods Such assessments help explore why and how users engage with your digital approaches and if and how they apply what they have learned offline When lockdown measures prevent face toface meetings and where connectivity allows you can conduct these qualitative assessments remotely using online media such as zoom calls Facebook Messenger and other communication applications RISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS As part of its Global Risk Communication and Community Engagement RCCE response for COVID UNICEF has developed three key indicators pertaining to digital and traditional media that are also included in the global Humanitarian Action of Children HAC appeal and the global Situation Report SitRep on COVID To align approaches the three RCCE indicators listed below can also help in obtaining sense of how activities around harmful practices are progressing nReach The number of people reached through oneway channels of communication nEngagement The number of people involved in participatory actions nFeedback The number of people sharing their concerns and asking questions clarifications for available support services to address their needs through established feedback mechanisms For breakdown on each indicator and how it can be adapted to harmful practices please refer to Appendix Media analytics is the practice of analysing digital interactions on social media platforms using various forms of data It can be used to track your intended audiences opinions and needs in relation to your topic or practice of interest COVID DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE CONSIDERATIONS FOR GOING DIGITAL While digital channels offer potential for increased reach and engagement there are also important challenges around equitable access Gender disability income education and geography can all affect if and how your intended users engage with your digital activities The following questions will help you assess the feasibility of including digital approaches in your social norms interventions reflect on potential risks and consider ways to reduce exclusion and exacerbation of pre existing power imbalances nCost Consider the cost of your digital programme and assess whether your intended audience is able to afford engaging with your content nLiteracy and language Ensure that the digital channel you choose uses the language of your intended audience and is in an accessible format Lower literacy levels will require more visual and audio content Remember that in some settings women and girls have lower literacy levels than men and boys nTechnology skills Assess whether your intended audience has the technology skills and confidence required to interact with your content Consider any differences in skills between audience segments for example rural versus urban populations girlswomen versus boys men young versus older people or wealthy versus poor nCultural norms Reflect on any local customs that may limit or prohibit access to digital technology and mobile devices In some cases there may be negative cultural reactions to some audience segments particularly girls and women using mobile phones and the internet nGender digital divide The gender digital divide is rooted in discriminatory social and gender norms which affect the ability of girls to access and engage with digital technologies In some contexts girls do not have the same access to digital technologies or to devices as boys or they may only be able to access mobile device through male household member Often girls and women have limited time for media consumption due to high volumes of chores They may also have limited opportunities for learning and development which impacts their skills and confidence to interact with digital content denying them voice for sharing experiences and speaking out against harmful practices Programmes need to reflect on whether including digital component may exclude girls and women and further exacerbate gender imbalances nDisability Consider how accessible your digital content is to people with impairments Assess what assistive technology is available to make your content inclusive nPhone lines internet connection and electricity supply Consider the available infrastructure phone lines and connectivity as well as electricity supply Disparate infrastructure may mean that segment of your audience is unable to access your digital programme nEthical considerations The digital age has amplified existing risks and in some cases created new ones Child abuse exploitation and trafficking online still occur and children are increasingly facing range of other online risks such as cyberbullying hate speech harassment and exposure to unsuitable content It is essential that children are able to participate in safe online environment benefit from safe devices applications and platforms and have the ability to use the internet safely Ethical considerations need to be at the heart of any digital engagement strategy to ensure protection of young users

is already functioning in the country and add relevant content on harmful practices MagicBox is UNICEFs big data platform which is involved in measuring the secondary effects of COVID to understand the impacts on social behaviour education sentiment opinion and vulnerable populations In addition it provides guidance on how to pinpoint and combat misinformation about COVID While not strictly related to harmful practices having an awareness of how communities are responding can help shape programming around harmful practices as well RapidPro is digital messaging platform that powers programmes such as the Internet of Good Things UReport and Chatbots It allows programmes to develop messages that can be disseminated to specific groups while also collecting data via SMS and other

response efforts include the development of RCCE indicators to promote consistency in global regional and country level reporting on RCCE indicators pertaining to digital and traditional media These indicators are included in the global Humanitarian Action for Children HAC appeal and the global Situation Report SitRep on COVID The three following indicators are proposed nReach the number of people reached through oneway channels of communication nEngagement the number of people involved in participatory actions nFeedback the number of people sharing their concerns and asking questions

PLATFORMINDICATORS DEFINITION AND RATIONAL TOOLS Social media Indicator The number of impressions per post on content relating harmful practices Definition While the exact definition of an impression varies among different social media platforms it can be defined as the number of times your content enters persons screen Facebook organic impressions are the number of times any content from your page or about your page entered persons screen Facebook paid impressions measure how often your ads were on screen for your target audience Instagram Impressions measure the total number of times users saw your post or story Twitter Impressions are defined as any time Twitter user sees one of your tweets LinkedIn Impressions are the number of times the updates were shown to members For any other social media networks please refer to their specific definitions Calculation Select your top performing social media channel eg Facebook and identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the reporting period For these posts take the total number of impressions and divide by the number of posts Rationale On social media reach and impressions are related concepts that can indicate exposure to messaging Prioritizing impressions is recommended as this is standard easily accessible metric across most major social media platformsNative analytics for each social media platform eg Facebook Twitter Analytics Instagram Insights etc Web Indicator The number of unique pageviews for content related to harmful practices Definition Aggregate number of unique views to the programmes harmful practices web pages generated by the same user in the same session during the reporting period ie the number of sessions during which the page was viewed one or more times within hour period Rationale The number of unique pageviews is an indication of how many times messages related to harmful practices on UNICEF or partner webpages are viewed It also helps to identify which postspages are most popular to help shape future content strategies This is an easily available metric that can be aggregated across relevant web pages relating to harmful practices Considerations The number of unique pageviews is simple approach that is easily accessible to most country offices across different skill levels and capacity using Google Analytics Alternatively countries can choose to report on of users for specific harmful practices pages if they have the capacity to configure Google Analytics to limit this data to specific pagesGoogle Analytics TV and radio Indicator The number

visitors who access relevant content on IOGT Definition Number of users accessing pages tagged for harmful practices and related content Rationale site visitor represents single person that may access multiple articles or messages on harmful practices on the IOGT site This indicator is defined by Google Analytics as user tracks site visitors by IP address that ensures no doublecounting occurs of the same person visiting multiple sitesGoogle Data Studio Dashboard Other digital toolsIndicator Can be adapted from some of the suggested indicators above Rationale Offices may employ additional digital tools such as Viamo or CommCare to reach target populations with information and messages When measuring the reach of messages with these tools reporting should focus on capturing the number of unique users reached Ignored prompts do not qualify for reach reporting but can be used to inform programmatic decision making around priority messages and audience preferences Effort should be

Select your top performing social media channel eg Facebook and identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the reporting period For these posts take the total number of engagements and divide by the number of posts Rationale Due to the limitations of existing tools there is no simple accurate way to convert the number of engagements to the number of people engaged Accordingly this metric aims to give an indication of the number of people engaged through social media while reducing the potential for double counting Public engagements indicate support and interest in your content and they are also more easily comparable across different platforms Dividing the total number of engagements by the number of posts reduces the risk of double counting Focusing on your top performing

University UK ABSTRACT Eorts have been made in recent years to ensure there is su cient capacity within nation states to respond to and combat Online Child Sexual Exploitation OCSE The UKled WeProtect Global Alliance initiative has outlined Model National Response MNRto which large number of nations have already committed OCSE like cybercrime is very often crime with international dimensions If we could start again knowing what we know now about OCSE what would model international response look like Does this help us identify gaps in the existing internationalresponse that can be opportunities for improvement This article maps an optimal international response to the problem of OCSE Drawing on and complementing the We Protect Global Alliance Model National Response MNR it highlights aspects peculiar to the international nature of OCSE and suggests areas for futureoperational coordination and researchARTICLE HISTORY Received February Revised May Accepted May KEYWORDS Online safety cybercrimechild sexual abuse policingpublic policy technologysecurity Setting the scene what is online child sexual exploitation OCSE The group of criminal activities today commonly referred to as online child sexual exploi tation may be most easily if at times arti cially categorised as contentrelated or contactrelated Contentrelated activities have traditionally focused on the production distribution and possession of what is often called child pornography in national legisla tive instruments and by the popular media but which is classi ed as child sexual abuse material by those working in child protectionChild Sexual Abuse Material CSAM may be broadly de ned currently as photographs or videos that depict children in erotic poses child nudity with focus on the genital area and children engaged in sexual activity be this with peers adults or alone Contactrelated activities meanwhile can be classi ed most simply as serious sexual oences against children such as rape and sexual assault While these ences are by no means new it is generally agreed that over the last years mobile phone and internet technologies have orded much greater opportunity than before for individuals to make contact with children for sexual purposes Baines Quayle and Koukopoulos UNODC This article considers international responses to the interrelated activities shown in Figure Chatham HouseCONTACT Victoria Baines OF CYBER POLICY due consideration has been given to some countries recent moves to criminalise sexual chat between adults and minors this is not included in the schema above due to an absence of international consensus on its criminal status What are the goals of combating OCSE Researchers have used number of approaches to assist in the formulation of response measures to child sexual exploitation Considering OCSE as crime problem naturally prompts responses whose chief objectives are crime prevention detection and control This is an approach with which law enforcement intelligence analysts and child protectionspecialists will be familiar Since the scope of this research is content and contact widelydeemed to be criminal response model focused on criminal justice and crime prevention is therefore an obvious choice growing number of researchers have proposed as an alternative the public health model which views OCSE as societal problem As Wortley and Smallbone explain the public health model provides for three levels of prevention Primary targeting whole populations Secondary targeting atrisk groups and Tertiary targeting those already identi ed as having problem Existing prevention measures such as online safety tools awareness programmes and removal of CSAM are populationbased strategies that sit rmly within primary prevention of OCSESupport services for those at risk of ending or victimisation would constitute secondary prevention ender treatment programmes and victim support tertiary prevention Considering the wide range of activities shown in Figure it seems helpful to develop responses that combine both public health and criminal justice approaches and to ensurethat speci functions and measures are aligned to the following highlevel goals Figure Online Child Sexual Exploitation activities BAINESProtect children Control ending Under these functional headings can be housed an array of responses from the elds of public health criminal justice and crime prevention For example protecting children can describe the work of law enforcement cials social workers and educators Controlling oending can be the work of prisons but also of therapists providing support to individ uals seeking to manage their sexual interest in children As the response to OCSE is cur rently organised at national and international levels some stakeholders are actively involved in both protecting children and controlling ending related approach that sees OCSE as commoditybased activity be this in the form of CSAM or ine contact with children and young people would set the goals in the context of economic theory as follows Reduce supply of children for online and ine sexual contact and of CSAM and Reduce demand for online and ine sexual contact with children and for CSAM This is closer to some of the models applied to organised crime which view illegitimate business structures as functioning in broadly similar fashion to legitimate business Thecomparison is sound in so far as CSAM is commoditized produced or distributed forpayment or as currency in itself and in as much as production and distribution may involve online networking of likeminded individuals OCSE conforms to the principles of supply and demand to some degree but there are dierent emotional ordances at work not least sexual grati cation in many but not all cases Application of the organised crime model is stretched particularly in those cases of oneonone sexual exploitation of child where there is no nancial element and no apparent attempt to further commoditise CSAM produced But even here we may posit that equipping children to avoid victimisation would help reduce levels of ending Closer parallels can be found in the online coercion of children and young people to produce further selfgenerated sexual content and the production of sexual content inreturn for inducements In either scenario the threat of public exposure or the promise of gain helps to check compliance with an ender wishes Each of the theoretical approaches discussed above can be used to inform the develop ment of ective responses to OCSE and to align with the two highlevel goals of protecting children and managing ending The international response model proposed in this article draws on them directly presenting an ideal against which existing policy response can be measured free from the constraints of established organisational structures The WeProtect global Alliance model national response MNR The WeProtect Global Alliance is the result of the merging of two international initiatives tocombat OCSE the UKled WeProtect launched in and the joint USEU Global Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Online launched in It is an international movement dedicated to national and global action to end the sexual exploitation of children online and now counts countries technology companies and civil society and international organisations among its members JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY The initiative sagship document is the WeProtect Model National Response MNR the intention of which is to help country evaluate its current response identify gaps prior itise national orts to ll those gaps and by establishing common set of aspirations for all countries enhance international cooperation It sets out desired capabilities for sig natory countries Policy Governance Leadership Research Analysis and Monitoring Legislation Criminal Justice Dedicated Law Enforcement Judiciary and Prosecutors Oender Management Process Access to Image Databases Victim Endtoend Support Child Protection Workforce Compensation Remedies and Complaints Arrangements Child Helpline Societal CSEA Hotline Education Programme Child Participation ender Support Systems Industry Takedown Procedures CSEA Reporting Innovative Solution Development Corporate Social Responsibility Media and Communications Ethical and Informed Media Reporting Universal Terminology It is not the intention of this article to subject the MNR to full critique not least because its professed scope of Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse is wider than online child sexual exploitation Nevertheless one can observe from the above that the MNR groups responses variously according to function governance communicationapproach societal criminal justice sector industry and individual stakeholder victim From methodological perspective it is therefore something of hybrid perhaps re ecting BAINESthe complexity of the issue and of the measures already being delivered in countries whose responses are deemed to be the most advanced or sophisticated By design the MNR makes recommendations for national sovereign capabilities But since the majority of OCSE has an international component it may be asserted that national capabilities alone are insu cient to combat OCSE ectively As the WePro tect Global Threat Assessment acknowledges Solely focusing on national level response will not meet the international challenges of this global threat Recognition of this fact is the rst step to developing more collaborative and therefore ective approaches to safeguarding and justice Accordingly this article proposes new model for responding to OCSE that outlines the optimal response functions with particular focus on the international level An optimal international response to OCSE Modelling method review was conducted of academic publications grey literature such as law enforcementthreat assessments and reports by nongovernmental organisations and open sourcematerial including public statements and media coverage From this were identi ed estab lished and emerging trends in OCSE proposed approaches to combating them progress todate and operational challenges This in turn enabled mapping of both the functionsrequired for an optimal international response Figure and the existing stakeholder environment Figure The free software SimpleMind was used to map the models Figure personify then circulated among professionals with specialist experience of combat ing OCSE in law enforcement industry nongovernmental and other international organ isations Review by this group validated the model and number of amendments were made based on their feedback The model Figure maps the functions identi ed as optimal for combating OCSE ectively in line with the toplevel goals of protecting children and controlling ending The choice of functionbased approach rather than one based on stakeholders capabilities is deliberate The aim is to envi sion an ideal response informed by what we know about OCSE in independent of the organisational structures hitherto developed to respond to the problem It makes the assump tion that even the proudest and most partisan of stakeholders can identify things that couldhave been done di erently or better had the various national and international responses to OCSE not developed rapidly in reaction to large and unforeseen increase in such crimes Consequently this research does not take as given that the existing structures for responding to OCSE are optimal even in those countries with the most extensive or sophisticated provision Discussion The model comprises single global set of responses to be delivered at national and international levels to varying degrees This approach has been chosen to maximise utility for all specialist stakeholders and nonspecialists alikeJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY Figure Proposed international model for responding to Online Child Sexual Exploitation BAINESMapping functions in this way highlights number of aspects worthy of further con sideration In the rst instance viewing existing policy responses through lens of the ideal allows for the identi cation of gaps and opportunities for improvement In the second numerous overlaps between functions make evident that none of them can operate in isolation For example victim identi cation is an activity of law enforcement in the course of criminal investigation but may also be part of an international crisis response in the event of live instance of sexual extortion of child The goal of controlling or managing ending sits across disruption therapeutic support criminal justice and awarenessprevention to varying degrees Technical measuresto prevent convicted enders or those exhibiting ending behaviours from accessing online services through which they can contact children legal approaches that impose oine restrictions and requirements in order to reduce opportunity and therefore risk behavioural therapy and live advice from helpline such as StopItNow may all assist an individual at risk of ending against children to manage their own impulses Law enforce ment initiatives such as the European Union PolicePeer may seek to divert suspected downloaders of CSAM towards support services by intervening directly on peertopeerlesharing platforms In order to be accurate and useful Insight Analysis will necessarily rely on intelligence and information from all of the other functions Prevention is fundamental theme of several of the toplevel functions and numerous response measures shown It inevitably dominates the awarenessprevention responseslisted especially target hardening in the form of safety programmes for children and their guardians and capacity building for educators and other practitioners coming into contact with children in accordance with the public health model of combatingoine child sexual abuse technical measures for example age veri cation can help to ensure children have access to ageappropriate online environments and contentwhere their risk of sexual contact with adults can be reduced and therapeutic providerscan also assist children in reducing their vulnerability to victimisation Some of the functions have less obviously international dimensions than others Thera peutic support will for the most part be delivered at national level but capacity buildingfor practitioners in this eld may well be provided by or under the auspices of international organisations Delivery of technical prevention and disruption measures at scale almost always has an international dimension not least when they are deployed on global online platforms The international dimension of responding to OCSE is most evident in the Criminal Justice and Crisis Response functions where government authorities in one countryrequire the timely assistance of entities in another Two scenarios will serve to illustratethe character and pressing nature of the challenges Criminal justice The victimisation of child in Country is reported to the local police In accordance withthe WeProtect Global Alliance MNR Country has national specialist law enforcementunit dedicated to the investigation of CSE Initial investigation reveals that the child has been encouraged to expose themselves online to an unknown person In order to identify this person police in Country need to request data pertaining to their registration onand usage of several online services typical scenario would be for request to be made to social media provider for the subscriber and login information for anJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY account This most often includes registration data phone and email identi ers attached to an account and IP addresses for recent activity If the provider is based in Country and the data is stored there domestic legislation will su ce to compel the production of the information sought in timely manner This is typically the procedure for requests to local Internet Service Providers ISPs for metadata concerning home internet usage If however the provider is located and the data stored in another country the legislationof Country has no extraterritorial force to compel the data production This has histori cally been the case for law enforcement agencies outside the US seeking data from large USbased online providers The process is further complicated where cloud storage may hinder attempts by authorities to identify the location of data at speci time Gillespie The importance of communications data to OCSE investigations is re ected in its inclusion in the regularly updated model legislation and global review of instruments produced by the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children Remedies exist in the diplomatic sphere most notably the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties MLAT agreed between countries for bilateral assistance in criminal investigations Butthe majority of these agreements were made before the mass adoption of internet tech nologies and the misuse of instant communication for serious crimes such as OCSE UNODC While some countries such as the US have exceptions that permit emergency disclosure in circumstances indicating threat to life or limb on the wholenational legislations either do not provide for or may strictly prohibit direct disclosure of personal data held in one country to government authorities in another Various initiatives are currently underway to modify individual agreements or inter national legislation At the time of writing the UK is seeking to conclude an agreement with the US which will permit UK law enforcement authorities to request personal data directly from US providers the European Commission has announced plans for EuropeanProduction and Preservation Orders to enable member states to request data directly from providers operating service in fellow EU member states and the recently enacted CLOUD Act empowers federal US authorities to obtain data held by US companies on serversoutside the US Crisis response The WeProtect MNR highlights the need for legislation that enables data to be requestedinternationally including from third countries but does not fully re ect the complexity inherent in that process nor the speed at which OCSE can now be committed and become lifethreatening Sexual extortion of children can rapidly progress from initial contact to crisis child in Country exposes themselves online at the request of an unknownperson That unknown person threatens the child that they will publish the material receivedor recorded unless more often more abusive material is produced or monies are paid within short time typically couple of hours day at most If the child has the courage to tell parent or guardian this may be reported to the local police In cases where the chief harm is causedby the publication of the CSAM authorities may prioritise prevention and disruption over identifying the ender Country has national specialist OCSE unit as recommended by the WeProtect MNR The only identi ers for the suspect relate to an account for video chat platform based in another country Country The alleged victim is in crisis and hasexpressed suicidal thoughts The most urgent priority is to locate the suspect account and BAINESremove the possibility for publication of the CSAM Information will then be sought with the aim of identifying and locating the suspect If the suspect is located in country other than Country where possible the information will be shared with authorities in that countryto assist in the suspect apprehension and prevent further victimisation For authorities responding to OCSE the above scenario is not uncommon As will be evident there are several possible points of failure that could result in direct physical harmto the child The child may not disclose but su er in silence the parentguardian may not report to the police local police may not understand the urgency of the situation the country may not have specialist unit with key contacts in other countries and online provi ders the online provider may not have the capacity or legal basis to respond to emergencyrequests from foreign authorities Where disruption and harm reduction are successful they rely more on interpersonal relationships than on tested or agreed process UNODC Practitioners and researchers alike have recognised the potential of sexual extortion for psychological damage selfharm and suicide Crisis intervention has historically been the remit of social workers and therapeutic providers and is key feature of the increasingly popular Barnahus interagency model for responding to child sexual exploitation andabuse But in hyperconnected world where children are encouraged to interface directly with others on global technology platforms rst responders may also be peers parents helplines hotlines educators law enforcement and online service providers all of whose actions may impact on the mental and physical wellbeing of child in potential crisis Thepublic health model requires community response and the internetmediated public is global community There is therefore an opportunity to establish an international and multiagency emergency response that reduces the immediate harm of OCSE for childrenin crisis enabled by an agreed operational framework and resourced for rapid action It should be emphasised that crisis response is also necessary for OCSE enders and potential enders Individuals struggling to control or come to terms with their urges to commit OCSE ences will often require urgent live support Adequate resourcing for help lines is therefore essential to prevent harm to enders as well as reduce ending Why has focus on crisis response largely been absent to date from strategies to combat OCSE possible explanation lies in the fact that both legal measures and research have historically been focused primarily on CSAM and not on the full range of OCSE ences Europol The requirement for criminalisation of nonimagebased OCSE activities such as grooming is comparatively recent development The Lanzarote Convention enacted in and the EU Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography are the landmark international instruments in this regard In some signatory countries are yet to ratify the convention and fully transpose the directive into their national legislations Continued policy focus on technical measures for eradicating CSAM is well founded aimed as it is at reducing supply and revictimisation improving practitioner resilience and coordinating responses But its emphasis on les rather than live scenarios involving children has not kept pace with the changing methods of victimisation There is further opportunity to recalibrate international responses to ensure they meet the goal of protecting children Phippen Legislative measures alone cannot ensure timely international response to OCSE emergencies Human capacity is required to maintain international relationships not only within national law enforcement authorities but also in the companies receiving emergency requests for assistance The major US tech companies publish transparencyJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY reports that include statistics on the number of data requests they receive from each coun trys law enforcement agencies These numbers do not necessarily include the number of times company is called upon to disrupt or prevent OCSE or the time taken to build relationships often with multiple law enforcement cers in every country policing OCSE Recent recommendations by the European Commission that EU member states desig nate Single Points of Contact SPOCs for data requests to US providers will doubtless bewelcomed by online service providers and this re ects the identi ed need for greater coordination in international evidence gathering including in relation to OCSE This is especially the case for smaller providers who may lack the capacity and resources to assist global law enforcement to the extent of the large global technology companies Insight and analysis The MNR identi es research analysis and monitoring of child sexual exploitation and abuse CSEA as desired capability Action to prevent and tackle CSEA is intelligence and evi denceled The nationallyagreed view is used to inform the development prioritisationand implementation of the country CSEA response and related policy and practice The ability to review progress and adapt responses to changes in the operating environmentis no less important at international level given the transnational nature of Online ChildSexual Exploitation Just as the MNR highlights that legal de ciencies in one country may lead to crime displacement so too do trends in victim and ender behaviours and also good practice in protective measures need to be shared globally and in timelyfashion to ensure consistent and ective responses across countries and sectors Advances in international research and analysis of trends in OCSE have to date been sporadic and largely sectorspeci Notable examples of international law enforcement analysis of OCSE include the Virtual Global Taskforce VGT Environmental Scan an assess ment of trends in OCSE based on the contributions of law enforcement specialists in VGT member countries and organisations First produced in for the World Congress III Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children it largely re ects trends as observed in law enforcement workloads and includes consideration of possible future developments demonstrating level of foresight not required by the WeProtect MNR In terms of international reach the VGT assessments are perhaps the most representative but they are representative only of the VGT members hip including EU member states via Europol They cannot be said to accurately re ect African law enforcement se eo fO instance since no African country is VGT ember Other research such as Europol sInternet Organised Crime Threat Assessment eects law enforcement assessment of OCSE in speci geographical regionFurther phenomenon or capabilitybased analyses add to our under standing including those of the various nancial coalitions on commercial OCSE the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on sexual extortion the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children on legislation ECPAT International and Interpol on CSAM and the Cana dian Centre for Child Protection sInternational Survivor SurveyWhat has been lacking is analy sis that synthesises these ndings into global assessment with regular updates There is therefore an opportunity for truly international and multistakeholder assessment of OCSE that enables all countries and sectors to anticipate risks and threats on regular basis In this respect research and analysis has an important role to play not only in reporting andlearning but also in the primary and secondary prevention of OCSE This is no small undertak ing given the number of countries to be surveyed Interpol member countries alone number BAINES The MNR recommendation for national research and analysis capabilities would perhaps go some way to lling these gaps and generating the necessary data if all WePro tect Global Alliance countries were to commit to their establishment As recent strides in the coordination of victim identi cation illustrate technology can assist the international coordi nation of the ght against OCSE Just as Interpol International Child Sexual Exploitation ICSE database now enables investigators hotline analysts and other authorities to focus on unidentied children by agging material already investigated by the international law enforcement community so too can technological tools automate at least part of the process of data gath ering and qualitative and quantitative intelligence analysis The WeProtect Global Threat Assessment is the most recent move towards lling this analytical gap Furthermore it highlights the need for consistent global assessment of the threat from CSEA and its impact and to keep up with the changing nature of such diverse complex and fastmoving threat Beyond general reporting of projected smart phone adoption however its foresight is currently limited Crosscutting challenges and enablers number of prerequisites underpin the delivery of the optimal international response to OCSE mapped in Figure International coordination International coordination is perhaps the most prominent theme of this research Theabove discussion of crisis response highlights the need for fasttime international and multistakeholder coordination At an investigative level international coordination ensures essential information exchange and evidence gathering often despite legalobstacles It also streamlines operational activity minimising duplication of ort and avoiding crosscontamination by multiple law enforcement authorities At the strategic level international coordination can target capacity building where it is most needed Gillespie and enable both measurement of impact and sharing of valuable insights The problematics of international coordination relate to ownership and leader ship When it comes to OCSE national sovereignty is not the only challenge As UNICEF notes The borderless nature of the Internet makes it hard for both national govern ments and intergovernmental agencies to speak directly to what has now become highly di use and widely dispersed set of interests Legislation Legislation is required speci cally at international level to ensure approximation or harmoni sation of criminal ences common understanding on jurisdiction and extraterritoriality and to provide for evidence gathering and information exchange amongst other aims As discussed above legislation can itself pose challenge in urgent situations where swiftinternational responses are required At strategic level instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child the Lanzarote Convention the EU Directive and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child set international standards in this regard to which communities and advocacy groups can hold governments to accountJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY presumption of partnership Mapping functions rather than stakeholders has revealed that the majority of the optimal international response activiti es rely on the contribution of more than one stakeholder and in some cases several For example while criminal investigation isthe natural preserve of law enforcement feedback contributors noted that non governmental organisations including hotlines for illegal material child helplines andeld missions play an active role in identifying enders and victims Accurate analysis of victim and ender behaviours will necessarily requ ire the sharing of information and intelligence between governments industry and nongovernmental organisations In acrisis response scenario involving the publication of CSAM law enforcement platformproviders hotlines and helplines may all be active in removing the immediate harm to child As Figure illustrates the international st akeholder environment for OCSE is complex In full recognition of the challenges of ownership at international level UNICEF has called for collective ort by policymakers law enforcement agencies social workers teachers parents and the private sector to systematically protect children Until now the public discourse in relation to OCSE has often characterised this collective eort as series of oneway relationships As Phippen observes the dominant policy response in some countries has been to look to technology to solve societalproblem This is echoed in media coverage of the relationship between some governmentauthorities and online platform providers where the tone is more often punitive than collaborative The question of progressing OCSE stakeholder relationships from cooperation to part nership is not merely semantic Cooperation as outlined in the MNR and currently practised by stakeholders in the ght against OCSE is predominantly transactional for example industry or hotlines reporting illegal material to law enforcement law enforce ment asking industry for data or to remove material nongovernmental organisationsreporting intelligence in the eld to the relevant parties Cooperation gives every stake holder role but not necessarily an equal voice True partnership in the ght against OCSE in which all stakeholders have part to play in shaping the response not just in delivering it would arguably engender not only greater ownership and investment from individual stakeholders but also more innovative solutions in the interests of protecting children and controlling ending The involvement of all stakeholders is also in the spirit of the public health model for crime prevention To this end following survey of practitioners in multiple sectors Davidson et al have identi ed the need for real joined up partnership between law enforcement and industry that is visible functional eective and seen as legitimate and the development of systematic policing and industry collaboration Communities and constituents To the stakeholders identi ed as professional contributors to the ght against OCSE must be added also the targets of these responses Smallbone Marshall and Wortley identify four essential targets for preventing child sexual abuse victims or potential victims enders or potential enders situations in which sexual abuse has occurred or is likely to occur and communities BAINESFigure Select stakeholder groups in the ght against online child sexual exploitation Note this map is not exhaustive and is intended to serve solely as an illustration of the complexity of the stakeholder environment Omission or inclusion on the map should not be interpreted as indicative of any weight or value of contribu tionJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY Article of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that In all actions concerning children whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions courts of law administrative authorities or legislative bodies the best interests of thechild shall be primary consideration Accordingly UNICEF advocates for childcentred approach to online child protection and there have been numerous callsfor law enforcement and criminal justice responses that are childfriendly Asndings of the EU Kids Online project have consistently demonstrated asking children whatbothers or upsets them online reveals diversity in how children feelabout OCSErelated experience in di erent countries and sociodemographic contexts often challenging par ental and policymakers perceptions of the problem Livingstone et al Support services for children and child participation in the development of policy and practice are key features of the MNR Not so evident in the models to date are the voices ofoenders and potential enders Approaching OCSE as public health problem rather than problem of public order requires listening to enders and potential enders what works what does not their particular challenges and methods in order to develop preventative measures that are ective because they are representative To date public discourse has shown itself to be intolerant if not hostile to OCSE enders and potential enders This is understandable but potentially counterproductive to the goals of protecting children and controlling ending and has in turn made such support ser vices as there are even more essential for the health and wellbeing of enders and potential oenders Altering the public discourse in relation to enders generally would seem to be important but particularly so in respect of juvenile ending and its prevention where there is recognised knowledge gap Acknowledgment of the intersection between target groups namely that child can also be an ender should lead stakeholders to ques tion further the mainstream media insistence on the demonisation of enders Technology Technical solutions play role in several components of the optimal international response to OCSE and are already used by several stakeholders including law enforce ment platform providers and hotlines for illegal content NetClean UNODC To date they have been deployed most extensively in the processes of detecting and removing CSAM and in the investigation of OCSE by law enforcement authorities where they assist in the prioritisation of cases and victim identi cation Hashing of known Child Sexual Abuse Material with unique signature for each image has enabled platforms to automatically identify and report attempted uploads This hasbeen seen as an important step forward for companies willing to demonstrate due diligence with the added bene that such measures aim to minimise revictimisation of chil dren and young people by reducing the ongoing circulation of identi ed material The practice is largely adopted by US companies in line with national statutory reportingobligation Hash sharing and related technologies also improve personnel resilience inindustry law enforcement and hotlines by reducing the amount of material that needs to be manually reviewed Given the identi cation above of gaps in relation to international crisis response insight and analysis and timely evidence gathering across jurisdictions it is reasonable to suggestthat automation of some tasks may improve responses in these areas BAINESPolitical will The international response to OCSE relies on adequate funding by nation states Without it individual countries risk becoming hotspots in the production and distribution of CSAM be this by live streaming online solicitation or other means as location for suspectsvictims or both number of countries around the world could already be said to be in this situation due to lack of resources Their lack of response in turn weakens the inter national community ability to combat the problem creating perception of safe havens and additional victims and suspects in other countries Support from international organisations in the form of ad hoc training or donated equipment can only ever be small part of country response to the problem This is key message of the MNR establishment of the desired functions outlined for signatory countries necessarily entails the provision of funding for national specialist law enforce ment units hotlineshelplines and so forth Logic suggests that political will shouldresult in the allocation of resources but in the eld of OCSE the relationship appears to be more complex There is currently no publicly available information on the progressof signatory countries towards implementing the WeProtect commitments It is evidenthowever that many signatory countries have made no obvious progress towards theestablishment of specialist law enforcement units youth awareness campaigns or thera peutic support for victims and enders Whether their basis is political charitable or focused on enforcement international organisations have role to play in lobbying for change political will and increasedresources This in turn can enhance coordination and reduce duplication of ort again ensuring that resources are distributed where they are most needed Concluding remarks OCSE is complex and dynamic phenomenon The optimal international response pro posed in this article and the subsequent discussion cannot hope to cover all aspects ofthe topic in the detail they deserve nor was this the intention of the research Rather it is anticipated that the relevant stakeholders will take forward the various items worthy of further consideration In deliberately choosing to map the gold standard for combating OCSE in all its forms at international level the research highlights opportunities for improvement in all countriesBased on assessment of the current state of ending and victimisation and contributions from stakeholders it is reasonable to assume that no one country would boast su cient law enforcement resources or ongoing therapeutic support for enders and victims From the international perspective the most obvious gaps to be transformed into opportunities are in Establishment of procedure for fasttime response to OCSE events in which childrenand young people experience crisis Streamlined cooperation and information exchange in the realm of criminal justice and Regular insight and analysis that future proofs OCSE responses as far as possible In terms of general global strategy the author has asserted that greater international coordination and true partnership across stakeholder groups have the power to createJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY more ective and innovative countermeasures whose secondary impacts are foreseen Mapping of currently observed and emerging OCSE activities in particular has cast light on interdependencies between them These in turn suggest that an optimal internationalresponse is one that approaches OCSE holistically rather than focusing on single aspect or activity and as both crime problem and public health issue The author is duty bound to acknowledge that the discussion in this article is inevitably coloured by her own professional experience combating and analysing OCSE in law enfor cement and industry and working closely with nongovernmental organisations Every attempt has been made to ensure that the perspectives of all relevant stakeholder groups were included in the research not least by soliciting feedback on the optimal international response It is hoped that this article will prompt further stakeholder and public debate on how OCSE is tackled globally Notes Throughout this article and in this section in particular attention has been paid to the termi nology used to describe activities deemed to be Online Child Sexual Exploitation Reference has been made to the terminology guidelines produced by ECPAT

WhatsApp are the most widely used social platforms Internet use is common across most of the nations surveyed Home computer or tablet access is relatively rare in most countries ajorities say mobile phones are good for society even amid concerns about their impact on children Overwhelming majorities say mobile phones have been more positive than negative for them personally Mobile phone users have mixed views about upsides and downsides of their phones are especially divided over whether they couldnt live without phones Users largely agree mobile phones help them maintain long distance communication st ay informed about important issues Majorities in most countries say mobile phone use has had good impact on education but fewer see positive impacts on children health morality Concern is widespread about the risk that mobile phones might expose children to immoral or harmful content It is relatively common for mobile phone users to limit the amount of time they as well as their children spend on their phones It is common for parents to monitor their childs mobile phone use and notable shares monitor the phone activity of their spouse or partner eople say the internet brings economic and educational benefits but some are concerned about social medias societal impact Publics largely see comparable influences from mobile phones and the internet Views of the impact of

Appendix About the focus groups Appendix Compiled usage figures Appendix Detailed tables Topline Questionnaire PEW RESEARCH CENTER org Mobile Connectivity in Emerging Economies Publics see mobile phones and social media bringing certain benefits to them and their societies But these views are paired with widespread concerns about their impact on children After more than decade of studying the spread and impact of digital life in the United States Pew Research Center has intensified its exploration of the impact of online connectivity among populations in emerging economies where the prospect of swift and encompassing cul tural change propelled by digital devices might be even more dramatic than the effects felt in developed societies Surveys conducted in emerging and eveloping countries across four global regions find that the vast majority of adults in these countries own or have access to mobile phone of some kind And these mobile phones are not simply basic devices with little more than voice and texting capacity median of across these nations now have access to smartphone capable of accessing the internet and running apps In concert with this development social media platforms and messaging apps most notably Facebook and WhatsApp are widely used Across the surveyed countries median of use at least one of seven different social media sites or messaging apps Indeed smartphones and social media have melded so thoroughly that for many they go hand inhand median of of smartphone users in these countries also use social media while median of of soc ial media

What is median Throughout this report median percentages are used to help readers see overall patterns The median is th middle number in list of figures sorted in ascending or descending order In survey of countries the median result is the sixth figure on list of country level findings ranked in order PEW RESEARCH CENTER org People in these nations say mobile hones have help ed them personally in various ways Among mobile phone users an country median of say these devices have helped them stay in touch with people who live far away and somewhat smaller share median of say they have helped the obtain news and information about important issues More broadly majorities of adults in all countries say the internet has had good impact on education and majorities in of countries say the same of mobile phones At the same time smaller shares of adults in these nations say mobile phones and social media have been good for society than say these technologies have been good for them personally nd the challenges that digital life can pose for children are particularly notable source of concern Some of adults in these countries say people should be very concerned about children being Facebook has brought lot of advantages for our society However it has also affected society in negative way Just like anything which can be used for both good and bad social media have brought negatives and positives for people Man Philippines The countries in this report and why they were included This report is the first of several reports that will be issued this year based on nationally representative surveys of adults age and older conducted in countries located in four different regions of the globe United mexican states Venezuela and Colombia South Africa and Kenya India Vietnam and the Philippines and Tunisia Jordan and Lebanon These countries were selected for the survey based on number of crite ria Key goals of the country selection process were to assemble group of countries that Are middle income countries as defined by the World Bank Contain mix of people with different sorts of devices Many of these countries have notable variation in the share of their populations who have smartphones more basic phones or no phones at all Offer country level diversity and variety These countries offer variety of regional pol itical economic social cultural population size and geographic conditions Vary in their market conditions These countries differ in their technological and industry competitiveness and have range of networked readiness ratings as calculated by the World Economic Forum In many cases have high levels of internal or external migration Each of these countries exhibits rising levels of urbanization and most still have substantial rural populations special report examining the impact of mobile phones on the migrant experience is also forthcoming PEW RESEARCH CENTER org exposed to harmful or immoral content when using mobile phones and median of say mobile phones have had ad influence on children in their country They also express mixed opinions about the impact of increased connectivity on physical health and morality Some of these tensions between the upsides and downsides of digital life span all countries surveyed At other times there are nation specific elements to peoples views about what these technologies have brought to their lives For instance more than half of mobile phone users in five of these countries describe their phone as something they couldnt live without but users in six countries are more likely to describe it as something they dont always need These are among the major findings from new Pew Research Center survey conducted among adults in countries from Sept to Dec In addition to the survey the Center conducted focus groups with diverse groups of participants in Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia in March and their comments are included throughout the repo rt How the focus groups were conducted Pew Research Center conducted series of focus groups to better understand how people think about their own mobile phones and the impact of these devices on their society Five focus groups were held in each of the following four countries Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia Each focus group consisted of adults coming together for an hour and ha lf for discussion led by local professional moderator using guide developed by the Center For more information on how these groups were conducted see Appendix These groups were primarily used to help shape the survey questions asked in each of the countries But throughout the report we have also included quotations that illustrate some of the major themes that were discussed during the groups Quotations are chosen to provide context for the survey fin dings and do not necessarily represent the majority opinion in any particular group or country Quotations may have been edited for gramma and clarity PEW RESEARCH CENTER org Majorities say mobile phones and social media have mostly bee good for them personally somewhat less so for society Asked for their overall assessment of the impact of mobile devices and social media platforms on society and their own lives people in these nations generally are more affirming than not But within this broadly positive consensus there are important nuances First at both personal and societal level publics are generally more likely to say mobile phones have had mostly good impact than say the same of social media median of of adults across these countries say mobile phones have been mostly good thing for society but that share falls to on the question of the impact of social media Indeed median of think social media have been mostly bad thing for society Second these publics are more likely to say that both mobile pho nes and social media have been mostly good for them personally than they are to say they have been mostly good for society As noted above an country median of say that mobile phones have been mostly good for society But an even larger share of say mobile phones have been mostly good for them personally When it comes to social media users of these sites are generally more likely to proclaim their benefits than non users Even among users peoples views of their personal impact tend to be mor positive than their views of their societal impact These broad themes tend to occur across the full scope of the countries surveyed But Kenyans and Vietnamese stand out somewhat for their more positive views of the societal impact of both mobile phones and social media Conversely relatively large shares of Venezuelans view the societal impact of these technologies as negative one Mobile phones viewed as having more positive personal societal impact than social media in emerging economies of adults who say have mostly been goodbad thing Note Percentages are country medians Source Mobile Technology and Its Social Impact Survey Qa Qa Mobile Connectivity in Emerging Economies PEW RESEARCH CENTER PEW RESEARCH CENTER org Many worry th at mobile phones are problem for children it is common for parents to attempt to curtail and surveil their childs screen time While on balance people in these nations express largely positive judgments about the personal and social impact of technologies they also express significant concerns over the effects mobile phones and online connectivity might have on young people Wo rries that mobile phones might expose children to immoral or harmful content are key flashpoint in these fears median of of adults in these countries and majorit ies in all countr ies surveyed say people should be very concerned about this More broadly median of say the increasing use of the inte rnet has had bad influence on children in their country and median of say he same about mobile phones Coupled with these concerns any parents say they try to be vigilant about what their children are doing and seeing on their phones Among parents whose children ave mobile phones median of say they monitor what their children do on their mobile devices arents who are themselves smartphone or social media users are more li kely than non users to monitor their childs phone in this way Along with monitoring their childrens activities on their mobile devices median of of parents whose children have mobile phones have tried to limit the time their children spend with heir phones Beyond these concerns about the influence of connectivity on children peoples views of the broader impact of digital technologies on family life are more positive For instance the vast In the survey questions about parents and children were asked of all respondents The results reported here were recalculated to exclude those who volunteered that they do not have an children andor that their child or children do not have mobile phone Publics in emerging economies express idespread concerns about the impact of

influence on family cohesion in most other countries surv eyed more say mobile phones have had good influence in this regard than bad one Publics are divided over the role mobile phones play in their lives Overall mobile phone users tend to associate their mobile phones with feelings of freedom In every country surveyed larger sha re of mobile phone users describe their phone as something that frees them as opposed to something that ties them down When it comes to whether their phones help them save time or make them waste time the largest share of mobile phone users in seven coun tries describe their phone as something that helps them save time Still larger share of Jordanians and Filipinos describe their phone as something that makes them waste time And in Lebanon and Mexico roughly equal shares see their phone as time save and time waster Across the countries surveyed obile phone users fall into two camps about whether their phone is something they dont always need or something they couldnt live without Kenyans South Africans Jordanians Tunisians and Lebanese who use mobile phone are more likely to say their phone is something they couldnt live without But in the six other countries larger share say they dont always need their phone Both phone type and demographic differences are at the core of these assessments about the value of mobile phones in users lives For instance adults ages and older are more likely than those under to view their phone as time saver while younger adults are more Across countries more see mobile phones as freeing time saving of adult mobile phone users who say their phone is something that Note Percentages are country medians Respondents who gave other responses are not shown Mobile phone users include those who say they own

although mobile phone users tend to see their phone as something that frees them the prevalence of these attitudes varies by device type For instance in most countries smartphone users are more likely than basic or feature phone users to say their phone is something that ties them down rather than something that frees them Publics in these countries say mobile phones have beneficial impact on certain aspects of society but more negative influence on others Peoples assessments of the specific societal impacts of mobile phones vary depending on the aspect of society in question Broadly people in most countries think mobile phones and the internet have had similar impacts on society possibly because for many their online access comes through mobile phone In most countries education stands out as the issue where the largest share of adults say the increasing use of the internet and mobile phones has had good impact median value of say this about the impact of mobile phones and

And seven of the countries for which trends are available more people today say the increasing use of the internet has had good influence on their countrys economy than said the same in But digital connectivity is seen in less positive light when it comes to other issues In addition to their widespread worries about the impact on children publics in these countries also express mixed views about increased connectivity impact on health An country median of say mobile phones have had bad influence on physical health and say the same of the internet Majorities of the public in Jordan Lebanon and Tunisia view these technologies as having negative influence on health In addition median of say that both mobile phones and the internet have had bad influence on morality In four countries for which trend data are available Kenya Venezuela Mexico and Colombia larger share of the public say the internet has had good influence on morality than was true four years ago But in Jordan and Lebanon the share saying this have declined since When people consider ssues such as the impact of digital tools on local culture civility family cohesion and politics the overall balance of public sentiment leans positive But notable minorities ranging from median of in the case of family cohesion to median of in the case of politics say mobile phones have had negative impact on these facets of society Moreover public opinion across these countries has diverged in recent years when it comes to the internets impact on politics Compared with surveys conducted in larger shares of Mexicans South Africans Venezuelans Kenyans and Colombians now say increasing use of the internet has had positive impact on politics But Tunisians Lebanese and Jordanians are now less likely to say this compared with Trend survey data are not available for India because of sampling design changes between and Children usually play with gadgets the most and are exposed to radiation and experiencing seizures thats what heard Man Philippines Also instead of playing outside they are busy with gadgets They are no longer able to socialize with other kids Woman Philippines PEW RESEARCH CENTER org Despite wide ranging worries about the problems mobile phones invite personal benefits are still widely recognized In addition to their concerns about the impact of mobile phones on children majorities across the countries surveyed also say people should also be very worried about issues such as identity theft an country median of say people should be very concerned about this exposure to false information mobile phone addiction and harassment or bullying when using their mobile phones Fewer are very concerned about the risk that people might lose the ability to communicate face toface due to mobile

concerns often coexist with perceived benefits to users For instance espite widespread concerns that mobile phones might expose people to false or inaccurate information sizable majority of mobile

communicate face toface even as median of of adults in these countries say people should be very worried about mobile phones effects on face toface communication Other key findings relating to the adoption and use of digital technology in these countries include Majorities in each country own their mobile phone and haring phone with someone else is relatively rare median of just of adults in these countries share mobile phone ranging from low of of adults in Vietnam to high of in Venezuela Smartphone us is higher among younger adults and those with high er education levels Lebanon and Jordan are the only countries in the survey in which majority of adults ages and older as well as majority of those with less than secondary education are smartphone users Home computer and tablet

Smartphone owning parents whose child also uses mobile phone are more likely than parents with more basic phones to say they have tried to limit their childs screen time in nine of these countries Indeed this gap reaches double digits in nine of these countries and is as high as points in Vietnam and Jordan Parents efforts to limit their childs mobile phone use are also related to their concerns about the negative impacts of mobile phone use such as online harassment or children being exposed to immoral content In nearly every country surveyed parents who say they are very concerned about at least five of the six issues tested are more likely to try to limit their childs mobile phone use relative to those who are very concerned about two or fewer of these issues The only exception to this trend is Jordan where similar shares of highly concerned and to a lesser extent concerned parents say they try to limi their childs mobile phone use In the survey questions about

and notable shares monitor the phone activity of their spouse or partner In the focus group interviews conducted as part of this study mobile phone surveillance performed by immediate family members emerged as common theme Some parents mentioned that mobile phones allowed them to track the whereabouts of their children and to make sure they were not exposed to harmful content And for people in marriages or romantic relationships mobile phone spying and social media stalking sometimes become the source of drama jealousy and harassment Among parents whose child or chi ldren use mobile phone median of say they ever monitor what their child is looking at or doing on the screen But some variation exists across these countries In Jordan Colombia and Mexico for example clear majorities of parents do this compa red with of parents in Vietnam and in India Parents who use smartphone are generally more likely to say they monitor their childs phone usage than parents who use basic or feature phone This trend is seen in out of the countries and is especially prominent in Jordan and Vietnam where smartphone users differ from other phone users by percentage points each Parents likelihood of monitoring their childs phone use also differs by their own social media presence Parents who use soci al media and messaging apps in each country are more likely than parents who do not

similar impacts on society whether for good or for bad And although pluralities in most countries say social media have been good thing for society large minorities see downsides as well sentiment that is even more common among those who do not use social media Things have gotten better indeed but the mobile phone also has made us lazier For the busier ones it has helped us have everything more

their society Five focus groups were held in each of the following four countries Kenya Mexico the Philippines and Tunisia Each focus group consisted of adults coming together for an hour and half for discussion led by local professional moderator using guide developed by Pew Research Center In each country the groups were structured according to the following criteria Group basic phone all participants either owned or shared basic phone that could not connect to the internet and were years old or older Group younger smartphone all participants owned or shared smartphone and were under the age of Group older smartphone all participants owned or shared smartphone and were at least years old Group women phone users all participants were women who either owned or shared phone including minimum of five participants who owned or shared smartphone and at least two participants were married and two were unmarried Group migrant phone users all participants either owned or shared phone including minimum of five participant who owned or shared smartphone and all either lived in place that was different from where they grew up or had family member who lived elsewhere All focus groups also required participants to have at least some interest in politics and aside from group which was all women they were balanced with regard to gender Aside from group participants were also required to use their phone at least once week Where feasible participants were also recruited to ensure diversity with regard to education levels employment status rural and urban location and the duration for which they have owned their phones Focus groups were held in four rather than all countries because of time and resources Countries were chosen purposefully to cover all four key regions included in the survey Latin America the Asia Pacific sub Saharan Africa and the Middle East and Nort Africa MENA PEW RESEARCH CENTER Focus groups were held in the following locations and on the following dates Mexico City Mexico March Manila Philippines March Nairobi Kenya March Tunis Tunisia March Systems Inc worked with local field partners in each of the four countries to recruit the participants

with the global COVID pandemic that has resulted in millions of children increasingly relying on online tools systems and platforms in multiple ways important to their lives These range from the infrastructural facilitating education healthcare and food reaching plates to the social children connecting to learn to play and to stay in touch with their family and friends This increased reliance also cont inues to expose children to the risk of violence exploitation and abuse including sexual exploitation and abuse and has made explicit the existing digital divide and deep seated and systemic inequalities This topic was prominently reflected in the Secretary Generals report on the Rights of the Child and will be the focus of the upcoming General Comment of the Committee on the Rights of the Child The event was moderated by Mr Andrew Morley President and CEO of Worl Vision International and attracted over participants from Member States Civil Society Organizations UNICEF and other UN entities In their opening statements both the EU and Uruguay representatives noted that the biennalisation of the GA resolutio on the promotion and protection of the rights of children does not mean

not created for children but has become an essential tool for their development Member States have primary role to play in promoting and protecting child rights online The rights of the child in the digital environment are the same as in real life but to be able to guarantee them we need de ep understanding of the complexities brought in by the digital world Technology and digital tools can help children reach their potential but safe digital spaces for children are needed This requires governments private sector and civil society working together Supporting childrens rights online is truly partnership effort We ne ed to put the participation of children in the heart of any process that we get engaged in There is no one country or stakeholder that can ensure child safety online by itself

['The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on ountriesC eveloping ducation in Zuheir Khlaif and Soheil Salha Faculty of Educational Sciences and Teachers Training An Najah National University Nablus Palestine Shahid Fareed Department of Computer Science Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan Pakistan Hadi Rashed Business Communication Department Kabul University Kabul Afghanistan Abstract The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in the developing countries of Palestine Libya and Afghanistan as reported by middleschool students their parents and teachers These countries have been struggling with an unstable and violent situation for decades Semistructured interviews were conducted with participants from the three countries and online classes were observed Findings revealed that COVID widened the digital gap among students and families which created challenges in terms of online class attendance In addition violation of students and parents digital privacy emerged as another key challenge to emergency remote teaching However teacher presence and timely feedback in synchronous online sessions strengthened students engagement within the emergency remote teaching environment Overall emergency remote teaching during the COVID crisis deepened inequities across students and infringed upon the digital ethics of students teachers and parents Keywords COVID Coronavirus digital inequity digital privacy Khlaif ZN Salha Fareed Rashed The hidden shadow of the coronavirus on education in developing countries Online Learning The motivation for the current study was the findings of Khalif and Salhas brief report regarding the unanticipated challenges of education during the COVID pandemic For this paper the researchers used the same data from the same participants but developed different research questions on digital privacy gender inequity and the specific impact of he digital divide The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Emergency Remote Teaching ERT is an unplanned and sudden shift from traditional in person education to remote teaching using technology to deliver teaching and learning materials and activities due to natural disasters economic crises violence and andemics In the past individual countries have used technology to teach online for limited time in response to crises and school shutdowns Czerniewicz et al Holzweiss et al Khlaif Salha Shraim Khlaif Traxler et al This year ERT was implemented in countries across the world to contend the outbreak of Coronavirus Johnson et al Khlaif et al ERT is unlike normal online learning while typical online courses take months to design develop and deliver to students ERT materials or lectures were originally designed for facetoface delivery and their quality in the remote context can be low Khlaif Salha In developing countries in particular students may also struggle with the digital equity and accessibility of educational resources delivered in the context of crisis Czerniewicz et al Jones Bridges Khlaif et al In this study we investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in the developing countries of Palestine Libya and Afghanistan as reported by middleschool students their parents and teachers In the introductory sections below we first describe our conceptual framework which is centered in digital inequity and digital privacy Next we describe the context of the three countries under study and lay out our key research questions Conceptual Framework The dimensions and determinants of the impact of COVID on educational systems within developing countries are wide and varied In the context of digital learning however two issues may represent key challenges to students and their families in developing ountries digital inequity and digital privacy Below we review these two issues in more detail with particular reference to the three developing countries under study Digital Inequity Digital equity is conceptualized in the framework of resource distribution technical knowledge and skills and the impact of Information and Communication Technology ICT use Yuen et al Willems et al defined digital equity as access to hardware and software and connectivity to the internet to create share and exchange highquality content in suitable language Resta et al suggested that there are five dimensions of digital equity hardware software and connectivity to the internet highquality digital content in local languages creation and sharing of digital content educators who know technology and highquality research and application In recent years with the increasing use of ICT in education digital inequity has begun to receive more attention from researchers Kurea Yuen et al With the shift to remote learning during the COVID crisis digital inequity has become an even more critical topic Hall et al Khlaif et al For example recent US study reported that school closures due to the spread of COVID prevented children with disabilities from continuing their learning These children were from the poorest families who did not have access to technology Collis Lope felix de vega carpio In developing counties the digital divide may be even more stark Shraim and Khlaif highlighted that key challenge of implementing elearning in the Palestinian educational The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March system was students differential access to devices and highspeed internet significant aspect of the digital divide in developing countries is the difference between men and womens access to and use of technology Mariscal et al Singh For example Elaiess found gender divide in Libya with women and girls having less access to technology such as the internet compared with men because of cultural and social issues Internet cafes for only men are not accepted The digital gap in gender is more evident for countries in the global south such as the three countries under study than for countries in the global north such as the US Digital Privacy Digital privacy refers to the protection of an individual information and communication that is used or created while using the internet on computer or personal device Robertson et al It is worth noting that the protection of digital privacy requires the knowledge the technical practices of online security institutional privacy procedures and the skill to conduct several processes for protecting online data Li Digital privacy is often understood as an individual right that must be respected and secured even when people have different objectives and desires Ahmed Booth With advancements in technology individuals can communicate and leverage data more easily but are also at increased risk of hackers violating their privacy and data confidentiality Lustgarten et al Despite the importance of digital privacy students are often unaware of its meaning or value For example Lorenz et al conducted survey of sixtyone participants from Estonia which examined the relationship between students awareness of privacy and their level of participation in the online learning environment The findings of the study revealed that students in the online learning environment did not distinguish between educational social interaction and their privacy The researchers considered student lack of awareness to be threat to the student privacy Lorenz et al Similarly Siemens et al conducted research on Canadian students in masters degree program to explore their perceptions of privacy and its impact on their engagement within an elearning environment The findings of the study revealed that students are not aware of their privacy in the online forums Students may be unaware of digital privacy issues because they have not been formally taught about them Kumar et al conducted nine focus group sessions with teachers in elementary school settings across three regions in the north of the to ascertain the meaning of digital privacy and security The findings of their study revealed that teachers rarely teach their students about digital privacy and security while using technology However teachers and parents themselves may have little understanding about digital privacy Citizens concerns and behaviors in terms of digital privacy may also be influenced by political and cultural factors For example Fahey and Hino point out that during the COVID pandemic some countries such as France South Korea Iran and Qatar have taken data first approach to contact tracing and other public health measures while other countries such as Germany Italy Japan and the US have taken privacy first approach Studies of digital privacy have not focused on developing countries However unique set of political and cultural factors impact education in developing countries For example in Afghanistan the education system has long struggled with issues revolving around culture lack of security and distance these challenges continue today Arooje Burridge Rasmussen Kelly Many of these challenges are further affected by transparency and quality The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March assurance Thus levels of awareness and concern about digital privacy in education could be quite different from those found in prior studies Context of the Three Countries Under Study The three developing counties under study are Palestine Libya and Afghanistan All three countries have been struggling with unstable situations and continuous violence for decades and thus have implemented ERT many times before the COVID pandemic Although the three countries are quite distinct all three share similar security situation have experience in education under crisis used online learning before the COVID pandemic transformed education into ERT during the COVID pandemic and have the technological initiatives to integrate technology into teaching and learning Below we provide context regarding the educational system of each country Libya Education policy in Libya is managed from the top down and is influenced by the overall political system of the country The education system has changed frequently since the Arab Spring in Aloreibi Carey The World Bank reported significant success in enhancing the literacy rate in Libya by increasing the budget for education and making it free and accessible for all Libyans and implementing new programs to improve education Conversely Gadour argued that the Libyan educational system is still not capable of producing graduates with the necessary skills to compete in world where knowledge and technology are essential for development in different aspects of the society Hbaci et al found that Libyan educators believe that using technology is still difficult task and that schools need computers internet access training and financial support to improve the teachers technological competencies in teaching and learning Libyan students may also be underrepresented in terms of their participation in global learning platforms recent study of Arab users of the MITx online learning platform found that only per million Libyans used the platform compared to per million in the United Arab Emirates and per million in Egypt RuiprezValiente et al Palestine As an occupied territory Palestine is subject to variety of ongoing restrictions such as checkpoints and other travel restrictions as well as periodic security spikes characterized by unrest violence and travel lockdowns which negatively impact its educational system For example students and teachers may be unable to pass through checkpoints in order to reach school in time or school trips may be canceled due to travel restrictions Traxler et al recent study conducted by Bruck et al confirmed the continued conflict in Palestine decreased the probability to pass the final exam and the opportunities to get an admission from the university to pursue higher education To mitigate the negative impact of restriction of mobility their students education many Palestinian teachers have turned to digital technologies Traxler et al Furthermore the Ministry of Education hereafter MoE which is responsible for the administration and development of the Palestinian education system at the levels of preschool basic education and secondary education has taken different procedures on the ground to reduce the negative impact of conflict on educati on such as locating teachers close to their living place and opening new schools in rural areas Shraim Shraim Khlaif Moreover the MoE has pursued variety of initiatives to mix technology in public schools such as the Professional Development program supported by the US through USAID the Belgium Learning project supported by the Kingdom of Belgium and Smart Learning supported by the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March local community in Palestine Khlaif Farid As consequence Palestinian education is highly digitized at both the managerial and instructional levels Khlaif et al In general the Palestinian education system is thought to be strong with an adult literacy rate at more than Itmazi Afghanistan The education system in Afghanistan is influenced by the Taliban and therefore there were several changes in the Afghani education system from the Taliban period to the postTaliban period Dandawate Dhanamjaya The decades of conflict almost destroyed the education system in Afghanistan During the Taliban era most girls schools were closed girls represented only about of school enrollment and women were barred from the few Teacher Training Colleges that remained open Shayan For students who did attend school the syllabus included religious subject that took up to of the teaching time Guistozzi Starting in girls enrollment began to rebuild by girls represented of school enrollment and of teachers were women Shayan However enrollment is inequitably distributed across the country in of girls attended school in the Hazara region while only did so in several southern provinces Larson Noorajan described Afghani online learning as very poor stating that access to the internet and digital learning resources are still not available in most educational institutions The digital divide is greater than expected because of the digital inequity to access to technology and the social gap among the Afghani society Khan et al Saay and Norta claimed that higher education institutions have moved forward in terms of creating shared reliable high speed interoperable elearning structure similar system for is not yet reality Contribution of this Study Although much research has been conducted on distance education there is lack of research on ERT in developing countries particularly since the COVID emergency forced schools to close and transfer their education to online classes This study examines hidden shadow on education across these three countries the unrevealed impact of ERT during the COVID pandemic on education including on students parents teachers and quality of content The study aims to answer the following questions How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school settings by instructors in these three countries To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and their families To what extent did digital privacy concerns create chall enges for students and their families Methods qualitative approach was adopted for the current study The qualitative approach is generally used to describe an intervention or phenomenon in the real life context in which it occurred Yin The qualitative approach used in the current study as individual semi structured interviews and observations of online learning sessions The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Participants The participants in the study were parents students and teachers in middle school settings in Libya Palestine and Afghanistan Sixty participants participants from each country including teachers parents and students were interviewed to discuss their lived experience with ERT in middle school settings during the COVID pandemic Furthermore online classes for each participating teacher were observed Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants The criteria for recruiting the participants in the study were having experience in online teaching during the COVID pandemic living in Libya Palestine and Afghanistan and allowing the online classes to be observed The participants were recruited through the professional network of the first author who was working with nonprofit organizations to train teachers on the use of ICT tools in education in these countries Table presents demographic information about he participants Table Participants Demographic Characteristics Participants Palestine Libya Afghanistan Male Female Male Female Male Female Teachers Parents Middle school students Total Data Collection Semi structured interviews with participants on Zoom were the main data source of this research Individual interviews were minutes in length and were audiorecorded after obtaining permission from each participant The interviews with participants from Libya and Palestine were in the Arabic language The interviews with participants from Afghanistan were in the Dari and Arabic languages The secondary data collection approach was observations of online classes Researchers observed four online classes for each teacher The main criterion for teachers to participate in the study was allowing their different online classes to be observed The researchers observed online classes from the three countries which took around hours Forty online classes were in the Arabic language and were in the Dari language the Afghani official language The classes comprised students from different backgrounds and cultures All the students parents and teachers participated in the study on voluntary basis Data Analysis The data analysis process started with the manual transcription of the interview audio files The transcribed files in the Dari language were translated into the Arabic language to facilitate the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March data analysis process The researchers individually coded the data into themes and subthemes from all the data sources by using thematic analysis Creswell Creswell Through thematic analysis researchers analyze categorize and report patterns in the data After constructing the themes that emerged in the analysis of the interview data the researchers used these themes to analyze the observations of online classes In terms of the analysis of the observations of online classes the researchers wrote notes on the structure of the classes and audiorecordings of the sessions to answer the first research question Furthermore the data from the observations of online classes were used to support themes and subthemes that emerged in the individual interviews Trustworthiness After transcribing the interviews the researchers sent all the written transcripts to participants for checking asking them to verify the content for accuracy Moreover participants were asked to write notes rewrite content and add new information on the transcripts Participants transcripts were not altered by the researchers When the final themes had been constructed professor in educational technology was asked to select small portion of the transcription and analyze it based on the constructed themes to check the accuracy of the themes In the Results section below transcript excerpts are labeled according to the participant role Parent Teacher or Student country Afghanistan Libya or Palestine and personal identification number Results Research question How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school settings by instructors in these three countries Based on the analysis of the observations of online classes the researchers categorized the implementation of ERT by schools and teachers in the three countries in to three themes type of online learning classes students engagement and the design and delivery of online instruction Type of Online Learning Classes Most of the teachers in the three countries used both synchronous and asynchronous tools to deliver instruction to the learners in the middle school settings Typically teachers created their asynchronous class using Edmodo or Google Classroom and posted links to synchronous Zoom sessions on the class wall Most of these teachers also recorded the synchronous sessions and posted the recordings for students who may have missed class Students needed to log into the virtual classes to access the recorded sessions All the teachers used free versions of the Zoom application Google Classroom and Edmodo However some teachers used other asynchronous platforms to deliver instruction and to communicate with their students and they rarely used synchronous sessions followup question was sent to these teachers about the reasons for not using synchronous session Typically teachers responded that most of their students did not have access to the internet because of the electricity in Gaza in Palestine and in Afghanistan being cut off Despite differences in the type of online instruction among the teachers from the three countries all teachers instruction shared the following common features it was free it was easy The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March to use students had to enroll in the platform to access content and technology tools were integrated Types of Content Delivered Various types of content were used by teachers to instruct students including interactive activities designed in opensource platforms educational videos from YouTube PowerPoint slides designed by teachers and students pictures infographic and whiteboard animation Teachers from Palestine and Afghanistan focus ed on using simple technological tools to design and deliver the instruction most of which were from opensource platforms They integrated simple tools to design and deliver interactive content to the students However the Libyan teachers depended only on one tool to design and develop instruction which was the Edmodo platform Few teachers assigned online tasks or activities to their students in the synchronous sessions as they reported they did not want to distract students in the online sessions Instead they assigned activities asynchronously using Edmodo or Google Classroom In synchronous online sessions teachers shared their screens used different features of the online platform such as the whiteboard and polls and used breakout rooms to allow students to work on assignments in small groups Depending on the type of instruction teachers allowed students to share their screen Students Interaction Teachers tried to support students engagement and interaction with each other in the synchronous and asynchronous sessions by designing and delivering activities few teachers gave students the opportunity to interact with the instructor or with their peers These teachers delivered online individual and group activities Teachers asked students to work on these activities online by forming groups and giving them the option to share their screens to present their work to their peers Other students were able to interact with their peers by providing text and verbal comments by using chat and audio features Many of the students engaged and interacted with their teachers thr ough text questions written on the chat tab In addition some students engaged in answering their peers questions on the chat tab Some female students from the three countries were reluctant to participate verbally in the online discussion However we noticed that these students were active in the asynchronous discussion on the platform The researchers asked the female students followup question about their engagement with the platform and discussions Feedback from participants indicated that students had various reasons for choosing to participate in asynchronous rather than synchronous interaction including personal reasons and cultural and religious reasons We discuss these reasons in more detail under Research Question Moreover the researchers noticed that the presence of teachers on the platform and timely feedback encouraged students to complete their assignments and interact with their peers Students from Afghanistan were more engaged in asynchronous activities than Palestinian st udents Observations suggested that the reason for this was that unlike the Afghani teachers Palestinian teachers did not interact with their students in asynchronous platform Libyan students engaged and interacted in both synchronous and asynchronous platforms less than the Afghani and Palestinian students The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Challenges of ERT All the participants from the three countries reported that ERT was big challenge for them since it was unplanned and students teachers and parents were unprepared to shift to online learning Most of the teachers in the three countries agreed that this was not the first time we moved to online teaching during crisis Teacher and that previous transformation had been for specific schools in specific districts due to violence Teacher Implementing ERT on large scale in the three countries caused pressure and anxiety for families in these countries parent from Afghanistan said Using online learning during the COVID crisis put me and my wife under pressure We have three kids in school We do not have enough devices and enough knowledge about online teaching Parent Research question To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and their families All the participants from the three countries reported that oving to ERT suddenly increased the digital gap in the learning process In addition they all reported that digital inequity put them under high pressure and caused anxietyparticularly since they did not know when this state of emergency would end and allow them to return to facetoface learning Overall the researchers identified three main themes inequity in internet and hardware quality of digital content and inequity based on gender Inequity in Internet and Hardware Internet Broadband Connectivity Teachers from Libya Afghanistan and Palestine noted the weakness of internet bandwidth as an element that hindered their ability to provide timely instruction to students ultimately affecting student engagement Although teachers in all three countries mentioned the issue it was reported less in the Palestinian context than in the Afghani and Libyan contexts Teachers and students who referred to the inequity in internet reported that access to internet broadband was one of the major barriers to implementing ERT during the COVID pandemic For example teacher from Afghanistan reported that the internet nowadays is weak because lot of people were trying to attend online classes It cannot help me prepare instruction and deliver it to my students Teacher Researchers observed that students from rural areas in all three countries were at more of disadvantage in terms of the availability and reliability of the internet than their peers from large cities live in small village north of Gaza Palestine did not attend online classes missed most of them because the electricity is cut off all the time Even if we have electricity the internet is weak asked my relative who lives in Gaza city to send me the recorded files to view them when electricity is available Student female student from rural area in Afghanistan stated usually go to my uncle house to attend online classes because we do not have the internet at home Student The participants from Libya reported that families financial situations influenced their connectivity to the internet am teacher in Tripoli have not received my salary for the last year so how can pay for the internet My priority is to pay for food and living expenses Moving to emergency remote teaching was sudden and it is difficult to adopt it in short time Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Inequit in Hardware Families from all three countries reported that some households have too few technological devices based on the number of children enrolled in schools and universities especially in families in which the father or mother or both are enrolled in graduate program at univ ersity female student from Libya reported cannot attend synchronous classes because my sister is using the device laptop when it is time for the class Student female student from Palestine stated that before this crisis COVID used to use my moms iPhone to finish my assignments but now cannot do this because she uses it to teach her students Student parent from Libya reported Because of the stay at home rule lost my job and it is difficult to buy new device for my kids to attend online learning asked their teacher to provide me the recorded teaching materials to use them by my children Parent male student from Afghanistan stated have two sisters one in high school and the older one at the university All of us are using the same desktop My dad cannot buy an additional computer for us Student parent from Palestine said cannot buy more devices because have not received my salary in the last six months because of Coronavirus Parent Quality of Digital Content Parents teachers and students agreed that the quality of digital content delivered by teachers in both synchronous and asynchronous sessions was low For example Libyan parents and students mentioned the low quality of course content for math and English while Palestinian and Afghani students and parents reported the low quality of learning materials and content in science Teachers believed the low quality of course content was result of the sudden transition to remote learning contexts We moved to online teaching within hours do not have time to plan and design suitable content for my students The teaching online is completely different from teaching face to face It needs specific teaching strategies specific content which takes lot of time to prepare Teacher Other teachers from Libya and Palestine reported that they were unprepared to design interactive content stating that they do not have team to design and do not know the tools to use in the design process Teacher Teacher Teacher Teacher Teacher Students from Afghanistan complained about the quality of the assignments and the grading system The content is related to the lesson in the book but when went to do the assignment it was unclear do not feel there was connection between the assignment and the material In addition do not know how my teacher will grade me Student Some parents from Palestine and Afghanistan were struggling to teach and assist their children because they do not have experience with the design of digital content Palestinian parent said usually teach my children and help them finish their tasks and activities but now do not know how to start with them asked my brother who is teac her to help them Parent parent from Afghanistan stated am not educated in using technology It is difficult for me to teach my kids this type of content Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March Inequity Based on Gender Most students and parents and some teachers believed that online course design and delivery was biased based on gender For example female students reported that course materials and activities tended to focus on males by showing photos of boys or using boys names Our observational data supported female students perceptions that teachers from all three countries privileged male students by using gendered language referring mostly to boy names allowing male students to speak more frequently and often interrupting female students My teachers are biased toward males in online classes Since the beginning of teaching online two months ago have only been allowed to use the mic twice for two or three minutes but some males talk more than all the females Student female student from Libya said In the presentation of our project my teacher did not give us an opportunity to present in the same way as males and in mixed teams He asked if prefer males to present the project like to discuss my ideas but am not allowed to Student The inequity based on gender was not only due to teachers as some families did not allow their female children to use the microphone female student from Libya stated My dad put restrictions on using the microphone and camera while using his laptop for online learning Student Palestinian female student mentioned that her mo ther allowed her to use the internet for learning without opening the mic and the camera Student Research question To what extent did digital privacy concerns create challenges for students and their families According to the data analysis new theme related to the ERT during the COVID crisis was mentioned by the participants which was digital privacy Most of the participants in the current study stated that teaching and learning in the ERT environment should be managed professionally and ethically by teachers and students All participants expressed concerns about digital privacy and most of the students reported that their digital privacy was violated by on of their family members or by their teachers Furthermore families stated that sharing devices such as smartphones laptops or desktops is considered as violating individual privacy In general perspectives on privacy seemed re lated to two key themes gender differences in privacy and sharing devices or internet access Gender Differences in Privacy As mentioned earlier many female students mentioned that their families did not allow them to use their camera or microphone during class followup question was sent to the students asking why their families were concerned about the camera and microphone Below we draw from these responses as well as students original interviews Due to security concerns cultural traditions or rel igious strictures many female students and their families felt their personal images should remain private For example one parent said We are living in bad situation because of violence and security am concerned about her daughter privacy in online learning do not know how to protect her Parent In some districts in Afghanistan Libya and Palestine it is considered inappropriate for families to allow their children to share photos videos or even to appear talking in video clip Other families from these countries consider themselves openminded and allow their children to share videos and The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March photos and use webcam on the internet however these families were minority Overall many female students felt their privacy was threatened by teachers as well as other students First some teachers asked female students to engage in practices that the students or families felt were inappropriate For example the researchers noticed that some male teachers asked students to open their camera at the beginning of the session Some of the girls refused to open it with one girl saying do not like to open my camera for personal reasons Student and the teacher respected their privacy During the online sessions some teachers asked students to share their desktop some students agreed to share it while others refused to share it with one saying have personal pictures in the background on my computer Student In interviews few other female students reported that their teachers asked them to open the webcam which they considered violation of their digital privacy and reported to their families One student asked Personal information on social media and in the online classes is private information do not like to use the camera so why did my teacher asked me to open the camera Student Other families did not allow their girls to attend online classes if they were asked to share their information on social media or share their laptop screen Second female students felt that many of their male peers did not know the boundaries or work professionally Student in the new online learning environment female student from Afghanistan expressed anger about some of her male friends who looked for her social media profile and sent her friend request Some female teachers from Libya and Afghanistan also reported that many girls complained about the bad conduct of their peers which included taking screen shots of the online sessions and posting them on social media pages trying to add them as friends on social media and sharing their emails on the chat tab in the online sessions to contact them In contrast most of the male students did not care about their privacy They were willing to open their camera and to share their desktop and shared no concerns about these practices in their interviews Sharing Devices or Internet Parents from all three countries reported they were forced to share their own smartphones laptops or desktops with their children for schooling purposes which they felt was violation of individual privacy parent from Palestine sta ted Because we do not have extra devices somet imes share my smartphone with my son and allow him to use it My accounts on social media are open and share my thoughts with my close friends Allowing family member to share my device puts my digital privacy at risk Parent Libyan parent reported that she does not like to share her laptop with her children She said am lawyer and all of my clients files are stored on my computer Honestly when let my kids use my laptop observed them Parent We asked her followup question about restricting access to her files by using password The answer was do not have high skills in computers to protect myself would appreciate it if you could help me Parent woman from Afghanistan reported that her husband asked her if he could share her smartphone in his online session My husband is science teacher and he asked if he could use my phone At the beginning hesitated because have my sister wedding pictures on it Parent The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March In addition to sharing devices many families shared their internet access points with neighbors This practice was common in Palestine and Afghanistan but was less common in Libya since buying an internet package is cheaper than in Palestine and Afghanistan No do not like to share internet with others It is cheap have high internet speed for less than Parent When families shared internet with neighbors parents worried that their children could be stalk ed by others on their network parent from Afghanistan reported We share internet with one of our neighbors because it is expensive to buy an internet package alone My daughter told me that our neighbors son knows everything about her online account and sen her friend request Parent Students from Libya and Palestine reported that they do not feel safe and secure in the online environment when they share internet with their neighbors For example female student from Palestine said When post anything on social media our neighbors son was the first to like or comment feel he is waiting for me to write post Student Discussion The aim of the study was to explore the challenges of ERT during the COVID crisis in three developing countries Libya Palestine and Afghanistan qualitative approach was adopted to achieve this aim Moving suddenly from facetoface teaching to ERT complicated and disrupted the educational system in these countries which had already been affected by violence and unstable policy as well as the weaknesses of the infrastructure and the bad economic situation Although teachers tried their best to foster students engagement in online learning sessions they sometimes failed because of the digital inequity among students and families Teachers and students in the developing countries used synchronous and asynchronous free tools to continue teaching and learning in the ERT and teachers on both asynchronous and synchronous platforms provided support and encouraged students to engag in online activities Teachers relied on their own technology solutions because there was no welldesigned and secure online system or platform for teaching and learning As result learners digital privacy was threatened and consistent with previous studies the quality of content in the emergency context was low compared with content delivered in well planned online learning context Hodges et al Khlaif et al Mohmmed et al Whittle et al Our results found number of inequities between students Some parents could not provide their children with technological devices and families in rural and remote places encountered difficulties in getting connected to internet broadband which reduced students engagement in online synchronous sessions compared with online asynchronous sessions Girls were also less active in synchronous online sessions than boys due in large part to their hesitancy to share their personal images but they were more active and productive in the asynchronous platforms These results align with previous studies suggesting that digital inequity negatively influences the online learning process Khidhir et al Khlaif Salha Khlaif et al We also found that digital privacy was major concern for both parents and students Most families were concerned about daughters opening their webcams or sharing their screens Parents were reluctant to share their own devices for their childrens schooling and vex that their childrens activities could be monitored by neighbors via shared internet access points In general The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March violation of students and parents digital privacy increased during the coronavirus ERT which reduced students engagement in online classes The concepts of digital inequity and digital ethics are still very limited underrated and unclear in developing countries such as Palestine Afghanistan and Libya Both were eroded in the coronavirus ERT setting which had negative influence on students engagement in online classes The absence of these concepts and related processes of instructional design among teachers in ERT settings was obvious which deepened digital inequity and damaged digital privacy To address these issues the Ministries of Education in these countries may wish to consider three key actions First they could provide students and teachers with devices and reduce internet fees to make the internet available to wide range of citizens Second they could develop clear vision about digital privacy Finally develop shared technology platform across the system that will benefit learners and train teachers on it The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries Online Learning Journal Volume Issue March References Affouneh Salha Khlaif

has negative and positive consequences Yet factors associated with greater use remain unexplored despite the impor tance of their identi cation for intervention purposes It stands to reason that parents can in uence child MTSD use via their attitudes beliefs rolemodelling and style of parenting Here we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles speci cally with regard to child MTSD use exist Hungarian parents were surveyed about their children digital activities their own attitudes and beliefs regard ing the child MTSD use and their own attachment to and use of mobile phones Taking datadriven approach distinct digital par enting styles were identi ed and these resembled general parenting styles Findings further suggeste that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents were more permissive more authoritative and less authoritarian had lower educational level exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones and had more positive attitudes towards and attributed less harm and more bene ts to early device use These results are the rst evidence for existence of digital parent ing styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential pre vention and treatment targetsARTICLE HISTORY Received August Revised October Accepted October KEYWORDS Digital device mobile device touch screen

Children can use touchscreen devices even before they develop advanced motor skills as they do not need to use controllers as they do with personal computers or videogames Consequently children can begin MTSD use at an increasingly early age According to US survey the average daily time children spend with mobile device use is almost an hour for yearolds and minutes for children under the age of

or built upon in any wayis available on early MTSD use despite ndings indicating that early use of other media eg TV has mainly negative ects on child development Chonchaiya Pruksananonda Zimmerman Christakis Arguably early MTSD use ie in infancy toddlerhood and preschool years is likely similarly important from developmental perspective with potentially both negative and positive ects eg Bedford Saez de Urabain Celeste Karmilo Smith Smith Li Subrahmanyam Bai Xie Liu As such better understanding of the characteristics and factors that are associated with earlier or more intensive use may have implications for psychoeducation as well as prevention and inter vention orts Direct and indirect links between parenting and child behavior Children behavior development and sociali zation are supposed to be directly in uenced by their microsystem ie family eers and school Bronfenbrenner Especially during early developmental stages eg prior to start ing school the family and in particular the parents have perhaps the greatest in uence on child behavior relative to later developmental stages eg adolescence which are characterized by increased peer in Raaelli It has been hypothesized that parents directly in uence child behavior via rule setting Steinberg Darling and also indirectly via various other means For example parents play large role in creating home environment and di erent aspects of that environment promote certain behaviors and not others eg whether or not there is TV or PC at home if there is one in the child bedroom Parental attitudes and behaviors including rolemodelling are also related to hild habits and lifestyle such as with regard to amount of physical activity Arredondo et al or sedentary behavior including as result of screen time Xu Wen Rissel Beyond shaping and reinforcing speci behaviors parenting also involves creation of socioemotional environment through speci cparenting styles that may ect child behavior Rhee Parenting styles in the context of MTSD use Parenting styles are strongly related to child development and outcomes eg Kordi Baharudin Parenting styles correspond to the emotional climate in which parents raise their children Steinberg Darling and can be characterized by dimensions of responsivenesswarmth responding to the child needs in supportive accepting nurtur ing and involved manner and demandingnesscontrol setting demands rules control expectations boundaries to integrate the child into the society Baumrind Spera Four parenting styles can be formulated along these dimensions authoritative high warmth high demand permissive high warmth low demand laissezfaire low warmth low demand and authoritarian low warmth high demand Authoritative parenting involves high warmth sensitivity responsiveness and involve ment as well as high expectations and high demands for maturity and selfcontrol from the child Authoritative parents respect the child opinion but also maintain clear boundaries They foster their demands through bidirectional communication eg expla nations of rules and encouragement of independence Permissive parenting corresponds with high warmth but low demand They set few rules or boundaries and do not have high expectation for maturity They refrain from confrontations with their children and rarely give guidance KONOK ET ALParents with laissezfaire parenting style show low warmth responsiveness and emotional involvement and also have low demands They do not set rules do not provide guidance and discipline They make no demands for maturity and impose few controls on their child behavior Authoritarian parents are not warm and responsive They have high maturity demands are strict expect obedience and assert power They express their expectations through orders and do not explain to their children the rationale behind these rules Specic parenting styles in relation to certain areas or domains of parenting may exist and these may not necessarily be the same across domains or even as general parenting styles they may nevertheless ect children behavior or functioning in that domain eg eating behavior Vereecken Legtest De Bourdeaudhuij Maes With regard to mediarelated behaviors parenting styles may also be expressed through levels of warmth and demandingness Parental responsivenesswarmth may manifest in parents supporting their child desired digital activity eg letting the child watch videos or play games helping the child engage in certain activities eg launching an application or teaching the child how to engage in such activities on their own Parental demandingness on the other hand may manifest in parents controlling and setting limits over the child digital activities or in supervising such activity Indeed parenting styles related to children internet use were found to statistically predict that use in schoolaged children Valcke Bonte De Wever Rots Children whose parents had permissive Internet parenting style used the internet the most and those whose parents adopted an authoritarian or authoritative Internet parenting style used it the least Similarly stricter parental rules regarding TV watching were found to be negatively associated with children ss nt Jago Neither the presencenature of parenting styles related to children sM Du digital parenting styles nor the associations of those with children actual use have been investigated to date Identifying and better understanding these are timely given the ever growing presence of digital media in the daily lives of families and society and thus its potential to impact child development Digital parenting styles may not only in uence the time children spend with MTSDs but also the way they use it For example parents who expect maturity from the child or who are involved in their child MTSD use may teach the child how to use the MTSD in functional way Alternatively children whose parents onl give them the device as form of engagement rw or tt eu em yu et eM Df rs pler activities or in nonfunctional way The importance of parents for children media use has been addressed in several studies on parental mediation Parental mediation includes set of strategies used by parents to control supervise or interpret media content for children Warren Previous research has suggested th at use of parental mediation is associated with less overall time spent with and less negative outcomes of media use Gentile Nathanson Rasmussen Reimer Walsh Kalmus Blinka Olafsson However the concept of digital parenting style is broader than parental mediation as it includes amount of guidance and inv olvement with child digital device use Additionally the parenting style concept ers dimensional view in which parental behavior can be placed along the dimensions of warmth and demandingness This also emphasizes the emotional nature of these parenting styles quite than focusing solely on parental behavior as in case of parental mediationJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Rolemodelling in the context of MTSD use Children learn observationally social learning theory Bandura by attending to and imitating people in their surroundings They identify with the model and take on observed behaviors values beliefs and attitudes of the person People in the immediate surrounding of the child especially parents can more easily become rolemodels for the child and rolemodelling is an important aspect of parental in uence eg on child eating habits and obesity Brown Ogden This is applicable to media consumption as parental media use has been shown to predict child media habits Bleakley Jordan Hennessy Lauricella Wartella Rideout especially in case of heavy parental use Rideout Foehr Roberts Woodard Gridina Examples include asso ciations between family TV time and child TV time Cillero Jago Duch Fisher Ensari Harrington or parental smartphone or tabletuse and child device use Lauricella et al Of note it is not only overt parental behavior ie digital device use but also attitudes and emotions that can be modelled for children to imitate Yet no study focused on whether parental attachment to these devices is associated with child MTSD use to date Furthermore beyond rolemodelling parental media use can also inuence child behavior insofar as it corresponds to less parental attention and other resources allocated to the child For example parents who watch more TV Kirkorian Pempek Murphy Schmidt Anderson and who are heavy mobile users Radesky Schumacher Zuckerman engage in less parent child interaction Other parental factors in uencing child MTSD use Parental attitudes Parents attitudes toward certain activities or habits predict whetherto what extenthow their children will engage in those activities eg eating behavior Scaglioni Salvioni Galimberti Parental rolemodelling practices rules and parenting style may all be in uenced by parental attitudes as attitudes predict behavior Fishbein Ajzen Parental attitudes toward child media use are mixed and largely depend on media type Rideout et al while parental attitudes toward TV use are mixed they are more positive toward computer use Rideout Hamel In turn more positive parental attitudes toward media are associated with longer child time with those media Cingel Krcmar Vandewater et al However to our knowl edge only two studies examined this association in case of MTSDs Lauricella et al Nikken Schols eb wi nt Parental Beliefs section Furthermore there is disproportionate focus on cognitive aspects of attitudes ie opinions about MTSD use at the expense of focus on emotional aspects of those Pooley Connor Parental beliefs Beliefs are the cognitive source of attitudes Fishbein Ajzen Parental beliefs regarding child media use traditional and digital such as whether and at what age the media have negative or positive ects on the child may in uence the degree to which parents allow or encourage their children media use which in turn can in uence how much the child uses these devices For example parents who attribute positive ects to digital media engage in couse and active mediation whereas parents who are concerned about negative ects are more likely to restrict their child sm au Nikken Jansz Nikken Schols In support parents belief that TV can be helpful is associated with increased child screen time Vandewater et al and parents who think that media provide source of entertainmentrelaxation and who think that it KONOK ET ALhas positive ects tend to have children who spend more time with MTSD use Lauricella et al Nikken Schols In addition to these aspects of parental attitudes and behaviors other aspects of the microsystem within which youth function such as socio economic status SES and parental education can also impact child habits including screen time or MTSD use For example higher SES and parental education are related to less time child spent with mobile media Common Sense Inc though others did not nd such association in much less representative sample Kabali et al Taken together some data on the associations between parental attitudes beliefs and rolemodelling and child media use including MTSD use are available but no studies to date have focused on the existence of digital parenting styles or the associations thereof with child media use In addition in most studies children media use was measured only in terms of amount of use However the type of use eg what kind of activities children are doing on these devices is also comparably important as di erent activities eg watching videos taking photos playing games could have di erent ects on cognitive development Additionally the relationship between parental factors and these speci activities is also important to explore eg whether certain parental attitudes are related to more advanced activities Aims and hypothesis Our main aim was to reveal whether parents digital parenting style general attitude and beliefs regarding early MTSD use and rolemodelling as indicated by their own mobile attachment and use are associated with child digital activity indexed by the amount of time and type of activity children engage in MTSD use Exploratory research questions To this end we rst identi ed types of MTSD use and user types in children Exploratory Research Question and investigated Exploratory Research Question whether digital parenting styles can be identi ed and conceptually determine whether these correspond to general parenting styles as described by Baumrind Following an explorative design we relied on datadriven analytic approach involving principal component analysis PCA using items selected based on highfrequency responses in an openended questionnaire survey Also exploratorily we aimed to identify di erent kinds of parental beliefs regarding the potential bene cial and harmful ects of early MTSD use Exploratory Research Question Hypotheses We hypothesized that children engage in MTSD use for greater amount of time and in more activeadvanced manner if their parents have permissive digital parenting style have more positive general attitude toward early MTSD use have more positive cognitive concepts or beliefs ie they attribute more bene cial and less harmful eects to early use also use their own mobile phone for greater amounts of time and are more attached to their phone Variables that may have confounding ects on child MTSD use such as parental educational level and child age and sex Kabali et al Lauricella et al were accounted forJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Additionally to the best of our knowledge no data are available about how the age of onset of MTSD use changed over the past years and it was our aim to investigate the existence of such trends Parents were asked to retrospectively report on when their child rst engaged in MTSD use We hypothesized that the age of onset of MTSD use has been becoming earlier and thus that younger children are more likely to be an MTSD user by given age than older children Method Participants and procedure Participants were recruited online through acebook and the website of Hungarian online magazine where the study questionnaire Digital Kids Questionnaire see below was adver tised Parents were included if they had child aged between and years This age group was chosen because we were interested in MTSD use in early childhood Nores Barnett in this age the ects of MTSD use on development could be bigger and more long lasting Schoenmaker et al dt ei uence of parents on their child behavior is relatively greater Laible et al than during later ages Additionally based on results of our openended survey see below we assumed that in children older than years there would be less variability in experience

on age groups in support of younger children were more likely an MTSD user by their third birthday than older children Figure Discussion Digital parenting styles and their associations with children MTSD use To our knowledge the current study is the rst to provide evidence for the existence of digital parenting styles and for the association between such styles and amount and type of child MTSD use Taking an explorative approach we identi ed comparable parenting styles in relation to children MTSD use as those identi ed in case of internet Valcke et al and general Baumrind parenting styles Parents displaying permissive digital parenting style allow their children to engage in MTSD use but they are also nurturing and inter active For example parents with this style show their child how to use the applicationdevice and answer the child questions As such permissive digital parenting is associated with low levels of demandingness and high levels ofJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA involvementwarmth From the perspective of parental mediation framework permissive parents likely engage in activeinteractive mediation Nikken Jansz Conversely authoritative digital parenting refers to parenting style where MTSD use is permitted but only under certain conditions eg only after the child has attended to hisher chores and obligations andor with certain limitations eg time limits Authoritative digital parenting is thus characterized by high levels of demandingness and high levels of involvementwarmth Additionally consistent with authoritative parenting involving encouragement of child autonomy Baumrind parents with an authoritative digital parenting style tend to not lock the device screen when they give it to the child or strictly supervise use Authoritative parents use some mixture of restrictive and activeinteractive mediation setting limits and conditions Nikken Jansz Parents exhibiting an authoritarian digital parenting style restrictprohibit child MTSD use and this parenting style is thus associated with high levels of demandingness and low levels of involvementwarmth Only one item that loaded strongly onto this component describes some level of parental involvement but even this item is combination of statements re ecting di erent degrees of involvement We do not give it to herhim we only show itwe watch the picturesvideos together Therefore authoritarian parents use restrictive mediation and supervision Nikken Jansz Parents who adopt laissezfaire digital parenting style allow their children to use the device in order to engage himher suggesting that at least in this context they are not nurturing or interactive This digital parenting style is thus characterized by low demand ingness and low involvementwarmth Laissezfaire parents do not engage in mediation Parenting styles are related to child development and outcomes eg Kordi Baharudin yet little is known about the associations between digital parenting styles and child digital device use Consistent with our hypotheses parents digital parenting style is associated with amount and type of child MTSD use Furthermore it appears that this association is driven primarily not by degree of parental demandingness but by parental Figure Ratio of children who had and had not used mobile phonetablet before their rd birthday in dierent age groups reported by Hungarian parents The ratios were calculated retrospectively from parents reports about the age when their child started to use the devices KONOK ET ALinvolvementwarmth Permissive and authoritative parenting was associated with longer durations of MTSD use and more active or advanced use in children In case of authoritarian digital parenting children use MTSDs for shorter durations of time and in rather passive or nonfunctional way The degree to which parents exhibited laissezfaire style was not associated with amount of child MTSD use This is in contrast with ndings on schoolaged children internet use whose parental demandingness permissive and laissezfaire styles was shown to be negatively associated with increased internet use zgr However in contrast with older children and adolescents who possess the necessary skills and knowledge to use Internet or digital devices including MTSDs and only need parental permission to do so young children may need guidance and support to learn MTSD use and as such use them more if their parents have warmer parenting style Associations of parental attitudes beliefs and rolemodelling with children MTSD use As expected the more positive attitude the parents have regarding early MTSD use the more time the child spends engaging in such use This result is consistent with earlier ndings indicating that positive attitudes toward media were related to higher rates of child media consumption Cingel Krcmar Parental attitudes may be in uenced by parents beliefs about potential bene ts and harm of early MTSD use In the current study the positive and negative ects parents attributed to early MTSD use were similar to those reported by Nikken and Schols it improves the child knowledge and skills is an entertainment opportunity but it can also be dangerous eg inappropriate content or inappropriate use abuse by others and developmentally inappropriate Parents in the current sample additionally reported that disadvantage of MTSDs is that they take time away from other activities In line with our hypotheses we found hat parents who attribute more bene ts and less harm to early MTSD use have children who spen dm et ew hM Du sc to prior data on TV and media which suggest th at parents who believe TV can be helpful have children who watch more TV Vandewater et al and also that parental worries about media are negatively related to chi ld TV consumption Cingel Krcmar The majority of our participants reported that they believed early MTSD use has both positive and negative ects which are also consistent with earlier ndings Radesky et al Additionally we found that parents who are less educated have children who spend more time with MTSD use consistent with what has been found with regard to child TV screen time Hesketh Ball Crawford Campbell Salmon Better educated parents may be more aware of the problematic aspects of TV or mobile phone use and thus consider these in their parenting Roser Schoeni Foerster Rsli Thus educa tional background may in uence child MTSD use through in uencing beliefs and atti tudes with regard to early MTSD use Contrary to hypotheses and the ndings of Lauricella et al dP ka McDaniel amount of parental mobile use was not but degree of parental mobile attachment was associated with amount of child MTSD use This may be because it is not only through their behavior but also through their attitudes and emotions that parents can be rolemodels for their child Parents higher mobile attachment may contribute to children developing positive attitudes toward MTSDs and as their parents are also more likely to allowJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA device use to children using MTSDs more freque ntly From another perspective parents who are highly emotionally involved in digital media may have less attentional resources to interact with their child resulting in the child engaging himherself via some other means eg with MTSD use Investigating these and other putative mediating mechanisms eg role modelling parenting styles and practices ome environment between parental mobile attachment and child MTSD use are important nex steps for future research Additionally some parents may refrain from using the smartph one in front of the child while others do not and this may depend on their mobile attachme nt those who have high mobile attachment may not be able or willing to control their mobile use in front of the child This can explain why only parental mobile attachment and not mobil use is associated with child MTSD use In the future parental mobile use should be investig ated separately based on whether it occurs in front of the child or not Age of onset of MTSD use Our results support the hypothesis that chil dren are starting to use MTSDs at younger age than was the case earlier insofar as older children were less likely to have started MTSD use et ea eo ft ny rc nc trast to the professional recommendations to discourage or prohibit digital media use in hildren under the age of American Academy of Pediatrics more than onethird of the chil dren between the ages of and in our sample were reported to have started MTSD use Given signi cant neural plasticity at this age Schoenmaker et al the observed trend calls for increased empirical study of the various ects of early MTSD use Association of children age with their MTSD use Results show that as children get older they spend more time with MTSD use as in Kabali et al Lauricella et al Roser et al The proportion of regular MTSD users also considerably increased with age perhaps because MTSDs er more opportunities for older children who have more advanced cognitive and motor capabilities the results show that they typically use the MTSDs in more advanced way Limitations and future directions Although our ndings establish important associations our research design is not suitable for causal inferences Of note we cannot rule ou tt ts ev ha sc dM Du aects parenting style parental attitudebel ief or parental mobile attachment and not the other way around or that there is bidirectional ect For example it is possible that if the child uses MTSDs more parents develop more positive attitude and beliefs either because they experience positiveno negative consequ ences of the MTSD use or because of cognitive dissonance reduction Festinger Similarly not only can parenting style in uence child characteristics but the reverse is also possible adillaWalker Carlo Christensen Yorgason Additionally it is also possible hat parent variables indirectly ect children sM use We referred to the possibility of di erent mediating and moder ating mechanisms These alternatives are hardly observable as experim ental studies in this topic are not possible to carry out but longitudinal studies may clarify some of these questions KONOK ET ALAnother limitation to our study is that we observed digital parenting styles parental reactions to child MTSD use only in parents who reported that their child shows interest toward MTSDs However parents may er MTSDs to the child even if heshe does not show interest toward it so parents can be proactive not only reactive in their behaviors regarding child MTSD use This experimental consideration should be addressed in the future One of the strength of our study is its datadriven approach Instead of preselected questions ie theorydriven approach we explored parents attitudes and behaviors exerting as little in uence on those as possible Nevertheless the questionnaire will need further validation in the future Although recent study showed that when people are call for about how often they use their mobile phone the correlations are quite high between selfreport and objective log data Boase Ling parents might have distorted their responses regarding their mobile use and mobile attachment especially given that these questions were asked after parents described their opinions attitudes and parenting behaviors related to child MTSD use Therefore the order of questions may be bene cial to reverse in future studies Variables not assessed in this study may also be linked to child MTSD use For example although we measured how much the parent uses their mobile phone and to what extent they are attached to it it would be also important to measure how much time the parent uses their mobile phone or other devices in front of the children Parental mediation techniques could be also investigated in relation to digital parent ing styles eg are digital parenting styles involve certain speci mediation techniques as we hypothesize above To what extent are the two phenomena overlapping Additionally possible contribution in future studies could be to investigate whether parents general parenting style and digital parenting style correspond or diverge For example is it possible that parent has permissive digital parenting style but an author itative general parenting style Conclusions In conclusion results suggest that parents may in uence their children sM Du modelling behavior digital parenting style attitudes and beliefs about early MTSD use and their educational level Future studies should clarify how these variables are related includ ing by assessing potential mediating and moderating mechanisms and examining whether digital parenting styles explain child MTSD use above and beyond other parental factors As children start to use MTSDs at an increasingly early age and for increasing amounts of time as they get older it is predictable that MTSD use will further intensify in children during the upcoming years Adults exhibit attachment to their mobile devices Konok et al and this attachment is not only when also observable but may be more pronounced in youth and this may potentially result in youth spending less time spent with other developmentally appropriate and important activities and toys Thus there is urgent need to examine possible ects of MTSD use on development If ndings indicate that early MTSD use has some negative consequences on child development in combination with the current results the data may suggest that reduction in child MTSD use can be achieved via changes in their parents attitudes and knowledge ie parental education Hinkley Cli Okely JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA Notes The Digital Kids Questionnaire is available from the rst Author upon request For example

infrastructural facilitating education healthcare and food reaching plates to the social children connecting to learn to play and to stay in touch with their family and friends This increased reliance also cont inues to expose children to the risk of violence exploitation and abuse including sexual exploitation and abuse and has made explicit the existing digital divide and deep seated and systemic inequalities This topic was prominently reflected in the Secretary Generals report on the Rights of the Child and will be the focus of the upcoming General Comment of the Committee on the Rights of the Child The event was moderated by Mr Andrew Morley President and CEO of Worl Vision International and attracted over participants from Member States Civil Society Organizations UNICEF and other UN entities In their opening statements both the EU and Uruguay representatives noted that the biennalisation of the GA resolutio on the promotion and protection of the rights of children does not mean

not created for children but has become an essential tool for their development Member States have primary role to play in promoting and protecting child rights online The rights of the child in the digital environment are the same as in real life but to be able to guarantee them we need de ep understanding of the complexities brought in by the digital world Technology and digital tools can help children reach their potential but safe digital spaces for children are needed This requires governments private sector and civil society working together Supporting childrens rights online is truly partnership effort We ne ed to put the participation of children in the heart of any process that we get engaged in There is no one country or stakeholder that can ensure child safety online by itself

but also the digital divide Question Can we bu ild safe secure inclusive digital environment for all children that make up also human rights compliant EU developing comprehensive strategy on rights of the child Considering digital services act including dimension on children As internet is global action should also be global Engaged in accompanying the UN in responding to the call for safe and secure and human rights compliant digital space Need to give voice to children in designing future being agents of change and future of tomorrow Leave no children behind Ambassador Carlos Amorin

res ources which is also the case of caregivers and parents Reminder that we all have role to play States protection child friendly services law enforcement and justice Private sector safety by design must be key element of their services ensure proactive protection Essential role that civil society plays particularly through advocacy running helplines and hotlines There is no one country or stakeholder that can do it by itself and there is not one specific way Amal Aldoseri Vice Chair Committee on the Rights of the Child The rights of the child in real life are the same as in the digital

progressive development of emental health research Nine studies that used Internet and digital technologies to addr ess mental health are presented three RCTs three acceptability and feasibility studies and three ongoing studies without published results The interventions included are heteroge neous in terms of participants and contexts eg adolescents adu lts patients professionals rural urban aims eg collabo rative care treatment monitoring relapse prevention and modaliti es eg website online games This demonstrates the divers ity of interventions that can be made through digital technologie to meet dierent needs Despite this heterogeneity the majorit of the interventions reported in this study are meant to reduce he burden of depression the most worrying mental healthproblem

technologies for collaborative care in his particular context with adequate acceptability and satisfa ction levelsamonghealthcareteamsandpatients The reviewed studies are addressing not only adult populations but also children and adolescents who are in critical period where many mental health disorders arise Implementing Internetbased interventions to prevent or trea mental health problems in this age group can be reasonable way of dealing with the severe scarcity of mental health care resources in developing countries considering that this age group is familiar with digital technologies The reviewed tudies show that Internetbased interventions are feasible in chi ldren andadolescentswithadequateacceptabilitylevels Despite the recent growth of this eld the number of conducted and ongoing studies is still low when compared to developed countries Most studies are mainly concentrated on the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions he few eectiveness studies RCTs show that the interventions supported by digital technologies are feasible but failed to demonstrate their eectiveness in reducing symptomatology Demonstrating signicant dierences between intervention and control conditions is hindered by low sample sizes that lead to low statistical power Therefore there is need to develop more eectiveness studies with larger sample sizes an substantial followup periods Likewise studies need to dev elop understanding on how interventions work for whom and why mechanisms of change they work Given that one of the main arguments for introducing Internetbased interventions their Frontiers in Public Health December Volume Article Rojas et al Improving Mental Health Through Technologies costsaving potential costeectiveness evaluations are lso of

['ERA Forum ARTICLE Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual exploitation and abuse Ethel Quayle Published online September The Authors Abstract European law has recognised the need for international crossdisciplinary collaboration to both identify locate and safeguard victims and prevent investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse OCSEA However there is evi dence that these crimes are continuing to increase and develop in step with techno logical advances Changing the behaviour of both perpetrators and victims is both challenging and expensive and there is little evidence of what works to reduce these crimes In this paper an argument is presented that changing the environments which support OCSEA is necessary if we are to detect and manage these crimes and more importantly prevent them Keywords Child sexual abuse Internet Affordances Prevention Introduction In report commissioned by the Council of Europe it was noted that Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse OCSEA does not respect national jurisdictions and that there was need for national and international crossdisciplinary collaboration to identify locate and safeguard victims and prevent investigate and prosecute these crimesIt was also recognise that any such cooperation would require the abil ity to respond to technological change and the corresponding changes in offender doings Perhaps the most important international law instrument dedicated to the Carr BE Quayle Professor of Forensic Clinical Psychology COPINE Research Clinical Health Psychology School of Health in Social Science University of Edinburgh Teviot Place Edinburgh UK Quayle rights of the child is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child CRCwith Article of the CRC requiring states to protect the child from all forms of sexualexploitation and sexual abuse It also makes specic reference to preventing the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials The OptionalProtocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children Child Prostitution and Child Pornography OPSC which followed covered many forms of sexual abuse and exploitationand specically referred to child pornography Article of the OPSC denes child pornography as any representation of whatever means of child engaged inreal or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts ofa child for primarily sexual purposes which provided wider denition that other international instruments Gillespie has argued that the region which has paid the most attention to the issue of child exploitation and in particular child sexual abuse mate rials CSAM is Europe with both the Council of Europe and the European Unionenacting international instruments that specically relate to the issue of the sexualexploitation of child including through child pornography The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Children against Sex ual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse CETS Lanzarote Convention and the Convention on Cybercrime CETS Budapest Convention provide comprehensivebenchmarks for both criminal law and procedural law standards to prevent and combat OCSEA They build on the international standards set out by the UNRC and the OPSC designed to protect children Articles to of the Lanzarote Convention and Article of the Budapest Convention set out the substantive criminal lawand denitions of offences required to be transposed into national law This convention was the rst instrument to establish the various forms of child sexual abuse ascriminal offences including abuse committed in the home or family with the use offorce coercion or threats The articles specically relevant to OCSEA offences areArticles to of the Lanzarote Convention which focus specically in Article on criminalising the production distribution and possession of and knowing access to child pornography increasingly referred to as CSAM offences concerning the participation of child in pornographic performances Article the corruption ofchildren through intentional exposure to sexual activities Article and the solicitation of children for sexual purposes Article In the European Union Article of the Directive EU of the European Parliament and Council on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornographyrequires EU Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that attemptsto solicit child to provide CSAM are punishable Article of the Lanzarote Convention requires states to criminalise the intentional proposal of an adult to meeta child for the purpose of unlawful sexual activity The Opinion of the Lanzarote Committee on Article of the Convention noted that The solicitation of UN Commission on Human Rights Convention on the Rights of the Child March ECN RES ARES of May Gillespie AA Gillespie Baines Greijer and Doek Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual children through information and communication technologies does not necessarily result in meeting in person It may remain online and nonetheless cause serious harm to the child The sexual offences which are intentionally perpetrated during an online meeting through communication technologies are often linked to the produc tion possession and transmission of child pornography pOf some importance here is that the assumption of harm which underpins most legislation largely relatesto the production of CSAM and until recently there has been little research that has explored the additional harms that come through the possession and distribution of this material In joint initiative by the EU and the United States in countries from around the world signed up to Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse On line They committed to key policy targets that aim at larger number of rescued victims more effective prosecution and an overall reduction in the number of childsexual abuse images available online The Global Alliance subsequently merged with the UKs WeProtect initiative to form the WeProtect Global Alliance to end child sexual exploitation online which brought together over governments global technology companies and leading international and nongovernmental organisa tions to protect children from sexual exploitation online The Global Alliance produced Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse CSEA Model National Response to provide guidelines and support on how to achievethe commitments The Model was intended to enable country to assess its current response and identify gaps prioritise national efforts to ll gaps and enhance inter national understanding and cooperation Its purpose is not prescriptive but aims to describe the capabilities needed for effective child protection highlight good practice from countries that are already delivering these capabilities and signpost organisa tions that can provide further guidance and support to countries seeking to develop or enhance their existing capability This tool is an interesting development as it bringstogether in an accessible format international frameworks as well as the substantial contributions made by organisations such as the United Nations ECPAT and ICMEC Scale of the problem In September the New York Times noted that in the previous year technol ogy companies reported to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Chil dren NCMEC over million photographs and videos of children being sexually abused This was more than twice the number reported in the previous yearThe Lanzarote Committee Opinion on Article of the Lanzarote Convention and its explanatory note Available at onarticleofthelanzaroteconventionanditsexplanatorynotehtml Hessick CB GewirtzMeydan et al Gass et al Maas et al Pashang et al Keller MH Dance GJX Quayle article made reference to research completed in in collaboration with NCMEC which stated that online sharing platforms have accelerated the pace of CSAI child sexual abuse image content creation and distribution to breaking point whereNCMECs manual review capabilities and law enforcement investigations no longerscale This study used anonymised metadata associated with the NCMEC reports related to suspected CSAI that were received from March when NCMECs CyberTipline was created until September NCMEC reports come from the US public and many US ESPs electronic service providers and over million such reports occurred in the year approximately one millionper month compared to the reports in its rst ten years of operation While meaningful estimates of these crimes are highly problematic it has been argued that there are essentially four ways in which onlinefacilitated child sexualabuse OCSA can be measured by counting the number of offences committed thenumber of perpetrators the number of victims and the number of images that havebeen viewed downloaded and exchanged However these authors note that quan tication based on each of these four measures inevitably produces very different gures partly because they are attempting to count different aspects of OCSA However there is converging evidence that sexual imagerelated crimes against childrenare increasing although recent metaanalysis of the prevalence of online solicitationamongst youth one specic form of online child sexual abuse would indicate thatone in nine young people experience online solicitation although prevalence rateshave decreased over time Cybercrime Online child sexual abuse OCSA can be positioned as cybercrime in which technology plays role across broad spectrum of activities The denition of cybercrimehas been described as highly contentious as while many people agree that cybercrime exists they are not really clear what it is In this respect cybercrime has developed from earlier concepts of computer crime and ecrime and has broadened to cover many different forms of criminal activity The European Crime Prevention Networkhas also argued that there is current absence of any consistent deni tion and even within specic legislative documents cybercrime is used in differentways For example the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention uses broad criminalisation headings in its denition of cybercrime including offences against thecondentiality integrity and availability of computer data and systems computerrelated offences contentrelated offences and copyrightrelated offences Bursztein et al Wager et al Madigan et al Wall DS EUCPN Cybercrime theoretical overview of the growing digital threat In EUCPN Secretariat eds EUCPN Theoretical Paper Series European Crime Prevention Network Brussels Council of the European Union Convention on Cybercrime Budapest November Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual Many researchers and practitionersuse cyberdependent crime and cyber enabled crime or cyberassisted crime to classify different forms of cybercrime Atone end of the cybercrime spectrum there is cyberassisted crime in which the Inter net is used in its organisation and implementation but which would still take place if the Internet was removed eg potential offender using online social media to locatea child who is sexually assaulted offline At the other end of the spectrum is cyber dependent crime which exists because of the Internet such as DDoS distributed denialofservice attacks or spamming Differentiating between cyberassisted crimeand cyberenabled crime is at times very difcult but it would appear that the boundaries between cybercrime and traditional forms of crime have never been clear cut and are becoming increasingly blurred due to the level of hyperconnectivity in to days highly digitised and networked world The ubiquitous use of the Internet and smart mobile devices in peoples everyday lives the wide adoption of cloudbased services by industry and government and for example the advent of the Internet of Things IoT the Internet of Everything IoE and CyberPhysical Systems CPSshave led to the widely accepted belief that almost all criminal activities include somecyber elements As consequence digital forensics sometimes called cyber foren sics have become an essential part of almost all crime investigation processes for law enforcement around the world The United Nations Ofce on Drugs and Crimealso argues that there is no international denition of cybercrime or cyberattacks but while they use the cyber enabledcyberdependent dichotomy they add further speciccrime type online child sexual exploitation and abuse which includes abuse on the clear internet darknet forums and increasingly the exploitation of selfcreated imagery via extortion known as sextortion Quayle expanded these crimes to include the production dissemination and possession of child sexual abuse images known in many jurisdictions as child pornography online grooming of children for sexual purposes sexting sexual extortion of children sextortion revenge pornography commercial sexual exploitation of children exploitation of children through online prostitution and live streaming of sexual abuse Other authors have dened OCSA as sexual abuse of children involving force or enticement to take part in sexual activities where the online environment is involved at any stage of the offenceThis includes the production preparation consumption sharing dissemination or possession of childsexual abuse material and the solicitation of children for sexual purposes of childrensometimes called grooming whether or not it results or is intended to result in contact offence In high to middle income countries technology now mediates al most all human activities in some ways including those of children which makes McGuire Dowling Sarre et al Miraz et al EUROPOL Internet organised crime threat assessment Available at europaeuinternetorganisedcrimethreatassessment UNOCDC Cybercrime Available at Quayle MayChahal Palmer Quayle an analysis of clear distinctions between ofine and online abuse difcult Digital technologies are embedded in our everyday practices and form an intrinsic part of private and public experiences Yet whilst creating opportunities for children to act asreceivers participants and actors in the digital world the Internet also creates spaces of social interaction which hold the potential for exposure to online risks including sexual risks such as abuse and exploitation Cybercrime migration What is important to note is that while there is converging evidence in some coun tries to support falling rates of nontechnologymediated child victimisation includ ing child sexual abusethis does not appear to be the case in relation to some forms of OCSA It is easy to speculate as to whether there is relationship between the decrease in ofine CSA and an increase in OCSA and whether there has been migration from one to the other It is however much more difcult to evi dence this Probably the largest number of convictions for cyber sexual crimes relate to possession of CSAMand this may relate to the forensic evidence available for law enforcement to secure convictionMany if not all people charged with pos session will have permanent product of that crime available to law enforcementpictures and videos depicting child abuse and exploitation that meet the criteria in that jurisdiction for illegality It might be argued that this as opposed to the evidence re quired for prosecution of contact offence against child will increase the number of successful convictions However though not without its critics the cybercrime hypothesis has been used to account for reduction of crime in other areas MirLlinares and Moneva present two hypotheses which they argue highlight the essential role of cyberspace as an environment that has shifted criminal opportunitiesfrom physical to virtual space and which ultimately reects on crime trends The rst hypothesis provides evidence that the more time spent at home by many young people engaging with for example video games and other online activities could have had an impact on the drop in juvenile crime Their second hypothesis states which has relevance for this paper that the appearance of cyberspace has led to ashift in opportunities from physical place to cyberspace This seems particularly per tinent in relation to online grooming or sexual solicitation For example survey of law enforcement indicated that social networking sites SNSs were used to initiate Finkelhor Jones Laaksonen et al Dunne et al Shields et al Wolak et al Walsh et al Farrell Birks MiroLlinares Moneva Mitchell KJ et al Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual sexual relationships to provide means of communication between victim and of fender to access information about the victim to disseminate information or pictures about the victim and to get in touch with the victims friends SNSs might be said to afford opportunities for offending In similar way what has been noted in offendersamples is the ease that online sexual behaviour can take place often prompted bythe easy exchange of photographs text or the presence of web cameras without anyphysical contact or the risks that would be associated with it Affordances Positioning OCSEA as cybercrimes forces us to think about the context in whichthese abuses and exploitations take place This potentially may offer ways of preventing or managing these crimes and moves us away from focus on the characteristicsof offenders or their victims and how it may be possible to effect changes in their behaviour In the context of young peoples mental health and digital environments it has been suggested that digital technologies have their own affordances which arelisted as persistence replicability scalability and searchability The affordances of digital technology in conjunction with the capabilities of online and networked technology such as social media allow digital information to be easily copied replica bility easily shared with large audiences scalability easily recorded and archived persistence and easily accessed by others and found in the future searchabilityLivingstone argues that these affordances are the result of complex networked infrastructures invented and implemented by people working under huge pressure and at speed in largely commercial in stitutions with global ambitions That means the needs of vulnerable young people may come very low down in their list of priorities How far researchersclinicians and other practitioners can wrest back control to ensure digital networks meet the best interests of young people is as yet unknown though surelya struggle worth the effort This has been explored in the context of revenge porn nonconsensual inti mate image distribution where it is argued that replicability and scalability haveincreased the ease with which such an act can be committed and the ease with whicha nudesexual image can be distributed to large audience Persistence and search ability have also augmented impact of this act in some cases by allowing this content to be located by others and to potentially affect victim at some point in the future However Dodge is critical of the decontextualised ways in which for example the judiciary have universally used these digital affordances to justify harsh sentences andthis is further explored in discussion of affordancesinpractice which stresses the Quayle et al Boyd Livingstone Dodge Quayle idea that affordances are not intrinsic properties that can be dened outside their sit uated context of usage but ongoing enactments by specic users that may vary acrossspace and time The term affordance is used throughout this paper and this warrants further dis cussion For Gibson affordances referred to the possibilities that an object offers foraction where the properties of the object emerge through the interaction betweenactors and those objects This is not only related to the physical properties of the object but also to social norms and rulesThe concept was further developed in re lation to humancomputer interaction where it was argued that an affordance shouldnot be understood as property but rather as human relationship It is therefore not static feature of an object and whether an affordance exists depends entirely on the relationship between the actor and the property Norman argued that the concept ofaffordances does not imply that online practices are determined by technology butrather by how people use it Therefore affordances are not static features of tech nology but have number of potential actions associated with them An affordance exists once user has perceived it and perceived the potential actions associated withit For example oice over Internet Protocols such as Skype have not only beenused by many people to keep in touch with geographically distant family members but also to facilitate the live streaming of sexual abuse of children There are reportsof live streaming in South Asia with victims described as deprived children who arecoerced into live streaming of sexual abuse from computers provided by employers against their will However live streaming has also been reported in highincome countries such as the UKLive streaming provides realtime access to events for participants who are not actually engaging in the activity themselves The UKs National Crime Agencys strategic assessment of serious organised crime suggested that the practice of live cyclosis is one example of how offenders can simultaneously create indecent images of children IIOC online view IIOC and commit contactabuse by proxy overseas case study on Periscope live streaming platform provides forensic examination of the technical and legal challenges for the investi gation of live streaming of sexual abuseThis is good illustration of how actors may use technologies in creative and unpredictable ways Costa Gibson JJ Meredith Norman DA Share et al Brown et al Internet Watch Foundation Available at abuselivestreamingrevealsofvictimsareorunder National Crime Agency National strategic assessment of serious and organised crime Available at Horsman Jarzabkowski Kaplan Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual It has also been argued that the Internet creates affordances that facilitate innova tive ways of committing old and new crimesand Jerde suggests child sexual abuse material CSAM as an example of crime that uses Internet affordances to circum vent law enforcement techniques deployed around national borders to avoid detec tionp further study in the context of cyberbullying on social networking sites SNSs used affordance to refer to the mutuality of actor intentions and technology capabilities that provide the potential for particular action This relational view of affordance is seen as advantageous for understanding technology use becauseit allows us to consider the symbiotic relationship between the capabilities of thetechnology and the actors goal and actions It has been argued that the actualisation of affordances occurs when an actor takes advantage of one or more affordances of SNSs to achieve immediate concrete outcomes that support their goals The focus istherefore on contextualised actions that technology makes qualitatively easier but which may be specic to that relationality and which potentially move researchersaway from the certainties of separate technology attributes and actors attitudes Technological affordances and CSAM Technological affordances have also been considered in the context of an interaction between design and usage and an example of this is privacy settings whereaffordances shape practice in that privacy settings distinguish between public private or partially private communications However as previously noted users also shape affordances for example young people setting up multiple proles on SNSs toproject different selves to different audiences Earlier work in this area suggested thatwe can also identify social affordances that refer to interactions between how users respond the social context and social networks However it has been argued that other people provide the richest and most signicant environmental affordances One nding of interest in relation to online grooming of children is that technological affordances are related to the motivations people have for using them It is notonly important to think about what these action possibilities are but when and forwhom they might happen For adolescents this may relate to the developmental taskof exploring sexuality afforded through the ability to create sexual media the on line applications that support this eg WhatsApp Instagram and the peer and adult engagement with this digital content Of importance it has been noted that new technologies reshape public life but teens engagement also recongures the technologyitself In the context of technologymediated CSA consideration of the reciprocity of Robey et al Jerde Chan et al Earl Kimport Majchrzak et al Staksrud et al Wellman et al Kaufmann Clment Quayle this engagement needs to be widened to include another set of actors those moti vated by sexual interest in children Crime opportunity theoryand the affordance perspective has been used to de velop metaframework to inform an understanding of SNS bullyingSpecically crime opportunity theory argues that two primary components contribute to crimebeing committed likely perpetrator and environmental conditions that offer criminogenic opportunities In this context using an affordance perspective into crime opportunity theory helped explain how social media allows perpetrator to evalu ate whether environmental conditions would facilitate SNS bullying activity In theirempirical study they proposed two SNS environmental conditions that offered criminogenic opportunities for likely offender to engage in SNS bullying These were the presence of suitable targets and the absence of capable guardianships The af fordances that facilitated the identication of suitable targets and which have relevance for technologymediated sexual abuse offences were accessibility informationretrieval editability and association The rst two of these accessibility and infor mation retrieval are particularly salient for OCSA crimes Accessibility affordance allows perpetrator to transcend time and spatial constraints to reach potential targetsand provides the opportunity to connect with an unlimited number of users includingpeople who are known and also unknown leading to an environment where suitable targets can be identied and accessed Information retrieval affordance refers to the extent to which user believes that an SNS offers the opportunity to obtain information about user on that platform This allows likely offender to access materialcreated by potential target which provides information about the background pref erences and daily activities of that individual These authors note that SNS updates often include new features that encourage users to continuously create and share information on these platforms Earlier work had also used these frameworks to understand CSAMrelated crimes Their starting point was routine activity theorywhich identied three minimal elements for criminal action likely offender ii suitable target andiii absence of capable guardian Focus on access to suitable target as with themetaframework developed in relation to bullying drew attention to the context in which potential criminal activity takes place which can be modied or changed This moves the focus away from the likely offender and the likely circumstances bothdistal and proximal that might have inuenced their behaviour to the possibility ofchanging the environment in way that increases or supplements the availability of capable guardianship It distinguishes between the inclination to offend and the ac tual offence Analysing criminal activity which is both particular and grounded inits situational context should therefore relate to the context and circumstances of aparticular situation In the context of CSAM the absence of capable guardian seems particularly pertinent In November the BBC news reported along with other agencies the Felson Clarke Ibid Taylor Quayle Cohen LE Felson Prevention disruption and deterrence of online child sexual decision by Facebook to encrypt all of its messenger services The endtoend en cryption on Facebookowned WhatsApp will be extended to Facebook Messenger and Instagram with Mr Zuckerberg CEO Facebook acknowledging there wouldbe tradeoff that would benet child sex abusers and other criminals While there is limited evidence for the purposeful use of encryption by offenders to conceal online sexual activities against minorstools such as WhatsApp which have end to end encryption protect the data during transmission and storage by default This also means that the applications used by organisations such as NCMEC and theInternet Watch Foundation IWF to detect and remove CSAM content such as Pho toDNA may no longer have the same efcacy PhotoDNA creates unique digital signature hash of an image which is then compared with hashes of other photos to nd copies of the same image When matched with database containing hashesof previously identied illegal images PhotoDNA helps detect disrupt and report the distribution of child exploitation material Paradoxically encryption by default may provide an environment which perpetuates the sense of privacy and anonymity associated with such applications recent study albeit within different context concluded that new app developers need to be mindful of the affordances of the prod ucts they developand in terms of online child protection this may be crucial Criminogenic qualities of the Internet Recently there have been number of studies examining the criminogenic qualities of the Internet It has been argued that situations vary in their criminogenic qualities producing or leading to crime from those that challenge offenders by re quiring them to create opportunities through those that provide easy temptations to those that actively provoke crimeImportantly Wortley considers the interaction between criminogenic environments and the criminogenic disposition of the likely of fender The latter has its roots in an offender typology which is based on the strength of criminal dispositions and the different roles played in their crimes by the imme diate environmentIn this typology antisocial predators may actively seek out criminal opportunities and use situational information to make rational choices about the risks and benets of committing an act Mundane offenders engage in lowlevel crime and seem to demonstrate poor selfcontrol and succumb easily to the oppor tunities offered in given situation The nal category provoked offenders are less

Clarke RV Quayle likely to have criminal record but react to an array of situational conditions some which may be internal and others environmental Related to this Seto described motivationfacilitation model of sex offending which examined the relationships be tween paraphilic traits predispositions state factors which facilitate acting on thesepredispositions and situational factors access and presence of capable guardian This was examined in the context of CSAM offenders and concluded that many of these individuals are motivated to engage in sexual behaviour with children as they have paedophilic or hebephilic sexual interests but that they demonstrate high levelsof selfcontrol or low in facilitation factors This leaves them less likely to commit acontact offence but this in the context of access to Internet technologies is not suf cient to inhibit acting on the opportunity to commit CSAM offences These offenders have also been found to have greater access to technology but less access to childrenthan contact offenders These issues are also examined in Brewer et als study on adolescent delinquency and the criminogenic features of digital technologyThese authors argue that the Internet exhibits features that make it uniquely criminogenic to ofine environmentsThe Internet as distinct place is said to deterritorialize encounters which are no longer limited by geography and can take place in synchronous or asynchronous time which enable identity and motives to remain concealed They suggest that Users caneasily move from point of predictable use eg targeted information searches to apparently random and unpredictable discoveries of information images and points of view due to the multiple hidden linkages between websites and services that are often driven by commercial considerations Algorithms may also direct ornudge users to certain content or services based on past individual or collective activity It has been argued that these algorithms can be specically designed to capitalize on cravings and curiosities and they may well have affordance qualities topical example of this relates to YouTubes video recommendation system which displays on sidebar what is up next for the viewerThese are ranked according to the users history and context and newer videos are generally prefer enced publication in the New York Times reported that YouTubes algorithm was encouraging people with sexual interest in children to watch videos of partiallyclothed minors often after viewing videos with sexual content These videos wereoften domestic and showed children at the swimming pool or on vacation but their report claimed that there was evidence that for some of the people watching them they were serving different and

number of individuals will increase the likelihood of viewing content that may approximate sexually inappropriate or illegal content It has been suggested that there are qualities of the Internet either in association with facilitating conditions personal or environmental or otherwise that in themselves made accessing and possession of CSAM more likely and in essence operate as event factors that relate to the commission of this particular crime This ar gument was framed within an analysis drawing on situational crime control modelwhich emphasises the signicance of precriminal situations and opportunity Taylor drew parallels between terrorist activities and CSAMrelated crimes and arguesthat some forms of user interaction with the Internet suggest the Internet may have criminogenic qualities Firstly the distributed nature of the Internet and the corre sponding lack of control over content is factor in increased availability of illegal orundesirable material Secondly the way that distributed complex global microstructures develop effectively increases opportunity for access to that content Alongsidethis criminal conspiracies can deliberately and intentionally use both content and opportunity to engage with and draw in otherwise uncommitted people Practice implications for prevention Changing individuals likely offenders and likely targets is both challenging and expensive Over the last years there has been development of number of internet safety and education programmes to increase positive adolescent behaviour andsafety online but their ndings from systematic review of related studies suggested that there is still need for reevaluating how internet safety education is delivered in the future In further publication content analysis of four Internet Safety Ed ucation Programmes for children indicated that most were not incorporating proveneducation strategies and lacked any strong evidence base although more recent study does advocate for the alignment of such programmes with clearer evidence baseThey also challenged whether messages would be better delivered through broader youth safety prevention programs versus standalone lessons Interventionprogrammes that target online offenders have shown equivocal evidence For example the UKaccredited treatment programme iSOTP was assessed following completion of pre and postpsychometric assessments by convicted offenders and in dicated improvements in socioaffective functioning and decrease in prooffending attitudes An evaluation of the psychoeducational programme Inform and Inform

the followup period when compared with the matched comparison offenders who had received no treatment compared with It appear likely that changing the contexts in which sexual crimes take place may offer greater opportunity to effect change Wortley comments that the most common model of situation prevention is opportunity reduction which involves ma nipulating the immediate environmental contingencies so as to increase the perceivedcosts of offending He applies this to the problem of CSAM through an examina tion of three opportunityreduction strategies reducing perceived rewards increas ing the perceived effort and increasing the perceived risks Reducing the rewards ofCSAM may involve removing or denying access to content that is targeted by offenders through for example regulatory control of content by Internet Service Providers Disruption tactics such as blocking efforts by Google and Microsoft resulted in drop over months in webbased searches for abuse images compared withno blocking activities from Yandex There are some positive indicators in rela tion to Internet monitoring moderation and reporting of tough content or be haviourOne example is the development of web crawler Arachnid by the Cana dian Centre for Child Protection to detect images and videos based on conrmed digital ngerprints of illegal content and combat the proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the Internet They report that the automated crawler helps reduce the on line availability of child sexual abuse material through its identication and issuingof notice to the hosting provider requesting its removal As of November over million images were identied for analyst review and million notices were sent to providers Of these of related to victims who are not known to have been identied by police Such disruption tactics reduce the number of im ages available through simple searching which is important as the presence of easily available CSAM and high levels of Internet use are risk factors in Internet offending Increasing the perceived effort of accessing CSAM involves making it more difcultfor offenders to gain access to content which means they have to expend more effortA publication by the Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Content presents collation of approaches that have been proved successful in deterring or detecting illegal or illicit use of mobile payment services used to access CSAM It is also Gillespie et al Mews et al Ibid Steel Quayle Koukopoulos Project Arachnid Available at Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse

risks may be achieved through proactive policing One example of this is provided by the EUROPOL initiative PolicePeer which involves law enforcement informing people trying to access or share CSAM on PPnetworks of the risks that they are taking and offering information as to where theycan get help In similar vein attention has been drawn to the particular context in which access to CSAM occurs which rmly locates the behaviour within the factors that inuenceit These have been summarized as the signicance of high affordance cues givingaccess to images immediate and highly salient reinforcement on achieving accessto images perceived absence of capable guardianship and surveillance in generalsense as far as the Internet is concerned and in specic sense in terms of the privacyassociated with Internet use insensitivity to immediate negative qualities resultingfrom both motivational factors and the strong affordance qualities of screen basedcues Three kinds of crime prevention initiatives have been identied which may be of value in helping to place this into context primary prevention focused on stopping crime before it occurs secondary prevention directed at people thought tobe at high risk of committing an offence and tertiary prevention focused on knownoffenders These categories were used to explore prevention efforts in relation to CSAM using two additional crime prevention categories reducing provocation and removing excuses Removing excuses for example through informing target audiences of the illegality of CSAM and its associated harms to children through media campaigns have provided evidence that these represent an effective way to reacha large audience and transmit the messages that there are signicant consequencesto viewing CSAM individuals have personal responsibility in controlling their behaviour and that help is available In this respect campaigns appear to be an appropriate strategy for deterring people from viewing CSAM that sits alongside otherinitiatives While there is no evidence to suggest that online abuse and exploitation are moreserious or pervasive offences than crimes occurring ofine it is the case that theaffordances offered by online social media may present signicant risk factor forsome children Three factors play an important role in this complex and dynamicscenario potential perpetrators and

Alliance brings together experts from government the private sector and civil society to develop policies and solutions to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse online The Alliance generates political commitment and practical approaches to make the digital world safe and positive for children preventing sexual abuse and longterm harm ECPAT International is global network of civil society organisations working towards the vision of ending the sexual exploitation of children With over years of experience in engaging with and managing multistakeholder processes and alliances across national regional and global levels ECPAT is considered to be at the helm of all issues and manifestations pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children With Secretariat based in Bangkok Thailand driving strategic direction producing key research and working on global advocacy together with the ontheground efforts of members in countries the network approach bridges local communities governments and the private sector offering global approach combined with customised national actions In recent years important achievements have been made in the areas of prevention legislative protection child participation research as well as collaboration with private companies in the travel and tourism sector in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children in such context both at the national level and in the main tourist destinations of the country Fundacin Renacer is nongovernmental organisation active since in Colombia to prevent and eradicate the commercial sexual exploitation of girls boys and adolescents in any form The work of Fundacin Renacer follows three lines of action comprehensive care for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation prevention and research This social organisation is pioneer in the country due to the development of comprehensive care and protection models and also protection environments from rights gender and differential approach and from multisectoral and interinstitutional actions Fundacin Renacer has managed to develop advocacy actions to strengthen public policies to address these issues and has consolidated strategies in an articulated manner with the government sector private sector community civil society and adolescents and young leaders in various departments cities and municipalities of

with survivors Frontline support workers survey Challenges and limitations Findings Trends in child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia Reporting mechanisms Support services Recommendations Recommendations on reporting mechanisms Recommendations on support services INTRODUCTION Photo by LeeAnn Cline Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaDefining child sexual exploitation and abuse online Child sexual abuse refers to various sexual activities perpetrated against children persons under regardless of whether the children are aware that what is happening to them is neither normal nor acceptable It can be committed by adults or peers and usually involves an individual or group taking advantage of an imbalance of power It can be committed with or without explicit force with offenders frequently using authority power manipulation or deception Child sexual exploitation involves the same abusive actions However an additional element must also be present exchange of something eg money shelter material goods immaterial things like protection or relationship or even the mere promise of such Child sexual exploitation and abuse online includes an evolving range of practices including Child sexual abuse material The production distribution dissemination importing exporting offering selling possession of or knowingly obtaining access to child sexual abuse material online even if the sexual abuse that is depicted in the material was carried out offline Grooming children online for sexual purposes Identifying andor preparing children via online technology with view to exploiting them sexually whether the acts that follow are then carried out online or offline or even not carried out at all Live streaming of child sexual abuse Sexual exploitation which involves the coercion threat or deception of child into sexual activities that are transmitted streamed live via the Internet for viewing by others remotely Other practices Related concepts can include online sexual extortion the nonconsensual sharing of selfgenerated sexual content involving children unwanted exposure to sexualised content among othersChild sexual exploitation and abuse online refers to situations involving digital Internet and communication technologies at some point during the continuum of abuse or exploitation It can occur fully online or through mix of online and in person interactions between offenders and children Interagency Working Group on Sexual Exploitation of Children Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse Bangkok ECPAT International Ibid ECPAT International Summary Paper Online Child Sexual Exploitation Bangkok ECPAT International Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaBackground Research about child sexual exploitation and abuse online has received increased attention recently particularly as our lives shifted further online during responses to the Covid pandemic Research from global north countries is over represented on this topic with far fewer studies taking place in low and middleincome countries continuum exists for our online and offline lives which also impacts this issue with blurred boundaries between our physical and digital worlds Sexual violence is also taking place in different ways online as well as in situations involving online and inperson elements of grooming facilitation and sharing Furthermore childrens voices about their experiences of these crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online nor the responses they receive Much of the existing research has also focused on identifying potential risks to children rather than directly measuring the evidence of harm that some have faced This is understandable as its ethically more complex to conduct research with young people who have experienced harm Yet fully understanding online harms is important to inform preventions and responses It must also be remembered that in reality the vast majority of cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse go unreported making it difficult to truly determine the scope of this problem in the first place Researchers have used qualitative methods like online surveys to examine childhood experiences of sexual exploitation and abuse online predominantly focused on survivors of child sexual abuse material production In one such study approximately half of those who responded felt that the images were associated with specific problems that were different to those caused by the actual abuse Nearly half of the respondents worried that people would think that they were willing participants or that people would recognise them Interestingly in this study onethird refused to talk about the images and denied that there were images Three themes were identified from the data guilt and shame their ongoing vulnerability and an empowerment dimension the images sometimes brought An additional study of adult survivors came from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection who conducted an online survey with female respondents whose child sexual abuse was recorded andor distributed online Seventy per cent of that sample also expressed anxieties about being recognised from the images further qualitative study of children who were referred following suspected online sexual abuse found that only were willing to talk about what had happened The remainder denied that anything had taken place in spite of the fact that there were digital images of their abuse The interviews with these children indicated that they were very critical of themselves and often had strong feelings of loyalty towards their offender The reluctance to accept disclose and attributions of selfblame have been evidenced in other research with children who have experienced online sexual exploitation both in relation to abuse through sexual image production as well as online grooming These are important lessons not only for Childrens voices about their experiences of sexual crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online nor the responses they receive Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in Colombiaresearch studies with these hardtoreach populations but also in relation to the recovery needs of these individuals Breaking down these common phenomena which may be heavily internalised is clearly required These studies notwithstanding qualitative research with children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse online is still relatively rare Such children are difficult to both identify and recruit which in part may reflect the ethical challenges of approaching children directly and also because many professionals act as gatekeepers to children and are reluctant to approach them for research due to justifiable fears of further traumatisation Crucially any such research must also be completed using ethically appropriate and safe techniques for engaging survivors However growing numbers of children are being supported by support services around the world for issues related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Seeking to understand and build on the strengths of such services and address their weaknesses is priority Amplifying the voices of young people who have had these experiences is vital for this work The increasing problem of child sexual exploitation and abuse online requires detailed extensive and sustained attention This is especially the case in middle and lowincome countries where the issue often lacks visibility and few studies have been conducted to date Specific evidence about the quality and effectiveness of support services will enable targeted responses in which governments nongovernmental organisations and the private sector can cooperate to address this problem Ensuring that the voices of children who have had experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are part of the evidence as was achieved in this project enables childcentred and informed approaches that better prevent this issue from occurring and better support those young people subjected to these crimes Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Subsister Perspectives in ColombiaThe project in Colombia To explore child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia this project undertook two research activities The conversations with young survivors focused on their recommendations for improving prevention and support services for children not their abuse as explained below The approach ensured that the research was informed directly by survivors who were drawing on their own experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation and abuse online Including their perspectives in the research bridges the conspicuous gaps noted above that sometimes persist in the evidence in this sensitive area Surveying frontline support workers aimed to provide substantial and nuanced understanding of how child sexual exploitation and abuse online is presenting in social support services Data from these professionals indicates knowledge and perceptions of the problem amongst workers caregivers and the general public identifies key vulnerabilities for children and assesses accessibility of care to support children subjected to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Data from Colombia was presented alongside data from five other countries involved in the project to panel of experts at an online roundtable held on th July Insights from the roundtable helped frame the data in the overall project report and this and other countries national reportsQualitative oneonone conversations with young people who had experienced child sexual exploitation and abuse onlineAn online survey of frontline support workers who were working with child survivors of sexual exploitation and abuse The project was implemented in Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Colombia Mexico Moldova and Peru This report solely includes the findings of the activities conducted in Colombia Similar national reports are available for all project countries along with project report summarising the findings across the six target countriesMETHODOLOGY Photo by Saul Mercado Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaConversations with survivors The conversations with young survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are of foremost importance to this project They were conducted with the intention to shed light on the conspicuous gaps that persist when survivors perspectives are excluded from work to shape policy and legislation in this area The conversations explored the survivors perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of existing support services and gathered recommendations for improvements Rationale Engaging survivors of child sexual exploitation in research requires substantial care to accommodate range of ethical considerations Such research must place significant value on survivors having the right to safely actively and meaningfully participate in discourse on issues that impact upon them Therefore the design for the survivors conversations in this project was built on the principle that the participants had and perceived themselves to have significant control over the process including the decisions of what they shared range of measures were taken that reinforced that survivors had full control over sharing their perspectives on their terms To ensure that the perspectives of young survivors were meaningfully included in this project ECPAT International developed comprehensive participantcentred ethically sound and traumainformed approach to engaging them with the help of an expert who had extensive experience working with survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation The conversations approach is thus dialogue with young survivors on issues which matter to them and which explore their experiences of the support that they received Participants were invited to speak freely about their personal experiences of support services through their recovery process and the facilitators used active listening to engage with the young persons and understand their story exploring particular gaps in understanding and drawing out the detail needed to represent young peoples perspectives of these issues Probing questions eliciting narratives across their experiences were only done responsively and to prompt discussion This was not structured interview with set questions which can feel like an interrogation Participants were invited to tell only the parts of their story that they wanted to The conversations in Colombia were facilitated by two psychologists male and female all with experience in therapeutic care for child and adolescents survivors of sexual exploitation Sample In Colombia the facilitators carefully identified possible young people that could be invited to participate Inclusion criteria included inter alia being aged between to years old having had an experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse before turning years of age as well as need for participants to have current access to support structures and for adequate time to have passed since the exploitation occurred ECPAT International Guidelines for Ethical Research on Sexual Exploitation Involving Children Bangkok ECPAT International Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaOf those identified and reached out to by the facilitators and their networks nine survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online young women and young men between the age of to years old agreed to take part in the conversations The participants were identified through the work carried out by Fundacin Renacer in association with the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare Conversations approach The conversations were carefully planned to be conducted in an interactive and unstructured style rather than traditional form of research interview The advantages of this design are that it is attentive to the nature and sensitivities of the topic and promotes choice and empowerment placing high value on the fact that participants have and perceive themselves to have significant control over what they share with the researchers Participants were also asked if they preferred to take part in conversations oneonone or in small groups for example in case they already knew some of the other participants because of participation in the same support groups The nine young people decided to conduct oneonone conversations Following initial agreement to take part conversations were then held in two stages premeeting was carried out and then the main conversation few days later This twostage process was deliberate symbolically indicating trusting relationship controlled by the participant from the outset The premeeting involved explaining the process answering queries about consent and seeking any preferences that the facilitators could accommodate in setting up the main conversation eg time of day room and seating preferences who was present etc Arrangements remained flexible and up to the local facilitators and the young people to determine together also in light of the fastchanging contextual circumstances caused by the Covid pandemic Facilitators took every measure to make sure that the survivors felt as comfortable as possible during the course of conversations The conversational nature open questions allowing enough time to respond regularly giving permission not to respond all helped shape the outcomes of the conversations As per the conversations approach the young people were able to contribute verbally but also encouraged to use range of visual tools to facilitate the conversations Past Now Future flip charts speechthought bubbles emoji drawings etc The possibility of carrying out the conversations in three moments past present and future seemed to be appreciated by the participants as it represented an opportunity to verbalise their empowerment processes The visual representation method however was not applied in all cases as some of the participants were more comfortable with verbally expressing their thoughts Their choices were fully accepted and respected While the Covid pandemic meant lots of interactions had to be virtual the researchers were adamant that psychological safety would be hard to maintain in such an approach Conversations were therefore all held facetoface Although the research did not seek to determine the specifics of the exploitation andor abuse that the young women were subjected to in this way the facilitators trained and experienced in working with trauma were physically present to provide psychological support if distress was encountered Some flexibility was needed to adapt to changing movement requirements and Covid safety plans were applied Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis Following the conversations the facilitators reflected on what they had heard their notes and recordings of the sessions They developed brief preliminary report in Spanish that focused on specific themes across the seven conversations such as barriers to disclosing the quality usefulness and accessibility of services and summarised the young womens recommendations for improvements This preliminary report was then reviewed and discussed between the facilitators the project expert and the ECPAT research team Once finalised it was made available to those participants who had indicated they wanted to see the output to offer their feedback and additional inputs Ethical considerations Before beginning the research activity ECPAT International convened panel of three global experts for an independent thirdparty review of the proposed methodology detailed research protocol that included mitigations for ethical risks was developed along with draft tools Detailed feedback from the panel was accommodated in two rounds of review before the project commenced As detailed above the local facilitators participated in extensive preparations together with the project expert prior to conducting the conversations Moreover the process for obtaining informed consent was conduct in two steps so the young people had time to consider their involvement not signing consent just prior to commencing and could control some of the circumstances of the conversations Frontline support workers survey The engagement of frontline support workers through completion of workforce survey was aimed at adding data to flesh out comprehensive picture of child sexual exploitation and abuse online by exploring the perceptions knowledge and practices influencing disclosure and support provision Rationale Workforce surveys have increasingly been used in research to gain an understanding of the effectiveness of social support systems Most commonly these surveys are used by health and social work professions to measure service delivery effectiveness Social support to children who are subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse is generally provided within the broader context of child protection We therefore developed and delivered survey for child protection workers The survey explored perceptions related to the sexual exploitation of children in general and online factors related to childrens access to support services perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of such services as well as details about the nature of their direct work with children Magadzire et al November

exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSample Fundacin Renacer utilised their national contacts to identify organisations supporting children from which to invite staff working at the frontline of providing support While the research focus was child sexual exploitation and abuse online very few services focus exclusively on support for child sexual exploitation and abuse with an online component or even exclusively on general child sexual exploitation and abuse The sample therefore included range of frontline support workers who had supported at least some children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse over the last year convenience sample of Colombian frontline workers was surveyed The sample should not be considered representative of the diversity of frontline workers in the country however attempts to represent different types of services both in terms of geographic location as well as type of services were made In order to be eligible to complete the survey frontline workers needed to be Over years of age At least last months working in the field of social work psychology or other social support At least last months managing own case load directly Case load over last months included at least some children Case load over last months included at least some cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of children The survey Selfadministered online surveys emailing link have notoriously low participation rates Thus the design for this project opted for inperson administration though using an online tool with limits and designated required items for clean dataset While restrictions related to the Covid pandemic meant the Colombian administrators staff members from Fundacion Renacer had to support participants remotely via an introductory Zoom or phone call and then remained on standby to support offer guidance and troubleshoot as the participants completed the survey The personal connection helped motivate participants to complete the survey Data collection took place between AprilJune The online survey consisted of multiple choices and short openanswer questions The tipple tool in English language was translated to Spanish and ECPAT International and Fundacion Renacer collaborated to check and contextualise the survey which was then pilottested with small number of frontline workers in the country before being fielded The full survey in English and Spanish can be provided on request Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis Following data collection data was cleaned and openended responses were translated to English Survey output was integrated into custom analytical framework where analysis was then conducted based upon exigent themes and patterns that arose from the data Qualitative analytical components were then added Quantitative and qualitative themes and patterns were explored with direct translated quotes from the open text responses used to illustrate dominant narratives emerging from the quantitative data along with occasional dissenting views Care was taken during analysis not to present any qualitative responses that may have identified participants It should be noted that the data are not statistically representative of the experiences of all frontline support workers in Colombia However the estimates perceptions and experiences reported here offer valuable insight into the access and quality of social support for Colombian children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse Ethical considerations Informed consent was obtained as an integrated part of the online survey tool To protect confidentiality names were not requested at any stage of completing the survey Care is also taken when presenting qualitative data in this report so that participants are not identifiable by the content of the quotes Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaChallenges and limitations The Covid pandemic meant movement restrictions varied at different times during the data collection period which had an impact both on the survivors conversations as well as the frontline workers survey The facilitators overcame this challenge for the conversations with survivors by conducting the premeeting on the phone two weeks before the main conversation Survivor conversations were audiorecorded but transcriptions were not completed with the intention that as facilitators themselves were producing the preliminary reports key insights would be easily surmised However in hindsight and as the young peoples direct words were focus transcriptions would have helped to facilitate direct quotes being incorporated more easily The team in Colombia also noted that while the approach to conversations was carefully created to centre the participants this was challenging for the facilitators to negotiate The team suggested that key lines of enquiry are maybe considered as basis for future use of the approach Regarding the frontline workers survey limitation occurred as result of our inclusion criteria Our intent was to include support workers who worked directly at the frontline not higher up managers Thus hurdle question sought experience of working directly with children within the last months As data collection occurred in the first half of the impacts of the Covid pandemic had restricted some frontline workers from doing direct client work for some time so it is likely that some of the participants who began the survey but were disqualified by hurdle questions may have been false positives Weak Internet connections in areas such as La Guajira and the Amazon resulted into difficulties in administering and completing the survey Connection issues also extended dramatically the time to complete the survey for some respondents rather than minutes some reported it had taken them as much as minutes or more to complete For some government respondents working from the office at the time an additional challenge was gaining access to the survey online platform as their work computers blocked access to the website Finally during the data collection period widespread national protests were occurring and some potential respondents lost their employment Rescheduling appointments was necessary throughout this time to meet the sample requirements Photo by Yaopey Yong FINDINGS Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe perspectives of the young people who had direct experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation and abuse online are the primary data used to structure this report Quantitative and qualitative data from the surveyed frontline support workers is then integrated amongst their perspectives to enhance comprehensive picture of the ontheground situation for preventing and responding to child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia Public perceptions and beliefs the knowledge and practices of workers availability and quality of reporting mechanisms and the resource levels of support services are all presented The report concludes with recommendations for action these stem primarily from what the young people told us but are expanded in places with other data and analysis from the project partners Trends in child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia Gender The survey data suggest that there is higher proportion of girls than boys utilising formal reporting mechanisms and accessing support services in Colombia In an open question participants were asked if they thought there were trends related to gender and sexual exploitation generally and online Figure shows that almost half indicated that they perceived more girls than boys were affected Figure Gender trends identified by frontline workers generally and online More boys More girls Other trends No trends No commentThe most reported cases have to do with the females The tendency is for the majority of girls to be the most vulnerable to the offenders Please note that text in green boxes refers to quotes from the young survivors who took part in the conversations Text in purple boxes refers to the qualitative input shared by frontline workers who completed the surveyA number of respondents assumed that the low access of support services by boys would probably be because girls are overwhelmingly seen as more at risk in the country for full range of concerns but also for sexual exploitation One of them commented that Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaHowever it seems that despite the perception that girls are more at risk boys too are clearly seeking assistance for range of things including for child sexual exploitation and abuse online Indeed survey data also show that most of the frontline workers had provided some support for boys Eighty three percent of the respondents said that they had boys among their caseloads and of these workers said that they had supported boys for sexual exploitation and abuse online This was actually quite similar to the participants who had provide support to girls and most had supported girls related to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse In line with global research these numbers confirm that while perspectives might be boys are less impacted caseloads suggest more boys than is commonly thought are impacted On top of that there were some interesting departures from expectations in the Colombia data number of respondents said that nonbinary people are identified within the support services They also mentioned that These data confirm other research indicating that young people with diverse sexual and gender identities are vulnerable to sexual exploitation In some cases their diverse status may contribute to risks Indeed in the conversations one young man who identifies himself as gay said that the feeling of loneliness led him into risky situations He was manipulated by older men and got involved in relationships that he could not identify as abusive due to the need to reaffirm his sexual identity Age The frontline workers who had worked with boys for online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse reported that nearly half were targeted between the ages of years old The five young men who took part in the conversations were at similar age to this majority when they were abused all were between and there are confusions on sexual orientation in many of the children and adolescents served and that it is harder for the LGTBTQIA population to recognise their vulnerability to sexual exploitation and abuse ECPAT International Global Boys Initiative global review of existing literature on the sexual exploitation of boys ECPAT International See eg ECPAT International Global Boys Initiative Thailand Report ECPAT InternationalFigure Age of boys who had experienced online sexual exploitation years years years years Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSimilarly the frontline workers who had supported girls reported that they tended to be targeted at similar age with subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online between and Figure Age of girls who had experienced online sexual exploitation years years years years However the data showed that greater proportion of the impacted boys were younger Eighteen percent of the reported cases involving girls involved children under the age of eleven years old compared with of the cases involving boys As one worker said while violence against girls is mostly based on gender age is what makes boys more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse Yes there are more women and girls victimised with sexual exploitation by saying this dont mean to say that there are no cases with boys or men however these are evidenced in relation to age that is there are more boys compared to adult men Reporting mechanisms Awareness Conversations with the young survivors generally illustrated little awareness of the formal reporting mechanisms that are available During the conversations all the young people said that they had not received information about where to look for help when they were subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse There is no information on how to report The girls and boys dont report it scares them because of the process they are going to face One must have support in order to report someone to accompany the survivor Family support and psychological help are needed VoSCOL They also demonstrated fear of facing the bureaucratic processes often involved in formal reporting mechanisms Five of the nine young people spoken to had disclosed sexual exploitation to school or community members who at the time were in charge of promoting awareness campaigns about this form of violence The young people said that once they reached out these adults not only demonstrated empathy but also acted to end ongoing situations of exploitation and abuse Non judgemental attitudes careful and genuine listening persistence patience and friendly treatment Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe family and community members acted as mediators between the children and the formal reporting mechanisms so they could gain access to the support they needed Unfortunately sense that these issues were well understood was not the rule within the young peoples communities In fact in the conversations the young people pointed out the needs to raise awareness and promote knowledge on how to disclose The lack of general public awareness was reiterated by the frontline workers who participated in the survey When asked about the level of public awareness regarding online forms of child sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia the majority considered it poor smaller fraction of the respondents answered that it was either fair or good while only one person considered it excellent Although this question was not specifically related to the awareness of reporting mechanisms the fact that most of the frontline workers who responded to the survey believed that there is little awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online in the first place confirms what survivors explained that there is likely to be very little knowledge on how to report if it occurs An interesting finding was that respondents with more years of work experience were particularly negative about public awareness as shown in Figure below This could be an indication that their perceptions about how informed is the society changes over time as they gain more experience in the fieldwere some of the characteristics mentioned by the young people when describing those who received their disclosures One young woman said that her family members told her Always count on us here we will be family waiting for you so that you can recover VoSCOL Because can tell you if case happens in the neighbourhood they choose violence because they dont know what else to do If they call the police the police in some cases do almost nothing people make violence justice by their own hands VoSCOL Figure Level of public awareness of online child exploitation and abuse according to the surveyed frontline workers Poor Excellent Fair Good Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaFigure Level of public awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online according to the surveyed frontline workers by years of experience Poor Fair Good Excellent years years years years number of surveyed frontline workers proposed that more education and training is needed in order to increase public awareness in Colombia In fact this was recurrent topic on survey qualitative responses as well as in the conversations Both sources of data strongly suggest the need for knowledge and skills development amongst frontline support workers on how to identify and work with online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse Another frontline worker said thatFrom the training academy of the universities there should be chair covering awareness in this dimension of protection towards children and adolescents The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence Having the support of reporting portals creates awareness among the police and state agencies to address these problems Information technology is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence it is important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of sexual violence in joint manner this includes the family the state and the society Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people consistently mentioned the need to promote information and prevention on topics related to the use of digital environments number of them believe that information about it is not disseminated widely and as consequence it does not reach those who are most at risk of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse Some young people specifically raised the need to inform parents and adult family members so they become able to educate their children about the risks involved in the use of the Internet According to one young person the usage of mobile phones and particularly of social media should be monitored by caregivers who are the utmost responsible for childrens safety online One young person said that promoting information about this type of violence is useful not only to alert people of the risks but also to increase the reports Knowing about cybercrimes that would have made me stop bit and would have realized that what was happening to me was that was being the victim of crime For us as young people it is important to recognise the strategies that these people use to manipulate and deceive and thus achieve to identify and stop them Not knowing how they act gives them an advantage to be able to deceive us VoSCOL Parents give their children access to cell phone to entertain themselves and they use it for other things its way for exploiters to get closer Parents need to pay more attention and have more communication with their children They need to teach them the risks of communicating with strangers When creating an account on Facebook how to use it and how to be careful protect themselves with social networks VoSCOL The mayors office and the government institutions and social organisations must create digital programmes or permanent institutional radio or television spaces where they warn about the risks More information means more cases reported Community leaders need to be trained to help protecting children They can identify victims facilitate victims access to institutions VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaBarriers to disclosure Seeking help may be challenge due to the stigma and judgments surrounding reporting mechanisms and support services Unfortunately this stigma can come from those who were supposed to protect and support children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse Fear of being recognised judged and stigmatised were main barriers to disclosure that came up in the conversations with young people They described situations where they were blamed by frontline support workers while reporting Fear of revictimisation and distrust of formal reporting mechanisms were also mentioned by the young people as barriers to disclosure They mentioned situations in which they were forced to repeat their statements due to the high turnover of frontline workers and consistently referred to fears of their abuse andor exploitation being reduced to scandal as one of the reasons that led them to think The barriers to disclosure were also explored in the survey with frontline workers as indicated in Figure The respondents were presented with list of factors that could potentially limit childrens disclosure of on line sexual exploitation and abuse By far the two most commonly selected barriers to reporting were related to pervasive culture of silence the stigma and shame that victims often experience at and to fears about how others will respond to disclosure These accounts confirm the fears of anticipated shame and stigma associated with sexual exploitation and abuse The attitudes and responses of those people charged with receiving these disclosures may have enormous impacts on childrenA cousin sought help for me and went to the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare psychologist who was there offended me and told me that was the only one to blame for what had happened to me started crying felt hatred for her How is it possible that you go to seek help and she tells you its your fault Thats unethical VoSCOL The fear of the report has to do with the fear of scandal The relevant agencies Colombian Institute of Family Welfare Police Courts need to have more bonding with the victims more support victims dont easily access services they arent well cared for Officials dont have empathy they dont understand the consequences of violence they revictimise them They lack training There is no psychological support for girls and boys to come and report VoSCOLits better if dont report VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaFigure Factors that potentially limit childrens disclosure Multiple responses permittedThe stigma and shame that victims often experience culture of silence Fears about how others will respond to disclosure eg blaming punishing not believing mocking Lack of confidence in being able to obtain helpful help Lack of information and visible dedicated services and support for children victims of sexual exploitation The sensitive and upsetting nature of talking about the experience High levels of physical of violence against children eg common violent disciplinary practices Fear of being

considered tabooChildren have low status and not respected as having their own rightsNegative attitudes to fears or difficulties asking for help and support Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people also mentioned that they feared being threatened and blackmailed by the offenders One young woman said that over time children subjected to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse As shown in Figure coincidentally psychological support was one of the most common services provided by the frontline workers When asked about the different types of direct support services provided by their organisations to children who have experienced sexual exploitation twothirds reported offering oneonone counselling The other most common service provided was support for families and caregivers Describing the type of service provided one surveyed frontline worker said She said that although she recognised the situation of sexual exploitation and abuse and wanted to escape she could not disclose because the offender threatened her and her family Support services It is essential to understand the perceived quality usefulness and accessibility of support services related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online This section presents some insights on these elements followed by more detailed overview of the different types of support services provided in Colombia taking into account both the experiences of young survivors within these services as well as the views of frontline workers providing them Usefulness quality availability and awareness of support services All of the young people who engaged in the conversations accessed support services from Fundacin Renacer and Colombian Institute of Family Welfare in the city of Cartagena They said that once they knew about and accessed the services the availability of support was very useful for them to recover One young man said that the psychological support was what helped him the mostAre trapped in fear of harming their families VoSCOL came to Renacer through friend At first didnt want to come but wanted to see the light at the end of the tunnel The attention was excellent What helped me the most as person was the therapeutic part learn how to become better person how to love yourself how to value yourself VoSCOL Counselling is

exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaWhen asked about the quality of government activities to address child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia frontline workers provided some criticisms particularly of government financial support Most of the respondents rated the quality of government funding on this topic as either poor or nonexistent The frontline workers also expressed dissatisfaction with both the availability and quality of medical psychological legal and reintegration services for children who have experienced online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia Responses on medical and psychological services were more positive with around of frontline workers rating the availability and quality of these services as either good or excellent However all four sets of services were rated as poor in terms of availability and quality by between of frontline workers suggesting broad need for improvement One of them commented Figure Frontline workers views on the quality of government activities Poor None Fair Good Excellent Awareness raising Funding Training Speaking publicly about child sexual exploitation think there is long way to go before the quality to respond to the needs of the victims is achieved together with the proper handling of the information Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaTypes of support services Psychological support As previously mentioned in this report psychological support was very much appreciated by the young people who engaged in the conversations All of them recognised this type of support as key to helping them overcome the impacts of online sexual exploitation and abuse In the conversations the young people expressed appreciation and emphasised the importance of these services for survivors in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration Referring to his psychologist one young man said She arrived and brightened my life VoSCOL She the psychologist treated me like human being she made me understand that was important she showed me the things had to overcome she touched my heart We made good connection it helped me to tell my mother that was homosexual it helped me to be free VoSCOLThey mentioned personal growth selfacceptance and selfknowledge as the main accomplishments after going through psychological assistance Indeed surveyed frontline workers said that children who experienced online sexual exploitation and abuse most commonly identified counselling among their biggest needs respondent elaborated that children need Psychological assistance Protective environment where children and adolescents feel safe from their offender Figure Biggest needs that children say that they have

AssistanceInformationEducation Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaPsychological support was also considered essential by the frontline workers who responded to the survey In the hypothetical scenarios counsellingpsychotherapy was frequently noted For example providing qualitative input on one of the scenarios worker said that In Colombia it was really encouraging to see that in some cases family members also had access to psychological support In the conversations one young woman said that in family therapy session she could tell her mother about the sexual exploitation that she had been subjected to Another one mentioned that all members of her support network including mother father siblings and aunt participated in psychotherapy sessions which she considered essential for her recovering process as they created caring and trusting relationship young man mentioned that the psychological support that he and his family received helped them to accept his sexual orientation and understand his situation Describing the impact of the family therapeutic process he said Commenting about situation where the family members were not involved one young person mentioned feeling lonely and once their father was included in the sessions the situation became better However some young people felt that family members could be better supported and monitored particularly when they lived in other cities or were not motivated in participate in the therapeutic process Scenario question Bernard who lives in Australia pays yearold in Colombia Ana to undress while they are on video call Do you believe that Ana is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse What practical steps would you take if you were the service provider supporting yearold AnaA therapy process would have to be carried out with the adolescent so that she can understand that she was sexually exploited online taking into account that they used this medium to obtain the material as well as psychosocial process that allows the adolescent to be in safe space They care about me but they give me freedom can go out alone they trust me VoSCOL Thanks to that am who am VoSCOL My family wasnt there at the beginning nobody found out had no one was on the street Later my father got involved thanks to the intervention of social workers They improved many things The involvement of the family changed lot however the families lacked more followup after discharge telephone call isnt sufficient VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe psychological support services secured the young peoples emotional and psychological state in the aftermath of the online sexual exploitation and abuse experiences and were considered essential for their recovery process It is worth noting however that the young people also noted that psychological services are not sufficiently accessible and available to all children who have gone through the experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse Indeed this was the case for number of young people who engaged in the conversations who lost interest in studies after facing such trauma Some young people mentioned in the conversations that as part of the psychological support that they accessed they were encouraged to go back to school and to improve their academic performance Emphasising the importance of the personal growth obtained in her recovery process one young woman said The young people highlighted in the conversations the need to strengthen sexual education in schools One of them described the type of sexual education that she had at school as only focused on avoiding pregnancy with no mention to the risks involved in the use of the Internet or how to identify situation of sexual exploitation and abuse There were lot of children and very few psychologists more therapy which is more continuous intense and frequent was needed single psychologist had to attend many children This having more psychologists would have helped them to overcome their problems more quickly VoSCOL If they prepare our personal growth we have solid basis to go out into the world later on Personally want to finish school study interior design or psychology VoSCOL Apart from studies and professional training first you have to be person VoSCOLEducational and pedagogical support When asked what were the biggest problems shared to them by children who experienced sexual exploitation and abuse online most of the surveyed frontline workers mentioned fear trauma and anxiety followed by social isolationmarginalisation and lack of assistance informationservices Providing qualitative inputs to the survey about social isolation one frontline worker commented that it is Not easy to go back to school Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaSexuality is not discussed in the family between parents and their children at school with teachers If sexuality was discussed more frequently children would not see it as sin as bad thing and they would not be deceived so easily VoSCOL The school can play an important role psychologists can train students as peer support Older students can train children among young people they understand each other more but they must be supervised by someone VoSCOLThe frontline workers survey included hypothetical scenario involving educational institutions quarter of the frontline workers expressed that the school should be informed whenever child is subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse When asked about the practical steps that should be taken to deal with such situations one of the respondents answered The import role that schools could play in preventing child sexual exploitation and abuse online was mentioned in the conversations One young woman proposed that educational spaces could organise peer support trained by specialised psychologists Unfortunately school teachers and the pedagogical staff were mentioned as not supportive of or cooperative with children in their experiences One young woman told us that she used to go to school to escape from situations of violence within her family but no one at school was attentive to the changes in her behaviour at the time She did not know the school psychologist and did not have anyone to talk School psychologists are often the first point of call for young people and can facilitate referral to other services Additionally the education system should work as protection mechanism for children enabling sense of belonging and stability Without easy access to these professionals gaining entry to the support structures can be difficult particularly as children simply do not know how and where to start Scenario question Carmen is yearold student Carmen has struggled to make good grades this year and is worried that Juan teacher who is close family friend will tell Carmens dad Carmen offers to send Juan naked pictures if he promises not to talk to the family Do you think that Carmen is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse London Metropolitan University Key messages from research on child sexual exploitation Professionals in school settings Psychosocial approach to obtain data on the exploitation situation report to directors of the Institution carry out an approach with the family activate legal channels awareness so that Carmen is recognised as victim and establish the relevance those practices Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaLegal support Even though all nine young people who engaged in the conversations had received legal support only three mentioned this type of assistance In all these three cases the young people said that the legal support helped them to understand that they had been subjected to form of sexual exploitation and abuse For instance one young woman said that the legal support that she received helped her to feel relieved and to recognise herself as victim after long time of selfblaming and selfharming behaviour In another situation young man considered that the police and prosecutors acted diligently initiating the process of restoration of his rights and prosecuting the offenders who were arrested for these crimes Unfortunately noy all the experiences involving legal support were positive One young man mentioned that although he did have access to this type of support he felt left in the dark about the process as those providing legal services did not communicate often with him or his family As shown earlier in this report in Figure of the surveyed frontline workers reported that their organisations offer legal support for children who have experienced sexual exploitation and abuse Legal assistance was among the very first steps that should be taken according to the surveyed frontline workers in all the scenariobased questions which involved cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse online When asked about the practical steps to take as service providers to help fictitious female adolescent subjected to live streaming of child sexual abuse legal action was raised by of the surveyed frontline workers Describing the necessary steps one respondent listed Immediate activation of the health channels Initial care Guidance to the family on legal actions complaint and process for the restoration of rights Referral to psychotherapeutic care Scenario question Bernard who lives in Australia pays yearold in Colombia Ana to undress while they are on video call Do you believe that Ana is victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaFinancial support Frontline workers were asked whether child victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse have the possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings whether from convicted perpetrators or countrymanaged funds More than half of the respondents indicated that they did not know the answer while responded positively In Colombia article of the Code of Penal Procedure states that all victims of any crime once the conviction is final have the right to receive compensation for the crime suffered Government of Colombia Code of Penal Procedure Law of Article When asked in the survey if they know of any children who had been subjected to online sexual exploitation and abuse and had received compensation for the crimes they suffered Colombia the majority of surveyed frontline workers either indicated that they did not or that they didnt know how to answer the question The young people who engaged in the conversations did not talk about benefiting or not from financial compensation Figure Do child victims of online child sexual exploitation or abuse have the possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings from convicted perpetrators or countrymanaged funds Figure Based on your work experience do you know if any child subjected to online sexual exploitation and abuse have received compensation for the crimes they suffered in ColombiaYes YesDont know Dont knowNo NoPhoto by Flavia Carpio RECOMMENDATIONS Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe recommendations presented below are primarily drawn from the conversations with the young people who took part in the conversations While the survey with frontline workers raised important issues and supported the analysis this report seeks to privilege the voices and perspectives of survivors Additional clarification and explanations from the analyses are provided in places from the project partners contributed during the analysis and writeup stage Recommendations on reporting mechanisms Promote information and awareness about risks in the online environment related to sexual exploitation and abuse as well as about reporting mechanisms and available support services when harm occurs It is necessary to Provide educational programmes for communities and family members about prevention of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse For all of the young people who engaged in the conversations the family plays an important role both in the prevention and protection of children Therefore it is crucial that family members have the capacity to educate children about the risks of Internet usage It is also important that they create spaces of dialogue where children feel confident to disclose and know how to guide children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse in the process of reportingReach the communities with the message of prevention recognition of these crimes and promote reporting allowing more and more people to learn about the issue commit themselves and support the defence of childrens rights and the report of the offenders VoSCOL Today its easier for the problem to arise because parents ignore the role of educating their children they dont see the dangers on social media VoSCOLThis recommendation was supported by the surveyed frontline workers When provided the opportunity to share any last thoughts at the end of the survey almost half emphasised the lack of general public awareness related to this topic as major issue in Colombia One of them said that It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence it is important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of sexual violence in joint manner this includes the family the state and the society Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaThe surveyed frontline workers also mentioned family members need to be better informed in order to prevent such crimes In order to create these resources one frontline worker recommended consulting children to make sure that their needs are taken into account Improve the availability and dissemination of reporting mechanisms creating childfriendly tools and making use of digital methods The reporting mechanisms should be as accessible as possible and available in easytouse online formats Impose legal duties on and promote collaboration with Internet service providers and social media companies These requirements ensure that providers will promptly comply with law enforcement requests for takedown of child sexual abuse material as well as to comply promptly with law enforcement requests for information This will assist investigations into crimes and limit the wide distribution of child sexual abuse material In the conversations young people said that social networks and other digital media do not display any prevention suggestions According to the young people they also do not respond to complaints other than sometimes blocking content They therefore recommend that Internet providers should have visible information on the risks associated to Internet usageI believe that victims should be heard Many formulations are made based on the thoughts of some people without considering the needs of the victims Resources for the care of children and adolescents are scarce and governments are resorting to stringer campaigns to position themselves politically and to ensure resources reach the childhood To large extent crimes related to technological means give merit to the lack of knowledge from the legal assistance and guidance perspective and the support that the family provides and to prevent children from becoming network victims Information must be increased the permanent dissemination of digital channels or complaints Create an easily accessible chat to report or make an application VoSCOL Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in ColombiaRecommendations on support services Better promote the availability of full range of specialised support services for children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online Any child who goes through such an experience should have access to specialists who can help them These professionals should be specialised and know the specifics of these cases The care programmes which exist are insufficient there is need for more because there are many children who come to services for help and information and they dont know how to talk and who to tell Care centres should be developed in the most vulnerable sectors VoSCOL Lack of specialised support services was also highlighted by one surveyed frontline worker surveyed frontline worker emphasised the limited trained professionals One of the challenges that children and adolescents victims of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation face is the late psychology support from the health sector due to the poor quality provided by this service and they do not have professional hired to do so The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence Having the support of the pages for the reporting purposes creates awareness among the police and state agencies to address these problems Officials dont have empathy they dont understand the consequences of violence they revictimise They lack training VoSCOL Commit financial resources to provide training and capacity building opportunities to law enforcement officers and legal professionals on topics related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online Both the young people who engaged in the conversations and the frontline workers who responded to the survey spoke about the need to improve the capacities of service providers Child sexual exploitation and abuse online Survivors Perspectives in Colombia Improve the investigation and prosecution of online sexual crimes against children Law enforcement should improve approaches to conducting investigations of online forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation Improvements are needed to ensure offenders are brought to justice and that those who have been subjected to such crimes are able to access compensation and other legal remedies This would also encourage other children to report sexual abuse and exploitation believe that for this crime despite the increased number of victims the actions implemented are insufficient the victims are unknown there is lack of commitment of parents regarding prevention there is lack of reaction of legal entities for the prosecution of the offenders and this last point involves series of terrible consequences for the victims on how much the population believes in the importance of the complaint and increases the probability of having new victims You can nd more

study ICTs enable rapid and widespread production exchange and distribution of potential child sexual abuse material through social media newsgroups email andor instant messaging systems In addition UNICEF study revealed that in Filipino children and adolescents are in danger of being bullied or being sexually abused online Aside from cyber bullying and sexting other ICTfacilitated threats to children in the Philippines include exposure to pornography or sexually explicit content online grooming and sexual solicitation offline sexual abuse facilitated by the internet and social media child abuse material child pornography and online commercial sexual exploitation of children The Philippines has become known as top global source of materials on child sexual abuse More than child pornographic images are uploaded to the internet everyweek In random search made by research team found photos of individuals appearing to be aged between and years in various nude poses and sexual acts They were recognized as Filipinos because of their build clothing and facial structure In the same year paper on cyber trafficking of Filipino girls found evidence of commercial sexual exploitation of Filipino children online The Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse defines online child sexual abuse in two ways sexual abuse of children that is facilitated by ICTs onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and sexual abuse of children that is committed elsewhere and then repeated by sharing it online through for instance images and videos It is also important to note that online child sexual exploitation is not distinct type of sexual exploitation In this case the internet is used to exploit children hence online child sexual exploitation is an umbrella term to indicate sexual exploitation with an online component The online manifestations of child sexual exploitation include child pornography or child abuse material live online child sexual abuse and solicitation of children for sexual purposes Live streaming of child sexual abuse is new form of child abuse and exploitation enabled by ICTs Currently many live stream child sexual abuse cases have been noted to be on the rise Live stream child sexual abuse is conducted in private place usually house organized by an operator where children undress and perform sexual acts on each other following instructions from remote pedophile through webcam Money is sent to the operator through an international wire transfer as payment for the show which lasts from to minutes Money is sent through Western Union or local moneytransfer agencies like Cebuana Lhuiller and GCash These money transfer methods help identify and trace online child sex abusers Recently alternative ways like prepaid debit cards and Bitcoins have been used including online money transfer sites such as Xoom and Azimo These alternative ways of money transfer offer anonymity or false identities for financial transactions and can hinder prosecution of individuals involved Poverty is seen to be key driving force for children in becoming victims of online child sexual abuse other driving forces include good grasp of the English language affordable and widespread internet access the easy money perception of webcam sex and cultural norm of family first that promotes choosing the needs of the family over the childs welfare In addition consumerism among youth may drive involvement in online sexual exploitation where money is spent on food internet access clothes cell phone load alcohol and drugs In an exploratory study on the nature and extent of livestream sexual abuse in the Philippines conducted by Terre des Hommes found three main categories according to scale of operation individual operations familyrun operations and largescale organized operations called dens Individual operations are run from private homes internet cafes or Pisonet computers that will provide internet access for minutes for every PhP Children involved in online sexual abuse are also commonly involved in street prostitution Familyrun operations are common in very crowded and poor neighborhoods where children are coerced by parents and other family members Dens are largerscale operations involving whole neighborhoods or organized criminal group operations where children are hired or trafficked Locally published studies on the topic are few and most of the information comes from gray literature ie organization research reports student theses and government reports and documents News stories and articles are alternative sources of information While the facts presented in media reports are not based on systematic investigation of materials and resources as in published research these can still provide contextual background and preliminary data for further investigation This review aimed to present preliminary information on SEACO in the Philippines using online news reports and media articles and provide insight into the geographic distribution of media reported cases of SEACO the profile of victims and offenders and how offenders and victims become

PHILIPPINA VOL NO Sexual Exploitation of ChildrenType of operation Table shows the distribution of cases according to type of operation There were five cases of familyrun operations of SEACO where children were exposed to cyber pornography by parents or other family members typically mothers Three of the reported cases were located in Barangay Cogon Cordova Cebu The family members involvement included being the pimp of their daughters guiding the sexual performances on and offcamera and sexual abuse of child oncamera There were two mothers involved in cybersex who exposed their daughters when their clients asked for children There were cases that involved cybersex dens hidden in two or threestory houses and rented apartments several in slum areas There was one encounter that occurred in hotel room Minors were initially recruited as babysitter or domestic helper or for work in internet cafs in the city and later forced into cybersex Cybersex operations involved uploading sexually explicit images of children nudity in front of webcam and live sexual performances with children or among children In one operation snapshots of naked children cost USD nudity in front of the webcam cost USD and live sex show among children cost as high as USD The children or parents got USDUSD per show Sudden show of increased wealth would arouse suspicion in the community but did not always prompt reporting The cybersex dens were discovered through disclosure from child victims tips from foreign agencies through information arising from investigations ie arrest of client in another country and through local surveillance based on tips from neighbors and informants The increased fortune of operators also leads to the proliferation of operations within communities giving rise to cottage industry in some towns In raids conducted of cybersex dens authorities confiscated cell phones computers laptops and tablets containing sexually explicit images of children as well as receipts for money transfer remittances from foreigners In eight cases cybersex operations masqueraded as fake call centers or business establishments that sold child pornography One of the operations rented building within school compound The staff of the cybersex operations would chat online with foreigners enticing them to subscribe to pornographic websites that contain images of Filipino Table

sextortion or the online sale of child sexual abuse material In sextortion victims are found through social media such as Facebook and lured into cybersex using video call services such as Skype The sexually explicit exchange is recorded by the suspects and is used to blackmail the victim in exchange for money DiSCuSSiON Despite the Philippines having reputation as global hub for cybercrime including child sexual exploitation not much is known about this topic Our review of media reports aimed to provide picture of SEACO however our study was limited due to the following constraints First we included only online news reports as these are readily available In trying to get more indepth reports we tried to obtain data from law enforcement agencies and child protection services however information was deemed confidential and classified Conversely journalistic investigation published in revealed that in livestreaming criminal cases have been reported in the Philippines which rose to cases in In ongoing livestreaming criminal cases were reported in the Philippines Second while the earliest news report obtained was from earlier studies have documented raids of cybersex dens and the rescue of minors as early as Thus the article from was an inaccurate marker of the emergence of SEACO in the Philippines and only reflected the point at which news reports became available online Third we aimed to gain more insight into the characteristics and circumstances of SEACO victims because of the challenges in gaining access to and collecting information from this vulnerable population however the news reports revealed very little information about SEACO victims Fourth details of SEACO operations that could be gathered from the news reports were limited by the amount of information contained in the news reports Still we think this review has contributed new and important information on the forms of SEACO and characteristics of offenders that have not been previously documented by other studies In this review incidents of SEACO were first reported in Olongapo City Cordova municipality in Cebu Cagayan de Oro and Davao City In the succeeding years cases were reported from contiguous provinces and cities suggesting that physical proximity may be factor in the spread of SEACO to other areas Figure Webcam child prostitution has been observed to be more prevalent in areas known for sex tourism although geographical link requires further investigation The areas identified in this review also coincided with research focus areas selected for the incidence of livestream child sexual abuse Angeles City Taguig City Cebu City and the municipality of Cordova in the province of Cebu As expected there was very little and vague information on victims due to confidentiality Since there were no consistent reports of the age and sex distribution of victims this review provided limited information on the characteristics of victims other than that of the youngest age of victim involved in SEACO which was reported to be months old The offender categories provided more information on the range of offenders involved in cybersex operations including consumers of child sexual abuse material and operators of cybersex operations Research suggests that offender motives vary according to type of offender most child sexual abuse material consumers are motivated by sexual gratification while other offenders are interested in profit alone Although studies typically describe consumers of SEACO as white men this study found foreigners not only as clients overseas but as partners of local operators The foreign offenders were mostly in their mids older than the average age of years seen in other studies Both men and women have been found to be involved as offenders in SEACO but females are reportedly involved to limited extent Their offenses are usually related to the possession production and distribution of child sexual abuse material In commercial sexual exploitation women are typically involved in running business operations and recruitment Women are rarely the primary offender in child sexual abuse However this review found that almost half of the offenders were women and that they played active roles in SEACO Their active participation ranged from recruitment trafficking and operating cybersex operations to the sexual abuse of child during webcam performances This review also highlighted the involvement of mothers in live streaming of child sexual abuse Individual operations involving children in webcam sexual performances from private residences Internet cafs or Pisonet were not covered by the news reports These operations lack an adult operator inability to conduct money transfer payments and poor English skills may make it difficult for children to receive payments The absence of an organized operation possibly allows this type of live stream sexual abuse to escape police surveillance Livestream child sexual abuse constitutes violation of several Philippine laws suspect may be charged with three different offenses namely child trafficking child pornography and child abuse In August the Philippines Department of Justice issued an advisory including the following laws as applicable on the issue of online child sexual abuse UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child Lanzarote Convention Republic Act No or the Special Protection of Children against Abuse Exploitation and Discrimination Act Republic Act No or the AntiChild Pornography Act of Republic Act No or the AntiViolence against Women and their Children Act of and Republic Act No or Cybercrime Prevention Act of Despite having ACTA MEDICA PHILIPPINA VOL NO Sexual Exploitation of Childrenthese laws in place reporting and prosecution of suspects is hindered by shortage of personnel to implement the laws Philippine privacy laws delay in prosecution due to authentication of foreign evidence lack of knowledge among legal practitioners low age of consent and lack of support for victims CONCL uSiON AND rECOMMENDATiONS Cases of SEACO have increasingly been reported in news and feature articles from almost every region in the country over the past ten years The national legal framework for responding to SEACO is comprehensive and in compliance with international standards However grappling with the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse of children online requires measures to prevent the proliferation of this industry in the country Identifying factors and addressing issues that encourage proliferation will be essential to impede its spread More information on victims and the circumstances that lead them to become involved in SEACO is needed The other players in SEACO also need to be looked into including law enforcement authorities telecommunications companies and money transfer agencies Our review is the first step in confronting this problem Acknowledgment The idea for this work was crafted during the

cutting risks Practitioner reflections The new CORE classification Conclusion References About the authors Key insights Risk classifications guide practitioner and policymakers in their work and in communicat ing their results EU Kids Onlines Cs of online risk is used widely as classic point of reference for stakeholders internationally It is time ly to update th is classification given the variation in its use the emerging risks in the digital environment and our growing understandi ng of childrens experiences of online risks of harm As part of our CORE work on theories and concepts we reviewed existing classifications of online risk to childre by UNICEF the International Telecommunication Union ITU Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Council of Europe CoE and others consulted European practitioners of child internet safety from Insafe and INHOPE to build on their experience This report propose new CORE Cs classification recognis ing that online risks arise when child engages with andor is exposed to potentially harmful CONTENT experiences andor is targeted by potentially harmful CONTACT witnesses participates in andor is victim of potentially harmful CONDUCT is party to andor exploited by potentially harmful CONT RACT The Cs classification also distinguishes between aggressive sexual and value risks as this is helpful in retaining balanced view of the range of risks that children can encounter We note that risks to the values that shape See evidenceeuunderstanding children online theories concepts debates childhood and society are increasingly prominent In addition to the Cs the new CORE classification recognises im portant cross cutting risks notably to childrens privacy health and fair treatment Keeping in mind that childrens online opportunities are paramount and that host of individual and societal protective and vulnerability factor mediate between risk and harm we hope that the new classification is insightful for research policy and practice that contribute to realising childrens rights in relation to the digital environment UN Understanding online risk In the CORE roject our work on theory examines the key concepts that frame the field of research policy and practice The aim is to bring together diverse perspectives and interrogat their underlying assumptions in order to contribute to the collective ambition of understanding the experience and consequences of growing up in digital world comprehensive understanding of childrens engagement with the digital environment requires balanced consideration of both risks and opportunities recognising the full range of childrens rights in digital world UN Within this broader frame Livingstone isk is one of the key concepts identified for investigation by the CO RE Consortium and is the focus of this short report In fast changing digital eco system the nature of risk is continually evolving sometimes exposing children to emerging risks well before adults know how to mitigate them Risk has been defined as Uncertainty about and severity of the consequences or outcomes of an activity with respect to something that humans value Aven Renn The clash of possibly severe outcomes with human values inevitably raises concerns and the digital environment in which children are often very active adds heightened uncertainties into the mix No wonder that online risk is one of the most contested areas of childrens digital experience concerning many stakeholders and posing pressing challenges for research policy and practice These challenges include understanding childrens exposure to different types of online risk and how regulatory technica social or individual interventions can be effective in developing strategies to cope with risk mitigating or minimising any harmful consequences From the outset it is vital to distinguish between online risk and harm Conceptually risk is the probability of harm while harm ncludes range of negative consequences to the childs emotional physical or mental wellbeing Livingstone For example xposure to pornograp hy poses risk to child but it is not certainty that there will be harmful consequences Harmful outcomes depend on the nature of the risk whether it is more probable or more severe in its consequences and on the design regulation and managem ent of the digital environment privacy settings moderation services access to helplines etc They also depend on the child and their circumstances because what is problematic for one child might not be so for another Such differences reflect societal factors norms and regulations political priorities economic investments education and family systems etc as well as the individual protective or vulnerability factors that differentiate among children including age gender digital skills resilience personality socio economic situation and family context It is paramount that our understanding of online risk is evidence based prioritising robust research conducted with and in relation to children Our understanding should also be informed by childrens own views and experiences nd those of practitioners responding to child online risk and safety problems rather than assuming or imposing vision grounded in adult normative expectations or popular anxieties See OECD UNICEF Smahel et al In this short report we critically examine how online risks have been classified in order to develop better understanding of childrens online experiences and their potential or actual real world consequences After discovering how existing classifications have been adopted in the work of various stakeholders we ropose new classification of online risk to children to meet the challenges of changing digital environment and the practical imperatives of policymakers and practitioners This new classification highlights four dimensions related to the positioning of the child in the digital environment and shows how these intersect with three dimensions regarding he nature of the risk It also recognises the cross cutting dimension of priva cy discrimination and health risks The Cs of online risk comprehensive classification of online risk was proposed by EU Kids Online in Staksrud Livingstone Staksrud et al funded by the European Commissions EC Safer Internet Programme now the Better Internet for Kids Programme It was originally developed to answer the often asked questions regarding What risks are we talking about and Why should policymakers take action It sought to disaggregate risks and raise awareness of the wide array of risks affecting children including but also going beyond the main emphasis on pornography grooming and cyberbullying that dominated the agenda at the time Taking ch ildcentred and evidence based approach EU Kids Onlines classification identified two dimensions of risk the positioning of the child in relation to the digital environment as recipient of mass produced content participant in adult initiated activ ity and an actor in peer topeer exchanges and the nature of the risk aggressive sexual values and commercial This classification took strongly child centred approach It highlighted that children should not be treated as solely vulnerable victim or protected at all costs including at the cost of their online opportunities The idea was to recognise childrens agency as actors in digital world but without holding them unduly responsible for risks online or especially for the at times harmfu effects on their wellbeing or that of others As will be seen later the revised CORE classification recognises the childs perspective and agency but also the power of societal and digital infrastructures to shape the childs experiences and outcomes The original classification was tested using data from EU Kids Onlines two wave European survey with internet using children aged conducted in Livingstone et al and Smahel et al It has been incorporated into the Global Kids Online model and its surveys of children in countries Livingstone et al Taken together these projects have generated cross nationally comparable data from children in more than countries providing an evidence base to inform olicy priorities and establishing baseline against which socio technical change and policy interventions have been positively evaluated Morton et al Figure shows the classification with exemplar risks in the cells Figure The EU Kids Online original Cs classification of online risks Livingstone et al Adopting the classification The Cs classification became classic point of reference since much cited by the policymakers and practitioners working to maximise childrens online opportunities and minimise their risks of harm To trace its use we conducted search for mention of co ntent contact and conduct risks online and among reports and documents by relevant organisations We found that the Cs of online risk See also and In keeping with EU Kids Onlines commitment to balance risks and opportunities parallel classification was proposed for opportunities although it was little noted Livingstone et al have informed the work of range of key actors albeit not always with direct source including UNICEF the European Commission EC the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development the International Telecommunication Union ITU the ICT Coalition ONeill Croll and ot hers ONeill Dinh Green et al One use is to classify the plethora of problems reported by children who call helplines Supported by the ECs Better Internet for Kids programme the We did not find classifications in the work of ECPAT Intern ational the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights FRA GSMA INTERPOL Child Helpline International CHI CEO Coalition European Network of Ombudspersons for Children or UNESCO Content Receiving mass produced content Contact Participating in adult initiated online activity Conduct Perpetrator or victi in peer topeer exchange Aggressive Violentgory content Harassment stalking Bullying hostile peer activity Sexual Pornographic content Grooming sexual abuse or exploitation Sexual harassment sexting Values Racisthateful content Ideological persuasion Potentially harmful user generated content Commercial Embedded marketing Personal data misuse Gambling copyright infringement work of the Safer Internet Centres SICs provide helplines across Europe Helplines provide information advice and assistance to children young people and parents on how to deal with harmful content harmful contact such as grooming and harmful conduct such as cyberbullying or sexting ONeill Dinh Relatedly the ECs self regulatory initiative the Alliance to better protect minors online called on businesses to tackle existing and emerging risks that children and young people face online including harmful content eg violent or sexually exploitative content harmful conduct eg cyberbullying and harmful contact eg sexual extortion UNICEFs flagship annual publication The state of the worlds children focused in on children in digital world and also used the classic EU Kids Online classification recognising that while it is vital to address online risk some degree of risky opportunities can afford children the chance to learn and become resilient depending on their maturity and circ umstances UNICEF Undoubtedly wh at has proved most valuable are the definitions of the Cs as illustrated in Figure It is noteworthy that most uses of the classification refer to just one of the two dimensions the child in relation to the digital environment and discuss content contact and conduct Thus they often omit the second dimension the nature of the risk aggressive sexual values commercial and perhaps in consequence the exemplar risks highlighted and researched by EU ids Online among other researchers Stoilova et al Without the second dimension however commercial risks became somewhat neglected leading to calls for revision of the original risk classification given rising evidence of the importance of com mercial online risks to children See single marketenalliance better protect minors online This framing is problematic in eliding risk and harm because it is precisely in the gap between them that Figure The Cs of online risk UNICEF Content risks Where child is exposed to unwelcome and inappropriate content This can include sexual pornographic and violent images some forms of advertising racist discriminatory or hate speech material and websites advocating unhealthy or dangerous behaviours such as self harm suicide and anorexia Contact risks Where child participates in risky communication such as with an adult seekin inappropriate contact or soliciting child for sexual purposes or with individuals attempting to radicalize child or persuade him or her to take part in unhealthy or dangerous behaviours Conduct risks Where child behaves in way that contributes to risky content or contact This may include children writing or creating hateful materials about other children inciting racism or posting or distributing sexual images including material they have produced themselves Contract risks the fourth Digital technologies have developed significantly since the original typology was created and the online ecology affords new opportunities but also new risks for children particularly in relation to commercialisation and datafication To respo nd to these changes and to reintroduce more prominently commercial dimensions of online risk fourth variously labelled contract commercial or consumer has been suggested In redevelopment of the EU Kids Online classification the fo urth is conceived not as commercial risk but as contract risk that directly or indirectly connects children and digital providers This reflects the dramatic rise in the commercialisation of childrens personal data arguably resulting in the atafication of children themselves Mascheroni With the Cs EU Kids Online has proposed not only classification but also digital ecosystem of online risks in which children are variously positioned and in which the different risks interact in increasingly many empowering and safety interventions focus their efforts eg digital literacy complex ways This informed the CoEs Handbook for policy makers on the rights of the child in the digital environment Livingstone et al as shown in Figure Figur The EU Kids Online Cs model of online risks Livingstone et al adapted from Hasebrink et al Most bviously contract risks arise when the child accepts including unintentionally involuntarily or unknowingly the Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions of commercial provider of digital products or services Such contractual arrangements can bind the child in ways that may be unfair or exploitative or which pose security or safety or privacy risks of which they may be unaware or over which they have little control or means of escape Related risks arise because of the data processed by public and third sector organisations as well as through host of public private partnerships Stoilova et al The Broadband Commission observes that children have no way of understanding what they were signing up for when they installed the app or logged on to the site Services and obligations that are designed for adults must be age limited so that children cannot sign up to them without guardians permi ssion While online children also risk spending money without permission of parents or caregivers and having their data harvested This data may be given by or taken rom childrens digital activities as well as inferred or assumed about them or about others connected with them through profiling operations The fast growing data ecosystem now provides an infrastructure not only for commercial transactions impacting children but also for the digital Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development In short ontract risks arise when children use digital services as well as when they are impacted by digital transactions conducted by others in other ways eg through institutional uses of digitised databases that include the childs profile or algorithmic processing of personal data relating to the child or others connected with them see ONeill Rights Foundation In naming this category of risks contract risks we note the legal difficulties linked to contracts involving children as well as the fact that users of all ages can be unaware of the contractual nature of their relationship with digital service providers We also note that the contract that occasions risk may not be with the child but with their parent or school or indeed between service provider and third par ty among other possibilities in the complex digital ecosystem Nonetheless on balance we propose that the label contract is helpful in pointing to mix of marketing data processing and other contractual risks that merit specific attention most products and services that afford content contact and content risks The result is that the types of risk are increasingly interlinked as are the solutions eg data protection regulation can prevent some interperson al or social forms of online harm Stoilova et al but not all of which are commercial and some of which are still emerging Cross cutting risk Even with the fourth there are dimensions of online risk that might not fit neatly into these categories UNICEFs State of the Worlds Children participatory workshops UNICEF revealed that children report concerns about risks that do not fit well with the classification such as technological problems and parental intrusion in their online lives In its draft Recommendation on children in the digital environment the OECD observe that the nature of existing risks have significantly changed and number of new risks have emerged Technological developments and new business models have contributed to the change in digital devices and services which in themselves have also contributed to the evolving risk landscape OECD Do we need to go beyond the Cs and add new and cross cutting elements Recognising that digital service providers need to know which risks are of greatest concern so that they can innovate in safety by design and building on multi stakeholder consultation Rights Foundation the OECD recently propose that some risks are seen as cross cutting in nature such as those related to privacy advanced technological features eg Internet of Things IoTs artificial intelligence AI biometrics predictive analytics health and wellbeing Note that the ECD builds on the EU Kids Online classification although it defines the fourth as consumer risks The second dimension of the figure lists risk manifestations or examples of ways in which children might encounter potential harms online although it does not organise them further This is shown in Figure Figure Children in the digital environment revised typology of risks OECD The OECDs proposed category of consumer risks includes four manifestations marketing risks commercial profiling risks financial risks and security risks Practitioner re flections To discover how practitioners working in the field of child online protection classify risks and whether they consider that revisions to the Cs are needed in October we conducted an online workshop with members from the Insafe and INHOPE networ ks from over countries The consultation sought to Identify familiar and emerging online risks affecting children across Europe and to see whether these are common across or specific to different contexts or countries Consider whether classifications of online risk are adopted in practice and useful and if so what purpose they serve and what the strengths and shortcomings of the avail able classifications are Insafe and INHOPE members contributed series of reflections on the risk classification and its possible development After lively discussion there was widespread agreement that risk classifications are useful for practitio ners Practical purposes of the classification of online risks include Identifying the range and diversity of risks including identifying emerging risks Making comparisons and capturing trends across risks and across timecontexts Systematically ommunicating results and priorities to expert policymaker and lay audiences Highlighting the need for resources budget and training Classifying the types of risks reported via input from helpline and complaints mechanisms Targeting planning interventions and awareness raising campaigns See Mapping evidence to risk categories and identifying evidence gaps In practice some organisations will always generate their own classifications for instance when working bottom up from helpline calls to track local trends while others will not need to classify risks in their work Overall however he consensus was that it is valuable to have shared approach to answering questions such as What do we mean by online risks and Which risks are emerging or Which should be prioritised and How is my country doing compared with others For researchers the classification is useful in providing common terminology by which to report and review findings and for mapping where evidence is sufficient and where there are pressing gaps As for practitioners researchers also repeatedly find that risks intersect bridging offline and online experiences and compounding adverse outcomes for the more disadvantaged or vulnerable children But we can only report such complex relations among risks if we first identify those risks so the classification remains useful It was also generally agreed that to be useful risk classifications should prioritise Flexibility the lassification has to be broad and flexible so that new risks can be added when needed or when we need to refer to different groups of children or address stakeholders Clarity the risks should not overlap with each other and they should map readily onto the reports from children or practitioners about problematic experiences Recognising that this is complex domain the call was also to avoid oversimplification recognising hybrid threats that could be classified in more than one domain eg identity theft could be linked to contact conduct or contract risks depending on the circumstances online pressures relating to body image can have both sexual and value dimensions see Figure Examples to be readily understood and applicable to the practical work including real For detailed findings see Livingstone et al world examples in the cells of the classification table is important While it is recognised that the examples provided cannot be comprehensive they should map onto the actual problems reported by children or encountered by practitioners They should also resonate with audiences parents policymakers etc when riskrelated work is made public Two structural changes to the online risk classification were recommended Inclusion of the fourth this is needed and it was widely thought that the term contract is more inclusive than commercial or consumer risk in recognising that risks can arise when the child is party to contract with public and third sector organisations as well as commercial bodies especi ally with the prevalence of public private partnerships in complex digital ecologies Cross cutting risk the recognition of risks that cut across several or all of the Cs was also agreed although much debated Again this arises because of the complexity of the digital ecology and also because risks are interrelated and they can affect multiple dimensions of childs experience The effects on childrens health eg health risks linked to excessive screen use were raised by multiple contributors So too were the array of privacy risks experienced by children online many of which arise from data processing and so can be classified as contract risks but that can also arise in relation to content and through interpersonal contact and conduct Even fter discussion different views remained regarding Country specificities should the classification differ by country and context to recognise different legal regulatory and cultural factors that shape childrens exposure to risk It emerged however that pan European commonalities are more notable In this regard the risk manifestations in the OECD classification were found to be difficult to interpret both because they are abstract and yet overlappin and because the legalillegal boundary varies by countrypolicy context Relatedly the idea of cross cutting technological risks was not taken up possibly because all online risks have technological dimension or because the examples given in the OEC typology than country differences and are often more worth of attention given the benefits of sharing insights and best practice across countries and in working towards common solutions Extending the classificati on with fifth range of possibilities was suggested including that the classification could identify the consequences of risk such as health or wellbeing or other abuses of childrens rights andor distinguish illegal criminal from harmful risks However his discussion threw up the many differences not only by country eg in which online risks are illegal but also organisational sector type and purpose It was agreed therefore that although Cs may be useful on occasion this should be left to each country or organisation to determine for itself The new CORE classification We propose new essence classification of online risk learning from the above experiences and from interview with the CORE Consortium Risk is recognised as relational emerging from the dynamic interaction between the childs agency and the agency of others opera ting in the digital environment including through automated processing such as algorithms and as embedded in digital design and operation The Cs of online risks of harm are content contact conduct and contract risks as explained in Figure The classification has the merit we suggest of order and clarity We believe it to be fit for purpose recognising the multiple positions that children may occupy in an increasin gly significant and powerful digital environment including continually emerging online risks It is orderly and clear and it provides practitioner tested exemplars of key risks including those that have become familiar in recent decades and those that re emerging and new The introduction of contract risks as the fourth incorporates risks previously labelled commercial are linked most closely to contract risks or again to privacy or discrimination This framing of the Cs overcomes the previous potential for misunderstanding eg the implication that child may participate willingly in contact abuse or hat they are mere receivers of content rather than also actively seeking it Figure The CORE Cs of online risk Content risks The child engages with or is exposed to potentially harmful content This can be violent gory content hateful or extremist content as well as pornographic or sexualised content that may be illegal or harmful including by being age inappropriate Content online may be mass produced or user generated including by the small fry and it may be shared widely or not Contact risks The child experiences or is targeted by contact in potentially harmful adult initiated interaction and the adult may be known to the child or not This can be related to harassment including sexual stalking hateful behaviour sexual grooming sextortion or the generation of sharing of child sexual abuse material Conduct risks The child witnesses participates in or is victim of potentially harmful conduct such as bullying hateful peer activity trolling sexual messages pressures or harassment or is exposed to potentially harmful user communities eg selfharm or eating disorders ypically conduct risks arise from interactions among peers although not necessarily of equal status Contract risks The child is party to andor exploited by potentially harmful contract or commercial interests gambling exploitative or age inappropriate marketing etc This can be mediated by the automated algorithmic processing of data This include risks linked to ill designed or insecure digital services that leave the child open to identity theft fraud or scams It also includes contracts made between other parties involving child trafficking streaming child sexual abuse Cross cutting risk Some risks relate to most or all of the four categories and can have multiple manifestations across the different dimensions aggressive sexual values These include online risks relating to privacy physical or mental health inequalities or discrimination Hence the new classification now distinguishes three dimensions in relation to the nature of the risk aggressive sexual and values It is noteworthy that interest in value related isks eg misinformation radicalisation self harm algorithm bias has grown in recent years now attracting as much attention and anxiety as aggressive and sexual risks Finally the new classification recognise three types of cross cutting risk to childrens privacy their health and their fair treatment and equal inclusion in digital world These risks we suggest can occur in relation to any and all of content contact conduct and contract risks see Figure Importantly it should be noted that although some risks are particularly cross cutting in nature many of the online risks to children intersect and hybridise depending on the circumstances and more so as the digital environment evolves Hence the classification and its exemplars ar offered here as way of organising and opening up further investigation rather than as implying that risks are simple or disconnected Figure The CORE classification of online risk to children Conclusions We hope this new classification serves constructive purpose for researchers policymakers and practitioners working to minimise or manage online risks to children rights and wellbeing The classification offers the foundations of better understanding of online risk to children and it can underpin the work of different stakeholders Policymakers can use it to identify what risks matter and why what evidence supports them and how they fit within or fall outside existing regulatory frameworks Parents and the public can use it to learn what can be done about the different risks and what to look out for Researchers can use the categorization to develop comprehensive definitions and We sought to future proof the classification by describing risks in broad terms rather than focusing on very particular or time bound risks although we measures of online risk and to organise compare and report findings Practitioners can use it in their work to classify and understand the problems reported to them to communicate with different audiences and to manage and bid for resources The classification will need careful framing for different udiences so more work needs to be done on implementation Moreover as society and the digital environment continues to change the classification will need revisiting in the future It should be noted that our focus has been on children online leaving others to attend to the important risks of not being online digital exclusion struggles for access and connectivity lack of digital skills and so forth We did not focus on the factors that account for wheth er when or why some children are more likely to encounter particular online risks than others nor the protective or vulnerability factors whether appreciate they arouse concern eg sharenting influencers deep fakes viral challenges concerning children their circumstances the digital environment or its regulation and management that account for harmful outcomes Again this has been amply addressed elsewhere It is also important to see risk as only one of the dimensions of childrens online experiences alongside opportunities and among many factors that intersect to influence childrens outcomes Livingstone Indeed while the digital environment affords children range of risks it also offers many opportunities to benefit and this merits parallel analysis If society becomes overprotective it can inadver tently undermin the very opportunities for which society provides children with internet access We will address the Cs of online opportunities in our future work OECD

attitudes and their practices regarding the use of digital technol ogies during preschool education The main research questions the study intended to address focused on teachers and parents attitudes and practices about the role of digital technology supplies in young childrens development The study used mixed rese arch approach using in depth interviews and an online questionnaire The results have shown that only one of the eight preschool teachers reported positive attitude regarding the impact of digital technology in childrens development Most of the interv iewed preschool teachers showed preference towards authentic play and activities exercising childrens psycho motor skills However most of parents have suggested that their children starting from early years of their development are exposed to differen digital technologies In conclusion there are two contradictory findings progressive and regressive philosophies among parents and preschool teachers regarding their perceptions and practices on the use of digital technologies in young childrens lear ning and development The study advocates for continuous cooperation between parents and teachers to ensure aspect of maximizing benefits and alleviating potential risks of using digital technologies in early childhood education Keywords preschool tea cher parents digital technology attitudes practices Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No INTRODUCTION Technology plays crucial role in children and adults everyday lives There are numerous studies showing that the use of digital technology from different user groups is increasing ev ery day However studies also show that there are different perceptions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the use of digital technology children especially during their early ages of development Information and Communications Technology hereafter ICT can be defined as anything which allows us to get information to communicate with each other or to have an effect on the environment using electronic or digital equipment Bolstad However according to Kalas in early childh ood education literature hereafter ECE the concept of ICT includes computer hardware and software digital cameras and video cameras the Internet telecommunication tools programmable toys and many other devices and resources In many countries EC or preschool education is conceptualized differently This study focuses on preschool education ie the years before children attend elementary school In Kosovo the Law on Pre university education requires children to enrol in elementary school at si years old Therefore the study concentrates on perceptions on the use of technology during children development before the age of six known as preschool age as defined by the Kosovo Curriculum Framework MEST In addition the study focuses on he use of digital technology at early childhood institutions and their home Early childhood education policies and practice itself in Kosovo has been great challenge for the overall educational policies According to study report published by the Kos ovo Education and Employment Network KEEN project the inclusion of children in institutionalized pre school education in Kosovo continues to be challenge given that by according to data from the Education Management information System EMIS here are only public kindergartens and licensed private institutions which are community based Gjelaj Rraci Bajrami As result Kosovo remains the country with the lowest inclusion of children in preschool education aged to years old in the region with an inclusion rate of The highest inclusion rate is in pre primary classes aged to where of children are involved Ibid Despite this current situation the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan KESP under the strategic objective teaching and learning plans to maximize learning through quality teaching implementing competency based curricula and by using high quality teaching resources The implementation of the new curriculum in all schools is understood as central to improving the quality of learning in Kosovo In addition to teacher training this requires the preparation of textbooks and other teaching and learning materials including electronic teaching materials that are in harmony with the Kosovo Curriculum Framework KCF This also assumes that special attention should be paid to providing schools with ICT equipment as well as other teaching support However two important stakeholders in early childhood development teachers and parents have opposing opinions regarding the use of digital technology in education Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No The purpose of this study is to analyze teacher and parents attitudes and practices about the use of digital technologies during early years of education The study aims to give answer to two main research questions What are the attitudes and practices of the parents towards the use of digital technology during early years of children development at home What are the attitudes and practices of preschool teachers toward the use digital technology during early years of children development in kindergarten education LITERATURE REVIEW Historically theorists and researchers have debated whether young children should use technology at school Alper Blackwell Cordes Miller Kirkorian Wartella Anderson House Lindahl Folkesson Morgan Parett Quesenberry Blum Plowman McPake at Zomer and Kay Various authors have expressed the view that computerICT use is ot appropriate for young childrens cognitive physical social and emotional development However there is no clear evidence to support this claim and this view has increasingly been replaced by the view that when used appropriately ICT can be usef ul tool for supporting young childrens learning and development Bolstad There are diverse attitudes presented from different stakeholders when discussing early years of children development and the use of digital technology Today it is common to observe toddlers and preschool children watching videos playing games on tablets or exploring on the internet With such dynamic developments there is need to establish better understanding of the process of engaging ICT in everyday play and learning activ ities of preschool children Several recent research findings pointed out the extraordinary potential of ICT to enhance the learning and other developmental processes of children Kalas According to Kalas studies have shown that digital tec hnologies can provide children with new opportunities to engage in attractive and relevant play learning communication exploration and development Properly integrated digital tools can empower younger children by providing them with voice especiall with limited literacy capabilities at their young age US Department of Education Digital technologies as digital toys which are properly integrated in learning can empower children by granting them voice they have never had before In this context digital technologies also open new pathways for alternative social interactions and change the learning relationships between children and teachers UNESCO Hayes and Whitbread examined holistic development of young childrens learning and identified seven different ways that learning could be enhanced by integrating ICT namely ICT and literacy ICT and mathematical understanding ICT and science creativity problem solving and playful use of technology visual literacy and painting media education digital animation and learning of music Results of the interviews with teachers and parents as shown by the study of Ihmeideh Alkhawaldeh have indicated clear perpetuation of the role of Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No technology and digital media in the intellectual religious and moral aspects due to the contributions of these aspects to childrens learning and development Based on Byron New Zealand Council for Educational Research and Stephen Plowman most of the concerns fall into one of four categories harmful physical effects childrens learning cognitive social and emotional development exposure to harmful contents and new technologies displacing other important learnin and play activities However nowadays it is almost impossible to come across an educational institution without an ICT presence In early childhood education the term ICTs could include computers digital cameras and digital video cameras creativity and communication software and tools the internet telephones mobile telephones tape recorders interactive stories computer games programmable toys videoconferencing technologies and closed circuit television data projectors microphones headphone electronic whiteboards and more Olowe Kutelu Early childhood in service and pre service teachers views are essential for ICT integration in early childhood settings and studies have shown that positive views are crucial for influencing their decisions to use ICT in their teaching Sime Priestley Their views and intentions predict the integration or lack thereof of ICT in the classroom while the successful integration will also depend on other factors such as appropriate skills and training Sime Priestley Inan Lowther examined the effects of teachers individual characteristics and perceptions of contextual factors that influence ICT integration in classrooms One of the independent variables included in their st udy was teachers beliefs about technology which was defined as the teachers perception of the influence of technology on teaching and learning practices Findings showed that teachers computer proficiency teachers overall support teachers technical support and computer availability have significant influence on teachers beliefs about technology Also teachers beliefs had strong influence on the use and integration of ICT in classrooms Regarding pre service early childhood teachers Angeli showed that they are not free of personal beliefs about the role of ICT in early childhood settings and that they may also have misconceptions about the potential of ICT tools in teaching and learning Although they appropriate technology in their ro le as students eg to prepare lessons plans they resist seeing technology as part of their relationship with children and express little desire to use computers with children as future teachers Laffey Furthermore Kiridis Tsakiridou Kask alis Golia have found that pre service early childhood teachers have positive views about the use of computer in early childhood settings Such views have pointed out that the use of computer enhances teaching thus computers should be used acro ss all kindergarten activities Their findings have recommended the introduction and use of computers have positive outcomes for young children such as higher concentration and participation in educational process enhancement of learning outcomes and acilitation of communication Literature also speaks that in service teacher training has been of informative nature and nonsystematic Minaidi Hlapanis and relevant courses mainly aim at the Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No development of teachers familiarity with ICT use of word processing spreadsheet presentation programs and internet According to Gialamas Nikolopoulou the positive influence of the computer self efficacy on views intentions is statistically significant for each population but it is stronger or the teachers This finding is in agreement with earlier studies that showed positive relationships between computers selfefficacy and inpre service early childhood teachers views Chen Chang Tsitouridou Vryzas On the contra ry to teacher perceptions and beliefs parents are more opened to use different supplies of digital technologies and most of studies show that there is strong relationship between parents different habits and influence to their children Studies show hat nowadays parents are not spending much quality time with their children while the amount of time spent by them on reading to their children is very low Shin Hesketh Hinkley Campbell Studies also found that parent technology use or at titudes toward media to be positively correlated with their childrens use of technology Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes Genc McCloskey et al Vittrup Snider Rose Rippy Blackwell Lauricella Wartella Overall parents showed positive attitudes toward media to the extent that they believed media exposure to be vital to childrens development and many disagreed with recommendations from expert sources regarding ageappropriate screen time Vittrup et al STUDY CONTEXT The Republic of Kosovo is the newest state in Europe It declared its independence on February th he total population of the Republic of Kosovo is estimated at million with ethnic Albanians comprising ethnic Serbs and other ethnic groups of the total population The current education sector in Republic of Kosovo is undergoing extens ive reform efforts in all sub sectors addressing key challenges of increasing participation and improving equity and quality of education with limited resources According to the Strategic Developing Plan of Education despite good progress in education reform there are challenges to be addressed Regarding preschool education system Kosovo seems to have the lowest rate of inclusion of preschool children in institutionalized education According to the Agency of Statistics in Kosovo there are only public kindergartens in overall state The capital of Kosovo Prishtina municipality has started implementing new model of community based kindergartens and it seems the best way to expand the inclusion of preschool aged children in educat ion The National Development Strategy Plan aims at improving the quality of education and early childhood education is one of the priorities The new Kosovo Curriculum Framework KCF focuses on learner centeredness competencies integrated teaching and learning flexibility mobility and transparency MEST Overall Kosovo is considered to have very advanced legislation in the field of education pre primary education for children aged years is expected to become Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No mandatory afte financial analysis done by KOMF Public awareness about the importance of ECE has also risen due to initiatives of UNICEF MEST and numerous partner organizations MEST has committed itself to providing improved access and quality educati on for all children and on all educational levels including Early Childhood Education ECE Preschool education is now part of the wider Pre University Strategy During preschool sector started to acquire support by MEST in order to develop Early Le arning Development Standards ELDS for children from birth to yearold The goal of the Early Learning Development Standards was to increase the quality of education activities in preschool education both in the family environment and preschool institut ions MEST However the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan KESP and the document of Kosovo Curriculum Framework underline that in order to become successfully integrated into digital economy students need to attain digital competencies Therefore along with basic knowledge of literacy and numeracy the current and future education system should stress the importance of digital awareness and literacy so that full functional literacy is achieved during formal schooling MEST Kosovo Edu cation Framework Even though educational policies in our country prioritize the continuous professional development of educators and the integration of ICT at all levels of pre university education and specifically in preschool institutions This research contributes to enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and parents in harmony with Kosovos strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in Early Childhood METHOD Participants The sample for this study includes preschool teac hers selected randomly from public preschool institutions all over Kosovo in order to see if there are differences in perceptions regarding the use of digital technologies in early childhood education between preschool teachers working in different parts of Kosovo The number of kindergartens in the cities of Kosovo is very low usually there is one kindergarten in one city However the situation regarding the availability of kindergartens public private and community based is higher in Prishtina the capital of Kosovo Teachers involved in this

randomly selected parents participated in the study Table provides parent demographic information According to Creswell one of the mo st common probability sampling approaches used by researchers is random sampling which allow representatives preschool teachers and parents in this study an equal chance of getting selected This sampling strategy was purposely chosen by our group of re searchers considering that topics such as the use of digital technologies in early childhood education are limited in the context of developing countries such as Kosovo Hence this sampling strategy allowed our study to acquire wide range of perceptio ns from both preschool teachers and parents as randomly selected the selected sample representatives enhancing the value of our findings Table Parents

interviews with preschool teachers where used to find out what are the teacher attitudes and practice regarding use of digital supplies in preschool education settings model of indepth interview protocol used from Kelly was used to identify four dimensions of teacher attitudes toward use of digital technology consisted from Teacher previous experience with regards to technology use Availability of digital technologies in current workplace Own believes about technology effects to children learning and development and Professional development activities with regard to technology skills Questions about the practices of integration of technology during the classes and the ones that ask to describe the lessons activities with technology where avoided when teachers declared that they do not have any kind of digital technology in their classro oms In order to collect preschool parents attitudes regarding the use of use of digital technologies in early childhood education an open online questionnaire was distributed to parents in October The questionnaire was self constructed and djusted to the context It covered main research questions dealing with parental attitudes and practices about The types of digital technologies used by their children Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No The amount of time spent with any kind of digital technologies and Believes about adva ntages and disadvantages regarding the effects of digital technologies on their children development and school readiness Data Analysis The in depth interviews were analyzed using content analysis Kolbe Burnett In addition the four dimensions from Kelly model were used as criteria and guiding elements to convey many themes and discussions The content analysis was followed by descriptive statistical analysis of the online questionnaire Creswell FINDINGS Parents Attitudes and Practices about use of Digital Technology during Early Years According to the data parents attitudes and practices about use of digital technology during early years can be organized into two groups One of the groups comprises parents that support the idea of enabling their children to use digital technologies such as TV laptop tablets smart devices computers gaming technology see Fig The other group of parents represents the opinion of avoiding their childrens exposure to digital technologi es during their early stages of development see Fig Figure Type of Technology Used by Children up to as Reported by Parents The questionnaire data showed that most of the parents declared positive towards th use of digital technologies for their young children ages to The results presented have indicated that most of parents grant access to TV smart phones and tablets for their young children ages to Parents Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No reporte that they are satised with how their young children access and use technology at home referring to the benets of technology use including but not limited to learning of English language acquiring technology skills and general development In fact around percent of parents declared they are firm believers that children using technology will promote their school readiness However around percent of them do not support this relationship Figure Parents Perceived Benets on School Readiness Despite the countless benefits parents associate technology use with socializing problems too much screen time sleeping problems physical development delays while they also think that children miss outdoor play with their pe ers and they even develop behavioral problems from the contact with inappropriate content such as violence and aggressive games Figure Time Children Spend Using Technology Each Day The data presented in the pie chart above indicates variation of childrens time allotted in front of screen from minutes to hours per day as reported by parents Most of the children use any type of technologies up to hours per day According to Lauricella Wartella Rideout there is scientific evidence to argue that very young children spend less time with media than older children This finding corresponds Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No with other findings Lauricella Wartella Rideout suggesting the general assumption that there is less exposure to technology in educating very young children Figure Parents Perceived Benets Associated with Technology Use While there is evidence to suggest that the use of technology does not nearly support childrens social skills development it is important to recognize that parents are aware of the benefits technology brings The que stionnaire results showed that parents believe that by using digital technologies children improve their language skills early learning skills and technology skills Having in mind that there are very few applications for youn children in Albanian language main language in Kosovo children are using digital platforms in English language and this might be considered by their parents as beneficial modality for their children language development These results complement oth er studies related to the language teaching lessons in particular Such studies emphasize that the use digital stories that promote lessons as enjoyable and productive affect the improvement of language skills interest attitudes attention and motivation in positive way Girmen Kaya However other fields of development are considered to be rather poorly developed such as social skills psycho motor development and communication skills In addition our findings of this study are consistent with other studies in the field of early childhood education and the use of technology Such studies also support the conclusion that parents have positive attitude towards the use of digital technologies in early childhood educat ion see McCloskey Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauricella Wartella In addition they support the process of exposing their children to technology supplies arguing in favor of the technology benefits on their children development As reported by Ihmeideh Alkhawaldeh both parents and teachers expressed high degree of agreement concerning the role of technology digital media in developing child culture Nevertheless data presented in the Figure indicates parents conc erns about the negative effects of technology on their childrens development As our findings

International Journal of Instruction January Vol No the internet engaged in less active play time might be negatively influenced by commercial content are engaged in less time playing in the yard might develop physical disorders and might develop sleeping problems In such cases while studies see Girmen Kaya McCloskey Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauricella Wartella highlight the importance of the use of digital technologies early childrens education our study points towards other imperative aspects in early children education that might lack behind due to the use of technology Figure Parents Concerns About Negative Effects from Digital Technology Economic consumption Preschool Teachers Attitudes and Practices about use of Digital Technology during Early Years Comparing to parents attitudes preschool teachers declared themselves very differently regarding the use of digital supplies during early years edu cation Most of the teachers believe that young children during this age mostly need interaction with their surrounding environment and engage with concrete tools toys Teacher experiences with regards to technology As declared by the interviewed tea chers most of them have been raised and educated in an environment without the use of any type of digital technologies None of them were provided with the opportunity to be exposed to an education environment that makes uses of digital technologies avail able at their disposal for teaching and learning Their pedagogy system did not support any digital technology learning tools The interview results emphasized that the previous education system power students learning through making use of physical mater ials as means of demonstration Back then the only technology related supplies that students were acquainted with were radio and TV Therefore teachers lack of experience with technology related supplies during their previous learning experience is va lid predictor for their current attitudes and perceptions regarding the use of technology in early childhood education The following verbatim quote represents this same argument Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No Our teachers never used technology in the classroom We were educated in very traditional method We didnt have computers in school or at home We even didnt have TV at school The main source of knowledge was books and teachers During early childhood we didnt used to go to kindergarten We went to school for the first tim when we were years old saw computer for the first time on when we bought one for my son declares preschool teacher LM age It can be seen also from other interviewed teachers that their experience with regard to technology was very pathetic The presented lack of experience could have affected teachers believes attitudes and practices on their present work with young children Only one from eight teachers declared that she was trained to work with computer Available technology suppl ies in current working place Most of the teachers declared that they have only one TV in the kindergarten The TV is placed in joined room where all the children from different groups could have their time to go there and watch movie During the previo us years they were asked or advised from the educational inspectors not to let children watch TV at all since they are being passive during that time Based on their experience they were using TV only for calming down the children as they prefer watchin TV This indicated experience shows that the only technology available in the kindergarten was no used for educational proposes Five from eight kindergartens reported that they only possessed one video projector that is rarely used since the group is packed and it is logistically inconvenient to organize spate projector group uses Moreover the interviewed teachers declared that they lack any kind of smart devices in the classroom In addition children are not allowed to bring their own devices at sc hool kindergarten In all the classrooms they declared that they do have music player The music player is bought usually by parents There are no computers in the classrooms in none of the seven public kindergartens in Kosovos main cities Figure Type of digital technology supplies in the kindergarten as declared by teachers Instead of real digital technology supplies preschool teachers declared that they use technology supplies brought by parents such as TV microwav iron radio which are Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No not properly functioning or are out of order preschool teacher has reported the following Through imaginary play with these technology supplies children develop their communication skills and creativity as well as enjoy rol playing IG age preschool teacher working in public kindergarten FH age declared that We encourage children to play in groups socialize with each other through authentic play and toys even if they want to bring their own smart de vices we dont allow them to do so because the devices are fragile and children can break them and we dont have time to deal with such issues Personal attitudes towards digital technology There is consensus among the majority of the interviewed teach ers that using digital technology during early years will only harm children psycho physical development The results have shown that they ignore any possibility that the use of technology devices is beneficial during early childhood education Teachers ha ve claimed that if kindergarten funding would enable them to purchase technology supplies they would only utilize them as didactical materials serving as means for providing illustration and examples Such technology supplies will not to be used by child ren themselves Most of the kindergarten teachers seven from eight believe that kid already spend lot of time using digital devices at home so while they are at school or kindergarten they should only play and learn in interaction with the enviro nment other children and other adults Children learn best when they explore and discuss with their peers and adults They need to move around solve authentic problems think critically and resolve possible conflicts from the real life experiences Pr eschool teacher HM age One of the interviewed teachers JM age declared that she would use smart devices such as smart boards or other smart tablets She said We miss very essential materials toys and paper dont know when we will be ab le to have smart devices in the classroom We could only ask from parents to bring their own devices at school Children love exploring and playing with them They can learn math language or singing Professional development activities for technology sk ills Preschool teachers were asked about their types of professional development activities that have helped them acquire technology skills and to what extent did their college coursework prompted them to integrate technology in classroom Teachers that ha ve been recently graduated with bachelor degree in preschool education Faculty of Education declared that they had only one course dedicated to ICT in preschool education The other teachers that have been studying in so called Pedagogical High School training offered for kindergarten teacher before preschool education was offered at University level they never had single course that dealt with the integration of Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No technology in teaching Similarly teachers coming from the faculty of general pedagogy were not offered any course during their pre service teacher training All of interviewed teachers declared that they attended an in service training of basic ECDL European Computer Driving License qualification However they have never used such train ing into their practice due to lack of computers at their disposal at kindergartens where they work It is usually one computer at principals office but none in our classrooms IM age None of the interviewed teachers feel they are sufficiently prepared to teach early childhood content using technology All of them would prefer training that would prepare them to use different technology supplies and also help them change their traditional mindset toward technology use during early years We admit that the world has changed Children of today are children of technology era They like it and maybe they can learn from it if used properly declares one of the interviewed teachers IM age The findings supported by this study conclude that younger generation teachers that have been qualified during recent years have been displayed more open attitude towards the use of technology use and the need to incorporate technology training during their professional development plan However teacher who have been educated during pre professional age Hargreaves have the tendency to be more reluctant to new teaching methods and changing their perspectives DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The purpose of this study was to analyze preschool teachers an parents views and practices regarding use of digital technologies during early childhood education Our findings have indicated that there are differences between parents and teacher views and attitudes regarding the use of digital technologies during arly years of children or pupil development Most of the parents of children to declared that they provide to their children different types of digital technology supplies starting from their first year of their development Regularly children spend lot of time on TV laptop and other smart technological devices Children spend screen time from minutes up to more than four hours per day Parents believe that there are some benefits emerging from the digital media They believe that their children development increases in some of their developmental areas including language development cognitive early learning skills and technology skills Children are using digital supplies in English language and this might be considered by their parents as beneficial to their language skills development This funding is consistent with other findings in the field of technology use in early children education see see Girmen Kaya McCloskey et al Genc Vittrup Blackwell Lauric ella Wartella However while our findings are emerge and support from numerous findings in this field the novelty of our results should be emphasised That is while the use of technology use in early children Gjelaj Buza Shatri Zabeli International Journal of Instruction January Vol No education is important our study uggests that other fields of development are considered weekly developed such as social skills psycho motor development and communication skills Parents believe that the use of technology improves their childrens overall development and school readin ess However they have also reported some concerns about the negative impact technology might have on their children wellbeing such as lack of active play time in opened environment physical development disorders or sleeping problems Correspondingly enc have showed that parents with negative opinions indicate how smartphone usage can cause physical or mental problems in the future they fear that their children will be introverted have an isolated life or be affected by harmful radiation Despite this most of them exposed their children to at least one digital supply during the first year of life and the number of supplies increases on yearly basis This finding is very controversial and points toward further discussions in the field of tec hnology use in early children education Despite parents views preschool teachers have very different attitudes about use of digital technology supplies during early years of children development The in depth interviews showed that teacher attitudes ar mostly affected by four factors as shown in the model below Figure Visualization of Factors Influencing Teacher Attitudes toward Technology Use Teachers previous experience with regards to technology use availability of digital technology supplies in current working place own believes about technology effects to children learning and development and professional development activities with regard to technology skills were indicated also very important at Kelly This study reports that teachers perceptions were influenced both by the interpersonal level as well as the communityinstitutional level In addition our findings are consistent with Kelly suggesting that the capacity building of teachers is important for ef fective use of technology tools Teaching experience seems to be correlated to their attitudes toward use of technology Studies show that teachers with more teaching experience have less favourable attitudes toward technology and use technology less ofte than teachers with less experience Blackwell Lauricella and Wartella Our study also depicted similar situation in Kosovo Teachers with more teaching experience where strictly against the integration of technology in their lesson plans or ac tivities with preschool children Inan Attitudes Teachers previous experience Availability of digital technology Own believes about technology Professional development Digital Technologies in Early Childhood Attitudes and International Journal of Instruction January Vol No Lowther showed that teachers perceptions of instructional benefits are an influential factor that affects technology integration in classrooms The interviewed teachers in our research also declared their vi ews as negative toward technology This affected their practice as well The study of Badia et al presents that ICT related school conditions such as ICT teaching policy and ICT infrastructure show significant but more modest association with tea chers perceived effectiveness of digital technology Similarly put finds have reported that the lack of proper technological tools in kindergarten to certain extent have influenced their negative perceptions regarding the use of technology For many years these poor conditions have influenced teachers lack of willing to use technology with young children Their professional in service and pre service development is also poor and their previous experience in school was not guided by the use of techn ology As reported by UNICEF it is imperative that ECCE educators are productively integrated in professional development related to technological use It is important to understand that the process of becoming ICT competent for ECCE educator is longterm transformation which requires continuous support and monitoring Since its beginning efficient professional development program must focus both on developing ICT literacy of the educators and simultaneously utilizing their emerging new lit eracy for building new pedagogies of ICT in favor of childrens learning and development Findings of the study are debatable since on the one hand the majority of parents support and utilize the use of technology in their children development while preschool teachers later in children education are stemming childrens exposure to digital technologies This influences children development in many levels while in this case creating two confusing levels of early children education ie using both rogressive and regressive philosophies in children development This is also relevant to initiate discussions at policy level in the country and other countries concerning with similar conflicts Findings have policy implications for preschool curriculum implementation towards quality education in early children development This research contributes to enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and parents in harmony with Kosovos strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in Early Child hood The question today on the use of technology does not concern the paradigm of whether it is positive or negative Today the use of digital technologies in education system is inevitable Rather different stakeholders involved with early childhood dev elopment should acknowledge both the benefits and risks that technology use brings to children and teachers continuous cooperation between parents and teachers should be facilitated to ensure prospects of maximizing its benefits and alleviating potentia risks in early childhood education REFERENCES

Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile Chile Abstract This article presents study that applies integrated and multifactor path analysis to report the direct and indirect effects of young Brazilian individual and home factors on their online opportunities and risks The results show that engaging in more online opportunities being older and having lower level of parental mediation are associated with higher number of online risks At the same time being older having Internet access at home having parents with higher educational level possessing more digital skills and receiving higher level of couse and active parental mediation are positively associated with online opportunities Although restrictive parental mediation is negatively associated with online risks it also reduces opportunities In addition couse and active mediation are positively associated with parental educational level These findings offer starting point to understand childrens online behaviour and digital inclusion in

USA Email NMS new media societyCabelloHutt et al researcharticle Article new media society Keywords Brazil digital skills online opportunities online risks parental mediation structural equation modelling Introduction significant number of young people have grown up with the Internet and digital devices as part of their everyday lives Erstad Facer et al Furlong and Davies Livingstone et al Livingstone and Helsper Researchers policy makers and other stakeholders have focussed on the opportunities and risks that the Internet can offer to children and young people and on the factors that may facilitate or condition them Hasebrink et al The type of activities children engage in online cannot be described as beneficial or harmful because such judgments depend on the outcome of the activity rather than the activity itself Livingstone et al However some activities are more likely to lead to beneficial outcomes while others will increase the likelihood of harm Livingstone et al The former can be conceptualised as online opportunities and the latter as online risks Hasebrink et al claim that although opportunities and risks are moving target they can be associated with certain activities online opportunities can include access to global information educational resources entertainment social networking with friends privacy for the expression of identity content creation and civic or political participation while online risks include illegal content or activities sexual violence bullying invasions of privacy offensive content biased information and contacting and meeting strangers As Livingstone and Helsper emphasise there is lack of research analysing the multiple and integrated factors associated with young peoples Internet use considering online risks and opportunities which are commonly studied separately Furthermore the focus has been placed more on online risks and safety Smahel and Blinka and how children cope with online risks Vandoninck et al Since those who encounter more opportunities also tend to face more risks online Livingstone and Helsper it is important to consider both aspects especially to avoid concluding that certain factors reduce risks without accounting for their possible negative effect on opportunities In addition to the importance of access frequency of use and time spent online evi dence supports an association between personal factors such as age gender digital skills emotional and psychological characteristics and online opportunities and risks Helsper et al Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch Smahel and Blinka Sociocultural factors such as socioeconomic status SES educational resources and parental mediation of Internet use have also been found to be strongly associated with opportunities and risks Cho et al Hargittai Helsper et al Lee and Chae Livingstone and Helsper Robinson et al Among these factors such as digital skills and parental mediation of Internet use are especially relevant since they are subject to public policy intervention The purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of new research approach analysing multiple and integrated factors associated with young peoples Internet use CabelloHutt et al Livingstone and Helsper Considering that research in this area has developed more in the Northern Hemisphere Livingstone and Bulger this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how these phenomena arise in Latin American country Internet users have rapidly increased in Latin America in the past decade on average from to In contrast in the United States and the United Kingdom the increase during this time was smaller but reached significantly higher proportion of users from to and from to respectively International Telecommunication Union ITU Despite the fast increase in access studies in Latin America related to the impact of digital technologies in peoples everyday lives particularly that of children are still scarce In this sense Brazil as the first country to offer international comparable data on childrens uses opportunities and risks in the region is an interesting case to study Nevertheless to further understand this phenomenon in Latin America and analyse its differences with Europe or other regions data from more countries are necessary This will be possible in the near future as new Latin American countries are increasingly implementing the Kids Online survey including Argentina in Chile in and Uruguay in In Brazil children face inequalities and specific features in their digital ecology as complex and multilevel phenomenon that are closely related to opportunities and risks Cabello etal Based on Brofenbrenners ecological model Livingstone et al claim that in order to frame childrens use of digital media it is necessary to adopt digital ecology approach defined by at least two systemic levels First the level of family dynamics and personal beliefs of parents and children and second the level of structural factors such as income access to technology and cultural values The case of Brazil Between and Internet users some who used the Internet in the past months increased in Brazil from to ITU Access and use of information and communication technology ICT are highly determined by the area where people live and their SES PausHasebrink et al In fact and of the households of two highest SES groups respectively have Internet access at home versus an of the lowest SES group households CGIbr The proportion of young Internet users in Brazil is among yearolds and among yearolds Despite this relatively high proportion of users one out of four children or teens is excluded from the Internet CGIbr Sozio et al The proportion who uses the Internet daily is of high SES children of medium SES children and only of low SES children Sozio et al Therefore Brazil still faces an important challenge regarding the universalisation and democratisation of access and use of the Internet Barbosa et al Literature review Opportunities and risks online Childrens Internet use has been amply studied and classified Many of these classifica tions are based on childrens motivations and frequency of use and come up with new media society generally similar categories entertainment communication information seeking and productivity among others Facer et al Furlong and Davies Hinostroza etal Ito etal Johnson Nevertheless most of these studies have limited to describe childrens uses without considering the consequences or potential consequences of the use of the Internet Livingstone et al propose that types of Internet use can be understood as online opportunities and risks The activities that are more likely to turn into beneficial outcomes can be classified as opportunities while those that are more likely to turn into harmful or disturbing outcomes as risks Online opportunities can bring risks and online risks may or may not turn into negative experiences or harm Livingstone and Bulger There is vast scholarship on the risks and negative experiences that children can encounter by using the Internet such as cyberbullying online grooming unwanted sexual material or excessive use or Internet addiction Aboujaoude et al Kowalski et al Mitchell et al Smahel and Blinka Whittle et al However enquiry on online opportunities is scarce and more recent Evidence shows that older children engage in more online opportunities Livingstone and Helsper and also tend to face more risks Livingstone and Helsper Mitchell et al Sasson and Mesch Age also has an indirect effect on risks mediated not only by access and use but also by digital skills Livingstone and Helsper In general boys tend to encounter more risks than girls Mitchell et al Sasson and Mesch even disregarding their skill level Livingstone and Helsper Boys also tend to engage in more opportunities online although gender intersects with age as children get older the gender gap widens in terms of diversity and amount of use Livingstone and Helsper The type of risks children and teenagers face online is also differentiated by gender Livingstone et al found that boys are more exposed to sexual images online while it is more common for girls to receive hurtful messages and also to be upset by the risks they experience However the evidence in being victim of cyberbullying based on gender differences is mixed Aboujaoude et al Kowalski et al In relation to SES there is some evidence about its association with different types of Internet use specifically in terms of enhanced life chances Robinson et al and gratifications gained from Internet use Cho et al Also the SES can be strong predictor of the way people engage on the Internet where those with higher SES tend to use it in more diverse and informed way Hargittai Livingstone and Helsper found that middleclass teenagers benefit more from online opportunities than workingclass teenagers However SES did not have direct effect on opportunities or risks but rather it was mediated by access Finally parental education is also relevant factor in explaining childrens online risks and opportunities Parents with less education tend to apply more restrictive technical mediation Sonck et al while more educated parents apply more active mediation PausHasebrink et al Digital skills Digital skills are set of abilities required for information society Van Dijk and Van Deursen They are not homogeneously distributed generating the socalled CabelloHutt et al secondlevel digital divide Hargittai and Hinnant Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Age grammatical gender and SES have been found to be associated with digital skills Research shows that lesseducated andor lowerincome people tend to have lower levels of digital skills Aesaert and Van Braak Correa Hargittai Van Deursen and Van Dijk Regarding gender some evidence shows that girls have higher levels of digital skills technical and higherorder skills Aesaert and Van Braak and regarding age older children tend to have higher skill levels irrespective of access or use Livingstone and Helsper Parental mediation of Internet use Research has reported different parental mediation strategies related to media The most commonly reported strategies include active restrictive and coviewing Nathanson as well as couse mediation Livingstone and Helsper Valkenburg et al Valkenburg et al recently developed validated model to evaluate the adolescents perceptions on restrictive and active parental mediation They found that these perceptions are more diverse than most researchers assume Restrictive mediation can be perceived not only as way to control but also as supportive mediation style Meanwhile active mediation can be perceived as way to control The authors discuss that parental mediation has not been properly analysed yet considering the wider context of parental styles The European Union EU Kids Online framework defines and measures five types of parental mediation on which this study is based active or instructive mediation talking about media content while the child is online restrictive mediation setting rules that restrict the use of the medium cousing remaining present while the child is online thus sharing the experience but without commenting on the content or its effects monitoring checking childrens online activities afterwards and restricting by technical bans or filters using software and configurations for time control and to ban or filter specific content Drager and Sonck Although this classification of types of mediation differentiates between various practices it is still limited as it does not incorporate the nuances of how these practices are taking place or being perceived by the child In relation to SES research has shown that students online activity is shaped by their parents differential access to what Bourdieu calls economic and cultural capital and also by their different experiences with technology Hollingworth et al In wealthier families parents tend to have more experience with technology and to be more digitally skilled providing their children with more guidance and support than in less wealthy families Vekiri As children get older parents reduce the frequency and diversity of the mediation practices Livingstone and Helsper Nikken and Jansz Sonck et al Valcke et al Data regarding the relationship between gender and the amount or type of parental mediation are mixed Some research has found that the childs gender has no association with the overall amount of parental mediation Livingstone and Helsper while others have found that girls are more subject to parental mediation new media society than boys Nunes De Almeida et al Sonck et al and others have found the inverse Nikken and Jansz Digital skills and online risks and opportunities Digital skills play significant role in Internet use Eastin and LaRose Hargittai and Hinnant Van Dijk and Van Deursen Evidence shows that they play direct role not only in online opportunities but also as mediator between those oppor tunities and the effect of sociodemographic factors and access Hargittai and Hinnant Livingstone and Helsper Digital literacy is associated with both opportunities and risks encountered online Livingstone and Helsper Specifically it is important in terms of online coping strategies when encountering upsetting situations Vandoninck et al and in whether certain uses become harmful negative experience or an opportunity Smahel and Blinka Vandoninck et al Parental mediation and risks and opportunities online supportive style of mediation is associated with safer Fleming et al use of the Internet and also with more positive interactive behaviour online Lee and Chae Norms such as time of use or websites that children can visit seem ineffective Lee and Chae Vandoninck et al As Livingstone and Helsper show restricting Internet use with the aim of reducing risks will most likely also reduce opportunities Similarly countries with the highest proportion of restrictive mediation practices are not systematically lower risk and harm countries Helsper et al Parental mediation and digital skills There is lack of evidence regarding the possible effect that any parental mediation of Internet use can have on the digital literacy level of children or teenagers However the EU Kids Online study shows that active monitoring and technical parental mediation of the Internet are positively associated with digital skills while restrictive mediation is negatively associated Drager and Livingstone Livingstone et al Hypothetical model Most of the studies reviewed did not perform an integrated and complex analysis For this study we develop multivariate approach integrating wider range of variables The following questions drove this research RQ What is the association between young Internet users demographics age and gender home factors Internet access at home parental education

significant effect in comparison to the younger age group The hypothesis of negative association between being girl and online risks was not confirmed However there is an indirect path between gender and online risks mediated by online opportunities Table In other words the fact that girls tend to engage in less online opportunities reduces their chances of experiencing risks The hypotheses regarding the negative effect of both types of mediation were con firmed Interestingly the direct effect of couse and active mediation is slightly stronger than the effect of restrictive mediation

society chance are from restrictive mediation which has negative effect and from Internet access at home and digital skills which both have positive effect Couse and active mediation have no direct significant effect on online opportunities however they have significant indirect effect when mediated by digital skills In other words this type of mediation may increase the level of digital skills resulting in higher engagement with online opportunities Belonging to either of the older age groups and higher parental education are both positively associated with opportunities Finally girls tend to engage in fewer online opportunities When looking at the total effects sum of all direct and indirect effects on each vari able presented in Table we confirm the importance of the effect of online

of the predictor variables included in this study The contribution of this study is testing the persistence of these associations in more complex model and in Latin American country The result that online opportunities seem to be associated with online risks is consist ent with the results of Livingstone and Helsper and it strengthens the relevance of analysing them together and of revising the factors associated with them Our findings confirm the relevance of personal characteristics in online opportunities and risks age gender and digital skills seem to shape childrens and adolescents experiences on the Internet As in previous studies Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch older teenagers engage in more online risks than younger children and older children engage in more opportunities Livingstone and Helsper Considering that younger children run to be more receptive to parental intervention while older children often perceive mediation as an invasion of privacy Smahel and Wright age should be crucial in the discussion regarding parental mediation opportunities and risk policies Contrary to prior findings Livingstone and Helsper Sasson and Mesch Vandoninck et al gender and digital skills seem not to have direct influence on online risks but rather operate through online opportunities Brazilian boys are more likely to engage in opportunities online which results in greater likelihood of encountering risks On the contrary the level of digital skills increases online opportunities leading to an increase in online risks The lack of direct relationship of digital skills with risks may be explained by the indicators used in this survey to measure digital skills which are more focussed on managing opportunities than risks We also found that family factors such as parental educational level and parental Internet use are important mainly due to their influence through parental mediation The finding that parental mediation seems to be reducing the number of risks is consistent with some previous studies Fleming et al Lee and Chae Valcke et al and contrary to others in Europe Helsper et al Livingstone and Helsper The latter studies showed that increasing mediation did not necessarily reduce risks and also that countries with higher restrictive mediation did not have lower levels of online risk In Brazil both types of mediation were found to be negatively associated with the amount of online risks although couse and active mediation had stronger effect compared to restrictive mediation Couse and active mediation do not have direct effect on online opportunities but as they are positively associated with the level of digital skills they may increase the online opportunities indirectly The fact that restrictive mediation reduces risks but also reduces opportunities questions the effectiveness of restrictive mediation on helping children and adolescents with an overall positive online experience However this should be further explored considering personal andor cultural factors that have been found to affect this association Kirwil Lee Parents who use the Internet tend to practice more mediation with their children espe cially couse and active mediation These parents may be more selfconscious about the different opportunities and risks online and tend to prefer explaining and discussing the media content andor sharing media activities with their children rather than restricting their useCabelloHutt et al Higher educated parents seem to practice more couse and active parental mediation However parental education did not have significant effect on restrictive mediation This is consistent with European findings Drager and Livingstone Livingstone et al As Livingstone et al noted highly educated parents seem to be replacing regulatory approaches with more supportive styles that encourage the childs empowerment These results suggest that couse and active parental mediation are in some way related to the cultural capital of the family as defined by Bourdieu It could be hypothesised that through active or couse mediation practices parents are transmitting to their children certain cultural capital in the form of advice criteria and guidelines on Internet use as proposed by Frow and Emmison Children with higher educated parents also engage in more online opportunities and have higher levels of digital skills Thus children from more highly educated families could be benefiting from Internet use to greater extent than those who have fewer resources resulting in increased inequality De Haan This result is particularly relevant for digital inclusion policies in Brazil and other Latin American countries which tend to focus only on providing access and promoting Internet use Social and especially educational policies in these countries should also work on implementing school and teacher Internet mediation strategies and on developing childrens digital skills Otherwise as these findings suggest digital opportunities may potentially become new source of inequality and could even result in the amplification of existing social and cultural inequalities Toyama In addition we found that structural factor Internet access at home was associated with greater number of online opportunities This finding in addition to the importance of parental education shows that the socioeconomic characteristics at home are still an important condition for online opportunities Livingstone and Helsper This represents relevant gap in country like Brazil where Internet access is far from universal and there are important social inequalities On the contrary the importance of digital skills on online opportunities is consistent with previous findings in Europe and North America Eastin and LaRose Hargittai and Hinnant Van Dijk and Van Deursen Finally general overview of the results of this model shows that as in other contexts of child development access to material resources parents education and mediation role and childrens skills are all important factors in the digital context More specifically parents who dedicate more time to active and couse can provide more opportunities for their children These parents also tend to be more skilled and more educated which is very important finding facing the inequalities in Brazil and other countries in the Global South These results support the importance of adopting an ecological per spective that combines personal family cultural and structural factors to study this phenomenon At the same time they stress the need to design overarching policies to support childrens development and wellbeing in the digital environment Some limitations of this study should be considered First the use of SEM posed some methodological challenges when using survey weights Second digital skills were based on selfreport rather than actual achievement which could be reflecting other personal characteristics such as selfefficacy and social desirability leading to an over or underestimation of the skill level Third the influence of teachers or peers was new media society not considered which may be obscuring the way that other socialisation agents shape childrens experiences on the Internet Fourth information on technical and monitoring mediation was only available for children with Internet access at home and therefore these types of mediation were not included in the analysis Fifth the mediation measures available fail to incorporate the nuances of the parenting style possibly hiding restrictive but supportive or active but controlling types of mediation Valkenburg et al Future studies should also consider these extended frameworks to study parental mediations Finally the definition of risks and opportunities only refers to the likelihood of harm or of benefit respectively and the classification of some items in each one of them could be argued One example is the inclusion of contacting strangers online as risk To avoid normative approaches in these types of classifications further qualitative and quantitative research in this area is needed Acknowledgements The authors gratefully

['Parenting in the Digital Age The Challenges of Parental Responsibility in Comparative Perspective Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrne Abstract As children in high middle and even lowincome countries gain access to the internet via range of digital devices and services most often via mobile phone parents are feeling challenged in their competence role and authority In response parents draw on their available resources socioeconomic and cultural and their preferred parenting styles as well as some of the principles of positive parenting In high income countries shift is underway from restrictive towards enabling forms of parental mediation In middle and lowincome countries the evidence suggests that restrictive mediation is generally favoured by parents although this brings costs in terms of childrens opportunities online especially for girls In all countries the rapid pace of technological innovation undermines parental competence this is in turn undermining childrens willingness to turn to parents for support We conclude with suggestions to support parents in meeting the growing challenge of empowering their children online in diverse contexts Keywords positive parenting parental mediation digital media Global South Global Kids Online crossnational comparisons Introduction Who is responsible for enabling childrens internet use and protecting them from risks Generally the first answer is parents especially when it comes to keeping children safe Parents are held responsible for teaching their children about values social norms and accepted behaviour They are also expected to enable their children to study help in the family keep healthy cross the road and make good judgements about people places and information In enacting these responsibilities parents we include here Livingstone Sonia Byrne Jasmina Parenting in the Digital Age The Challenges of Parental Responsibility in Com parative Perspective in Giovanna Mascheroni Cristina Ponte Ana Jorge eds Digital Parenting The Challenges for Families in the Digital Age Gteborg Nordicom Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrnestep parents grandparents and any other adults and older siblings taking on caring role have always been able to draw on their own life experience and the traditions and knowledge of their community But as children in high middle and even lowincome countries gain access to the internet parents are feeling challenged especially as their children use mobile devices that are difficult for parents to supervise and technologically complex services that parents may not understand They are also influenced by popular worries about screen time internet addiction stranger danger and so on So whatever is normatively expected of parents there are practical limits to what they can do No wonder that in whichever country has recently gained widespread internet access there is groundswell of con cern from parents as they struggle to enact their responsibilities and about parents as governments worry about the digital divide child protection and cybercrime on the one hand and on the other the digital skills of the future labour force Also under pressure are schools expected to teach the digital literacies needed for children to benefit from the expanding digital opportunities welfare and mental health services now expected to address problems children face in proprietary online services law enforcement dealing with networked crimes involving child victims at considerable scale and businesses striving to expand into digital markets but undermined by issues of consumer literacy and trust From the perspective of these organisations the more that parents can take on to prepare their children for the digital age the less the bur den on them Conversely the less able parents are to enable and protect their children the greater are the calls for appropriate education regulation public expenditure and corporate social responsibility Parenting offline and online how do they relate What kinds of parenting styles are likely to be effective in relation to the digital environ ment There is growing body of evidence especially from high and middleincome countries that demonstrates the importance of positive parenting for child development including early childhood physical cognitive and emotional development educational outcomes improved communication and trust reduction in risk taking behaviour among adolescents improved social competence of adolescents and reduction of violence Daly Knerr Gardner Cluver Moore Whitney Kinukawa What is often considered positive parenting includes stimulation and affection clear and focused praise supporting increasing autonomy encouraging healthy habits goal setting establishing firm rules and consequences De Stone However when children enter adolescents from around the age of there are also changes in parentchild relationships with adolescents seeking more autonomy and independence Patton et al and parenting styles must adapt In the World Health Organization WHO developed framework that ex amines key dimensions of parenting or parental roles that positively affect adolescent Parenting in the Digital Agewellbeing connection behaviour control respect for individuality modelling ap propriate behaviour and provision and protection WHO These parental roles can be easily applied to all situations and environments including to childrens digital world as follows Connection positive stable emotional bond between parents and adolescents is an important factor contributing to child and adolescent health and development In the digital world that means that child or an adolescent who feels connected with their parents is more likely to share their offline and online experiences without fearing their access will be blocked Our Global Kids Online study shows that where children say they have positive relationship with parents in general manifested through support and praise they are more likely to share with them when negative things happen online Georgiev et al Logar et al Behaviour control this includes supervising and monitoring adolescents ac tivities establishing behavioural rules and consequences for misbehaviour and conveying clear expectations for behaviour WHO When it comes to children and the digital technologies this could include rules astir time spent on the internet use of digital devices after bed time in childrens bedrooms during meal time as well as understanding what children do online how they set up their privacy controls with whom they share personal information etc South African parents surveyed through Global Kids Online on average exhibit the digital skills of to year olds making it relatively difficult for them to support and supervise their childrens online behaviour Phyfer et al The Bulgarian Kids Online survey shows that parental engagement in childrens online activities declines with childrens age with per cent of parents engaging with to year olds and only per cent with year olds and older Kanchev et al Respect for individuality this means allowing the adolescent to develop healthy sense of self apart from his or her parents This includes listening to what ado lescents have to say trusting them to complete their responsibilities or to take on new roles in the family In the digital domain this means allowing children and adolescents to explore the internet independently in much the same way we would allow them to explore the physical world The age and capacities of the child matter as younger children will clearly need more guidance than the older ones The Global Kids Online research shows that the to year old group finds it particularly difficult to know what information online is true and what is not Byrne et al Modelling appropriate behaviour children and adolescents identify with their parents absorb the values and norms established in the home and try to emulate parental behaviour If parents spend most of their free time online there is strong likelihood that the children will do too If parents share too much information Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrneonline will that affect how children share their own personal information or information about their friends Through development of their sense of agency children may depart from the established norm in the family and decide to take different approach to that of their parents We have seen examples of children disagreeing over sharenting or parental sharing of content and images of their children online BlumRoss Livingstone Provision and protection parents cannot meet all the needs of the growing adolescent Their role is also to seek the resources for their children that they cannot provide or to ensure that they have access to appropriate services When it comes to protection of children online parents still have an important role to play But so do peers teachers and other adults in childrens lives When asked who they turn to if they experience something hurtful online children would turn to peers first and then parents second as we show below Byrne et al To what extent these parenting roles will be fulfilled what parenting style will be adopted and what parenting practices will prevail will depend on many factors including parental education beliefs and culture as well as the individual and institutional support avail able to parents As we discuss in what follows this varies in different parts of the world In high income countries In the early days of internet access in Europe and North America many children be came confident and competent internet users before their parents and teachers This resulted in considerable generation gap parents underestimated their childrens use and the risk of harm they encountered online As consequence few parents supported their childrens internet use beyond the fact of providing access By the same token few children turned to their parents for support when they encountered problem on the internet culture rapidly developed in which to generalize many parents felt disempowered ignorant of their childrens experiences online susceptible to media panics about internet predators or pornography and therefore restrictive in managing their childrens internet access But the situation is now changing recent survey of European parents of children aged to in France Germany the Netherlands Spain Poland Italy Sweden and the UK found parents to be fairly concerned about their childrens online experi ences especially exposure to violent images and being bullied online but also about their children being exposed to data tracking digital identity theft and advertisements for unhealthy lifestyles Livingstone et al However analysis of what parents said they actually did to manage their childrens internet use revealed two styles of parental mediation Parenting in the Digital Age Restrictive mediation Parents restricting or banning or insisting on supervising any of long list of online activities Enabling mediation Parents undertaking active strategies such as talking to child about what they do online or encouraging their activities as well as giving safe advice also activities that might seem restrictive use of technical controls and parental monitoring but are better interpreted as building safe framework precisely so that positive uses of the internet can be encouraged In terms of outcomes more enabling mediation by parents was positively associated with childrens experience of online opportunities but also with more online risks Conversely more restrictive mediation was associated with fewer online risks experi enced by children but also they enjoyed fewer opportunities This makes it problematic if policymakers concerned with risk urge parents to restrict childrens internet use without recognising the costs to their online opportunities But also problematic is the tendency of educators to urge parents to enable childrens internet use without recog nising that this may bring more risk In addition both parents and policy makers need to be aware that risks do non necessarily translate to harm and that enabling mediation helps children to build resilience and adopt strategies that can help them stay safe both offline and online Further analysis of the European parent survey showed that parents prefer risk averse restrictive strategy for their less skilled children presumably doubting their childs ability to cope with risk if they encounter it while being more encouraging of if their children or they themselves are more competent internet users Thus in the Global North it is time to recognize that many parents are also gaining digital skills and they can use these to enable their child online However parents who are less confident of their own or their childs digital skills take more restrictive approach keeping their child safe but at the cost of online opportunities so to avoid vicious cycle of disad vantage parents every bit well as children could be provided with digital literacy education To sum up what we learned in the Global North suggests the value of an open dia logue between parent and child so that each comes to understand and respond to the online experiences competences and concerns of the other However insofar as parents or children lack digital skills inequalities in childrens online opportunities may open up EU Kids Online research shows other ways in which disadvantages in home life offline may extend online children more vulnerable to risk of harm offline also tend to be more vulnerable online also around one in eight parents does not provide sup portive or safety mediation last around half of parents whose child has encountered an online risk is unaware of this and this in countries where twothirds of children say their parents know fair amount about what they do online So even in the Global North many parents and carers lack time knowledge or other resources to manage their childrens internet use as well as they would wish either to promote opportunities or minimize risks And their responses both reflect and repro duce socioeconomic inequalities in childrens life changes now online as well as offline Sonia Livingstone Jasmina ByrneMoreover the continual flow of technological innovations further destabilizes parental competence and confidence while placing children at the cutting edge of experimental forms of technological innovation Lupton Williamson Add to this the con tradictory exhortations on the one hand to minimize screen time and on the other to buy the latest device to ensure children keep up and parental anxieties become intense BlumRoss Livingstone this book In low and middleincome countries It seems likely that the above problems are exacerbated in low and middleincome countries for several reasons UNICEF First even though close to billion peo ple mostly in the Global South are not connected of those who are young people below the age of are nearly three times more likely than the general population to be using the internet ITU So while kid are often pioneers in exploring the internet they may lack support from knowledgeable adults As Gouws comments about South African teenagers use of technology although perceived to be streetsmart arrogant knowitalls and technological experts they are also young lonely insecure and find themselves in life period of major developmental challenges Many children in developing countries are brought up by single parent or even by relatives often grandparents In CentralSouth America and subSaharan Africa children are more likely to live with either one or neither of their parents than children in other regions Child Trends Factors such as migration illness parental death poverty affect these family units functioning and parents or caregivers are often left with little resources and time to help with their children with the digital skills The digital divide between children and their grandparents is even more pronounced and it is hard to expect that year old will be able to monitor his or her grandchilds internet use or support them with the development of digital skills Sometimes parental mediation techniques are based on the cultural norms prevail ing in society tending to restrict childrens digital use even further Bulger et al which may in turn lead to children hiding from their parents what they do online For instance Davidson and Martellozzo found in their study in Bahrain that Young people use digital media in much the same way regardless of the social and cultural contexts but that culturally gendered perspectives place restrictions upon us age Specifically they note that parental expectations about girls use of digital media led girls to conceal acts that would be judged unacceptable such as communicating with boys online or that would be harshly punished if discovered Indeed parenting restrictions can fall particularly heavily on girls Livingstone et al As Porter and colleagues note in their study of three African countries These constraints on girls by parents and communities often imposed at least in part from positive welfare motives can be substantial barrier to accessing education and improved livelihoods especially but not only in rural areas study Parenting in the Digital Ageof parental mediation practices in South Africa found that girls received less parental mediation with regard to their internet use which was associated with fewer online risks but also with lower levels of digital skills and fewer online opportunities Phyfer KardefeltWinther forthcoming The degree to which parents and carers are often reluctant to discuss sexual matters with teenagers can leave them vulnerable to online and offline risks as they search for answers online potentially finding problematic content as result Nwalo Anasi No wonder that girls themselves call for efforts to educate parents teachers and communities on the importance of their access to the internet and to having ICTs better integrated in the curriculum de Pauw Parents may also not understand the nature of the risks online In Turkey smallscale survey of toyearolds found that the most reported form of exposure to cyberbullying students experience is being insulted and being threatened Aricak et al yet that parents and teachers tend to see verbal threats as less serious than physical bullying facetoface notwithstanding research which shows harms from cyberbullying United Nations In South Africa parents do worry about children experiencing of bullying online yet sizeable percentage of children said they experienced bullying in person which parents did non mention as concern Such onesided worries stem from the lack of parental knowledge of both digital technologies and their childrens life experiences so their mediation practices may go from total restriction and no access to device to access to device with little guidance on how to use the internet safely Phyfer et al In addition since in the least developed countries school attendance is low pupil teacher ratios are high and the overcrowded classrooms and untrained teachers are common UNESCO It seems fair to conclude that in many countries children lack supportive andor informed adult in their lives who can teach them to navigate the internet safely or offer support when needed What is being done what can be done Policy and practice must respect the different conditions that apply in different parts of the world The Global Kids Online GKO project is interviewing and surveying parents and children aged across different continents to benchmark and track childrens online access skills opportunities risk and safety and the skills and protective actions of their parents Recent findings from partners research reveals the different sources of support that children themselves turn to in different contexts Byrne et al Cabello et al Georgiev et al Kanchev et al Logar et al Phyfer et al Popadi et al Figure shows that in Bulgaria and Montenegro parents are more likely to be childrens first recourse for help when something is problematic on the internet com pared with in the Global South countries surveyed In Chile children seem less likely Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrneto tell anyone at all while in South Africa and the Philippines friends are preferred over parents though both are helpful In no country do children turn to teachers or other professionals in significant numbers This suggests that it is difficult to provide alternative adult sources of support to parents but that children might be supported by peerbased mentoring systems Figure The last time something happened online that bothered or upset you did you talk to anyone of these people about it per cent yes by country Comments to year old in all countries In Bulgaria Chile and Montenegro representative national samples are used Caution is needed for the findings from the Philippines and South Africa which are based on pilot data in the Philippines the sample is very small For methodological details see Multistakeholder discussions often express the hope or expectation that parents will take primary responsibility for child safety online Parental mediation can be tailored according to the age maturity cultural or psychological circumstances of each child It doesnt limit adults freedoms online and it is cheap Moreover parents are already on hand willing to play their role But they also expect that their childs school will offer them advice and safety education and that the government will police the internet so that parental lapses in effort or effectiveness dont have disastrous consequences In Europe Insafe is the awarenessraising network for national centres that coordi nates the annual Safer Internet Day and provides parental steering regarding the latest popular site or newest online fashion among children Furthermore there are numerous multistakeholder initiatives that draw together the combined expertise of educators parenting groups child welfare bodies industry and law enforcement see for example the work of the ICT Coalition in bringing together the internet industry Croll Coordinated accessible parentfocused efforts in the Global South are few and far between Livingstone et al Although there are many parenting education pro grams in this region very few address childrens online experiences Integrating online issues into existing programs may be way to reach more parents and address their needs holistically Also likely to be useful is peer mentoring given childrens preference Bulgaria Chile Montenegro South Africa Philippines Friend Paretscarer Sibling Another adult trust Teacher professional Parenting in the Digital Ageto turn to friend for support especially when it comes to marginalized groups of children eg children with disabilities or adolescent girls in societies where gender inequality undermines girls opportunities to benefit from ICT use For instance in Iraq provision of online resources allowed adolescent girls to access information also linking them to peertopeer support networks where they could discuss issues usually considered private or taboo in their society UNICEF Conclusion We have drawn on the available and new research to argue that in both the Global North and the Global South while it is entirely appropriate to call on parents to play key role since they are ideally positioned to address the particular best interests of their child policies which leave the bulk of the responsibility to parents will find that this works better for relatively privileged families than for the majority including for those particularly vulnerable or at risk thereby leaving many challenges for the rest of society to address The problems are multiple First parents are usually not the first people children wish to tell about their relational emotional or sexual concerns Second the internet is hugely complicated and fastchanging making it difficult for busy parent to grasp what children need to know Third some parents do not take on this responsibility and they are hard to reach by awareness campaigns Fourth small minorities of parents are truly neglectful of or abusive to their children making it inap propriate to rely on them to ensure their childs safety However for those seeking to prevent or manage the risks of harm to children it is important to empower all parents and to provide safety net for circumstances of childhood vulnerability Some trends in the Global North have implications for experience in the Global South For instance the growing understanding and willingness of parents to engage with their childrens internet use as they catch up with their early adopter children Some trends in the Global South have implications for experience in the Global North We can point the trend towards mobile first replacing first use via desktop or laptop computer which is now also spreading in the Global North reducing parents ability to monitor their childs internet use Mascheroni lafsson Other trends invite us to recognise that also in the Global North some children escape parental oversight by going online outside the home or lack reliable parenting or adult figures in their lives The WHO five parental roles have resonance for families everywhere for most parents struggle with the tension between protecting their children versus giving them the freedom to explore learn and grow independently In addition most parents can be encouraged to draw on what they know about their child and the wider society as often this knowledge is also applicable in the digital domain Therefore in considering the stakeholders supporting parents there are questions about balance In future it will also be critical to include parenting in the digital age as component of parenting programmes currently being offered in the North and the South and to evaluate them Sonia Livingstone Jasmina Byrnefor impact Such examples of evidencebased programmes include Triple or Sinovuyo Teen parenting programme Haggerty et al Cluver et al indicating the positive impact of specific interventions in relation to parenting support In seeking answers to these dilemmas we would refer to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which clearly specifies that parents have the primary responsibility for childrearing but it also places obligations on states and communities to support parents in these endeavours It seems that the old saying it takes village to raise child still applies in digital world Its just that the village is now both local and Global
