"Abstract Maritime cybersecurity is developing as an issue that affects the ocean. Recent security breaches cost shipping companies hundreds of millions of dollars and put marine ecosystems at risk by disabling ship controls and increasing risks of collisions and hazmat spills. Additionally, most new ships are designed to transmit engine performance data ashore to allow timely maintenance and efficient operation. However, many ships still prohibit such data transmission due to security concerns, resulting in increased ship emissions and environmental risks from accidental release of oil, hydraulic fluids, or lubricants. Similarly, research vessel data are routinely sent ashore, but security concerns for their computers are also increasing, especially when they operate in global ports and oceans. Maritime cybersecurity is also critical as autonomous ships are being developed. Addressing maritime cybersecurity is therefore a valid area of scientific policy research and important for ocean science operations.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has called for improved maritime cybersecurity, and the U.S. Coast Guard also recently released a Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC; NVIC 05-17) on maritime cybersecurity for comments. The newly established Maritime Cyber Security Committee of the Marine Technology Society is coordinating maritime cybersecurity best practice information, contacts for cybersecurity professionals, and lessons learned on responding to cyberattacks to make this information broadly available. We review here various stakeholder approaches to maritime cybersecurity, outline available resources, and discuss how advanced methods, including optical communications and quantum encryption, will improve maritime cybersecurity. Scientists have a role in developing and implementing maritime cybersecurity methods and policies to ensure safe ship operations and improved environmental security for the oceans.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract While Cambodia has achieved stellar growth and poverty reduction over the last two decades, the next wave of growth is anticipated to come from increasing value-added as well as nurturing new sectors such as the Digital Economy. Over the past two decades, facilitated by preferential trade treatment and strong foreign direct investment inflows, growth and job creation have been taking place in activities with relatively limited value added, such as garment manufacturing, rice cropping, and construction. In recent years, Cambodian authorities have issued several policy documents relevant to digital development. Overall, the objectives and high-level program goals are generally consistent with international good practice, and envisage partnerships between the Government and the private sector at multiple levels. The Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 highlights the need to further develop e-Government and encourage the private sector to invest in technology. This was followed in 2014 by the approval of the Cambodia ICT Master Plan 2020 which aims to improve ICT industry and human resources development, internet connectivity, cybersecurity, and government e-services—and in 2016 by the Telecoms and ICT Policy which outlines policy measures and associated targets to expand ICT infrastructure and develop ICT human capacity. In addition, a draft Cambodia e-Government Master Plan 2017-2022 has been drafted, although not yet adopted. The draft outlines programs to provide quality information and digital services, in collaboration with prospective beneficiaries; connect with people on public policies and decisions, in particular through social media; and increase government efficiency by establishing basic foundations for digital government (e.g. cloud, enterprise architecture, intensive staff capacity building) and a government portal on which ministries can host their services. Numerous institutions across Government are tasked with the implementation of these policies and strategies. This policy note responds to a request from the Royal Government of Cambodia for the World Bank to assess the current state of its Digital Economy and identify policies to further develop it.The Policy Note applies the analytical framework presented in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends, to identify challenges and suitable policy options, and it is intended to inform the preparation of the upcoming Rectangular Strategy Phase IV (2018—2023).",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract This guide was initially developed for regulators in Europe and Eurasia to reinforce their knowledge of practical cybersecurity solutions in the face of ongoing threats within the energy sector. However, the questions of how to evaluate risks, assess mitigation measures, and select standards are relevant for regulators around the world.

NARUC’s intention in preparing this guide is to provide a consolidated review of multiple cyber concepts that can serve as a nontechnical and user-friendly guide to energy regulatory staff. Regulators are charged with several core functions, such as ensuring security of supply, evaluating utility investment plans, and
setting tariffs. As cyber threats continue to evolve, energy regulators need to increase their technical capacities to be able to serve as leaders within their countries and promote coordination among governmental and non-governmental institutions. This guide provides a useful summary of international cyber standards (with more detailed information included in the annex) so that regulators can have a starting point to more easily evaluate options for their national and/or regional contexts.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The Global Cybersecurity Capacity Program, which was generously financed by the Korea World Bank Group Partnership (KWPF) between 2016 and 2019, is one of the first steps that the World Bank has taken in an attempt to bridge existing gaps in cybersecurity capacities, especially in the case of governments that have taken out loans from WB to cover the needs of their emerging digital economies. Thanks to tailored national and regional technical assistance schemes, this Program has helped to strengthen cybersecurity capacities and awareness in six countries, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of North Macedonia in the Western Balkan
region, Ghana in West Africa, the Kyrgyz Republic in Central Asia, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia. The objective was to benefit a selected sample of countries across geographical regions that prioritize cybersecurity assistance and have at least some capacity to design and implement digital investment projects that include elements of cybersecurity. The countries had to be classified based on their income levels for WB to be able to assess the ultimate Program effectiveness, which is the main subject of this Executive Summary.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract How does digitalisation lead to new kinds of global connections and disconnections in the Global South? And what are the pitfalls that accompany this development? Much of the policy literature on digitalisation and development has focused on the importance of connecting developing countries to digital networks. Good connection to digital networks may have a fundamental impact on societies, changing not only how individuals and businesses navigate, operate and seek opportunities, but also as regards relations between government and the citizenry. However, the rapid pace of this development implies that digital technologies are being put to use before good, functional regulatory mechanisms have been developed and installed. The resultant shortcomings – in state mechanisms, institutions, coordination mechanisms, private mechanisms, general awareness, public knowledge and skills – open the door to new kinds of vulnerabilities. Herein lie dangers, but also opportunities for donor/recipient country exchange. Instead of adding to the already substantial literature on the potential dividends, this article examines a less studied issue: the new societal vulnerabilities emerging from digitalisation in developing countries. While there is wide agreement about the need to bridge the gap between the connected and the disconnected, the pitfalls are many.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract Governments are adopting various measures to address cybersecurity-related concerns. Some of these measures restrict cross-border flows of digital services/data, and thus inconsistent with obligations in trade agreements such as General Agreement on Trade in Services (‘GATS’). However, certain governments might argue that such measures are justified under the GATS security exception (Art. XIVbis) as they protect national security. This article investigates whether GATS Art. XIVbis is relevant in justifying cybersecurity measures and its potential impact on cybersecurity governance. It argues that GATS Art. XIVbis has limited relevance, and is potentially problematic, when used in justifying majority of cybersecurity measures. First, a large majority of cybersecurity measures do not fall within the limited set of exceptional circumstances listed in GATS Art. XIVbis. Further, in applying this exception to cybersecurity measures, WTO Panels will be unfairly forced to balance trade and security interests in an environment of political, technological and policy uncertainty. Given these practical limitations and the normative boundaries of GATS Art. XIVbis, countries must avoid casually relying upon security exceptions as a basis for adopting/implementing unilateral measures on cybersecurity, but rather engage in meaningful cyber-diplomacy and regulatory cooperation mechanisms to resolve their differences on cybersecurity governance.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The identification and assessment of risks are a fundamental part of cybersecurity. Determining the elements that participate in this field is difficult because there is no exclusive approach to cybersecurity. This document aims to provide a framework to identify and assess cybersecurity risks. For this, a systematic review of the studies related to cybersecurity risk taxonomies was carried out. The main elements of the proposed conceptual model and framework have been determined by applying the snowball technique. To validate the implementation of the proposed framework, a case study has been implemented at the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute. The first task was to consolidate the information in a baseline. Once the baseline was obtained, the defined framework has been applied. As a result, through the use of the proposed framework, the assessment process has improved the decision-making process regarding the importance and criticality of the risks and countermeasures that must be applied.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that

"Abstract An inclusive, digitally-enabled agricultural transformation could help achieve meaningful livelihood improvements for Africa’s smallholder farmers and pastoralists. It could drive greater engagement in agriculture from women and youth and create employment opportunities along the value chain. At CTA we staked a claim on this power of digitalisation to more systematically transform agriculture early on. Digitalisation, focusing on not individual ICTs but the application of these technologies to entire value chains, is a theme that cuts across all of our work. In youth entrepreneurship, we are fostering a new breed of young ICT ‘agripreneurs’. In climate-smart agriculture multiple projects provide information that can help towards building resilience for smallholder farmers. And in women empowerment we are supporting digital platforms to drive greater inclusion for women entrepreneurs in agricultural value chains.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract While gender equality has an intrinsic value as a human right, it could also act as a catalyst for economic growth (Klugman & Tyson, 2016). For instance, closing the education gender gap could unlock resources and contribute to diversifying skills and talent within the workforce (Eriksson, 2017). Moreover, the incorporation of women in the labour force is recognised as an important driver of national growth (Scott, 2018); McKinsey Global Institute estimates that reaching gender economic parity could add up to 26 per cent to the annual global GDP in 2025 (Woetzel et al., 2015).

Interestingly, ICT practices has become the backbone in
providing the quality of education. Therefore, ICT is used as a
key to success and has become indispensable part of the
education sector from primary education to Higher Education.
ICT helps students as well as teachers to augment their
knowledge, skills, as well as learning. Education being the main pillar of society needs modern approaches to enhance the scope impact of education. Hence, ICT is best tool for this. Even ICT has become inevitable tool in every sector. Thus, developed world and developing nations are also adopting ICT. This paper has reviewed ICT related literature including different plans and projects by government of Pakistan and its autonomous bodies. Meanwhile, to compare the real situation, it also considered the papers published in world recognized journals as well reports and surveys by United Nation’s subsidiary bodies like UNESCO and World Bank. The reading of relevant literature resulted in four factors to be highlighted in this review paper. The factors to be highlighted consist of ICT importance, infrastructure, challenges to its successful use and suggestions to improve the usage. All these factors are drawn from previous literature and discussed comprehensively in comparison with findings. Finally, the current findings and expected targets for ICT in education are

"Abstract The study, which is forthcoming at World Development, takes place in Uganda, a low-income East African country with a high level of decentralization. Specifically, the intervention was implemented in Arua district, a rural and fairly poor area of northwestern Uganda. In rural areas in developing countries, representatives often lack information about the quality of public services on the ground. This information shortfall is due to the high cost for the government to actively monitor service points, as well as the high cost to citizens who observe problems directly and report service delivery problems. The study aims to improve service delivery by leveraging a new information communication technology (ICT) platform that reduces the monetary and social cost of monitoring service providers and sharing information with local government officials.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract Recent years have seen an ever-greater expansion of the digital economy, a development that may bring new opportunities to workers who were at a disadvantage in the traditional economy. We focus on a specific set of workers who belong to such a group: women. We study a skill set of particular relevance in the digital economy and estimate their returns in the labor market, according to gender, across four Latin American countries. We find that information and communication technologies (ICT) skills and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills yield significant positive returns for both men and women. However, there is a significant gender gap that favors men on the STEM returns. There is also a sizable gender gap regarding the amount of skills accumulated by gender. Through an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we estimate that up to 80% of the gender gap in hourly wages may be due to the lower returns that women receive, relative to men, on their STEM skills. If an investment in skills relevant to the digital economy may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women, why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries remains an open and relevant question.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity

"Abstract Access to formal sources of credit remains a challenge for the unorganized Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector in India. The credit gap for informal enterprises within the MSME sector in India was estimated to be at US$418 billion in 2012-13. Lack of business transaction data and credit history acts as a barrier to establish creditworthiness required to access credit from formal sources. As a consequence, these enterprise owners often end up accessing loans from informal lenders at exorbitant interest rates. In an attempt to break this vicious cycle and help small merchants get loans from formal sources, CATALYST carried out multiple experiments. These were aimed at testing if access to credit through a starter builder model would encourage merchants to transact digitally and build a digital footprint.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for Georgia as it is for virtually every country in the world. In recent years, Georgia has made significant progress in regaining fiscal space and developing sound monetary and financial frameworks, but there is no such thing as perfect macroeconomic conditions when a crisis such as this occurs. Virtually all sectors of the Georgian economy have been adversely impacted, including tourism, which has been an important contributor to Georgia’s economic growth in recent years. COVID-19 has created new opportunities for Georgia to stimulate its economic recovery and long-term resilience though deepening integration with global supply chains. To capitalize, Georgia must focus the next phase of policy on positioning high-potential sectors to compete—high-value/low-volume manufacturing segments and select business services—and creating and enabling environments for local businesses to adapt. Criteria for business-site selection has remained largely intact, reaffirming sectoral policy directions that Georgia had been pursuing pre-COVID. Acceleration toward automation, a focus on supply chain transparency, and increasingly stiff global competition to localize business activity have created many imperatives, such as making foreign direct investments (FDIs), as well as making swift, bold investments in digitalization, workforce development, and core infrastructure.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

"Abstract eMitra, a Government of Rajasthan (GoR) e-governance platform, provides more than 350 services to citizens. The eMitra centers are run by individual entrepreneurs who earn through commissions or fees paid for services rendered. The most widely used services are utility bill payments, which are either paid monthly or bimonthly, resulting in a share of the eMitra center customers being regulars. CATALYST conducted a diagnostic study with eMitra entrepreneurs in a particular area. It held a detailed discussion with six entrepreneurs and studied the back-end data of a sample of around 27 eMitras to understand their operations and underlying challenges in process and payments flows. While attempts have been made to digitize payments at eMitra centers in the past by providing Point of Sale (PoS) devices or integrating other modes of payment within the eMitra portal itself, the transaction fee is usually passed on to the customer. Due to low profit margins, these additional charges cannot be absorbed by the eMitra entrepreneur either.

Various investigative research methods were conducted, such as qualitative in-country key informant interviews (KII) with actors in the targeted value chains; discussions with relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and meetings with Government of Jordan (GoJ) representatives and other key stakeholders. Focus group discussions (FGD) were held with partner microfinance institution (MFI) staff and clients as well as in-depth interviews with potential clients listed as members of the targeted cooperatives. Due to the overall low statistical sample, the key findings focus heavily on the situation of HBBs rather than MSEs; however, the information in this report is relevant and useful for both groups.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract More than a hundred years ago, the predecessors of today’s energy giants, Chevron and ExxonMobil, began marketing and exploration activities in Indonesia with pioneering investments that eventually led to the country becoming a world-class energy producer. The full scale of US investment in the country is not often evident from official government figures. Statistics from the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) only attributed $7.78 billion worth of investments to the US from 2013 to 2017. This is far from a complete picture. For this year’s edition of our annual investment report, AmCham Indonesia, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the United States Agency for International Development Mission to Indonesia (USAID Indonesia) commissioned Ernst & Young Indonesia to try to paint a more complete picture of the true scale and impact of US investments in Indonesia.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract Over the past decade, financial services for the poor have undergone a dramatic transformation. For years, financial institutions like banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) struggled to sustainably serve the world’s poor. But advances in technology have led to innovative business models, and with them, new opportunities for expanding the reach of financial services. At the heart of this financial transformation is the rise of digital payments services through which nearly any individual or business can send or receive money in real time for almost any purpose and from nearly anywhere in the country, an inclusive payment ecosystem.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Digital financial services (DFS) differ from traditional financial services in several ways that have major implications for regulators. The technology enables new operating models that involve a wider range of actors in the chain of financial services, from design to delivery. The advent of DFS ushers in new providers such as nonbank e-money issuers (EMIs), creates a key role for agents in serving clients, and reaches customers who have otherwise been excluded or underserved. This in turn brings new risks and new ways to mitigate them. For many years now, CGAP has been interested in understanding how these new models are regulated, and how regulation might have to adapt to enable DFS models that have potential to advance financial inclusion. This focus note takes a close look at four building blocks in regulation, which we call basic regulatory enablers, and how they have been implemented in practice. Each of the enablers addresses a specific aspect of creating an enabling and safe regulatory framework for DFS. Our focus is on DFS models that specifically target excluded and underserved market segments. The authors analyze the frameworks adopted by 10 countries in Africa and Asia where CGAP has focused its in-country work on supporting a market systems approach to DFS.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Improving “last-mile” public-service delivery is a recurring challenge in developing countries. Could the widespread adoption of mobile phones provide a scalable, cost-effective means for improvement?  We use a large-scale experiment to evaluate the impact of phone-based monitoring on a program that transferred nearly a billion dollars to 5.7 million Indian farmers. In randomly-selected jurisdictions, officials were informed that program implementation would be measured via calls with beneficiaries.  This led to a 7.6% reduction in the number of farmers who did not receive their transfers. The program was highly cost-effective, costing 3.6 cents for each additional dollar delivered.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract The objective of this note is to identify the key issues in trade facilitation and logistics that affect the e-commerce landscape, with a focus on cross border (trade facilitation) domestic delivery (logistics); highlight key challenges and opportunities, particularly for developing countries and small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and provide a roadmap for potential areas of World Bank (WB) support in that landscape. This work has broadly covered areas such as customs and border management; information and communications technology for trade; logistics services, including competition issues; and trade-related infrastructure (ports, inland ports, airports, and so on). This note identifies the various issues and challenges relating to e-commerce from a facilitation and logistics point of view and identifies potential solutions, particularly those in which the WBG can play a role in helping developing countries. The note draws from a wide array of developments and literature and from work done by the WBG more generally in trade facilitation and logistics in assisting countries to improve their trade environment. The note explores the required building blocks for facilitating cross-border e-commerce as to address the challenges raised and consist of: (a) improvement programs for creating a more conducive legal environment for automation; (b) improving automation and interconnectivity between agencies; (c) implementing simplified procedures to trade, including for e-commerce; and (d) implementing fully the World Trade Organizations (WTO's) trade facilitation agreement. The note concludes with the summation that e-commerce offers new challenges and opportunities for governments and firms, but to maximize its benefits requires significant reform. This note has set out a path for countries to continuing the reform and modernization route with recommendations and an action matrix of specific improvements to the trade facilitation and logistics environment that will better position countries and firms to take advantage of the enormous potential that cross border e-commerce offers.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract In many low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) where disease burdens are highest, health supply chains function poorly, resulting in frequent stockouts and a high prevalence of substandard and even falsified medications. In response to these concerns, the global health initiatives have stepped up their efforts to improve supply chain management. At the same time, a growing number of rich country pharmaceutical companies are investing in digital technologies that help them “track and trace” the movement of medicines through the supply chain at the package-level. Drawing from interviews with over thirty experts, we find that traceability offers a realistic solution to some of the problems found in LMIC health supply chains but that implementing the approach is a huge logistical endeavor that requires a strong political commitment. We close by discussing how donors can support committed governments, by taking an evidence-based approach to determine what traceability methods work best.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Iraq, once again, is facing a combination of acute shocks which the country is ill-prepared tomanage. The collapse in oil prices has considerably reduced budgetary revenues and reversed the fiscal surpluses accumulated since 2018. COVID-19, and the lockdown measures needed to contain the pandemic have dealt a severe blow to economic activities especially the services sectors like transport, trade, banking and religious tourism, which constitute around half of the non-oil economy. The growing discontent over poor service delivery, rising corruption, and lack of jobs persists and is coupled with political impasse over the formation of a new government. Iraq’s pre-existing conditions going into this crisis limit its ability to manage and mitigate the socio-economic impact. An undiversified economy, highly dependent on oil outcomes, as well as large presence of the state in economic and commercial activities, make it hard to create the needed private sector jobs for a predominantly young population. Furthermore, rampant corruption and weak governance and service delivery fueled large scale protests across the country calling for better public service delivery and jobs.  As a result, the economy is projected to contract by 9.7 percent in 2020, down from a real GDP growth of 4.4 percent in 2019, with both oil and non-oil sectors contracting by 13 and 4.4 percent respectively. This special focus on digital economy (DE) highlights the importance of digital transformation for Iraq and the urgency behind it. Iraq’s economic condition was gradually improving following the deep economic strains of the last three years. However, the recent protests and unrest highlight the continued fragility of the country and the high priority of improving economic opportunities, particularly for youth. Leveraging the DE will help Iraq address some of its citizens’ concerns as well as accelerate the achievement of its development objectives.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract China has achieved remarkable success in financial inclusion. China’s rate of account ownership – a basic metric of financial inclusion – has increased significantly in the past two decades and is now on par with that of other G-20 countries. Traditional financial service providers have dramatically increased the reach of the formal financial sector, including through the world’s largest agent banking network. China has also been an established leader in the fintech revolution, with new technology-driven providers transforming how millions of Chinese consumers make payments, borrow, save, invest, and insure themselves against risk. This report examines in detail China’s approach to financial inclusion over the past 15 years. The report benchmarks China’s progress against peer economies and analyzes key developments and factors in China’s financial inclusion experience.

"Abstract The increasing importance of the Internet, not only for tasks related to information search, storage, and sharing, but also for connecting people and business, domestic and international trade, education, entertainment and social interactions, has led governments around the world to include Internet connectivity in their priority policy agendas and infrastructure plans. Today, access to the Internet is no longer a luxury, but is increasingly considered an essential service, as important as building transportation and utility networks. However, more than four billion people, overwhelmingly in developing countries, still lack Internet access. For the past decade, policy makers have sought ways to best create an enabling environment to direct national resources and engage the private sector to effectively expand access to the Internet. In doing so, policy makers and regulators face a unique combination of priorities, resources, market structures, and geographies that will affect their national plans. Experience shows that no one-size-fits-all approach exists, but past and current experience can be analyzed for common factors contributing to success or failure to support similar endeavors in the future. This report reviews and provides guidance on innovative business models and approaches to the deployment of high-speed broadband networks and highlights global trends related to terrestrial spectrum resources that can be leveraged to meet expected future demand and close existing Internet access gaps. It is intended to serve as a reference tool to help policy makers and regulators assess alternatives for infrastructure deployment and adopt decisions tailored to their country’s circumstances and needs.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic underscores the importance of digitalization for economic and social resilience. COVID-19 is restricting mobility and economic activity around the world, and the Philippines is no exception. In the Philippines, COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption and use of digital technologies. However, digitalization is largely constrained by the country’s low high-speed broadband penetration, which lags behind neighboring middle-income countries. The digital divide in the Philippines is large with nearly 60 percent of households not having access to internet, and unable to reap the benefits of digitalization. As a result, face-to-face interactions and analog practices largely dominate in the Philippines, making social distancing economically costly. For example, cash and cheques remain the dominant modes of payment while applying for permits and licenses typically requires exchange of documents in person. Gatherings of people waiting in lines are typical fixture for Filipinos to secure goods and services. This report provides a thorough analysis of the obstacles to digitalization and identifies key reforms and policy measures that could help the Philippines harness the potential of the digital economy. It uses the CHIP (Connect, Harness, Innovate, Protect) conceptual framework to analyze the requirements to accelerate digital transformation. The framework focuses on four key drivers of digitalization: (i) Connect, which refers to a set measures to build the digital foundation and enablers such as digital infrastructure for participation in the digital economy; (ii) Harness, which points to needed investments in analog complements such as skills, regulations, and institutions to leverage the old economy; (iii) Innovate, which refers to expanding the new economy services, digital payments, digital entrepreneurship and e-government; and (iv) Protect, which focuses on mitigating the risks in the digital economy. The need to act on the digital economy is urgent. Reforms delivered now will help the government cushion the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, support the recovery in the medium term, and make the economy more inclusive, competitive, and resilient to similar shocks in the long term.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract The education system under the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) in Indonesia is highly decentralized. Most school costs under MoEC are covered by fiscal transfers from the centre to provincial and district levels, some of which are earmarked for education use. One such type of transfer is school operational grants, known as Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS) or school operational assistance. BOS funds are managed directly by schools, which have been delegated the autonomy to receive, plan and budget, spend, administer, and report their use. Experience has shown that many schools lack the capacity to use BOS funds effectively and efficiently to deliver better learning outcomes for students, while there have been no planning systems to manage use of BOS funds towards achieving the National Education Standards (NES) for individual schools. Under the BOS program, each school is required to conduct a School Self‐Evaluation (SSE) against the NES and use the results to develop its spending plans accordingly. Every school has also been advised to develop a planning and budgeting system (Rencana Kegiatan dan Anggaran Sekolah or RKAS) to allocate and manage BOS funds. To support implementation of the RKAS, an application called the Rencana Kegiatan dan Anggaran Sekolah Berbasis Elektronik (e‐RKAS or electronic school plan) has been developed. To assess the preliminary effects of introducing different e‐RKAS applications on the role and behaviour of stakeholders, as well as challenges experienced during implementation, the World Bank conducted an evaluation of the e‐RKAS program.

"Abstract The global economy is increasingly digital. The internet and other information and communicationtechnologies (ICTs) are changing the way individuals, businesses and governments operate. Theirresilience to natural disasters, and their ability to recover in the aftermath, is thus critical to the resilience of the economy. This chapter discusses the impact of climate events on various types of digital infrastructure. It highlights key considerations for governments and digital infrastructure owners to make their infrastructure more resilient, while maintaining affordability of services. We find that digital infrastructure is vulnerable to various climate risks, but that technology choices and network design can improve redundancy and resilience of networks, by design. Certain infrastructures warrant greater ex ante investment in their resilience considering their criticality in the broadband value chain (submarine cables or landing stations) while others could follow repair and recovery options (mobile network antennas, poles, and towers).

"Abstract This report first describes the value to be derived from an increasingly digital economy in the Solomon Islands and examples of how other countries are doing the same. The tourism, agriculture, and fisheries sectors are examined in detail. It then presents an assessment of the digital government program elements and the extent to which they contribute to delivering effective and efficient, digitally enhanced government operations and services. Finally, and most importantly, it presents an assessment of the status and issues of the foundational enablers of a digital economy. The outcomes of the assessment indicated that while continued attention and action are required on digital government program elements, the SIG needs to focus mainly on strengthening the enabling environment for both digital government and the digital economy. Recent developments suggest good progress, (i.e. the National ICT Policy, the submarine cables, cybersecurity committee and planning), but several of the enablers require investment, effort, and action. The results of this assessment, and the breadth of the resulting recommendations, are further evidence of the degree of effort needed to accelerate the establishment of a digital economy and a digital government in the Solomon Islands, beyond simply the provision of faster, cheaper internet access. However, this assessment also exposes an already-substantial level of sophistication, continuing progress on key areas of focus, and a strong political will to invest additional resources and effort. The Prime Minister signaled his strong support in the Solomon Islands Digital Economy Workshop held in early November 2019. The arrival of the submarine cable, together with the recommended actions from the workshop and those provided herein, will no doubt accelerate the realization of the vision of ‘A peaceful, united and progressive Solomon Islands communicating and informed by technologies open to all’.

"Abstract Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the need for accelerating digital adoption in Burundi. Burundi’s current sectoral strategies acknowledge the importance of investing in digital technology. However, these lack an overarching approach with an actionable roadmap and clear resources behind it. Burundi’s mobile network coverage and mobile broadband uptake continues to be characterized by a stark urban-rural divide. Digital platforms are paramount in connecting people, businesses, and the government - enabling both transactions and the exchange of information, goods, and services in more efficient and convenient ways. At present Burundi’s digital entrepreneurship sector remains embryonic, hampered by barriers such as limited ecosystem support and weak access to financing. Whether through the provision of public services closer to its citizens with digital platforms, or through increased financial inclusion enabled by digital financial services and dynamic digital ecosystems, Burundi stands to gain from a continued investment in the foundations of its digital economy. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two reviews cross-cutting factors that affect the strategic, institutional, and regulatory environment for the digital agenda in Burundi.

"Abstract Universal adoption and effective application of digital technologies are expected to characterize economies of the future, shaping their ability to succeed in the global marketplace and offer a better quality of life for their citizens. Disruptive technologies are already altering traditional business models and pathways to development, yielding significant gains, increased convenience, as well as supporting better access to services for consumers. In 2016, the digital economy was worth an estimated 11.5 trillion dollars worldwide, equivalent to 15.5 percent of global GDP. It is forecast to reach 25 percent in less than a decade, far outpacing the growth of the ‘traditional’ economy (Huawei and Oxford Economics 2016). Mobile money is driving financial inclusion, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the number of accounts doubling to 21 percent between 2014-17. African e-commerce is also rapidly growing, at an estimated annual rate of 40 percent. Over the past five years, there has been a tenfold increase across the region in the supply of new intermediaries such as incubators, accelerators, and technology hubs, amongst others, numbering more than 400 across Africa today. The digital economy in Africa is expected to grow to over 300 billion dollars by 2025 (McKinsey 2013). Ghana has made substantial progress on financial inclusion, due in large part to growth in DFS. According to the World Bank’s Global Findex, the share of Ghanaian adults (over 15 years of age) with a formal financial account increased by 42 percent between 2014 and 2015. As a result, nearly 6 in 10 adults had formal access in 2017. With mobile account ownership increasing by nearly 200 percent between 2014 and 2017, mobile money has become the preferred payment alternative to cash when measured in terms of transaction volumes. In May 2018, the Bank of Ghana mandated that all mobile money providers connect to GHLink, with full interoperability between mobile money providers and banks introduced in December 2018.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract The financial sector in Ghana has grown rapidly since 2010, and with it the share of Ghanaians with access to formal financial services, which is a measure of financial inclusion. Despite all the challenges in building a more financially inclusive economy, there has been a significant growth in the number of financial access points over the past five years. The government has facilitated interoperability across payment instruments by establishing a mobile money switching solution. But more can be done to leverage innovative digital technology, as is recognized in the government’s national financial inclusion and development strategy (NFIDS). This note provides financial analysis and policy recommendations for the Government of Ghana.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Côte d’Ivoire has the world’s largest cocoa sector, producing over 1.4 million metric tons of raw cocoa per year, accounting for thirty two percent of world production. Harvest payments often arrive late due to the complex logistics of cash-based payments and, it is not uncommon for the amount farmers receive to be somewhat below market value due to high commissions taken by chains of intermediary middlemen. Cognizant of these costs and inefficiencies, many actors in the cocoa value chain are exploring alternatives. One such alternative is paying farmers through Digital financial services (DFS). This research focuses specifically on mobile money accounts and discusses, first, how these have already expanded financial inclusion in Côte d’Ivoire and, secondly, how mobile money could help deliver products to cocoa farmers that meet their needs. The study is a knowledge product of the Partnership for Financial Inclusion, a joint initiative of IFC and The MasterCard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract One day, people will wonder how global trade was even possible with before goods and services were bought and sold in global digital markets without regard or even knowledge of where sellers and buyers where located. We are not there yet --not by a long shot. For now, digital trade remains segmented mostly along national and regional boundaries, due largely to a combination of lack of consumer trust in online transactions and regulatory differences across borders, as well as the inherent challenges of moving goods internationally. Regulation plays a central role in building the foundations of digital markets. It can provide the legal tools necessary for remote contracts, clarify the rights and obligations of the multiple actors involved in digital transactions, and establish a framework that promotes consumer trust in digital markets, even when the consumer does not know the merchant or when the merchant is in a different country. However, regulation can also further segment digital trade, de facto restricting digital transactions to within national boundaries, or allowing for cross-border transactions with some partners to flourish, while limiting others. This can be the intended result of regulatory measures that limit cross-border data flows or online purchases or may be the undesired effect of regulatory differences across countries that leads businesses to offer different goods and services across boundaries.",AreaPolicy and regulation

"Abstract Digital skills constitute one of the five foundational pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) initiative, launched by the World Bank, and are needed to mobilize digital innovations to transform economies, societies and governments in Africa. The other foundational pillars are digital infrastructure, digital platforms, digital financial services and digital entrepreneurship. African economies require both a digitally competent workforce as well as digitally literate citizens who could reap the benefits that the digital society brings. This paper presents a framework for digital skills, based on a review of international frameworks. It discusses the demand and supply of digital skills as well as a mapping with formal education programs at different levels of the system that could produce these skills. It also gives examples of programs outside of formal education programs that could be used for imparting skills training. Finally, it suggests indicators that could be used to better measure progress towards the objectives of the DE4A initiative.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract This paper seeks to examine the motivating factors that propel people to use mobile money in the Greater Accra Region (GAR) of Ghana. The authors posit that the behaviour of a person, in terms of the choice and means of transaction, cannot be explained solely by utility-maximizing assumptions or rationality. Thus, other socio-cultural and psychological factors are crucial in determining whether a person will use mobile money. This study uses a cross-sectional design to obtain primary data on 733 households from the GAR of Ghana to determine the drivers of mobile money use. Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, a logit model and its marginal effects are estimated. Furthermore, parametric and non-parametric statistical tests are used to examine gender effect and mobile money use.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract In Ghana, many traditional credit providers like banks and microfinance institutions are wary of extending credit to small-scale farmers, fearful that they will inherit the risks inherent to farming; with limited access to traditional, formal credit, many farmers must rely on costly, informal loans. Researchers are evaluating the impact of an innovative mobile phone-based digital finance program on loan repayment rates, investment decisions, savings, and use of other financial services, as well as agricultural yields and profits. Researchers are partnering with Farmerline Limited, a social enterprise devoted to assisting the entrepreneurial efforts of small-scale farmers in Ghana, to evaluate the impact of its Mergdata Digital Finance Module. Mergdata is a mobile phone-based digital finance program that facilitates rapid credit rating and loan provision. To request a loan, farmers work with Farmerline purchasing clerks to fill out an application form through the Mergdata mobile application. If they are deemed eligible by Mergdata’s credit scoring algorithm and recommended by the purchasing clerk, they are given a loan in the form of a particular input (the exact input depends on the farmer’s credit score and the crops he or she grows). Loans can take the form of urea, lettuce seeds, or other relevant inputs; the products are delivered to the farmer at home.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Digital financial products like mobile money are becoming ubiquitous in developing countries. Due to low access to financial services and high access to mobile phones, offering of financial services via mobile phones is heralded as an important tool that can revolutionize financial services adoption and usage in developing countries thereby fostering rapid financial inclusion. However, despite becoming rampant in many developing countries, the role of mobile money in revolutionizing formal financial account access and usage has so far been modest.  In this project, we study whether subsidizing cash out fees could stimulate more adoption and usage of mobile services. In other words, we study the responsiveness of usage of mobile money services to changes in price of cash-out fees. To this effect, we use a randomized field experiment where we randomly vary the cost of cash-out charges among some randomly selected clients of a private mobile money service provider in Gambia called Qodoo. We then study how the adoption of the new offer and usage of their mobile money accounts varies across different withdrawal or cash-out fees subsidies.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Developing country lenders are taking advantage of fintech tools to create fully digital loans on mobile phones. Using administrative and survey data, we study the take up and impacts of one of the most popular digital loan products in the world, M-Shwari in Kenya. While 34% of those eligible for a loan take it, the loan does not substitute for other credit. The loans improve household resilience: households are 6.3 percentage points less likely to forego expenses due to negative shocks. We conclude that while digital loans improve financial access and resilience, they are not a panacea for greater credit market failures.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract Payments are central to how governments transfer and receive financial resources; however, the way such payments are made—and how they could be made more effectively—is often not mainstreamed in public financial management (PFM) despite the fact that many of the direct benefits from effective digitalization of payments are identical to those traditionally expected from strong PFM systems. The digitalization of payments does not provide a silver bullet for solving PFM problems; therefore it needs to be approached in an integrated way, with strong leadership from central agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, to exploit the synergies between the many different types of payments facilitated by digital technology. The paper explores the linkages between the digitalization of payments and PFM, including through four case studies.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract M-PESA, a mobile phone–based technology for transferring money, provides a gateway to formal financial services for populations who otherwise would not have access to those services. In a 2014 study, William Jack and Tavneet Suri analyse a panel of 2,282 Kenyan households over the 2008–2010 period to estimate how M-PESA has enabled financial risk sharing. They focus on two types of negative shocks – an overall negative shock and an illness shock – and then analyse how family members and friends share financial resources during these adverse events. A key finding is that M-PESA users, relative to nonusers, are largely able to protect their consumption when faced with negative income shocks. They are more likely to receive remittances in the face of unexpected negative shocks, receiving both a greater number and higher value of remittances. They also receive remittances over greater distances and from wider networks. This replication study uses pure replication, robustness checks and additional model specifications to re-examine this recent work on the impact of transaction costs on the ability of households to share risk using a mobile money innovation, M-PESA",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract With the rise of digital technologies, the use of personal data by private companies is growing rapidly. But how do we know they will use this data responsibly and in consumers’ best interests? In emerging and developing markets, the question is particularly acute because the predominant model rests upon obtaining consumer consent to use their data. Informed consent, however, is unrealistic given the complexity of disclosures and particularly so in countries where there are literacy, language and technological barriers. It’s time for a new approach to digital privacy and protection. To safeguard the interests of billions of consumers, many of whom are coming online for the first time and opening up digital financial services, CGAP has identified three key ways for countries to better protect their citizens, especially the poor. The new approaches would shift the burden of responsibility off the shoulders of consumers and onto the data collectors and users.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract Information frictions can be substantial in rural markets in developing countries and can raise the cost of searching for market information. This includes search frictions associated with learning about goods and services offered by numerous suppliers dispersed along urban-to-rural supply chains. I investigate whether lowering search costs for small firms in rural Tanzania decreases information frictions and changes incentives to engage in relational contracting with suppliers and customers. Using a randomized experiment of 500 small firms, I study the impact of a digital phonebook that lowers the cost of accessing new business and customer networks. Participating firms are split into a control and treatment group with two variations: 1) a phonebook listing that is visible to upstream suppliers in urban areas, and 2) a phonebook listing that is visible to downstream customers in rural areas. I find that treated firms increase relational contracting with their suppliers and decrease it with their customers. Yet, there is no strong evidence that the number of new customers or suppliers increases. It suggests that being listed in the directory caused firms to update their valuation of relational contracts and respond by negotiating better terms with suppliers and customers.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract The question of how retail banks adapt to a changing market place that is driven by disruptive Fintech firms is increasingly becoming important. This is especially critical in East Africa where banks have traditionally had limited presence. This paper examines the impact of digital technologies such as mobile money and mobile banking on retail banks' channel strategy. We introduce a technology and innovation adaptation model for retail banks; consisting of digital channel adoption, changing consumer preference and how these factors influence banks' adaptation strategies and distribution channels. A SEM analysis based on a survey of over 100 bank managers from mainly cross border retail banks in East Africa was carried out. The study results suggests that digitization and consumer preferences have statistically significant impact on retail banks' adaption strategy. Our findings show that, for retail banks to remain competitive and relevant in the new digital marketplace, they must think beyond traditional distribution strategies such as branch banking and embrace new possibilities provided by digitization like digital banking services. While some banks that offer a mixture of traditional and multi-channel models are attractive to the consumers, others that partner with new players such MNOs to offer digital banking stand at a higher competitive edge. The key implication is that digitization is tied to success of retail banks in the new market place.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Although a specialized regulatory window for e-money issuers (EMIs) has been recognized as a key regulatory enabler for inclusive digital financial services, regulation alone is not enough. It needs to be complemented by an efficient and effective supervisory regime to enforce compliance. While there is a solid body of evidence about how to regulate EMIs, much less guidance exists on how to supervise them. The role of supervision is to (i) ensure risks are identified, managed, and mitigated by EMIs; (ii) enforce compliance with regulatory requirements; and (iii) manage EMI crises. Proportional, risk-based supervision helps EMDEs keep e-money markets safe while advancing financial inclusion. EMIs—which could be banks or nonbanks—have, by regulation, a much more limited scope of activities than banks. By posing less risk and being less complex, EMIs warrant a lower level of supervisory attention. A key regulatory provision is fund safeguarding rules that require EMIs to back e-money liabilities with safe and liquid assets. If such fund safeguarding requirements are effectively implemented by EMIs, the risk of clients losing their money is curtailed significantly. Hence, ensuring compliance with fund safeguarding requirements is a key aspect of EMI supervision.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract A strong regulatory framework can provide essential tools for remote transactions and improve trust in digital trade. Yet, regulations can also introduce restrictions that hamper the conditions for digital markets. Based on a database of 20 Middle East and North Africa countries and 20 comparator countries around the world, this paper shows that the Middle East and North Africa region is falling behind in establishing a modern governance framework for the digital economy. The analysis focuses on a set of regulatory areas, including electronic documentation and signature, online consumer protection, data governance, cybersecurity, and intermediary liability regulations. It assesses each country’s domestic regulatory framework in light of recent international trends and regulatory models. The study shows that regulation of digital markets in countries in the region is still in its infancy, being mostly governed by general laws that were not originally intended for the digital era. Some countries have tried to support an export-oriented information technology sector by keeping an updated regulatory framework. However, regulation in most countries in the region, regardless of their level of development, still features some major loopholes that can limit consumer trust in digital markets or reduce certainty—and increase costs—for digital businesses.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract There are signs that despite rapid growth in Internet usage in the region, many gaps remain that must be addressed if the digital economy is to achieve its potential. There are gaps between countries in the region in basic access to the Internet, along with speed and cost. There are also gaps in Internet access within countries, especially in larger countries with remote regions. There are gaps between the day to-day use of the Internet by citizens on the one hand and the use of the Internet by businesses as a tool for growth on the other. There are gaps between traditional models of education and training, and the approach needed in response to ongoing technological change. And there are significant gaps in the policy and regulatory infrastructure required to unlock further growth in the digital economy, especially in building levels of consumer and business trust, within an overall environment of openness and integration between economies in the region. In short, there is great untapped potential for the digital economy to grow further and more rapidly in the region – for the benefit of all its citizens.

"Abstract This is a landscape analysis of trends and research on financial inclusion in Europe and Central Asia. Inclusive financial systems allow people to invest in their education and health, save for retirement, capitalize on business opportunities, and confront shocks. In the Europe and Central Asia region, there is great variation in financial inclusion.  Tajikistan, Armenia, Moldova, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Georgia are among the countries that have seen the greatest increases globally, despite starting from a very low base. These experiences underline the potential role of digital payments in driving financial inclusion. There are many opportunities to increase account ownership. Over 80 percent of the unbanked have a mobile phone, and simply moving public sector pension payments into accounts would reduce the number of unbanked adults in the region by up to 20 million, including 8 million in the Russian Federation alone.

There are multiple ways of addressing these challenges, but a common theme is the need to put citizens at the center of governance and service delivery, through (i) empowerment—putting citizens at center of service provision and incentivizing delivery; (ii) transparency—openness and sharing of information; (iii) accountability—enabling citizens to monitor service levels and quality; and (iv) participation—including citizens in policy design and implementation.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract The paper investigates the impact of ICT (information communication technology) diffusion on the financial inclusion across 16 Indian states during the time period 2007–2008 to 2014–2015. Tele-density, usage of mobile phones and internet connectivity can improve the accessibility, reduce the transaction cost and travel cost of the commercial banking sector. This increases the access of institutional credit, products and services to marginalized unbanked population of society. Inter-state comparison reveals the fact that there are disparities in the spread of ICTdiffusion and financial inclusion across the regions and these disparities are persistent in nature. ICT diffusion index is consistently high in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, whereas low in Assam, Bihar Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. Dynamic panel data analysis exhibits that ICT index has a strong positive significant impact on financial inclusion index. It also illustrates that lack of education, age composition of population, rural-urban location, poor status of financial literacy play a very vital role in spreading financial inclusion. The elderly people in rural as well as in urban areas are still not that familiar with mobile and internet, they may not be able to get benefited by ICT revolution.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract This paper explores economic informality and how it relates to digital financial inclusion. It focuses specifically on the potential role that digital financial services–including those accessed through mobile phones and the internet can play in encouraging businesses to formalize their operations. The data show wide variations in the extent of informality as well as the financial inclusion of informal business owners. The paper finds that digital financial services can make it easier for informal firms to register and operate as a formal business, while also creating synergies between individual reform efforts. For example, companies that use a digital payroll system can easily make pension contributions when online platforms are available. Digital financial transactions also make it easier for governments to enforce laws and regulations, including tax collection. However, there are several important caveats. It is not clear that formalizing small transactions is an effective way to increase tax collection. As the digital economy grows and countries seek to curb informality, policymakers should tailor their programs to the needs and realities of different groups of enterprises.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract We argue financial technology (FinTech) is the key driver for financial inclusion, which in turn underlies sustainable balanced development, as embodied in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. A comprehensive digital financial transformation strategy based on four pillars, including digital ID, open interoperable payment systems, FinTech for G2P programmes, and long- term development of sophisticated financial market infrastructure, is key.",AreaDigital finance Digital

The system led to rural clinics being inspected 104% more often after 6 months, but only 43.8% more often after a year, with the latter estimate not attaining significance at conventional levels. There is also no clear evidence that the increase in inspections led to increases in general staff attendance. In addition, we test whether senior officials act on the information provided by the system. Focusing only on districts where the app is deployed, we find that highlighting poorly performing facilities on a dashboard viewed by supervisors raises doctor attendance by 75%.

"Abstract Weak governance is a critical constraint in delivering quality education in developing countries. A recent review of a decade of education research in India concluded that business as usual expansion in education spending is unlikely to yield improved outcomes without significant improvements in pedagogy and governance of the education system (Muralidharan 2013).  A striking indicator of weak governance in education in India is the high rate of teacher absence, estimated as 26.2% in 2003 and 23.6% in 2010, leading to an estimated fiscal cost of $1.5 billion annually (Muralidharan et. al. 2014). We propose to conduct a randomized evaluation of one of the most ambitious recent attempts by a developing country government to improve education governance at scale.  The Madhya Pradesh (MP) School Quality Assessment Program (MPSQA) â€“ officially called the MP Shaala Gunwatta program â€“ is a comprehensive attempt to improve school governance in the Indian state of MP and has been designed in a partnership between the Government of MP (GoMP), DFID, and Absolute Return for Kids (ARK). The program targets school governance directly through a combination of (a) regular monitoring of schools, (b) creation of school report cards, and a customized school improvement plan, (c) quarterly follow-ups on progress against this plan, and (d) the leveraging of ICT tools to collect and report real-time records of all assessment results, school improvement plans, and follow-ups to a dedicated online system. MPSQA was piloted and refined in a sample of 100 schools in 2013-14 (phase 1), and has been rolled out across 2,000 schools in the  school year (2014-15) (phase 2). The Principal Investigators (PIâ€™s)  have worked with the project implementation team from ARK and GoMP and have successfully randomized the rollout of the program across ~2,000 schools in August 2014, to enable a credible evaluation of the MPSQA program on both school process outcomes and student learning outcomes. The evaluation, with a sample of 534 schools (primary and secondary), will assess the effects of the program on key governance metrics (e.g. teacher absence) as well as student academic outcomes over a period of 18 months.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract This study experimentally compares two different interventions aimed at improving early grade reading in English as First Additional Language (EFAL)  in poor communities in South Africa. Both interventions are designed to improve and strengthen teachers' enactment of the existing government curriculum, and consist of the same three components: (1) detailed lesson plans, (2) integrated learning and teaching support material and (3) instructional coaching and training. The main difference between the two intervention models is in the delivery model of the lesson plans and the coaching support. In Intervention 1, the teachers receive a paper-based version of the lesson plans and benefit from regular on-site coaching. In Intervention 2, the teachers receive a tablet with an electronic version of the lesson plans, including various audio-visual resources and are supported through an ICT coaching model that includes telephone calls and cell phone messaging. The electronic lesson plans are provided on an application which is specifically developed for the study. This application contains additional electronic resources such as short training videos, sound clips of the phonics sounds, songs and rhymes and examples of learners' work.

"Abstract Access to identification is a vital priority. In developing countries, persons with disabilities are among those most likely to face barriers in accessing government services such as health and rehabilitation, public transportation, education, voting, financial services, and economic opportunities. For women and girls with disabilities and other persons with disabilities with intersecting identities, these barriers are multidimensional. Addressing poverty among persons with disabilities and their families requires solutions that address their differentiated and sometimes complex needs, a precondition of which is possessing official proof of identity. This report provides a model of the continuous nature of the ID lifecycle, suggesting some illustrative approaches to designing a disability-inclusive ID process at any stage in the lifecycle. The ID lifecycle comprises five phases, each allowing for disability-inclusive interventions. The five phases are: (1) planning and design; (2) outreach and engagement; (3) enrollment; (4) use of ID; (5) and monitoring and evaluation. The cycle presents examples of continuous activities which should be regularly revisited to ensure that ID systems are accessible to people with disabilities regardless of the stage of implementation of the ID system. While not exhaustive, and recognizing that country contexts differ, this cyclical model can be a useful planning tool, much like that used across the world by electoral commissions for inclusive voter registration.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract Do social networks matter for the adoption of new political communication technologies? We collect complete social network data for sixteen Ugandan villages where an innovative reporting mobile platform was recently introduced, and show robust evidence of peer effects on technology adoption. However, peer effects were not observed in all networks. We develop a formal model showing that while peer effects facilitate adoption of technologies with minimal externalities (like agricultural practices), it can be more difficult for innovations with significant positive externalities to spread through a network. Early adopters might exaggerate benefits, leading others to discount information about the technology’s value. Thus, peer effects are likely to emerge only where informal institutions support truthful communication. We show that the observable implications of our model are borne out in the data. These impediments to social diffusion might help explain the slow and varied uptake of new political communication technologies around the world.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract Since its adoption in December 2015 by the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21), within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 175 countries to date have ratified the Paris Agreement. These countries have made commitments Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in some cases contingent on financing by developed countries, to limit or reduce their Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a variety of measures including more significant deployment of renewable power, energy efficiency, land-use controls such as conservation of forests and grasslands, carbon pricing, and other measures compatible with each country’s national circumstances and capabilities. Even with full ratification of the Agreement by all 197 signatories, the aggregate effect is projected only to slow the rate of GHG emissions growth from the 24 percent increase, between 1990 and 2010, to an anticipated increase between 2010 and 2030 of between 11 and 23 percent. To foster higher ambition and sustainable development, and also encourage large-scale financing towards the most effective mitigation measures, Article 6 of the Agreement recognizes that countries may engage in cooperative approaches, including the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) towards their individual NDC.

"Abstract In recent decades, the growth of information and communications technologies (ICT) and the move toward the digitalization of trade and global value chains has been radically transforming the global trade scene, with important implications for women engaged in trade. In order to identify adequate measures to reduce gender disparities, this paper reviews and discusses evidence from the existing literature, as well as presents evidence from several new empirical analyses. It also introduces two new frameworks to analyze the gender dimensions of e-commerce. Digital technologies have the potential to empower women socially and economically by creating new employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, removing trade barriers for women, enhancing access to finance and information and optimizing their business processes. For example, e-commerce substantially lowers the barriers to entry for micro-, small- and medium sized enterprises by reducing the investment needed to launch and run a business. Digital solutions that remove the need for face-to-face interactions when trading can help reduce the difficulties women business owners face, such as mobility constraints, discrimination, and in some countries even violence. As workers, digital technologies may help women overcome time and mobility constraints by connecting women to work from different locations and in flexible hours through emails, instant messaging and tele-conferences. It will also benefit women as consumers by saving time, providing access to information, reducing transaction costs, or giving them more control over the purchasing process. Yet, technology is not the silver bullet in resolving all the gender gaps in trade. This is because women’s access and use of ICTs and digital technologies tend to lag in contrast to men. The benefits of digital technologies hinges on well-designed and specifically targeted policies.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

However, the link between ICT and broader social welfare such as women empowerment is still not explicit, especially with sparse empirical evidence on their relationship. In this context, we first examine the possible mechanism and channels under which ICT

Then we use two-year panel dataset, collected from farm household in poor rural China during 2015-2018, to regress the women empowerment indicator and ICT adoption in addition to a set of control variables, gaining a fixed effects estimator to evaluate possible effect of ICT application on
women empowerment. For possible endogeneity, we further identify an instrument to solve the issue. Although ICT has the potentials of changing women in all aspects, the empirical results from our sample haven’t shown significant effect of ICT on women empowerment, which implies that it may be a challenge for women to transform technologies into income generating activities, and economic earnings don’t necessarily change the gender relation in a household for a short term.

"Abstract Proof of identity is vital in modern society. Individuals need identity documents to participate in many aspects of civil, political, and economic life. These include obtaining a job in the formal sector, opening a bank account, borrowing from a financial institution, and owning a property or a business in addition to traveling, voting, and gaining access to health and social welfare services. For women and girls, legal identity is a stepping stone to empowerment, agency, and freedom of movement. Hence, it is a vital enabler of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. However, many women and girls do not have access to legal identity. Globally, it is estimated that 1 billion people are unable to prove their identity, and millions more have forms of identification that cannot be reliably verified or authenticated (World Bank 2015).

"Abstract In recent decades, the growth of information and communications technologies (ICT) and the move toward the digitalization of trade and global value chains has been radically transforming the global trade scene, with important implications for women engaged in trade. In order to identify adequate measures to reduce gender disparities, this paper reviews and discusses evidence from the existing literature, as well as presents evidence from several new empirical analyses. It also introduces two new frameworks to analyze the gender dimensions of e-commerce. Digital technologies have the potential to empower women socially and economically by creating new employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, removing trade barriers for women, enhancing access to finance and information and optimizing their business processes. For example, e-commerce substantially lowers the barriers to entry for micro-, small- and medium sized enterprises by reducing the investment needed to launch and run a business. Digital solutions that remove the need for face-to-face interactions when trading can help reduce the difficulties women business owners face, such as mobility constraints, discrimination, and in some countries even violence. As workers, digital technologies may help women overcome time and mobility constraints by connecting women to work from different locations and in flexible hours through emails, instant messaging and tele-conferences. It will also benefit women as consumers by saving time, providing access to information, reducing transaction costs, or giving them more control over the purchasing process. Yet, technology is not the silver bullet in resolving all the gender gaps in trade. This is because women’s access and use of ICTs and digital technologies tend to lag in contrast to men. The benefits of digital technologies hinges on well-designed and specifically targeted policies.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract An evolving API strategy helps digital financial services (DFS) providers get started with opening APIs without overinvesting before returns can be demonstrated. A clear API strategy will assist a DFS provider to cultivate an API ecosystem, in which third parties are building new products and services that reach low income customers as well as new markets. Understanding the API maturity model can help a DFS provider move from one-off integrations to an iterative process of building open APIs, in which continual learning informs an API strategy that generates new revenue opportunities and helps third parties to develop products that bring more people into the financial system. This Technical Note helps DFS internal stakeholders understand how to evolve an API strategy along the API maturity model spectrum, where increased investment in open APIs is matched with benefits returned to the business overall, and to API ecosystem partners.",AreaPolicy and regulation

"Abstract In many aid projects, monitoring and evaluation is a static exercise driven by donor reporting requirements. After project closure, there are seldom sustainable benefits of the monitoring and evaluation system. This paper examines how monitoring and evaluation can be transformed into a dynamic tool for effective project management, with benefits carrying over beyond the typical project lifecycle. The paper assesses an innovative, digital management information system developed under the Women Entrepreneurship Development Project, a Government of Ethiopia initiative financed by a World Bank International Development Association loan and grant funding from Global Affairs Canada. The paper examines the context of the development of the management information system, its effectiveness, and its potential for sustainability. Ethiopia is among the poorest countries in the world, and government administration units involved in administering projects often face funding and resource shortfalls. The paper demonstrates how effective and sustainable monitoring and evaluation systems can be developed even in challenging contexts such as these, by focusing on simple technical solutions that can be maintained and refined locally, ensuring low development and maintenance costs compatible with government monitoring and evaluation budgets, and linking project-level monitoring and evaluation to broader government operations.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract This report covers the use of digital technologies for programmes and for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in FCAS. It shows how digital technologies have a wide range of potential uses in both peacebuilding programmes and in the reconstruction of post-conflict states. These uses should be informed by key principles such as DFID’s endorsement of the Principles for Digital Development, a commitment to understanding the digital context and a consideration of the privacy and security of the data of people caught up in conflict. However, a review of the literature shows that there is little best practice yet for evaluating the effect of technology tools on peacebuilding. In terms of M&E, the literature consistently highlights the problems caused by lack of data in FCAS but there are also significant challenges in collecting and storing data in line with the goals of the Responsible Data movement. There are significant risks posed by humanitarian and development actors using data-intensive approaches without due consideration of the risks to beneficiaries that these approaches might involve. The sheer amount of data being collected on beneficiaries of humanitarian assistance has led to what has been described as a ‘dataholic’ environment in the sector: with an urgent need to increase understanding of how these data-intensive systems and the use of technology is affecting individuals and communities.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Industrial activity creates jobs, catalyzes investments and innovation, and raises standards of living in many countries. As climate change, and natural disasters intensify, so too does the risk environment for industry activity. More recently, a viral pandemic has threatened industries and national economies, and the imperative to secure business continuity and competitiveness during growing instability has thrust resilience into the spotlight. The suite of risks posed by climate change and natural disasters threatens industry’s potential to grow, generate jobs, and compete. For many developing countries, disaster-related liabilities may exceed the capacity of governments to respond, and even national economies may be threatened. The emergence of industry resilience as a global discourse is timely; however, industry resilience is a nascent discipline, and frameworks for its application and operation remain limited even as threats intensify. Disasters offer the opportunity, with the right frameworks in place, to strengthen competitiveness through build back, better initiatives, and to adapt to long-term climate change and disaster risks. Despite these insights, and the urgency to act, however, the evidential basis for policy intervention and conceptual frameworks for industry resilience are far from definitive, and gaps in knowledge remain. As a result, industry resilience policy and action remain low in both the public and private sectors, and firms and economies still face significant costs of inaction.",AreaDigital information services

In first drawing attention to the limitations of quantitative data for representing injustice and the problematic effects of conventional framed photographs of informality from aerial and ground-level perspectives, this paper explores the possibilities of ground-level 360° imagery as a realist, non-reductionist form of representation for informal settlements. Three 360° street views were produced to illustrate key possibilities and limitations for advancing recognition, based on the notion that visibility is essential for recognition. Further, the piece reflexively critiques how – through new advancements in image analytics – informal settlement visibility projects risk further engendering injustices of misrecognition for these highly marginalized urban spaces.",AreaData systems and

Addressing these threats is, therefore, of paramount importance for developing countries, not only because SMEs are seen as the vehicle for employment and job creation, but because research on SMEs and cybersecurity in this context is limited. This study is a contribution toward addressing this gap. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to explore SME cybersecurity practices and the challenges they face in developing countries. The goal is to sensitize practitioners and government institutions about the challenges and practices faced by SMEs, so that the various parties can work collaboratively in providing context-specific solutions to address these challenges and improve current cybersecurity practices.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The increasing availability of low-cost mobile phones and mobile Internet access in emerging markets has led to widespread use of social media platforms, making them an important source of news and place for social and political activity. This trend has brought many new users online including those with limited exposure to technology. Concurrently, we have also observed an increasing trend in the spread of misinformation on such platforms. The spread of misinformation can create and exacerbate polarization, while also affecting the beliefs and actions of users without a prior ideological leaning. We carry out a household level survey which provides unique first-hand evidence on the trends in social media use, sharing of news, and spread of misinformation among low and middle-income users in Pakistan. Using a list of actual news stories circulated on social media we create a test to measure the extent to which users are likely to believe and share misinformation. We evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions for countering misinformation in a randomized control setting. Our first intervention educates users about common features of misinformation through a video, while our second intervention in addition to the video provides specific feedback to users about their own past behaviour in engaging with misinformation. We measure the effectiveness of our interventions on future behaviour of participants in believing and sharing misinformation.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract This rapid review examines evidence on how the Iraqi government can simplify or provide temporary civil documentation to IDPs in protracted displacement. Conflict and violence are the main triggers of internal displacement; therefore, information is provided on such countries with protracted displacement. Practical solutions used effectively by them is also included. If national governments are unable or unwilling to meet their responsibilities, the international community has a role to play in promoting and reinforcing efforts to ensure protection, assistance and solutions for IDPs. Therefore, most of the literature available is focused towards the needs of the IDPs, as well as the assistance provided by these agencies, e.g. the United Nations (UN). Evidence is mainly for both refugees and IDPs - in some cases the terms are used inter-changeably. In order to simplify the documentation process, advances in digital technology are resulting in new approaches, e.g. introduction of centrally-based identity systems by governments around the world. As this review is focusing on Iraq, the government could also accept testimonies of mukhtars (local mayors), recommending citizens and affirming their place of residence, as an acceptable official document as a temporary solution to security clearance. This could prevent potential problems due to movement from place of origin. Multi-country evidence proves that updating policies with inclusivity is a necessary but complex and longer-term process disability and gender-based discrimination in existing Iraqi laws and practices regarding civil registration, as well as the provision of nationality legal documentation, need to be addressed. However, no evidence was found to see if this is currently the case.

"Abstract In recent years, a large number of countries have implemented policy changes to advance financial inclusion, especially by using digital financial services (DFS). However, results are mixed. While some countries are achieving impressive inclusion gains, others continue to fall short of expectations. How to properly diagnose the country-specific root causes of this shortfall and prioritize needed actions is a pressing question for policymakers in charge of designing and implementing financial inclusion strategies. Building on the Growth Diagnostic work by Hausmann and others, this paper provides an analytical framework (a decision tree) to identify country-specific constraints blocking progress with financial inclusion; that is, binding constraints. Using a deductive top down approach and dividing constraints between supply and demand factors, the tree analyzes various potential causes (branches in the tree). To identify the most relevant constraints, the methodology calls for analysis of the markets for financial services (particularly DFS) using observed (or shadow) prices and quantities. For its benchmarking approach, it proposes a wide-ranging set of indicators, including aggregate and micro-level statistics as well as survey data to reflect providers’ and consumers’ perceptions. For ease of exposition and illustrative purposes, the discussion of the tree uses many country examples. Recognizing constraints differ by financial service, trees are presented for payments and transfers, store of value, and credit services.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Agriculture remains the dominant sector for rural areas in developing countries.  However, short-term shocks (e.g. conflict, economic crisis) and long-term trends (e.g. climate change) hamper and can even reverse attempted gains in agricultural productivity and related rural development outcomes.  Influenced by the current sustainable development paradigm, it is increasingly acknowledged that, to address this, rural households and communities must strengthen their resilience. Given their growing role in rural livelihoods, information and communication technologies (ICTs) will be a key part of resilience-building.  Yet we currently know very little about this.  To address this knowledge gap, a systematic literature review was undertaken to establish two things.

"Abstract The spread of COVID-19 and implementation of ""social distancing"" policies around the world have raised the question of how many jobs can be done at home. This paper uses skills surveys from 53 countries at varying levels of economic development to estimate jobs' amenability to working from home. The paper considers jobs' characteristics and uses internet access at home as an important determinant of working from home. The findings indicate that the amenability of jobs to working from home increases with the level of economic development of the country. This is driven by jobs in poor countries being more intensive in physical/manual tasks, using less information and communications technology, and having poorer internet connectivity at home. Women, college graduates, and salaried and formal workers have jobs that are more amenable to working from home than the average worker. The opposite holds for workers in hotels and restaurants, construction, agriculture, and commerce. The paper finds that the crisis may exacerbate inequities between and within countries. It also finds that occupations explain less than half of the variability in the working-from-home indexes within countries, which highlights the importance of using individual-level data to assess jobs’ amenability to working from home.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

"Abstract How does data visibility affect vulnerable communities that face uncertainty over occupational rights? Or in other words, can data justice be realized in settings of acute resource injustice? These are the overarching questions that our case study interrogates by opening up the black box of the community in the volatile and fast-transforming context of occupation rights on the peri-urban frontier. We examine the unfolding of data and information processes through the lens of enumeration and community mapping exercises conducted in a low-income neighbourhood or basti located in the fast-transforming peri-urban fringe of Hyderabad, India. We argue that the realization of data justice is mediated by ‘information politics’, i.e., the ways in which informational resources, as well as the risks and rewards associated with them, are distributed across individual actors and identity groups within the community. In so doing, our case study underlines the importance of a structural understanding of data justice and also suggests directions for embedding justice in data processes.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) over a 3-year process of global, open, and inclusive consultations with stakeholders, the framework is intended to help governments and other stakeholders to assess their national internet environments and develop appropriate policy approaches and improvements. The framework is not intended either to provide a basis for scoring national performance or to make comparisons between countries. UNESCO points out that digital information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer opportunities for access to information, freedom of expression, human connectivity, technological innovations, and multistakeholder engagement. However, ICTs pose challenges, especially with regard to free expression, privacy, online disinformation, the safety of journalists, transparency, accountability, deepening inequalities, and gender and other divides.",AreaDigital information services

A total of 207 school teachers and 276 students from 53 schools taking part in an ICT project in Palestine responded to a questionnaire survey. Results indicated that students in Palestinian public schools perceived ICT to have a moderate influence on their learning. Students indicated that they face frequent challenges such as: lesson duration, access to modern devices and issues with information research skills. These results contrasted with school teachers’ views, which reflected a much stronger impression of the influence of ICT on teaching.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract Reforming inefficient and inequitable energy subsidies continues to be an important priority for policymakers as does instituting “green taxes” to reduce carbon emissions. Simply increasing energy prices will have adverse impact on poorer consumers, who may spend substantial budget shares on energy and energy-intensive products even though the rich typically appropriate more of the price subsidy. Equitable pricing reforms therefore need to be accompanied by programs to transfer compensation: depending on the situation, this can be targeted or universal. Successful reforms require measures to raise awareness-of the subsidies and the problems they cause, effective dissemination of the reform to the population, and rapid feedback loops to facilitate mid-course corrections. Digital technology, including for unique identification and payments, as well as general communications, can help build government capacity to undertake such reforms and respond to changes in fuel markets. The paper outlines the use of digital technology, drawing on four country cases. The technology is only a mechanism; it does not, in itself, create the political drive and constituency to push reform forward. However, it can be employed in a number of ways to increase the prospects for successful and sustainable reform.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Platform work, also known as gig work, is a fast-growing trend, estimated to involve up to 40 million workers in the global South. Celebrated in some quarters, growth of the gig economy has also been a cause for concern about the nature of jobs being created. Yet, while it is the focus for a growing body of research, there has been a lack of systematic frameworks to evaluate this type of labour against decent work standards. This paper reports on the development of such a framework, based on five principles of fair pay, conditions, contracts, management and representation. Following its development, the framework was applied via worker interviews to 11 digital labour platforms in South Africa covering ride-hailing, delivery, domestic and digital work. It finds positive evidence around pay, safety interventions, communication and worker interaction for some workers and platforms. But the framework also exposes workers paid less than minimum wage and working very long hours, incorrect employment classification, and absence of collective representation.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract The increasing awareness and growing emphasis on making ""Education for all"" a realizable dream has made the classrooms of twentieth century necessarily inclusive in nature where an attempt is made to teach the children with different abilities and varied cultural, economic and family backgrounds under the same roof and with equal access to facilities and opportunities. To address to such diversity in an equitable manner, technology is undisputedly playing a significant role. It is making the teachers equipped to handle day to day classroom situations in a better way through ICT tools and devices that have built and provided platforms to remove barriers (physical, technical, cultural, psychological etc.) to facilitate complete development of children. With technological advancements and increasing use of various digital resources, the various aspects of education such as teaching, learning, evaluation and feedback becomes far easier and quicker as compared to the traditional approaches. With the advent of specialized tools for the disabled or children with special needs as well as a wide range of apps and softwares, the services reach uninterruptedly to various strata of the society with ease. The current paper reflects on the integration of various technological tools and approaches in our classrooms for a more inclusive environment so that a teacher can cater to individual educational needs of children. The potential of ICT in providing access for all learners including the ones with special needs and ability to access the general education curriculum is being discussed in this paper. The objective of the paper is to make the teachers aware about how amalgamation of ICT can be done in classroom learning for better addressing of the problems of the students for them to overcome their inabilities.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract Job search costs are high in rural labor markets in developing countries. Consequently, the flow of information on jobs and wages is limited, and wages tend to be dispersed. To lower search costs, I develop an SMS-based messaging app that connects agricultural workers and employers. The treatment reduces within-village wage dispersion by 16-40 percent. Wage compression occurs from both sides of the wage distribution, leaving the average wage unchanged. Consistent with reduced wage dispersion, I find evidence that labor is reallocated within villages. Dispersion in per-acre labor input across farms decreases. Workers divert job applications from lower-paying

"Abstract Due to the limited penetration of bank branches across rural India, access to formal financial services has been a pipe dream for millions of rural poor for decades. In 2013-2014, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and German agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) jointly implemented a proof of concept entitled self help group (SHG) members as Business Correspondent (BC) Agents under the rural financial institutions programme (RFIP) and successfully demonstrated that SHG members as banking agents or customer service points (CSPs) could deliver last mile banking services to the rural community in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. It was in this context, that the Bank Sakhi (female banker friend) model - a gender focused variant of the traditional BC model, was adapted by National rural livelihood missions (NRLM) and piloted in seven states .

"Abstract Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has grown and developed over the years, impacting so greatly on new or modern businesses. This has really become a broad subject area expanding into the growth and applications of e-commerce, potential of e-business, e-market places, e-customer relationship management, and the rise of online customer feedback, automation of business functions such as
electronic payments/money transfers, high density data transfer and the impact on postal service. The adoption of these technologies in many countries by different sectors of the economy have been found to have direct positive impact on the organization’s efficiency and have led to more rapid acceleration of development in these countries. In Nigeria, however, preliminary investigations show that only a few
organizations in the economy have adopted the ICT, but there has not been formal study to determine the level of adoption and impact on the efficiency of the organizations and the consequent effect on the
nation's economy. This study, is therefore, designed to determine the level of adoption in the Nigerian organizations, and the impact on the nation’s economy. The research adopts quantitative (hypothetic

The results of the quantitative analysis were discussed and interpreted in relation to the key issues of the research. The outcome of the work recognises the strategic role of ICT in national development, trade, competitiveness and employment. It further appreciates that the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has come to play a critical role in the sustainable growth and development of the Nigerian economy by revealing that in Nigeria today, the ICT sector is a major pillar of the economy in terms of its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

"Abstract Ten years ago, only 6 percent of the population in low-income and lower-middle-income countries had access to the internet. Today, nearly one in every three people there does. The rapid expansion of internet access across the globe is a welcome development, but it raises new policy challenges. And while there is broad agreement in the development community on the importance of getting digital policy “right,” too little attention has been paid to how policymakers in the developing world can best engage with the companies who dominate
the digital landscape. As governments reassess their relationship with these companies, an increasing number are enacting policies that raise barriers to the cross-border flow of data and put the largely global and open nature of the internet at risk. In this paper, we review
how internet use has evolved in the developing world over the last decade, with a focus on initiatives by big tech companies to reach the “Next Billion Users.” We then examine how concerns about data privacy, disinformation, and market concentration have manifested

"Abstract The growing use of digital technologies, including mobile connectivity and the internet, offers new opportunities to institute a range of scalable feedback mechanisms that are far speedier, and probably less costly, than traditional approaches. Rapid, more granular, feedback can help in the early design phases as well as in the reform of legacy systems where major redesign may be costly. Bottlenecks can be alleviated and accountability improved, often without the need to fully replace the system.

"Abstract Despite a rapidly growing enthusiasm around applications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to smallholder agriculture in developing countries, there are still many questions on the effectiveness of ICT-based approaches. This study assesses the effects of videomediated agricultural extension service provision on farmers’ knowledge and adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices in Ethiopia. The study focuses on a program piloted by the Government of Ethiopia and Digital Green and poses three questions. First, to what extent does video-mediated extension lead to increased uptake of improved agricultural technologies and practices by smallholder farmers? Second, is video-mediated extension targeted at both spouses of the household more effective than when only targeted at the (typically male) household head? Third, how cost-effective is a video-mediated approach to extension provision? The study explores these questions with a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the video-mediated approach as applied to three priority crops (teff, wheat, maize) and three technologies (row planting, precise seeding rates, and urea dressing). The trial was implemented in 347 kebeles (village clusters) during the 2017 meher (rainy) season in Ethiopia’s four most agriculturally important regional states. Analysis of data from our surveys of 2,422 households and 896 extension agents indicates that the video-mediated approach is more effective than the conventional approach in achieving several key outcomes. Specifically, we find that videomediated extension reaches a wider audience than the conventional approach and leads to higher levels of agricultural knowledge and uptake of technologies in those kebeles randomly assigned to the program. While our results do point to greater participation and greater knowledge of female spouses in kebeles where both male and female spouses were targeted by the program, we do not find clear evidence that the more inclusive approach translated into higher uptake of the subject technologies and practices. Finally, we find that the video-mediated approach becomes less costly as the scale of operation increases.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract This paper tells the story of how the United Nations Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P) team in Uganda worked with exporter Kyagalanyi Coffee Limited (KCL) to digitize one of the country’s most important cash crops: coffee. In addition to addressing the complex dynamics of digitizing agricultural value chains, the paper illustrates how seven organizations from different sectors embarked on a three-year journey to digitize Uganda’s coffee value chain. The solutions they built and lessons they learned have fueled the digitization of several other agricultural value chains in Uganda—particularly, tea, dairy, and maize. Their work helped to build a foundation that enables greater financial inclusion of smallholder farmers by increasing financial participation of farmers, traders, off-takers, and exporters in the formal economy.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Eko India is a fintech company founded by brothers Abhishek and Abhinav Sinha in 2007. Its core business model uses agents to offer customers, who pay cash over the counter and remittance services provided by banks and other services providers. Its target customers are low- and moderate-income earners in urban areas. Intrigued by the Eko story, we met with Eko leadership to take a closer look at how Eko leveraged open APIs as a key part of its business transformation to connect its platform with over 300 third-party businesses. Connecting with these third parties allowed Eko to scale its distribution reach from 15,000 to 150,000 agents within three years and expand its coverage to every state in India. Currently, more than 11 percent of its agents are in rural India.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Elevating the collective voice of digital financial services (DFS) consumers can give them more say and more power in the financial sector. Through a stronger consumer voice, regulators will gain a better understanding of the risks facing consumers and adapt regulations accordingly, thus making financial services more responsible. Through its research, CGAP identified three opportunities to elevate the consumer voice that deserve support: consumer groups and  associations; regulatory consultative bodies; and technologies that elevate the consumer voice. This paper explores the potential impact of incorporating the collective voice of consumers into financial sector policy and regulation, and opportunities for funders to help elevate these voices.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract Fintech companies combine technology with access to data to deliver new financial services and experiences to customers. They have been proliferating in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), and some are creating solutions specifically for underserved, low-income, or remote customers. Yet for all the general excitement that fintechs have generated in the global development community, there is little information available about how specific fintech innovations solve pain points in financial inclusion. In 2016, CGAP launched a program to understand fintech innovations and draw clear links to financial inclusion, where they existed. We supported pilots with 18 fintechs in Africa and South Asia that targeted financial services to low-income or underserved customers. Our goal was to explain innovations in a detailed way and generate insight on whether the services (i) work as stated, (ii) create value for underserved customers, and (iii) ease age-old pain points in delivering financial services to underserved customers. This paper is written for funders—whether donors, investors, development finance institutions, or philanthropic organizations—who engage with fintechs to advance financial inclusion. Based on CGAP’s work, it identifies five types of fintech innovation that offer potential for financial inclusion. We also highlight challenges that these fintechs, particularly those in early stages, face that inhibit their ability to impact financial inclusion.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The expansion of digital financial accounts among poor customers has raised the question of whether e-money should be covered by deposit insurance and if so, how. This Technical Note examines the options while arguing that deposit insurance should not be the first line of defense, for two primary reasons. In many emerging markets where authorities have limited resources, their first area of focus should be on strong prudential regulation and supervision to ensure safe and sound institutions. Second, electronic money issuers are engaged in a narrow set of activities and in most cases pose limited or no systemic risk, compared with financial institutions that intermediate deposits and issue credit.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract This case study explores the nexus of youth, technology, and agriculture, highlighting insights from a meta-analysis of efforts around the world — and particularly in U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) countries — to engage youth in agriculture through ICTs. It begins with an analysis of the challenges hindering youth involvement in agriculture. These include:
-Family and community pressures
-Lack of perceived profitability
-Access to land
-Access to finance
-Access to education, technical training, and resources.
The case study continues with an analysis of potential opportunities to improve engagement with youth in agriculture, including:
-Shifting the perception of farming within rural
families and communities
-Exposing youth to agriculture early on,
incorporating all aspects of the value chain
(rather than just farming)
-Increasing the profitability and productivity of
farming, and
-Introducing agriculture problems to youth to
resolve them.
Several examples are included to illustrate how organizations and projects within GFSS countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia use ICTs to engage youth in rural communities and inspire them to consider agriculture and related careers. Examples discussed in depth include Agrijoven and Rana Labs (Guatemala), CocoaLink (Ghana), and ICT for Agri (Nepal). The case study concludes with recommendations for USAID staff, implementing partners, and other organizations that wish to better engage youth in their agricultural programming through ICTs.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity

"Abstract A key regulatory enabler for building inclusive digital financial services is creating a special licensing window for electronic money issuers (EMIs). Because EMIs have a lower risk profile than banks, they require less regulatory oversight. A special licensing category that recognizes that their role is to store customer funds converted into e-money held in basic transaction accounts, not to extend credit based on such funds, can open the DFS market to new providers. While many countries have created nonbank e-money licenses to cater for this business, at least three countries have introduced a special banking licensing category – the payments bank license. This technical note analyzes the country context in which the payments banks licenses were crafted, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the EMI license versus the payments bank license.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract The emergence of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) solar has been one of the most exciting trends in energy access over the past several years. It is a scalable model for distributed energy that could reach millions of off-grid households. At its core, PAYGo solar is an affordability solution that connects loan repayment to energy use. Over 2.5 million households have acquired solar through PAYGo companies, but the sector needs more capital in the form of receivables financing to continue growing (Dalberg Advisors and Lighting Global 2018). PAYGo solar is not an average opportunity. Distributed solar is becoming a viable energy option. Customers that have never seen the inside of a bank are being approved for loans they desperately need. But this sector is too young and too strange to unnecessarily risk financial disruptions. Customers need this to work, and for it to work, there must be safeguards.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract One billion young people in low-income countries are navigating their transition into adulthood and engaging in various forms of education and employment along the way. Financial services can play an important role on this path, but they alone cannot deliver positive outcomes for youth.

According to the report, ICT has started to play an increasing role in Kosovo’s economic growth. As stated in the Kosovo IT Strategy, the ICT sector in Kosovo, despite its still relatively limited but growing share in overall economic output, is one of the most developed and most promising sectors for generating economic growth. Given its potential, the Government of Kosovo has recognized and listed the ICT sector among the six top priority sectors that contribute to economic development. The sector offer high promise for generating new jobs for young male and female entrepreneurs, as well as for increasing the overall level of the country’s exports. As such, the ICT sector, including the full range of electronic communications and information society services, is poised for immense growth and is likely to become one of the most important service sectors in Kosovo’s economy.",AreaDigital finance Digital

While Vietnam is not as far along in that transformation as other countries in the region, its internal market of nearly 100 million people, the second-highest mobile telecommunication penetration in Southeast Asia, and its technically capable workforce give it a strong base from which to work. The COVID-19 pandemic is serving as a crucible for Vietnam’s digital economy.

"Abstract In Senegal, the majority of farmers do not have a system to monitor their crop production activities. Generally, producers do not have the tools to effectively manage their inputs, monitor and evaluate their own performance, learn from their experience, and strengthen their credibility with value chain support organizations such as financial institutions and technical partners.  Agricultural support is typically provided through state-run extension services, and technical agencies that control data collection and analysis. In this context, producers depend on others to access the data required for planning and carrying out their activities effectively. In the cereals sector, only a few
producer networks working with industrial scale manufacturers in the Senegal River Valley documented, in a limited manner, their operations relating to credit, input supply, marketing, and follow-up on membership. The development of easy-to-use information technologies, the accessibility to computer equipment, the improvement in connectivity in rural areas, and the exposure of producers to these technologies have ushered in a wider use of decentralized information management at the producer level. However, even with this new digital landscape, the solutions typically

"Abstract Education of poor and disadvantaged populations has been a long-standing challenge for education systems in both developed and developing countries. In China, millions of students in rural areas and migrant communities lag far behind their urban counterparts in terms of academic achievement. When they fall behind, they often have no way to catch up. Many of their parents have neither the skills nor the money to provide remedial tutoring; rural teachers often do not have time to give students the individual attention they need. Given this, there is growing interest by both educators and policymakers in helping underperforming students catch up using computer assisted learning (CAL). While CAL interventions have been shown to be effective internationally and elsewhere in China, traditional software-based CAL programs are difficult and costly to implement. An online version of CAL (OCAL), however, may be able to bypass many of offline CAL’s implementation problems and enhance the remedial tutoring experience.

The world was rapidly shifting to mobile, with China and India claiming a large part of the four billion subscribers. The Grameen Village phone project was exploring the reaches of mobile for development (M4D). In 2018, the majority of people in the world own phones, and about half are online, with gaps in access for women, for users of certain languages, and by region. Mobile and social media are now central to digital development, with Facebook being accessed by two billion users with a billion logged on daily. Millions of users go online without having an email address, using WhatsApp ""for everything from media sharing and church groups, to informal enterprise and civil disobedience.""",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract This article explores the potential roles as well as pitfalls and challenges of so-called Big Data in shaping the future of vaccinology, moving toward a tailored and personalised vaccine design and administration. It describes conventional vaccinology, born in 1796, as ""vaccinology 1.0"". Examples of ""second generation"" vaccines include vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, anthrax, pneumonia, influenza, hepatitis B, and Lyme disease. The shift then to ""vaccinology 3.0"" has been possible thanks to Big Data, characterised by high volume, velocity, and variety of data.

"Abstract These guidelines are intended to strengthen national health information systems (HIS), by providing a tool to guide decisions on security, privacy, and confidentiality of personal health information collected and managed using mobile devices. mHealth technology comprises many layers that can affect data security, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the data life cycle. These layers include national and organizational policy; technology used in data collection, management, storage, and use; as well as user behavior. Each layer requires careful analysis to identify and protect potential vulnerabilities. The sensitivity of health data requires that the developers of mobile apps for health should build systems that have a secure back-end database; keep minimal or no personal health information data on the device; and ensure that the hardware, software, and communication channels between the device and other systems are secure. These guidelines are meant to help mHealth program managers and ministry of health officials systematically address mHealth data privacy and security issues. For each of the layers of technology, these guidelines explore common vulnerabilities and propose ways to proactively address them to reduce possibilities of data breaches. The guidelines also address overarching topics, such as national data leadership and governance, user behavior, and training. Other topics are technology-specific, such as mobile devices (hardware), operating systems, applications, networks, and data storage.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that

While there are a growing number of examples demonstrating the performance of digital phenotyping tools using social media data, little is known about their capacity to support the delivery of targeted and personalised behaviour change interventions to improve health. Similar tools are already used in marketing and politics, using individual profiling to manipulate purchasing and voting behaviours.

"Abstract Much remains to ensure that digital health  affirms rather than retrenches inequality, including for gender. Drawing from literature and from the SEARCH projects in this supplement, this commentary highlights key gender dynamics in digital health, including blind spots and biases, as well as transformative opportunities and responsibilities. Women face structural and social barriers that inhibit their participation in digital health, but are also frequently positioned as beneficiaries without opportunities to shape such projects to better fit their needs. Furthermore, overlooking gender relations and focussing on women in isolation can reinforce, rather than address, women’s exclusions in digital health, and worsen negative unanticipated consequences. While digital health provides opportunities to transform gender relations, gender is an intimate and deeply structural form of social inequality that rarely changes due to a single initiative or short-term project. Sustained support over time, across health system stakeholders and levels is required to ensure that transformative change with one set of actors is replicated and reinforced
elsewhere in the health system. There is no one size prescriptive formula or checklist. Incremental learning and reflection is required to nurture ownership and respond to unanticipated reactions over time when transforming gender and its multiple intersections with inequality.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract A robust data governance regulatory environment, encompassing both safeguards that protect the rights of market players and enablers that facilitate use/reuse of data, provide an important foundation for trust in the data economy. This paper presents the methodology and findings from a Global Data Regulation Diagnostic. The Global Data Regulation diagnostic is a detailed assessment of laws and regulations on data governance, covering both safeguards and enablers for data governance across 80 countries ranging from low to high income groups. Diagnostic results show that countries have put in greater effort in adopting enabling regulations than regulatory safeguards. However, the development of both enablers and safeguards remains at an intermediate stage: only 41 percent of good practices for safeguards and 47 percent for enablers have been adopted across countries. The diagnostic identifies gaps in the regulatory framework across several important dimensions including safeguards for personal and nonpersonal data, cross-border data flows and cybersecurity, as well as enablers for public and private intent data, as well as e-commerce. While higher income countries are typically more advanced than their lower income counterparts, significant gaps nonetheless remain in the regulatory framework for data across all income groups.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has upended lives and brought major disruption to economic activity across the world, precipitating an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. One of the key lessons learned early in the pandemic was the need to ensure business continuity of the critical supply lines, notably the maritime gateways, and the associated logistical chains. However, the maritime ports are also just one node in a complex logistical chain involving a number of interactions; digitization is vital to improving the competitiveness of that chain. A number of global organizations, such as United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), World Customs Organization (WCO), World Trade Organization (WTO), and International Maritime Organization (IMO) have been advocating the accelerated digitalization of cross-border processes and documentation. This report highlights the immediate, short-, and medium-term measures considered necessary to strengthen the resilience of the maritime and logistics sector, to build back better, and more importantly ensure countries realize the significant potential efficiency gains of digitization. This report underlines digitalization as not solely a technological issue, but also as human capital and institutional issues. Any move towards increased digitization will require a high level of political commitment, while the establishment must have an appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy framework at the national level, across the different disciplines of the maritime, port, clearance agencies, and the transport and logistics sector.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The increasing cyber connectivity of vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure will drastically reshape mobility in the coming decades. Although the advent of connected mobility is expected to benefit travelers and society by smoothing traffic, improving rider convenience, and reducing accidents, the augmented cyber components in connected and autonomous vehicles and related infrastructure also give rise to cyber attacks on the transportation system. Yet, little attention has been paid to transportation cyber resilience. This paper thus proposes an investigation on this topic with a comprehensive literature review. Cyber components and plausible autonomous mobility systems operation scenarios are discussed, before identifying possible cyber attacks to autonomous mobility systems at the vehicle and system levels. The discussion then moves to existing practices to enhance cybersecurity, and several strategies are investigated toward enhancing autonomous mobility system cyber resilience. At the vehicle level, creating layers and separation to reduce cyber component connectivity and deploying an independent procedure for data collection and processing are important in vehicle design and manufacturing. At the system level, recommended strategies include keeping redundancy in transportation capacity, maintaining a separate road network, and deploying different sub-autonomous mobility systems.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract This report is part of a broader work program on shaping a more positive narrative on regional integration in South Asia. It is a follow-up to a recent flagship report published by the South Asia Region of the World Bank, A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia. E-commerce is dramatically changing the way goods and services are transacted nationally, regionally, and globally. It facilitates international trade by reducing the cost of distance and remoteness and can be more inclusive of underrepresented groups such as women, small businesses, and rural entrepreneurs. Intraregional trade in South Asia is still below its potential, and the region lags behind other parts of the world in activating the potential benefits from e-commerce. Adopting a novel yet practical approach, this report explores how e-commerce can be boosted to deepen intraregional trade in South Asia. It examines the main transacting models in the digital space and the channels through which e-commerce helps reduce transactions costs for firms and consumers. It considers the regulations, as well as the regulatory gaps, affecting private sector participation in e-commerce, focusing on data privacy, consumer protection, delivery, cybersecurity, market-access regulations, and digital payments. Finally, the report presents recommendations for regulatory reforms that could enhance e-trade, especially in a regional context and as a possible platform for greater global engagement by South Asian firms. The scale of these recommendations ranges from the modest, such as allowing cross-border payments and streamlining the customs regime, to the more ambitious, such as allowing the operation of regional e-commerce platforms and liberalizing related cross-border logistics services.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

"Abstract Universal health coverage (UHC) is the ideal that all people have access to needed health services that are of sufficient quality to be effective, without risk of financial hardship. While many countries aspire to UHC ideals, achievement remains elusive; half of the world's population cannot access needed health services. However, the rapid proliferation of mobile telephones and advances in digital financial technology have created opportunities to accelerate progress toward universal healthcare. These developments, particularly the widespread adoption of mobile money among the unbanked, have expanded financial inclusion in low- and middle-income countries and there is great potential for applications in the health sector. To identify these opportunities, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) commissioned the Local Health System Sustainability Project to establish an evidence base on emerging models of digital financial services for health. Digital financial services consist of financial transactions, including banking (savings and loans), insurance, and payment services (remittances, transfers, user fees, and bulk payments) that can be accessed via digital channels such as mobile phones, electronic cards (credit, debit, and prepaid), vouchers, computers, and other electronic instruments.

"Abstract The strength of a health system—and ultimately the health of a population—depends on health worker performance. However, insufficient support to build, manage, and optimize human resources for health (HRH) across broader workforce development functions results in insufficient quantity and quality of health workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This in turn perpetuates health inequities and results in low-quality health services. Defined as “a broad set of supervisory interventions that improve provider performance through team-based, learning approaches, including supportive supervision, the use of checklists, and in-person visits” (USAID, 2018), enhanced supervision is estimated to have the highest potential impact of all health systems interventions (USAID, 2017).

"Abstract SPRING aimed to transform the lives of adolescent girls by working with businesses to develop products and services which would help them keep safe, learn, earn and save, and have greater wellbeing. The SPRING accelerator identified businesses which could improve the lives of girls and provided mentoring support, limited finance, and expertise in business growth, design, innovation and marketing to help drive their business models forward. The project's original focus on getting “direct economic assets” was broadened to include a wider range of products (e.g. economic, digital, sanitary or otherwise life-enhancing products), services (e.g. childcare, mobile health advise, etc.) and business opportunities (i.e. ways of including girls in a business’ value chain). The SPRING programme ran from July 2014 to September 2019. The programme supported four cohorts of businesses in nine countries in two different geographic areas in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda) and South Asia (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Myanmar).

"Abstract The Standard Days Method (SDM) is a fertility awareness-based family planning method that identifies a 12-day fertile window during which women with regular menstrual cycles (26–32 days long) should abstain from sex or use a barrier method to prevent pregnancy. irst developed and tested in 2001 by the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH), the SDM was introduced with “CycleBeads,” a string of different colored beads that each represent 1 day in the menstrual cycle. In 2012, the free iCycleBeads app was introduced and piloted as a digital version of the CycleBeads for download on a mobile device. This review of implementation science publications on the SDM in LMICs first looked at community pilot studies of the SDM to determine the acceptability of the method; correct use and efficacy rates; demographics of users; and changes to contraceptive prevalence rates and family planning behaviors, especially among men and couples. Then, we examined the status of the SDM in the 16 countries that had attempted to scale up the method within national family planning protocols, training, and service delivery.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract This report is on two DFID multi-cadre conferences that explored how strengthening a development focus on leaving no one behind (LNB) improves the lives of people living in extreme poverty and marginalisation. The conferences brought together over 220 advisers from across the livelihoods, social development, infrastructure, and climate and environment cadres. The purpose of this report is to share the outcomes and process of the conferences with colleagues in DFID and partner organisations. The conferences provided an innovative and interdisciplinary space for peer learning and led to a shared understanding of how the LNB agenda could be progressed within DFID, with partners and within cadre groups. LNB is a core commitment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a key priority for DFID, with the UK Government having been a very strong advocate for embedding this concept in the SDGs. The conferences explored the implications of LNB for economic development, building stability and increasing resilience, with attention to the crosscutting issues of gender, disability, digital access, and migration. They were innovative in the way they integrated collaborative facilitation processes and visual recording within an overall framework of scenario analysis. The design aimed to optimise peer-to-peer sharing and learning while working towards a collective understanding of how to accelerate progress on the LNB agenda. Central to the discussions was the concept of intersectionality, i.e. recognition that extreme poverty and marginalisation must be viewed from the intersection of multiple interacting social, political, and economic factors. In seeking solutions, it makes little sense to focus on one group or one form of exclusion without considering the wider context of interacting forms of exclusion.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract New technological trends, such as digitization, artificial intelligence and robotics, have the power to drastically increase economic output but may also displace workers. In this paper we assess the risk of automation for female and male workers in four Latin American countries Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and El Salvador. Our study is the first to apply a task-based approach with a gender perspective in this region. Our main findings indicate that men are more likely than women to perform tasks linked to the skills of the future, such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), information and communications technology, management and communication, and creative problem-solving tasks. Women thus have a higher average risk of automation, and 21% of women vs. 19% of men are at high risk (probability of automation greater than 70%). The differential impacts of the new technological trends for women and men must be assessed in order to guide the policy-making process to prepare workers for the future.

"Abstract Recent years have seen an ever-greater expansion of the digital economy, a development that may bring new opportunities to workers who were at a disadvantage in the traditional economy. We focus on a specific set of workers who belong to such a group: women. We study a skill set of particular relevance in the digital economy and estimate their returns in the labor market, according to gender, across four Latin American countries. We find that information and communication technologies (ICT) skills and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills yield significant positive returns for both men and women. However, there is a significant gender gap that favors men on the STEM returns. There is also a sizable gender gap regarding the amount of skills accumulated by gender. Through an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we estimate that up to 80% of the gender gap in hourly wages may be due to the lower returns that women receive, relative to men, on their STEM skills. If an investment in skills relevant to the digital economy may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women, why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries remains an open and relevant question.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract Who drives on ride - hailing platforms in Latin America? A Profile of Uber Drivers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia , and Mexico Abstract Digital platforms can improve the functioning of markets characterized by coordination problems and high levels of fragmentation, s u ch as the transport ation market. In recent years, the adoption of digital platforms across L atin America (L atam ) , notably in the ride - hailing sector , has been considerable . This expansion may increase the  availability  of better  job  alternatives  for  workers  in the region ,  which  is characterized by high  levels  of  informality  and citizen’s  insecurity .  To evaluate  the  viability  of  this hypothesis ,  we  explore d the  characteristics  of  Uber  drivers  (UD s )  by  combining Uber  administrative data with a survey designed  and applied for  this  project . The characteristics we  analyze d include drivers ’ past and current  labor profiles,  labor  aspirations, and financial behavior s . We fo u nd that the average  UD  in L atam is male,  3 8 years  old , and  highly  educated.  Most  drivers  have  no  previous experience in the transport ation sector. The mean duration of use of the platform is 19 hours per week, and the majority of UD s use it less than 30 hours per week. The average hourly gross income for UDs utilizing the platform is three times a given country ’s hourly minimum wage, with slight disparities by country, gender, and age. The main reasons cited for joining the platform are the ability to generate more income and have work more flexible working hours . Only 40 % of drivers would choose to work a fulltime job (that provides the same total income from all sources) over driving for Uber . The majority of UDs are financially stretch ed or insecure and show low levels of retirement prepared ness. However, UDs have  a strong desire to  accumulate more savings, at least  in the short term. Based  on  these findings , we suggest different policy alternatives to leverage ride - hailing platforms to improv e the lives of their drivers in Latin America , including facilitating the participation of  women  and migrants as drivers , promoting financial inclusion and financial literacy , easing voluntary contributions to retirement products and exploring alternatives to acquire coverage against multiple risks , including pay ing social security contributions .",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract Improving infrastructure and basic services is a central task in the region’s growth and development agenda. Despite the importance of private sector participation, governments will continue to play a defining role in planning, financing, executing, and overseeing key infrastructure projects and service delivery. This reality puts a premium on the efficient and transparent management of public investment, especially in light of the considerable technical, administrative, and political challenges and vulnerability to corruption and rent-seeking associated with large public works. The recent spate of corruption scandals surrounding public procurement and infrastructure projects in the region underscores the urgency of this agenda. The emergence of new digital technologies offers powerful tools for governments and citizens in the region to improve the transparency and efficiency of public investment.

"Abstract Latin America and the Caribbean is well positioned to participate in the digital economy and leverage its opportunities. Cloud computing is an enabling technology, forming the foundation of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, and constituting one of the main pillars of the digital economy. Cloud computing allows government customers to access industry-shaping technology at a speed, cost, and scale previously reserved for the largest companies in the private sector. Governments can essentially do more with less and use newly freed resources—in cost and human capital—to address key challenges they face. In addition to maximizing investments and avoiding additional investments in legacy IT infrastructure, cloud computing enables public sector organizations and government agencies to meet mission-critical objectives and to innovate. Cloud computing represents a unique opportunity for governments in the region to improve productivity and facilitate adoption of the latest technologies and those still to come. By eliminating the upfront costs of IT infrastructure, and having thousands of IT tools and almost unlimited computing capacity available with a pay-as-you-go model, cloud computing also represents a unique opportunity to small and medium enterprises and large corporations to adopt and use state-of-the-art IT solutions. To leverage the benefits of cloud services and new technological developments, governments in Latin America and the Caribbean need to undertake public policy initiatives to develop policy frameworks that quell concerns around data protection, cybersecurity, financial market regulation, and data privacy.

"Abstract There is growing interest to understand how technology will change politics, particularly in developing democracies where marginalized groups face higher barriers in communicating with their political representatives. Weak political communication channels have important implications for the health of a country’s democratic institutions: with poor information on their constituents’ preferences and policy priorities, elected representatives have a hard time representing, and political parties cannot differentiate themselves in meaningful ways. Can mobile technology help? There are obvious reasons why it could, but there are also fears that information communication technology (ICT) will only better connect those that are already well connected.

In an initial pilot, or “framed field experiment”, the authors found that introducing SMS as a way to send messages to government elicited a significant amount of new communication and improved the rate at which marginalized groups communicate to their representatives. Following the result of the framed field experiment, the authors worked with the Parliament of Uganda and The National Democratic Institute (NDI) to scale-up the intervention to 100 constituencies. This “natural field experiment” was structured as a randomized controlled trial and took place over a 6 month period.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract Social scientists have long sought to explain why people donate resources for the good of a community. Less attention has been paid to the difficult task of motivating the first adopters of these important behaviors. In a field experiment in Nigeria, we tested two campaigns that encouraged people to try reporting corruption by text message. Psychological theories about how to shift perceived norms and how to reduce barriers to action drove the design of each campaign. The first, a film featuring actors reporting corruption, and the second, a mass text message reducing the effort required to report, caused a total of 1181 people in 106 communities to text, including 241 people who sent concrete corruption reports. Psychological theories of social norms and behavior change can illuminate the early stages of the evolution of cooperation and collective action, when adoption is still relatively rare.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract In 2017, Transparência Brasil developed a cell phone application called Tá de Pé (TDP) to improve the accountability of government education spending to citizens (Figure 1). The TDP app collects crowdsourced data from citizens on school construction project completion rates in their neighborhoods to be assessed by a group of independent specialists. If the construction is behind schedule, the app provides a platform for citizens to make an anonymous complaint to the mayor. If the mayor’s office does not respond to the notice within 15 days, the notice is forwarded to the Brazilian Ministry of Education, which makes it more difficult for the municipality to access federal funds in the future. Transparência Brasil launched the app for Android in August 2017, and a version for the iOS platform came out six months later. A Facebook campaign to publicize the app successfully attracted 2028 new users within October 2017 alone.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract We examine the effects of national voter registration policies on voting patterns with a large-scale experimental study. Together with Kenya’s electoral commission, wedesigned an experiment in which 1,674 communities were randomized to a status quo or treatment group, receiving civic education on voter registration, SMS reminders about registration opportunities, and/or local registration visits by election commission staff. We find little evidence that civic education improves registration. Local registration visits improve voter registration, a relationship that increases in poorer communities. Moreover, local registration increased electoral competition and vote preference diversity in down-ballot contests in the 2017 Kenyan elections. Our results suggest that status quo voter registration policies constrain political participation and competition, and that inexpensive policy changes may attenuate the effects of such constraints.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract This concept note has been produced in response to a request by 74 agriculture ministers in January 2019 during the Global Forum on Food and Agriculture (GFFA) and supported financially by the Federal Republic of Germany. It proposes the creating of a new body, an International Digital Council for Food and Agriculture, to enhance international cooperation, the exchange of ideas and experiences across borders, creating synergies and avoiding duplication of efforts. It will strive to keep pace with rapid developments in digitalization, working with new digital tools and the highest expertise available. In line with this, it will help to tackle challenges of food security, hunger, health, inclusiveness and sustainability in the agri-food system at national, regional and international levels. With this approach, the Digital Council would provide structured and strategic agricultural policy recommendations on digitalization to governmental and non-governmental actors, strengthen international cooperation in the agri-food system to identify the challenges and solutions. Examples of activities include the organization of international forums to share best policy practices, and promoting interaction among farmers associations from different countries and national- and international-level stakeholders. The scope and function of the proposed Digital Council are summarised herein for consideration by government ministers, international organization members, donors and other stakeholders. It was highly noted amongst all stakeholders involved in the process of producing this concept note that the proposed Digital Council would have significant impacts on increasing the positive benefits of digitization in the food and agriculture sector, contributing to improving rural livelihoods.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract A significant challenge in understanding digital agricultural transformation is a lack of systematic, official data on the topic. Much of the data – for example on levels of e-literacy – are only available at the country level with no distinction for urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, data on networks focus only on coverage and do not provide information about the quality or affordability of services. There is also a lack of information about government support and regulatory frameworks for digital transformation; so far, this has been interpreted via proxies including the availability of government e-services and regulations about connectivity and data protection. A second consideration is that there are significant disparities in the adoption of digital agriculture technologies between developed and developing countries and between global companies and those at a local, community or family scale. Factors including financial resources and education levels influence the adoption of modern agricultural technologies. Small farmers in rural areas are disproportionately disadvantaged as well as facing problems of limited access to infrastructure, networks and technology. A final factor to consider is that digital agricultural technologies are affected by economies of scale. Adoption is easier for users who can implement them at large scale. Small-scale farmers face a disadvantage compared to large agribusiness actors. This creates disparity between large and small-scale farmers, with a corresponding inequality between developed and developing countries. Transformative digital innovations and technologies are often not designed for the scale at which smallholder farmers operate.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

"Abstract Chile has a native forest that constitutes 18 percent of its continental surface area and over 60 million hectares of protected areas. The country is considered a global hotspot of conservation priority due to its endemism and a high degree of habitat loss. The loss of ecosystems could increase if economic development does not progressively adopt sustainability standards that create less of an impact on biodiversity. From August 2015 to May 2020, FAO implemented the project in order ""to develop and implement an integrated monitoring and assessment system on carbon stocks and biodiversity in forest ecosystems (SIMEF) supporting the National Greenhouse Gases Inventory (INGEI) and the design of policies, regulations and SFM practices incorporating the REDD+ Programme and biodiversity conservation in forest ecosystems"". The project established sound foundations that improve the monitoring of the conditions of forest ecosystems and, consequently, more robust information is generated and with greater frequency. It is worth highlighting the creation of an interinstitutional structure that will support the continuity of the SIMEF and the creation of a digital platform with five tools. The SIMEF is, at present, a regular programme of the Chilean State with a governance system and with a permanent annual budget. Given this, the sustainability of the achievements made in the project can be maintained and strengthened. However, a low level of appropriation of the system at local level was identified, which could affect its sustainability.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract The aim of this report is to present evidence towards how Information and Communication Technologies for Small-scale Fisheries (ICT4SSF) might enable and support the implementation of the FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines). We present case studies of ICT4SSF initiatives in different use areas to identify key themes and reflect on successes and failures. There are very few baselines against which to compare fisher wellbeing and access before and after ICT initiatives, and this gap is an important finding in this report. Thus far, success has only been assessed qualitatively and relatively, in terms of uptake, sustainability and local legitimacy. Still, some ICT4SSF initiatives presented in this document are closely aligned with the Principles for Digital Development and the objectives of the SSF Guidelines. These initiatives highlighted that when ICTs are locally led or developed, or co-designed with end users and marginalised groups, or strengthened already existing networks and technologies, the potential for positive impact is much higher. However, there is much less evidence of proactive confrontation of inequality through data ownership. Further, there are very few examples of developing mechanisms for fishers and fish workers to hold, access or own their data, or legal mechanisms to recognise their ownership, or protect them against misuse or manipulation.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract The increasing availability of low-cost mobile phones and mobile Internet access in emerging markets has led to widespread use of social media platforms, making them an important source of news and place for social and political activity. This trend has brought many new users online including those with limited exposure to technology. Concurrently, we have also observed an increasing trend in the spread of misinformation on such platforms. The spread of misinformation can create and exacerbate polarization, while also affecting the beliefs and actions of users without a prior ideological leaning. We carry out a household level survey which provides unique first-hand evidence on the trends in social media use, sharing of news, and spread of misinformation among low and middle-income users in Pakistan. Using a list of actual news stories circulated on social media we create a test to measure the extent to which users are likely to believe and share misinformation. We evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions for countering misinformation in a randomized control setting. Our first intervention educates users about common features of misinformation through a video, while our second intervention in addition to the video provides specific feedback to users about their own past behaviour in engaging with misinformation. We measure the effectiveness of our interventions on future behaviour of participants in believing and sharing misinformation.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
Abstract We study the impact of an innovative antianxiety digital treatment on performance in a cognitive demanding task using a randomized control trial design. We exogenously manipulate a cognitive bias associated with anxiety – the tendency to disproportionately allocate attention to negative stimuli – in a group of young men and women using a digital treatment called Cognitive Bias Modification. CBM treatment reduces attention bias by training individual attention. It is a computer-based training in which pairs of threatening and neutral visual stimuli appear sequentially on the screen. The subject is trained to divert attention away from threatening stimuli by requiring repeated identification of the location of the neutral stimulus in a pair of neutral and threatening stimuli. We observe that the treatment reduces the cognitive bias of treated women and significantly improves their performance in the cognitive task.,AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity
"Abstract Information and communication technologies (ICTs) make a significant contribution to growth and socio-economic development in countries and regions around the globe. The widespread adoption and integration of ICTs has reduced information and transaction costs, improved service delivery, created new jobs, generated new revenue streams, and helped conserve resources. ICTs have also transformed the way businesses, people and governments work, interact, and communicate. ICT innovation is also revolutionizing the agriculture and food sectors. In developed economies, innovations such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, data analytics and block-chain are changing the way agriculture does business. Remote sensors collect data on soil moisture, temperature, crop growth and livestock feed levels, enabling farmers to achieve better yields by optimizing crop management and reducing the use of fertilizers, pesticides and water. However, the rapid global revolution in ICT stands in stark contrast to the continuing high numbers of extreme poor and hungry individuals in the world. The new digital technologies and innovative use of ICTs creates enormous opportunities and poses daunting challenges to ending poverty and hunger. On one hand, there is potential to increase productivity and wealth, generate new activities, products and services, and improve livelihoods. On the other hand, such opportunities can lead to further alienation of marginalized communities and an exacerbation of existing socio-economic inequalities.

"Abstract The continuing COVID-19 pandemic—and related lockdowns—triggered a massive cash crisis around the world for families who depend on informal earnings, including daily wage workers. In Pakistan, a nationwide lockdown was imposed on 21 March 2020. This had major reverberations on the food supply chain and agriculture sector, where restrictive measures threatened the livelihoods of workers and smallholder farmers. In total, as of 12 July 2020, there were 248 872 confirmed cases throughout Pakistan. Lockdown-related challenges have created new threats to public health, with communities struggling to adhere to restrictions while still securing food for their families. Overall, society’s most vulnerable and food insecure segments have been disproportionately affected by the immediate impacts of lockdown measures, which include sudden unemployment, food price shocks, disruptions in marketing and food trade, logistics and production, and upended labor migration patterns.

"Abstract Sustainably developing the agri-food sector in Mashreq countries is of paramount importance for food security, job creation, expanded export potential, and social stability and inclusion. Digital technologies could create a new momentum for economic development by accelerating the structural transformation process and by supporting the transition toward a more competitive, commercially oriented, and export-oriented agriculture and agri-business sector. Like any major technology change, digital transformation of the agri-food sector also comes with risks that need to be understood and appropriately managed. Digital technologies show promise for advancing the digital transformation of the agriculture sector in the three Mashreq countries (Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon), although their adoption is still at a relatively early stage. Digital agriculture in Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon is limited by many factors. Achieving successful results in Mashreq will require that: 1)users have a better awareness of digital applications, and 2)digital applications provide timely, localized, and customized information addressing specific farming concerns in a comprehensible format and in Arabic or local languages. The public sector has an important role in identifying public goods, policies, and investments needed to maximize the societal benefits from digital agriculture in increasing efficiency, equity, and environmental sustainability in agri-food systems. The catalytic investments and policies include establishing e-Government systems for all public services, facilitating the deployment of smart irrigation and fertilizer management systems along with appropriate policies to safeguard overexploitation of natural resources, and fostering digital ecosystem development.

"Abstract Digital technologies have a high potential to enable further development of the agricultural sector, significantly reshape food value chains (FVCs), and greatly contribute towards more productive, resilient and transparent food systems. This paper provides a non-technical overview of digital technologies that have a high potential to revolutionize the agriculture and food industry, and contribute towards inclusion of small farmers into FVCs. The particular focus is on digital platforms providing e-commerce services and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), such as blockchain, as they mutually enable more efficient and more inclusive local and global agricultural markets by tackling their contribution to reducing information asymmetries, transaction costs, and providing financial inclusion of actors along FVCs. Various examples indicate that digital technologies represent great potential benefits for small farmers including increased efficiency of production, direct access to market, inclusion in global value chains (GVCs), and access to finance and insurance services. The further potential of digital technologies, especially blockchain, could change existing linear food value chain models by providing more transparency and trust between the supply chain actors. Finally, by using digital technologies, governments can provide more efficient public services. Overall, the real impact of digital technologies on the agriculture and food industry will be more evident in the years to come when they become widely accepted by all involved actors, and their usage reaches a critical scale.

"Abstract This report analyses the recent trends in Pakistani Information Technologies (IT) and InformationTechnologies enabled Services (ITeS), as well as obstacles confronted by firms. The authors assess the importance of trade costs as a barrier to services growth and development in Pakistan’s domestic market and to seizing  the opportunities of global trade. The report also aims to understand and examine the impact of obstacles (i.e., trade costs) confronted by firms. These obstacles increase the costs of selling services and may reduce capacity to compete both in the local market (Pakistan) as well as overseas (exports). These obstacles include direct costs generated by policy barriers that limit market entry, but can also include infrastructure deficiencies, geographical location, and institutional capacities, and/or obstacles imposed by regulatory measures. Among the latter obstacles, examples  include difficulties in accessing the information necessary  to operate in a market, the predictability and stability of  the business environment in a market, and the quality of the decision-making process and administrative procedures of competent authorities in the domestic and export markets. The focus of the report is the trade costs confronted by IT and ITeS firms. IT and ITeS operations are the backbone to provide digital services, digital goods and depend on digital technologies, conform an integral part of the  overall ecosystem. The report relies on a survey conducted
 on 782 IT and ITeS firms across different cities. The objective of the survey was to examine the importance of these factors for Pakistani firms and to provide advice to policymakers. To complement the survey results, the main findings were discussed in focus group structured interviews. Firms interviewed covered different services activities beyond software companies and included both exporters (534 firms) and non-exporters (248 firms), reflecting the export competitiveness as well as domestic competitiveness of Pakistan's IT services sector.

"Abstract This report provides an overview of the role of emerging technologies in digital transformation and the global best practices in policy responses to the disruptions they cause across a broad spectrum of economic activity. It analyzes the successes and challenges of digital transformation in Russia and attempts to develop key recommendations to help policy makers accelerate the pace of digital transformation across the main sectors of the Russian economy. In its current version, the report starts with discussing the results of the Russia DECA and offers an analysis of international best practice in formulating policy approaches to stimulate digital adoption while easing the disruption caused by the rapid emergence of new technologies. The objective is to help policy makers think through ways to harness the opportunities created by emerging technologies to enable Russia to accelerate the pace of digital transformation. The report then discusses the emergence of digital platforms as key enablers of digital transformation and proceeds to explore sectoral
 dynamics in the key digital transformation areas outlined in the Russia Digital Economy Program, including digital government, digital business, as well as digital innovation and skills building. Sector-oriented chapters follow a similar structure by analyzing international best practice in the transformation of a sector, offering an assessment of the current state of transformation of that sector in Russia and concluding with proposing a set of recommendations that may help accelerate the digital transformation of the sector in light of international best practice and the local experience. Due to the rapid pace of technological change and space limitations, this report does not pretend to offer in-depth analysis of Russian digital transformation at the sectoral level but is rather an attempt to analyze global  best practice to inform Russian policy making and an invitation to the policy-maker and expert community to continue the digital co-creation experience started two years ago in the hope that it is an effective way to share the just-in-time global expertise of the World Bank whenever and wherever it is needed most in order to help accelerate Russia’s digital transformation process.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create a global need to deliver on an agenda which relies heavily on quantitative data. This creates a demand for human capital with the requisite statistical and data skills to work on the challenges represented by the SDGs. Increasingly, long-term domestic solutions to the building of statistical capacities are being sought, in order to decrease the dependency on external support and ensure a sustainable flow of qualified professionals. In this paper we argue for the value of thinking of statistical capacity as a pipeline which needs to begin in the education system, and illustrate how investment in this end of the pipeline can deliver a more sustainable and long-term pathway to building up the holistic skills-base to enable the challenges of the SDGs to be tackled. We describe an existing tried-and-tested experiential learning model called Q-Step based on developing skills in the workplace, and propose that the successes of this partnership-driven model illustrate how ‘data fellowships’ can fulfil some of the unmet capacity needs of the data revolution for sustainable development. We illustrate our argument through a practical exploration of the development of such a learning model in Colombia. Although there are challenges in ensuring that educational access is equal, we demonstrate that there are significant opportunities and a data fellowships model opens doors for addressing local skills gaps to help deliver the SDGs.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity

One channel of profit shifting is transfer mispricing. That is, firms can reduce their tax bill by applying a high price on items flowing from affiliates in low-tax countries to affiliates in high-tax countries, and vice versa. Using transactional data, I can directly test for transfer mispricing. I obtain access to a newly constructed, confidential, administrative-level, customs data-set covering all imports of goods to South Africa in the period from 2011 to 2015. Tax authorities can use the econometric method applied in this paper as an automated digital flagging system. For many governments, the data is already there and used when firms are audited. The next natural development is to use the full data source in an automated flagging model to guide the selection of firms for audits. Such an intervention is an example of the potential for digital tax enforcement, which the OECD (2016a) and the IMF (2017) are promoting.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract This report is driven by one fundamental question: are we seeing models of inclusive innovation emerging in the Asia Pacific region and, if so, are they pointing to concrete alternatives to the dominating innovation narrative (driven by Silicon Valley)? To answer this question, we partnered with Nesta, building on their comprehensive framework of inclusive innovation, to produce case studies from across ASEAN countries, particularly Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia and Viet Nam. The research team conducted dozens of interviews with key stakeholders from grassroots to government to seek patterns and outliers. In Vietnam, UNDP is currently hosting a series of conversations with different stakeholders on the practical implications of adopting an inclusive innovation framework. This report draws on the insights from these case studies, to present concrete recommendations for policymakers in Asia and the Pacific who are interested in developing a more coherent approach to innovation as a means of addressing societal challenges and fostering more inclusive ecosystems. We hope that many will take up the challenge. We firmly believe that those governments who shape the innovation narrative around inclusion will reap major benefits and induce new dynamics that will help achieve the SDGs.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformations. Digital solutions are increasingly needed to continue some of the economic and social activities remotely. They have been critical for telemedicine, telework and online education, not least to keep alive our social ties in times of physical distancing. We have also witnessed e-commerce growth in developing countries, with long-term implications. However, unless adequately addressed, existing digital divides are likely to result in even greater inequalities. Against this background, a group of eTrade for all partners joined forces in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the aim of jointly assessing how the impact of the pandemic was playing out in various regions of the world, what barriers countries and business were facing when trying to leverage digital solutions; what policy responses had been taken; and – not least important – what we could do better to reap synergies and enhance global support to those countries that are the least equipped to manage digital transformation for dealing with the pandemic and beyond. This study on the impact of COVID-19 on e-commerce and digital trade is a collective effort, and the first research-oriented project undertaken under the eTrade for all umbrella.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is a founding member of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, which is an international, multi-stakeholder initiative to improve the availability and quality of ICT data and indicators. One of its key achievements is the development of a core list of ICT indicators for the production of internationally comparable statistics. The current edition, entitled Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy, was prepared to reflect the many changes that have taken place in the past decade in terms of access and use of ICTs. Compared to earlier versions, it expands the coverage of the measurement of e-commerce, trade in ICT services and trade in ICT-enabled (or digitally delivered) services. It contains more model questionnaires and reflects the most recent revisions of the Partnership’s list of core ICT indicators. The Manual is intended to guide statisticians from developing countries through all the steps involved in the production and dissemination of statistics related to e-commerce and the digital economy.",AreaPolicy and regulation

"Abstract Although the Coronavirus pandemic, and its human and material costs, is still underway, history suggests that it will inevitably pass. Indications regarding the shape of the future global economy can be gleaned from the handful of sectors that thrived amid the pandemic. These include innovative technology and digital businesses offering connecting products and services as well as online retailers and service providers and their supply chain and logistics partners. These businesses, not surprisingly, are excelling in major global stock markets, and they and other innovation platforms such as robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and DNA sequencing (Gurdus, 2020) are likely to sustain their strong investment prospects in the post-pandemic global economy. Of particular interest to the present perspective paper is the extent to which the expected boost in global digital investment might foster digital inclusion, access and entrepreneurship in underrepresented parts of the world, specifically Africa. Although internet penetration levels and online marketplaces have expanded across Africa in recent years (Lattimore, 2015), significant gaps still exist compared with other regions. This paper briefly profiles African digital multinationals, offers policy recommendations for advancing their international investment prospects and reflects on how the latter might contribute to a more inclusive global economy in the post-pandemic era.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract This document identifies the principal tensions and opportunities arising that are impacting the inevitable and ongoing digitalization process that is underway in the maritime sector, particularly through the authors’ experience in the development and subsequent validation of the Port Collaborative Decision Making (PortCDM) concept. The document also identifies the trends of development at large and those associated with the many stakeholders that are involved in global maritime operations. During the last decade, various efforts have been made to enhance the coordination / synchronization / optimization of port call operations. One of those is PortCDM, an international, independent and product agnostic concept of mutually beneficial near real-time digital data sharing. PortCDM acknowledges that a “one size fits all” solution is most inappropriate in a dynamic, flexible, digitally enhanced business environment, so it concentrates on providing generic guidelines and standards that can be adapted and applied at the regional and local level.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract This report introduces findings from ten digital rights landscape country reports on Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Cameroon. The country reports analyse how the openings and closings of online civic space affect citizens’ digital rights. They show that: When civic space closes offline citizens often respond by opening civic space online. When civic space opens online governments often take measures to close online space. The resulting reduction in digital rights makes it impossible to achieve the kind of inclusive governance defined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We know far more about openings and closings of online civic space in the global North than we do in the global South. What little we do know about Africa is mainly about a single country, a single event, or single technology. For the first time, these reports make possible a comparative analysis of openings and closings of online civic space in Africa.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that
"Abstract This paper begins by locating the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition project (GODAN) in the context of wider debates in the open data movement by first reviewing the literature on open data (OD) and open data for agriculture and nutrition (ODAN). The review identifies a number of important gaps and limitations in the existing literature. There has been no independent evaluation of who most benefits or who is being left behind regarding ODAN. There has been no independent evaluation of gender or diversity in ODAN or of the development outcomes or impacts of ODAN. The existing research on ODAN is over-reliant on key open data organisations and open data insiders who produce most of the research. This creates bias in the data and analysis. The authors recommend that these gaps are addressed in future research. The paper contributes a novel conceptual ‘SCOTA’ framework for analysing the barriers to and drivers of open data adoption, which could be readily applied in other domains. Using this framework to review the existing literature highlights the fact that ODAN research and practice has been predominantly supply-side focused on the production of open data. The authors argue that if open data is to ‘leave no one behind’, greater attention now needs to be paid to understanding the demand-side of the equation and the role of intermediaries. The paper argues that there is a compelling need to improve the participation of women, people living with disabilities, and other marginalised groups in all aspects of open data for agriculture and nutrition. The authors see a need for further research and action to enhance the capabilities of marginalised people to make effective use of open data.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that

Thus, the widespread availability of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has stimulated interest in the potential of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to increase scalability at low cost, and thus to improve vaccination coverage. Yet, questions remain about whether mHealth interventions can be effective for highly disadvantaged populations facing barriers due to poverty, low literacy, and restrictive gender norms.

Sending vaccination reminders through mobile-phone-based short message services (SMS) has been shown in some studies to promote vaccination uptake. In Hong Kong, WhatsApp messenger, which also permits social networking functions, is used by over 80% of the population due to high penetration of smartphone use. Previous studies suggest that parental decision making for children's vaccination is modified by knowing other parents' vaccination decisions, indicating a strong social normative influence. Therefore, knowing that other parents take their child for SIV can encourage hesitant parents to do the same. This was a preliminary study to test the effectiveness and parental acceptability of a social networking intervention that sends weekly vaccination reminders and encourages exchange of SIV-related views and experiences among mothers via WhatsApp discussion groups for promoting childhood SIV.",AreaE-government E-governmentInterventions that

"Abstract China’s relentless advance in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computing has engendered a significant amount of anxiety about the future of America’s technological supremacy. The resulting debate centres around the impact of China’s digital rise on the economy, security, employment and the profitability of American companies.

This essay will address this question by examining how democratic countries can, or should respond, and what you can do about it to influence the outcome. The essay argues that democratic countries should form a global, broadly scoped Strategic Tech Alliance, built on mutual economic interests and common moral, social and legal norms, technological interoperability standards, legal principles and constitutional values. An Alliance committed to safeguarding democratic norms, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

"Abstract The digital revolution is in full bloom and technology is being used to solve the world’s most challenging problems, yet traditional banking excludes many of the world’s poorest people from taking advantage of the full fruits of the financial system. Financial services are the lifeblood of an economy, enabling households and businesses alike to save, invest, and protect themselves against risk. Yet in many emerging economies today, the majority of individuals and small businesses lack access to basic savings and credit products, which hinders economic growth and perpetuates poverty. Two billion people in the developing world lack access to a bank, and 200 million small businesses cannot get the credit they need to grow, a gap estimated at $2.2 trillion.
The solution can be summed up in two words: digital finance, the idea that individuals and companies can have access to payments, savings, and credit products without ever stepping into a bank branch. This is possible through digitization, which can essentially turn a smartphone into an all-in-one wallet, checkbook, bank branch, and accounting ledger.

"Abstract The emergence of a global digital ecosystem has been a boon for global communication and the democratization of the means of distributing information. The internet, and the social media platforms and web applications running on it, have been used to mobilize pro-democracy protests and give members of marginalized communities a chance to share their voices with the world. However, more recently, we have also seen this technology used to spread propaganda and misinformation, interfere in election campaigns, expose individuals to harassment and abuse, and stir up confusion, animosity and sometimes violence in societies. The absence of oversight has allowed dysfunction to spread, as malign actors manipulate digital technology for their own ends without fear of the consequences.

Using a subset of data from ‘Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA) 2019’, this study analyzed 31,343 households’ data, which was collected between 17 July and 19 September 2019 throughout all 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The outcome measured was access to care in the healthcare facility, and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to identify the specific factors associated with access to healthcare. Of 31,343 households exposed to complex emergencies in Afghanistan, 10,057 (32.1%) could not access healthcare facilities when one was needed in last three months. The access to healthcare was significantly associated
with displacement status, economic factors such as employment status or total monthly income, and the distance to healthcare facilities.

"Abstract Globally, the rapid growth of technology and its use as a development solution has generated much interest in digital health. In line with global trends, Bangladesh is also integrating technology into its health system to address disparities. Strong political endorsement and uptake of digital platforms by the government has influenced the rapid proliferation of such initiatives in the country. This paper aims to examine the implications of digital health on access to health care in Bangladesh, considering who uses electronic devices to access health information and services and why. This study aims to understand how access to health care and related information through electronic means (digital health) is affected by sociodemographic determinants (ie, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and personal and household ownership of mobile phones) in a semiurban community in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey of 854 households (between October 2013 and February 2014) and 20 focus group discussions (between February 2017 and March 2017) were conducted to understand (1) who owns electronic devices; (2) who, among the owners, uses these to access health information and services and why; (3) the awareness of electronic sources of health information; and (4) the role of intermediaries (family members or peers who helped to look for health information using electronic devices). A total of 90.3% (771/854) of households (471/854, 55.2% of respondents) owned electronic devices, mostly mobile phones. Among these, 7.2% (34/471) used them to access health information or services. Middle-aged (35-54 years), female, less (or not) educated, and poorer people used these devices the least (α=.05, α is the level of significance). The lack of awareness, discomfort, differences with regular care-seeking habits, lack of understanding and skills, and proximity to a health facility were the main reasons for not using devices to access digital health.
Although influenced by sociodemographic traits, access to digital health is not merely related to device ownership and technical skill. Rather, it is a combination of general health literacy, phone ownership, material resources, and technical skill as well as social recognition of health needs and inequity. This study's findings should serve as a basis for better integrating technology within the health system and ensuring equitable access to health care.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Community health workers, also known as fieldworkers (FWs), are frontline health-care providers in Bangladesh, where unmet need in family planning outcomes related to maternal and child health are high. A digital health intervention provided netbook computers to

To understand how the intervention affected FW’s knowledge and counseling behavior, this pre-poststudy measured FWs’ knowledge related to family planning, maternal, newborn, child health, and counseling on family topics before and after the pilot. Bivariate analyses were used to determine changes in FW knowledge, and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine changes in behavior, comparing knowledge and behaviors prepilot to postpilot. Comparing mean knowledge scores after and before the pilot, the difference in mean scores was significant (p<.05) related to knowledge of benefits of birth spacing (1.26) and benefits of a small family (1.3) and related to maternal health, anemia prevention (0.95), and recommended number of antenatal care visits (0.13). Regarding newborn and child health, the difference in mean scores was significantly (p <.05) related to knowledge of proper attachment for breastfeeding (3.56) and signs of adequate breast milk supply (1.08). Postintervention, FWs were significantly more likely to counsel couples on all available contraceptive options (adjusted odds ratio: 4.64; 95% CI [3.16, 6.83]) and birth spacing benefits (adjusted odds ratio: 4.54; 95% CI [3.17, 6.50]).

"Abstract We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a digital health intervention package (mCARE) for community health workers, on pregnancy surveillance and care-seeking reminders compared with the existing paper-based status quo, from 2018 to 2027, in Bangladesh.
The mCARE programme involved digitally enhanced pregnancy surveillance, individually targeted text messages and in-person home-visit to pregnant women for care-seeking reminders for antenatal care, child delivery and postnatal care. We developed a model to project population and service coverage increases with annual geographical expansion (from 1 million to 10 million population over 10 years) of the mCARE programme and the status quo. For this modelling study, we used Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that would be averted by 2027, if the coverage of health interventions was increased in mCARE programme and the status quo, respectively. Economic costs were captured from a societal perspective using an ingredients approach and expressed in 2018 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. We estimated the mCARE programme to avert 3076 deaths by 2027 at an incremental cost of $43 million relative to the status quo, which is translated to $462 per DALY averted. The societal costs were estimated to be $115million for mCARE programme (48% of which are programme costs, 35% user costs and 17% provider costs). With the continued implementation and geographical scaling-up, the mCARE programme improved its cost-effectiveness from $1152 to $462 per DALY averted from 5 to 10 years.
Mobile phone-based pregnancy surveillance systems with individually scheduled text messages and home-visit reminder strategies can be highly cost-effective in Bangladesh. The cost-effectiveness may improve as it promotes facility-based child delivery and achieves greater programme cost efficiency with programme scale and sustainability.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract Men’s engagement in women’s sexual and reproductive healthcare as well as responsible parenthood is a demand of time in countries like Bangladesh, where men play a vital role, when it comes to the issue of women’s ability to seek healthcare. Yet, we couldn’t reach a point, where our men are wellequipped with proper healthcare information to assist their partners in a specific health complication and fully participate to take a decision on their health and wellbeing. But, if they can be aware and motivated about the importance of their active involvement in family’s healthcare using ICT tools, they could definitely help their partners to take effective decision in emergency. Ensuring the use of low cost intervention like ICT tools for receiving health information will also help achieving the vision of health equity, by engaging all, regardless of gender or class barriers. The main objective of this paper is to assist the healthcare professionals and development partners, who are involving with advocacy through e-health awareness programs using ICT tools, to formulate their coordinated next plan of action. By formulating such an action plan, healthcare providers can easily identify the issues that need to be more emphasized, topics that are not covered by anyone yet and prevent duplication of healthcare contents that are already available online. By ensuring e-health for all, we can contribute to implementing our UHC, as part of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In order to showcase the importance of digital technology in healthcare, we picked up two social media platforms that provide the highest possible healthcare information on adolescence and reproductive health and aim to reduce the rate of maternal mortality and morbidity to the bare minimum. Since the inception of the Facebook page called ‘Dr. Purabi’sHelp Desk https://www.facebook.com/DrPurabisHelpDesk/’ and the YouTube channel ‘Nowsheen Purabi, https://www.youtube.com/user/drpurabihelpdesk’ in November 2012, these online platforms have been delivering video contents, articles on adolescent-maternal-reproductive health, contraception, non-communicable disease prevention, vaccination, nutrition, and mental health.The data we have shown are taken from the analytics/ insights of Facebook page ‘Dr. Purabi’s Help Desk’ and YouTube channel ‘Nowsheen Purabi’. For Facebook page data, we have used the monthly insight report that Facebook provides every page owner. On the other hand, the YouTube data was taken from the channel analytics, which gives a lifetime data to the channel owner. People from reproductive age (18-34 years old) mostly watch the YouTube contents, while same in Facebook Page. 64% men are somehow likely to be active in watching healthcare contents online. Contents are viewed by people from different parts of the world (Bangladesh 88%, India 8%, Saudi Arabia 1%, USA 1%, and Australia 1%). Almost 91% of the viewer uses their mobile phones; 6% use computers and 3% percent use tablets to watch the contents. 94% male and 6% females are engaged in the posts. If we can take necessary steps to engage more people in digital healthcare by lowering the internet price, we will be able to achieve SDG as well as UHC within a short time. We need the coordination of government and private initiatives to bridge the information gap between the healthcare professionals and the patients.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract In a short span of time, starting in 2011, mobile financial services (MFSs) have burgeoned in Bangladesh, and elsewhere in the developing world. MFSs have brought about major changes in financial products and institutional structures in the financial services market. The study of Bangladesh's experience with MFS shows that financial inclusion has greatly improved along with efficiency of provision. This article shows that the probability of using MFSs by a household increases by about 43 per cent if the households have temporary domestic migrant members. Female household heads are less likely to use MFS compared to male household head. Out of 1,588 micro merchants in the sample, around 30 per cent have access to MFSs. Individuals engaged in the non-agriculture sector, those from households with the head having higher education, those from non-poor households and those from urban areas have higher probabilities of MFS use. But more research must be done to design appropriate MFS products for the poor, so that they too can also leverage the benefits of MFSs.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract This paper evaluates opportunities and challenges of the Union Digital Centre (UDC) project, a Bangladeshi telecentre initiative, based on a Public-Private-People’s Partnership (PPPP) scheme. It investigates how each of the stakeholders contributes. In the face of many closures, it is a timely contribution. A stakeholder management framework focused on telecentres is used to understand stakeholder behaviour and to provide a hypothesis about the contribution of each to the operation. This study surveyed stakeholders such as entrepreneurs, central government officials and local government representatives. The roles of stakeholders are discussed and opportunities are identified for external support from government bodies to support the operation of UDCs. The potential demands and benefits of a massive client base are also examined. Application of a structural equation model highlights that current progress hinges more on external support and people's participation than on entrepreneurial investment. The dependency on philanthropic support, combined with problems in stakeholder engagement, poses challenges to entrepreneurship development, a feature necessary for sustainability. To engage them, effective interplay of relevant stakeholders is required.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract The information communication technology (ICT) has a great impact in shaping life and responses. The current century is running with the rampage of cutting edge technologies that compose our everyday life while the expansion of ICT allows us to make our life meaningful. The most significant challenges in transition are to coping with the changes that even happen all of a sudden i.e., about one million refugee influx in Bangladesh in 2018. Nowadays people recognized ICT as a decisive and inseparable part of them that constructs a new fashion of modern democratic governance. Though ICT is crucial in representative governance but now it inflates both the magnitude and persuade. The study tries to treat them embedded in the governance nexus and connected to each other. The present study focuses on the nexus between ICT and refugee management which shaped the refugee governance landscape in transitional Bangladesh. The endeavor of the study is to answer the questions n how ICT and administration act and react with each other on the refugee governance issues and how it indicates the future role of administration in refugee management and resettlement. The study followed the content analysis method and primarily based on secondary sources of data to reach the inferences. The results found ICT as a comprehensive platform that includes the different stakeholders and emphasized the trade-off between them which in our case Rohingya refugees governance. It provides geo-localized support for them and specific aid during the adverse situation. It is also found that it helps the administration to identify the synchronized ideas of people that coordinate their actions to produce services for the people. The study concludes by arguing for the management and wrapping of multidimensional data through the observatory mechanism that could likely develop their life and incentives required for the administration to act in support of the governance and resettlement of refugees in the future.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Lack of usability can be a major barrier for the rapid adoption of mobile services. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the usability of Mobile Health applications in Bangladesh. We followed a 3-stage approach in our research. First, we conducted a keyword-based application search in the popular app stores. We followed the affinity diagram approach and clustered the found applications into nine groups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in total) and conducted a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest downloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30 participants. We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature from heuristic inspection. The most (21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and minimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale (SUS) scores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the heuristic evaluation. Thus, the results of heuristic evaluation and user studies complement each other. Overall, the findings suggest that the usability of the mobile health apps in Bangladesh is not satisfactory in general and could be a potential barrier for wider adoption of mobile health services.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract It is observed that the technologies have invaded the classrooms, providing increasingly attractive teaching methods. Technologies have challenged school institutions to keep up with this new reality. In some cases, the technologies offered aim, to a certain extent, to meet some educational needs of students and soften deficiencies in classroom teaching. The arrival of digital technologies in classrooms brings great advances, but also brings many uncertainties and insecurities, giving rise to new tensions, new possibilities and new challenges. With today's technologies, the school environment can transform into a meaningful, face-to-face and digital learning environment, making students more active, motivating them to learn and search all the time. The present work aims to present the advantages and disadvantages of these digital methods, as well as to demonstrate the applicability of these technologies in the current daily life of school institutions. It also presents some important aspects about the use of technologies in the learning process, discussing how the use of virtual simulations software can contribute to the teaching of Physics.

"Abstract Heart failure (HF) is one of the main causes of morbimortality in Brazil. However, little is known about the characteristics of the Brazilian HF population assisted at the community level, including the use of HF medications and frequency of hospitalizations. ePHealth is an app-based large-scale digital data collection platform that currently has health data on more than 1.5 million people. To assess the use of evidence-based HF medications, hospitalizations and epidemiological characteristics of HF patients in Brazil. This is an observational retrospective study of the digital health data collected using the ePHealth platform on individuals, who self-reported a diagnosis of HF. Data collected included sociodemographics, clinical data, risk factors, comorbidities, medications and hospitalizations. Data collected at more than 40,000 home visits on 5907 individuals with HF were analysed. Majority of them were female, aged 55 to 75 years and brown (Figure 1). About 36% were married, 20% were illiterate, 65% were retired and 66% earned ≤2 minimum wages. Mean BMI was 26.7 kg/m2 (SD 5.9), risk factors and comorbidities were frequent (Figure 1). The use of HF medications was very low (Table 1). There were 575 hospitalizations (9.7%), due to the main following reasons: probable or definite heart failure decompensation (89, 15.5%), heart attack (60, 10.4%), cardiovascular procedures (54, 9.4%) and stroke (42, 7.3%). This data suggests that community-level use of evidence-based cardiovascular medications in a population of individuals with HF in Brazil is very low and that hospitalizations are frequent. This study also provides a better understanding of the characteristics of a population of HF individuals, using large-scale real-world data collected on a community-level via an entirely digital platform. ePHealth is a disruptive platform able to provide data on the burden of HF and other cardiovascular diseases, informing decisions on implementation of prevention and management programmes.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract While Brazilian governmental initiatives focused on home broadband Internet access, availability of computers for students in schools has been drastically reduced since 2010. Furthermore, schools usually prohibits mobile Internet access in its premises, contrarily to the migration of students' access to smartphones. This study investigates the impact of the increasing home and mobile Internet access on the existing educational inequalities. This study made use of quantitative, locally statistical research to investigate the reproduction or closing of existing educational digital divide across already contrasting Brazilian regions. Child or adolescent from 9 to 17 years of age and their guardians, interviewed by CETIC.br. Data was obtained from the CETIC.br data portal and the Google Trends webpage. Data were analyzed by means of local geostatistical measures of spatial autocorrelation and inequality, as well as bivariate choropleth maps. Our results suggest that the Brazilian school system is failing to cultivate in their students the more productive use of Internet access and therefore contributing to the widening of the existing second-level digital divide between regions and social classes. This digital divide was critically exacerbated by the arrival of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of presential classes. Brazilian policymakers should concentrate efforts and resources in addressing this large-scale second-level digital divide, possibly by equipping educators and students with the knowledge and skills towards the educational, productive and responsible use of the Internet, as well as allowing mobile Internet access in school premises.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract Research on the use of mobile technology in health sciences has identified several advantages of so-called mHealth (mobile health) applications. Tablet-supported clinical assessments are becoming more and more prominent in clinical applications, even in low-income countries. The present study used tablet computers for assessments of clinical symptom profiles in a sample of Burundian AMISOM soldiers (i.e., African Union Mission to Somalia; a mission approved by the UN). The study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of mHealth-supported assessments in field research in Burundi. The study was conducted in a resource-poor setting, in which tablet computers are predestined to gather data in an efficient and reliable manner. The overall goal was to prove the validity of the obtained data as well as the feasibility of the chosen study setting. Four hundred sixty-three soldiers of the AMISOM forces were investigated after return from a 1-year military mission in Somalia. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were assessed. The used data-driven approach based on a latent profile analysis revealed the following four distinct groups, which are based on the soldiers' PTSD and depression symptom profiles: Class 1: moderate PTSD, Class 2: moderate depression, Class 3: low overall symptoms, and Class 4: high overall symptoms. Overall, the four identified classes of soldiers differed significantly in their PTSD and depression scores. The study clearly demonstrates that tablet-supported assessments can provide a useful application of mobile technology in large-scale studies, especially in resource-poor settings.

"Abstract In the wake of globalization discourses and the so-called spatial turn space and place have become central concepts in the social sciences and humanities and in migration studies in particular. Increasingly, and despite the widespread transformations in the ways we move and communicate today, place-making has gained important attention as a practice among diaspora groups, forced migrants, and refugees. To further advance insights in this field of research, the present study investigates the role of communication technologies in the place-making practices of the Yanacona indigenous community, which has been internally displaced in Colombia. In-depth interview data revealed that, for the Yanacona community, place-making is a collective process driven by cultural values of cooperation, collaboration, and solidarity. Building networks of support, protecting the community from disappearing, and restoring the collective identity are three practices that the Yanacona have adapted to make a place in the city of Bogotá. In this process, smartphones and social media are particularly relevant for many of the interviewees, who expressed both advantages and negative implications of these technologies for their community. Results also revealed how indigenous communities take on processes of social construction of technology, challenging the archaism discourse that hinders these communities, especially in the Global South. This study recognizes the relevance of paying attention to emergent indigenous media practices and networks in Colombia, arguing that they can be crucial for a community's cultural survival after forced migration.

"Abstract Introduction: The use of mobile applications has increased in the last years. Most of them require the knowledge of the user location, either for their core service or for marketing purposes. Location-based services (LBS) offer context-based assistance to users based on their location. Although these applications ask the user for permission to use their location and even explain in detail how this information will be used in its terms and conditions, most users are not aware or even interested in the fact that their location information is stored in databases and monetized by selling it to third-party companies. Regarding this situation, we developed a study with the aim to assess perception, concerns and awareness from users about their location information. Results: The results show that, in general, the respondents do not have a real concern regarding the privacy of their geolocation data, and the majority is not willing to pay to protect their privacy. Conclusions: This type of surveys can generate awareness among participants about the use of their private information. The results expose in this paper can be used to create government policies and regulations by technology companies about the privacy management.",AreaData privacy Data
"Abstract The  introduction  of  Information  and  Communications Technologies  (ICT)  in  the educational  sphere  is  becoming  more  and  more  essential  due  to  its  potential  as  a pedagogical tool. This study aims to evaluate some factors that facilitate and hinder the pedagogical use of ICT in the context of learning English as a second language (L2) at preschool education levels. Through the methodology of Design Thinking, it is possible to structure the characteristics that a playful interface should have in order to support this educational process and, especially, to satisfy the needs of an environment that intends to make the most of the technological resources  it has. To this end, this  methodology takes into account the experience of direct users (children), indirect users (teachers) and the socio-economic dimension of educational centres, headed by managers. In this sense, two ad  hoc questionnaires were  completed by  the  school  executives  and  teachers, respectively,  in  a  specific  educational context  of  Barranquilla,  Colombia.  The questionnaires were administered to 25 schools. Data analysis showed the importance of ICT in improving the teaching and assessment process. At the same time, it shows the levels of frustration of some teachers who use technologies with low levels of training or with self-generated content that limit the use of ICT in an appropriate way. These results will  outline a  number  of characteristics  that  should  be considered  when  implementing actions to improve the teaching of English in the classroom using digital tools.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract In limited-resource settings such as the Dominican Republic, many factors contribute to poor health outcomes experienced by adolescent mothers, including insufficient support and/or health knowledge. In response, digital educational support group- was designed, administered through WhatsApp Messenger, for new adolescent mothers. The purpose of this study was to assess if participation in this digital support group could improve health outcomes and health behaviors. Participants completed questionnaires with a health literacy screener, demographic items, knowledge questions, the Index of Autonomous Functioning, and five Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales before and after the moderator-led intervention. Differences between pre- and post-intervention scores were calculated and perceptions of the intervention were explored through in-depth interviews analyzed with content analysis. Participants’ well-baby visit attendance and contraceptive use were compared to that of controls and a national sample. (3) Results: Participants’ (N = 58) knowledge scores increased (p < 0.05). Participants were 6.58 times more likely to attend well-baby visits than controls (95% CI: 2.23–19.4) and their contraceptive use was higher than that of the national sample (p < 0.05). Participants indicated the intervention was enjoyable and beneficial. This adolescent-centered digital intervention is a promising method to improve health outcomes and health behaviors of young mothers in limited-resource settings.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in the 21st Century in professional and personal lives. The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries' higher education institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teacher's digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context. Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract Nowadays, due to easiness and expansion in property of smart mobile devices, it is becoming inevitable for mobile applications to have an important role in higher education systems. The Egyptian public universities are facing the problem of students large number enrolled in each year. Thus, we lack proper communication between educators and learners. Mobile learning can solve that problem, and it enables adjustment of the curriculum to meet students' learning time and life situations. It provides different solutions better than traditional educational methods. Students and professors could exchange educational material or information even if they are not in the same class. Furthermore, the cost of universities' materials reduced, as all course materials can be found online through mobile applications. This paper proposes a mobile learning system named ""Easy-Edu"". The proposed system intended to make the learning process easier, focus on students needs, and encourage communication and collaboration between students and professors and supports collaborative scenario-based learning for university students. Unlike other traditional systems, the proposed ""Easy-Edu"" was built using an Agile-based approach that delivers sustainable and high-quality mobile learning system. In addition, it eliminates the chances of absolute system failure and detects and fixes issues faster. Summarily, everything related to the design and implementation of ""Easy-Edu"" is discussed.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract During the last 10 years, different initiatives have been implemented to provide mobile-based extension services for the agricultural sector in Egypt. The current study compared the quality of agricultural extension messages between public and private providers. A simple random sample of 120 farmers was selected representing 7% of the total farmers registered in the databases of Ministry of Agriculture (public services) and Shoura company (private services). Farmers assessed a sample of 10 messages delivered by both providers in terms of six indicators namely (1) access, (2) utilization, (3) timeliness, (4) trust, (5) satisfaction, and (6) sharing information with other farmers. The findings revealed the lack of access to messages by the farmers in the two services. However, more than 50% had utilized the majority of messages (in case of access). The study also showed significant differences between perception of farmers to quality attributes in public and private services (Access 6.77, 0.01; Utilization 8.44, 0.004; Timeliness 8.55, 0.002; Satisfaction 8.88, 0.001; information sharing 7.62, 0.009) except for trust (1.11, 0.4). Findings provide practical implications to support mobile-based extension services to enable sharing information and link farmers with other actors in the agricultural value chain.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract Mobile money, a service permitting monetary value to be digitally stored in a mobile phone and transacted to others through text messaging, is increasingly becoming available in several African countries including Eswatini. This study examines the factors associated with mobile money usage and the extent to which mobile money accelerates financial inclusion in Eswatini. Data were collected from the nationally representative FinScope Consumer Survey for Eswatini conducted in 2014. The authors use a quasi-experimental method in propensity score matching (PSM) with bootstrapped standard errors to alleviate the possibility of selection bias associated with mobile money use and bank account ownership. As a sensitivity check, the authors calculate the average treatment effect (ATE) using kernel-based matching methods, as well as estimate a multilevel model that accounts for the hierarchical structure of data. The authors found that higher education, entrepreneurship, being female, improvement in work situation in the past year and living in urban area and in the Lubombo region all positively influence the probability to use mobile money. The results also show that individuals who use mobile money are 19% more likely to own a bank account at a formal financial institution with a higher probability estimate observed amongst rural residents.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract ICT is used to enhance the overall activities of individuals, administrative processes of businesses and various governmental and non-governmental organizations. Despite its advantage in all aspects of development, it has drawn low attention in expanding the services in general and utilizing the technology in particular. Therefore, this study was aimed to explore the main factors that affected the usage of ICT in Illubabor zone, Ethiopia. A descriptive cross-sectional study design with quantitative and qualitative data collection method was carried out. The data was collected from 195 samples by using structured questionnaires and observations by employing simple random and purposive sampling techniques. SPSS version 16 was used for data analysis. The study confirmed that lack of computer skill training for staff and lack of sufficient budget for the provision of ICT are the major bottlenecks in expanding ICT service in the zone.

We draw from several theoretical frameworks and also from comments of Ethiopian academics, writers, and publishers to ground descriptions of Ethiopian contexts of language and literacy. We then present three different models for the production and curation of digital stories for children and contemplate how these models align with existing literacy traditions and practices. We also raise questions about the potential effects on the development of literary culture and childrenâ€™s literature in Ethiopia of projects aimed at rapidly producing large corpora of literature for children. Ultimately, we pose complicated cultural and linguistic questions that need to be taken into consideration to provide appropriate and original early literacy materials in Ethiopia.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract This paper aims to identify the dynamic capabilities of government organisations in Woredas of Ethiopia that digitally innovate on the existing government digital platform, the WoredaNet. The study adopted a qualitative interpretive case study strategy using three government administrative regions in Ethiopia (called Woredas), which digitally innovate using the government digital platform, the WoredaNet. A structured interview protocol was implemented for data collection. In total, 5 respondents representing users, information and communication technology (ICT) staff and management were selected from each of the Woredas (districts), yielding a total of 15 respondents.
Drawing from the dynamic capabilities literature, the findings reveal that the digital platform governance model plays the strongest role in digital government innovation. Specifically, the Woredas exhibit highly developed adaptive capabilities through learning from the affordances offered by the digital platform. Also, despite the collaborative nature of their absorptive capabilities, there are no clear organisational structures to manifest these capabilities (integrating new learnings). The innovative capabilities (creating digital government products or service innovations) are constrained by the governance model, which is centralised in one ICT unit. The research is limited to one of the Regional States of Ethiopia. Further studies would be needed to consider other regional states and more Woredas. The research provides a means through which dynamic capabilities can improve digital innovation on government digital platforms, despite the scarcity of resources, especially in low-income countries. The paper contributes to digital government and dynamic capability literature in revealing how digital innovations in government agencies might be organisationally enhanced through distributed digital platform governance models.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract This study aimed at determining access to mobile phone and willingness to receive mobile phone-based diabetes health services as well as identify associated factors in Northwest Ethiopia.
An institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to March 2016. Systematic randomly selected 423 patients with diabetes from University of Gondar Hospital diabetic clinic. The main outcome measure was willingness to receive diabetic health service via mobile phone voice call or messaging services. Out of 423 patients with diabetes, 329 (77.8%) had access to a mobile phone. Among the latter, 232 (70.5%) were willing to receive mobile phone-based health services. The educational status of patients (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.6 (95% CI: 1.2 to 5.58)), route of medication (AOR: 3.2 (95% CI: 1.44 to 7.1)), transportation mechanism (AOR: 4.1 (95% CI: 1.2 to 13.57)), travel time to health facility (AOR: 0.3 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.82)), current use of mobile phone as appointment reminder (AOR: 2.6 (95% CI: 1.07 to 6.49)) and locking mobile phone with passwords (AOR: 4.6 (95% CI: 1.63 to 12.95)) were significantly associated with the willingness to receive mobile phone-based diabetic health services.
Access to a mobile phone and willingness to receive mobile phone-based health services were high. Educational status, route of medication, transportation mechanism, time to reach the service, using mobile phone as appointment reminder and locking mobile phone with passwords were significantly associated factors. Given the high proportion of access and willingness of patients to receive mobile phone-based health services, mHealth interventions could be helpful.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The proper use of Partograph supports to capture key maternal and fetal data. Paper-based Partograph are prone to error, incompleteness, delayed decisions and loss of clients' information. Electronic (e-Partograph) enables to easily retain and retrieve client data to ensure quality of care. Mobile technologies found an opportunity for resource-limited countries to improve access and quality of health care. Evidences were lacking on end users' acceptance to e-Partograph. This study aimed to assess obstetric care providers' willingness to use mobile based e-Partograph and its associated factors. Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 30, 2016 to January 21, 2017. A total 466 obstetric care providers were selected using multistage sampling technique in North Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data were entered in to Epi info version 7 and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Cronbach's Alpha test was calculated to evaluate the reliability of data. A multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with dependent variable. Adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was used to determine the presence of association The study found that 460(99.6%) of care providers owned mobile phone. Smartphone owners accounted only 102(22%). Of them, 205(46%) were willing to use mobile-phone for e-Partograph. Care providers aged 30 years (AOR=2.85, 95% C.I: 1.34-6.05), medical doctors and higher level clinicians (AOR=8.35, 95% C.I: 2.07-33.63), Health Center (AOR=4.41, 95% C.I:.10-9.26), favorable attitude towards Partograph (AOR=2.76, 95% C.I: 1.49-5.09) and related in-service trainings (AOR=7.63, 95% C.I: 3.96-14.69) were enabling factors for willingness to use mobile phone. Almost all obstetric care providers had access to mobile phone, however; smartphone ownership is still low. Willingness to use mobile-phone for e-Partograph was low. Younger aged, lower level clinicians, Hospital based workers, unfavorable attitude on Partograph and lack of in-service trainings were main factors for non-willingness.

"Abstract Mobile payment is an electronic payment made through a mobile device. As the number of mobile phone subscribers in Ghana increases, so does the market for mobile money services. The majority of Ghanaians lack any formal bank account. An estimated 80 percent of Ghanaians are ""unbanked“ meaning they conduct their transactions outside the banking sector with no access to financial services. Products like ""mobile money,"" that enable safe and secure money transfers without the use of a bank account, could have a major impact on this unserved segment of the population. Mobile money gives anyone with a mobile phone the ability to transfer money, make cash payments and conduct other financial transactions over the phone. Currently, there are four mobile money payment systems in Ghana, namely, MTN mobile money, Vodafone (VF) cash, Tigo cash and Airtel money. For an effective operation of these systems, Privacy, Traceability, Cost of Transaction, and Simplicity of the Processes involved are of much interest. The study examined the loopholes in the current mobile payment systems and proposed a framework to address the loopholes such as: Entering of information on next of kin into the system during registration, acceptance of year of birth as PIN, transactional PIN decrypted, no entering of a Valid ID number into the system, no provision for security word during token cash out, no provision for guarantor information, no provision for BoG permit number, no provision for police clearance number, and data in transit not encrypted.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Since mid-March 2020, educational systems worldwide and particularly Ghana were under increasing pressure to use the new Digital Technologies (DTs) and mobile applications (apps) to assist teachers in guiding students to continue with online learning activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is aimed at assessing the utilization of DTs and apps tools by students during the COVID-19 pandemic and how those technologies have affected online learning in institutions of higher education in Ghana. The researcher adopted an online survey and exploratory-based design that utilized quantitative and qualitative approaches to purposively collect data from N=784 students from three major public universities in Ghana. Also, the study applied Uses and Gratification as the theoretical basis in understanding the utilization of DTs and their possible limitations for remote learning during the peak of COVID-19 in Ghana. This study reported that the specific DMTs and mobile apps used by students in higher education for online learning are smarts phones and apps such as Class In, Zoom, Skype, and Instagram live stream. This study also revealed that Personal Learning Network (PLN) such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter were also actively used by students for remote online learning. Again, the study shows that 77.1% of students in the sampled three universities were fully aware of the DTs and apps utilized for online learning during COVID-19. Also, the findings from this study report that students in higher institutions identified unstable electricity for continuous online learning, especially for those students in rural areas, unreliable internet service, poor WiFi connections, expensive smartphones / laptops, and high cost of inter bundle as key challenges of using DMTs and mobile apps for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, on the perceived usefulness of DTs and mobile apps among students for online learning in higher educational institutions, the findings from this study suggest that DMT's and apps were of great benefit to students for remote online learning.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which individual factors such as academic tasks, preference for print sources and information skills influence distance learners' use of digital libraries in a teacher distance education programme at the University of Education, Winneba in Ghana. The population of the study consisted of 1,834 distance students and from a sample size of 641 distance learners spread across three distance study centers, namely, Winneba (247), Kumasi (276) and Asante-Mampong (118). A total of 453 (70.67 percent) distance learners, selected randomly, completed a 31-item questionnaire. In addition, 30 distance education tutors, four coordinators and four librarians were purposively selected to participate in the study. The findings showed that academic tasks of distance learners did not require them to use digital library resources, which resulted in low or no academic use of digital libraries. The findings also pointed to a high preference for print resources among distance learners which resulted in the low use of digital library resources. Finally, it was noted that even though most of the distance learners possessed basic ICT skills, this did not result in their of use of digital library resources. To improve digital library use in distance education, it is recommended that academic librarians seek and foster collaboration in teaching information literacy and library instruction in distance education, an approach which must be backed by a policy that mandates the use of (digital) library scholarly resources in teaching and learning in distance education. It is also recommended that the Centre for Distance Education and the University Library collaborate to offer training programmes in specific digital resources and general information literacy courses for all distance education stakeholders in the university to boost digital library use.",AreaData systems and

These digital governance initiatives include the electronic or digital-health care systems, e-justice system paperless clearing of goods at port-banking, and other online services. Paramount among the many digital initiatives is the introduction of drones for emergency digital health delivery. Access to medical supplies in Ghana has been hindered by the difficulty of getting the supplies from the central points to other areas that are remotely located to enable the patients who need the services to get them. To overcome this challenge and deliver affordable and accessible health care services to the Ghanaian populace, the Government of Ghana engaged a US-based company Zipline Technology to use Drones in the supply of medical supplies for emergencies and hard-to-reach areas of the country. Since the introduction of this initiative in 2019, it has attracted mix-reactions from various stakeholders on the relevance of the drone technology project on health delivery in Ghana. This study used the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a theoretical framework to assess drone technology’s impact on Ghana’s emergency health delivery system.

"Abstract This study reviewed the design and deployment of relational geodatabase on mobile GIS application, using collector for ArcGIS and survey 123 for ArcGIS platforms for COVID-19 contact tracing in Ghana during the lockdown. The study assessed whether cases spread by physical neighborhood contacts, defined by a 2km buffer of initial known 60 cases location. The application was deployed on the android tablet, which was used by field workers. Application Post-deployment review shows that from 30th March to 4th April 2020, 828 samples were collected with 34 confirmed cases, of which 61% occurred outside the 2km buffer. From 1-30 April 2020, 8,748 individuals with 16,087 contacts were tested within the physical neighbourhoods, 2.4% turned positive. Similarly, 7,501 individuals with 17,071 contacts were tested outside the physical neighbourhoods with 4.3% positives. Results suggest that more infections occurred outside the case's physical neighbourhoods possibly due to; (1) existence of unknown cases prior to lockdown; (2) cases were moving outside their physical neighborhood and infecting others; (3) panic movements of cases within the 3 days window between announcement and enforcement of lockdown; (4) movement of cases into the country through unapproved routes. New cases were identified outside the lockdown areas, which could not be explained. This study raises questions about (1) the understanding of the mode of spread of the virus (2) the implementation of the lockdown, including the geographic coverage and timing. It is recommended that future decisions on contact tracing and lockdown should be guided by an understanding of the disease geography.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The impact of mobile money services in Africa have been largely recognised. However, empirical studies are principally lacking on the factors influencing the decision to own a mobile phone (first hurdle), register with mobile money (second hurdle) and the intensity of use of mobile money services (third hurdle). This study examined the determinants of the mobile phone ownership, drivers of registration (participation) of mobile money services, and the intensity of use of mobile money services in rural Ghana by employing the triple hurdle approach. The first and second hurdle were analysed using the logit model while quasi-poisson regression was used to analyse the third hurdle. The analysis from the cross-sectional data showed that the decision to own a mobile phone was driven by household size, marital status, the farm size, access to electricity, income status and the type of occupation engaged, whereas the decision to register with mobile money was influenced by the age, educational status, marital status, household size, farm size and the type of occupation engaged in by the household head. The intensity of usage of mobile money services was influenced by the age of the household head, higher educational level, marital status of the household head, household and farm size as well as the distance of the household heads from the mobile money agent which directly influences the intensity of use of mobile money services by household heads. The study recommends that strategies that promote access to electricity and occupation in the formal sector or both farming and trading in the rural communities should be promoted. Furthermore, policy attention should focus on location, farmers and farm characteristics.",AreaDigital finance Digital

The results show that workers use hybrid-ity  of  digital  and  non-digital  literacy  artifacts  in obtaining retirement planning information. The users of non-digital literacy can be termed as the socially excluded from digital space use. These  are  discussed  focusing  on  uses,  func-tioning, capability, and agency. Digital literacy facilitates retirement planning information ac-cess through enhanced media and other litera-cies  and  associated  competencies,  skills,  and  dispositions,  while  retirement  planning  offers  opportunities for obtaining the requisite infor-mation  with  implications  for  social  inclusion.  A  Cramer’s  V  test  of  0.705  indicates  a  strong  association  between  retirement  planning  in-formation  sources  and  helpfulness.  Compara-tively, more formal sector workers are exposed to, and/or users of digital artifacts and literacy due  to  their  nature  of  work  and  are  thus  digi-tally  literate  with  implications  for  inequality  considerations.  This  may  have  consequences  for  increasing  disparities  in  retirement  prepa-ration.

Through the Antecedents, Privacy, Concerns, and Outcome (APCO) model, the study developed a research model that was hypothesized and evaluated with 316 respondents from a tertiary institution. The data was analyzed through the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that whilst antecedent variable Gender influences Privacy Concern, Experience on the other hand does not. Also, Enjoyment, Privacy Risk, and Trust influence Usage Continuance Intention. Also, Application Popularity influences Change Privacy Settings. Again, Privacy Concern influence Privacy Risk but does not influence Trust. Moreover, Enjoyment, Privacy Risk, and Trust do not influence Change Privacy Settings. This study has given the researchers insights as to why users continue to use Mobile Apps despite the Privacy Concerns that have been raised in the literature. Other implications for theory, policy, and practice are also discussed.",AreaData privacy Data
"Abstract Although mobile money (MM) has been explored in the existing literature, the roles of trust and risk in MM use have received little attention from researchers. Furthermore, many of the existing studies have treated these constructs as unidimensional. The extant literature also shows that perceived risk has received little attention from researchers who have conducted studies on MM. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the roles of trust and perceived risk in customers' intent to adopt MM services in Ghana. Both trust and perceived risk were broken down into various dimensions. The study involved 671 respondents who were selected via an intercept approach and an online survey. Structural equation modelling was used to test the study's hypotheses. The findings show that perceived risk is negatively associated with customers' intent to use MM services and economy-based trust. Trust in service providers and economy-based trust are positively associated with customers' intent to use MM services. The implications of the findings are provided in the latter part of this study.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract In the last two decades, microfinance institutions across regions have helped to financially build small businesses in areas of disadvantaged populations. The efforts in providing entrepreneurs with small non-collateralized loans (or micro-loans) along with developing cooperative programs for entrepreneurs were reported in earlier studies as being helpful in alleviating some borrowers from extreme economic poverty. However, early warning signals were raised about whether microfinance institutions were benefiting themselves more than the poor. This article assesses the differences in attitudes toward the use of information and communication technology among small business owners in Ghana that have access to micro-loans. The findings indicate significant differences between interest payers and interest non-payers based on region of the country, age, education, and membership in an entrepreneurship program.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Fraud is a global economic menace which threatens the survival of individuals, firms, industries and economies, and the mobile money service is no exception. This paper aims to explore the main causes of fraud in the mobile money services in Ghana and the measures to combat the menace by the key stakeholders connected to the mobile money services. The paper is motivated by recent reports of numerous fraudulent transactions on the mobile money platform, and the need to clamp down these nefarious transactions with effective and practical measures to sustain the service. A thorough review of existing studies on fraud risk relating to mobile money services was done revealing a paucity of literature on the subject. Primary data were gathered using an interview guide to explore the magnitude of the problem based on the views of employees of mobile money operators, mobile money agents, banking supervisors from Bank of Ghana, employees of partnering banks, employees of National Communications Authority and mobile money subscribers.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract Digital technology plays an important role in achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, access is uneven, with 80% of those in high-income countries being online compared to 20% of those in the 47 least developed countries. This study aimed to describe and analyse adolescents' access to and usage of digital technology in Guinea-Bissau and its implications. In June 2017, a survey with a locally adapted Planet Youth questionnaire was implemented in the capital, Bissau, whereby classes in 16 secondary schools were surveyed on a variety of issues. In total, 2039 randomly selected students participated; the survey included ten questions specifically on the access to and use of digital technology. Half of the respondents had access to desktop/laptops, and one-third used mobile internet daily; about two-thirds had an experience of social media. Explanatory variables included educational institution, parental education, economic situation, and gender. Furthermore, students' experience of social media was significantly linked to bullying, anxiety, depression, smoking and alcohol consumption. Many adolescents in Bissau have no experience of using digital technology, including for schoolwork. Access improvements are necessary so that young Bissau-Guineans are not to be left behind in developing their capabilities and can benefit from proficiency in the use of digital technologies. At the same time, potential harmful usage of the media requires the implementation of preventive measures.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract In recent years, Reliance Jio’s offer of 4G services, guaranteeing free voice calls and ‘unlimited’ data streaming, lead to disruption in the Indian telecom market with other cellular operators losing their revenue and customer base. To comprehensively analyze this churn in the Indian telecom industry and its impact on mobile phone customers, the article argues for observing the entanglement of infrastructural and platform-related discourses at three levels of operation: Jio’s strategies to capture the Indian telecom market and the responses by the leading incumbent service provider (Airtel), ordinary citizens’ phone use practices and infrastructural encounters, and the government’s vision for India’s digital future. Connecting pipes to platforms, Jio made infrastructural investments (in spectrum, cell towers, and fiber optics networks) to promote its suite of apps (JioTV, JioChat, and JioMoney). Ordinary citizens relate their access/proximity to telecom infrastructure (cell antennas) to their ability to effectively use apps on their phones. ‘Digital India’ vision purportedly facilitated infrastructural growth to create platforms that would support demonetization and facilitate transparent governance. Through such a three-pronged analysis, I conceptualize ‘infrastructural imaginaries’ that are coproduced by states and citizens, and lie at the intersection of structured state policy/corporate initiatives and lived experiences/affective encounters of ordinary citizens.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract This article assesses the rationale for India’s November 2016 demonetization, in terms of its origins and impact over the following year. I argue that this intervention was conceived and understood as part of a larger international monetary experiment. The article draws upon international media commentary, impact assessments by Indian scholars and the professed goals of the Government of India. Having established a direct link between demonetization and an advancing ‘cashless agenda’ around the world, I situate Narendra Modi’s Digital India programme as the putative foundation for a transactional economy. Drawing upon ethnographic studies exploring the everyday experience of India’s year of living digitally, this article raises the critical question of who must, or indeed can, bear the transaction costs of this digital utopia. In conclusion, I argue that the rapid expansion of digital money situates these concerns at the heart of social and cultural, as much as economic, analysis.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Film, television, and music form a major domestic and export product in India. Whereas, in the past, content production has been restricted to professional producers, digital media platforms have drastically altered the landscape of content production in India. Through in-depth interviews of ten online content creators, the article describes motivations of online content creation in India. Discussion themes include professional activities, identity construction of creators, and quasi-corporate structures that are taking root in the democratized digital spaces in India. In doing so, the article challenges the notion of creators on social media as mere ""amateurs"" or ""UGC"" (user-generated content). Conclusions from this study suggest future research should take a more holistic approach to studying online content creators rather than classifying creators on the basis of platform affordances.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract In this special issue, we examine the two decades of digital media expansion in India, the world’s second largest Internet user domain, to propose the idea of “millennial India.” Millennial India highlights the processes of digitalization as a distinct sociopolitical moment entailing new conditions of communication, and the stakes of “millennials” who are drawn to digital media to articulate political matters. These processes, we suggest, have led to a democratization of public participation through the self-activity of online users. Qualifying the assumption that participation leads to empowerment, we show that a politics of civic action has grown simultaneously with violent exclusions via digital circulation.

"Abstract A high burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is contributing to high mortality and morbidity in India. Recent advancements in digital health interventions, including mHealth, eHealth, and telemedicine, have facilitated patient-centered care for NCDs. 
 This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence on digital interventions for people living with NCDs in India and the outcomes of those interventions.  We adopted PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Scopus databases with following criteria: journal articles presenting digital intervention(s) used by people with at least one of the NCDs, reporting health outcomes following the intervention, studies conducted in India among Indian population.  Among 1669 articles retrieved from multiple sources, only 13 articles met our criteria. Most ( n=7) studies were conducted in southern states of India; eight studies included patients with diabetes, followed by neuropsychiatric disorders and other NCDs. Five studies recruited participants from tertiary hospitals; six interventions used text-messaging for delivering health services, and 10 studies reported randomized controlled trials. All the studies reported positive health outcomes following the intervention, including better self-management, increased patient-provider communication, improved medication adherence, and reduced disease symptoms. Most studies scored moderate to high in quality assessment checklist of Downs and Black. Current evidence suggests a low number of interventions with positive outcomes.

"Abstract The physical discomfort and collection of symptoms after digital screen use for longer than two hours at a time is referred by the Vision Council as digital eye strain (DES). Common symptoms of DES are eyestrain, headache, blurred vision, dry eyes and pain in neck and shoulders. This study aims to know about the prevalence; factors associated with and awareness about preventive measures for DES among college students.
A cross-sectional study was conducted for 2 months in 2017 among randomly selected 200 college students of 20 to 30 years of age in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh using a pre-designed semi-structured questionnaire. Mean age of participants was 22.5 years; of which 58% were females. Of the respondents, 89.5% (179 students) reported experiencing DES. Average distance from digital screen, brightness level of digital device, use of digital device before going to sleep and awareness about appropriate distance of digital screen from eyes had statistically significant association with having digital eye strain. 98% of respondents were unaware of the term DES while >60% did not have knowledge about the harmful blue light emitted by digital devices, protective use of digital screen filters, appropriate distance of viewing digital screen and the 20-20-20 rule of taking breaks in between screen time.

"Abstract Financial Inclusion is still a major challenge for the India, despite of being one of major agenda since 2004-2005, due to difficulty in reaching far flung areas of the country comprising 600,000 villages. This has huge implications on economic development of the country. Therefore there is regular thrust from Government of India (GoI) to bring everyone to the ambit of formal banking system through various schemes. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MGNREGA) is one of the major GoI schemes that have contributed significantly to financial inclusion in India.

"Abstract In India, most patients maintain a personal copy of their medical record in paper form which is hard to manage and collate. Newly diagnosed cancer patients and their doctors have an insurmountable task of consuming and using that information. Making this information available in an easy to consume format as well as recording a patient's cancer experience is a technical challenge. We piloted an innovative mobile application to address this pain point. A pilot engagement was performed with 100+ cancer patients visiting a non-profit oncology center between March 2019 and January 2020 in a suburb of New Delhi, India. Systematic medical information was captured on stage, TNM, molecular markers, tumor size, tests, and treatments. We assessed the utility of a digital health application for the purpose of cancer information management and ease of use by the medical team. Data for a total of 65 patients with a single cancer and diagnosis and treatment information was captured. Patients were between the ages of 23 and 78, mean age 49. Of these patients, there were 21 (32%) early stage cases ( <Stage 3), 23 (35%) late stage cases ( >Stage 2), and 21 (32%) cases with missing stage. Overall, 39 (60%) received a chemotherapy only regimen, 2 (3%) radiation only, 6 (9%) surgery only, 6 (9%) received chemotherapy and radiation, 11 (17%) received surgery and chemotherapy, and 1 (1%) patient received surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Clinic staff reported that the application was easy to use and helpful. We continue to enhance the application with staff feedback. We demonstrate the feasibility and value of moving to a next generation digitized mobile platform circumventing the need for a traditional EMR system at a busy non-profit oncology clinic in the suburbs of New Delhi, India. Using the pilot, we make a case that this type of technology has the ability to transform cancer care for rural and low-resource cancer centers.

"Abstract Information and communication technology (ICT) such as Internet, mobile phones, computers and related network interfaces facilitate promotion of economic growth by improving the allocation and productivity of labour and capital, and also by promoting trade and competition in market. But these regional developments led by ICT technologies are not realised if there is a digital divide. In India, uneven digital developments may lead to uneven economic developments. Unless ICT developments grow faster in low-income states, they cannot catch up with high-income states, economically. In this context, this article aims to analyse the changing pattern of the digital divide and empirically examines the convergence in access to ICT facilities across the Indian states. The secondary data for 15 major states of India is used for the time period 2008-17 by considering three ICT variables, namely, telephone users, mobile phone users and Internet users per 100 populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to construct ICT access index. With PCA scores, the Indian states are ranked at two data points and convergence is verified by using sigma and beta convergence techniques. Findings suggest that there is an uneven access to ICT facilities across the Indian states. In the last decade, the low-income states are growing on a better pace than the high-income states in providing access to facilities such as telephone and mobile phones. However, there is evidence of the divergence in the use of Internet facilities. So the governments' attention in improving these facilities in the low-income states, particularly in rural areas and lagging districts, is important. Special policies and schemes need to be devised to promote the access of Internet services in the lagging states.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

Our results indicate that exposure to this intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of both mainstream and false news headlines, but effects on the latter were significantly larger. As a result, the intervention improved discernment between mainstream and false news headlines among both a nationally representative sample in the United States (by 26.5%) and a highly educated online sample in India (by 17.5%). This increase in discernment remained measurable several weeks later in the United States (but not in India).

"Abstract Erstwhile faith and belief in media and its potential for development spurred the growth of broadcasting to its present level in India. The arrival of printing press in the early phase of European colonialization subsequently lead to print journalism that is now more than 240 years old. Its sustained growth and coexistence with the new media in digital India is contrary to developments in many other nations where erstwhile print journalism is giving way to convergent media. Reforms in the telecom sector and corresponding institutional arrangements have led to the formulation of an ambitious digital India programme.  This programme focusses more on enhancing the access and equity to the rural population. The nebulous distinction between legacy media and social media has raised several issues including governance, production and consumption of content and delivery of welfare services including financial inclusion. These challenges are sought to be addressed through the digital infrastructure. Solving contemporary problems within the fragile and vulnerable social structure are daunting including the challenges posed by user generated content.

"Abstract Introduction: Task sharing holds promise for scaling up depression care in countries such as India, yet requires training large numbers of non-specialist health workers. This pilot trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a digital program for training non-specialist health workers to deliver a brief psychological treatment for depression. Methods: Participants were non-specialist health workers recruited from primary care facilities in Sehore, a rural district in Madhya Pradesh, India. A three-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, comparing digital training alone (DGT) to digital training with remote support (DGT+), and conventional face-to-face training. The primary outcome was the feasibility and acceptability of digital training programs. Preliminary effectiveness was explored as changes in competency outcomes, assessed using a self-reported measure covering the specific knowledge and skills required to deliver the brief psychological treatment for depression. Outcomes were collected at pre-training and post-training. Results: Of 42 non-specialist health workers randomized to the training programs, 36 including 10 (72%) in face-to-face, 12 (86%) in DGT, and 14 (100%) in DGT+ arms started the training. Among these participants, 27 (64%) completed the training, with 8 (57%) in face-to-face, 8 (57%) in DGT, and 11 (79%) in DGT+. The addition of remote telephone support appeared to improve completion rates for DGT+ participants. The competency outcome improved across all groups, with no significant between-group differences. However, face-to-face and DGT+ participants showed greater improvement compared to DGT alone. There were numerous technical challenges with the digital training program such as poor connectivity, smartphone app not loading, and difficulty navigating the course content issues that were further emphasized in follow-up focus group discussions with participants. Feedback and recommendations collected from participants informed further modifications and refinements to the training programs in preparation for a forthcoming large-scale effectiveness trial. Conclusions: This study adds to mounting efforts aimed at leveraging digital technology to increase the availability of evidence-based mental health services in primary care settings in low-resource settings.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity
"Abstract With digital literacies becoming an essential competency for teachers across the world, recent educational policies in India emphasize teachers' ability to use digital technologies for pedagogic purposes and the use of digital technologies by teachers as one of the evaluation criteria for ranking institutions. In the absence of any properly established policy on in-service training in digital technologies for teachers, such policies cannot be expected to promote effective learning. Moreover, little effort is being made to keep track of the impact of training in digital technologies on teachers' pedagogic practices. In light of the above background, the proposed multiple-case study aims to explore changes in the practices of three English for Science and Technology (EST) teachers in India. The main objective of the study is to compare the teachers' technology integration practices before and after they participated in a 12-hour need-based training programme in digital technologies. Data for the study were collected through questionnaires, interviews, classroom observations, field notes and e-portfolios. Results suggest that the programme had a positive impact on their practices and there was difference in the way the three teachers selected, used and thought about digital technologies.

Eligible individuals included those aged 18 years and above, residing in these slums, and who provided voluntary consent to participate in the study. Individuals with mental or physical challenges were excluded from the study. Our results showed that females were half as likely to own mobile phones compared with males (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.76), less likely to have internet access (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.11), or know how to send text messages (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.66-1.31). The predictors of mobile phone ownership, internet access, and text messaging between males and females included age, individual education, housing type, and the number of earning members in a household in the adjusted analysis. Among males, the number of earning members was a predictor of both mobile phone ownership and text messaging, whereas household education was a predictor of both internet access and text messaging. Age and individual education only predicted internet access, whereas housing type only predicted text messaging. Among females, household education was a predictor of all the technology outcomes. Age and type of toilet facility only predicted mobile phone ownership; housing type only predicted internet access whereas television ownership with satellite service and smoking behavior only predicted text messaging. Our study findings showing disparate access to technology within gender groups lend support for further research to examine the causal mechanisms promoting these differences to proffer significant solutions. Specifically, our study findings suggest that improving household education is crucial to address the disparate access and usage of mobile phones, the internet, and text messaging among women in slum settings. This suggestion is due to the consistency in household educational level as a predictor across all these technology indicators. In addition, the mechanisms by which the number of household earning members influences the disparate access to technology among men call for further exploration.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract This study aims to endeavor to explore the extent of gender digital divide(GDD) in Uttar Pradesh (U.P., IT-Hub of North India), a most populous state of India, with a particular focus on the first and second order of digital divide, including availability, access time and use of the internet. The authors have adopted stratified multistage sampling procedure for this research and conducted an empirical study on the data set of 600 respondents of six districts of U.P. to perform the inter-regional analysis. Furthermore,  method has been used to reveal the factors responsible for the GDD among selected districts of UP. Statistical results clearly indicate that out of 12 sub-districts, most of the districts suffered from first order as well as second order of GDD, and this gender disparity within an increasing digitization environment is due to the existence of exclusion from basic technological skills, social norms and financial constraints. This study is the first to illustrate the orders of the digital gender gap in a developing economy such as India and to gain an insight into the factors behind it. This research will also consider a promising avenue for future work.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to know the frequency, place, and purpose of use of computer. It also aimed to know the various problems faced by the students in using the computer and to know the reasons for not using computer by rural and urban students. A total of the 2,592 sample population were selected from 64 rural and urban high schools of two districts of Karnataka state.

"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents of the behavioral intention and adoption of mobile payment services like m-wallets and m-banking by users in India. This is done by examining the diffusion of mobile payment technology within an extended framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The study attempts to extend the UTAUT model further by introducing three more constructs, namely- perceived cost, perceived risk and demonetization effect and analyzes the impact of demonetization that happened in India from November 8, 2016 to December 30, 2016 on the mobile payment service adoption process.

"Abstract This paper aims to investigate the role of “perceived risks” in adopting mobile government (m-government) services in India. Conceding that “privacy risks” are one of the major factors that influence the adoption of e-services, the impact of “perceived risks” alongside “social efficacy,” “influence” of significant others and “attitude” on the adoption of m-government services in India has been underlined here. Specifically, the study has been conducted with 311 actual m-government users and constructs have been derived from existing theories like Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Multiple regression analysis has been conducted to analyze the data focused on constructs as: Perceived Risks (PR), Influence (I), Self-efficacy (SE), Attitude (ATT) and Behavioral Intention to Adopt m-government services (BI). Results show that while the respondents perceive that adoption of m-government services is risk-free and safe, there is no impact of the interpersonal relationships on m-government adoption. There is more inclination to adopt m-government services conceding that the respondents perceive that they have the self-efficacy to operate such services. M-government services are being tapped regularly by the respondents and there is more inclination to adopt m-government services among the public sector employees and self-employed respondents in comparison with the ones who are students or unemployed. In terms of age, those in the age group of 31–50 are more inclined to adopt m-government services in comparison with the rest.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to understand Indian consumers’ intention to use mobile payments by examining their adoption readiness (AR) in the larger context of their technology readiness (TR) and their privacy concerns (PCs). A four-city, three language, paper and pencil survey yielded a sample of 600 respondents from India. Data were analyzed using structural equations modeling. This study finds that AR positively mediates the relationship between TR and intention to adopt (IA) mobile payments. More importantly, PCs negatively moderate the relationship between AR and IA. Results will vary depending on country and other variables outside the scope of this study such as perceived risk, trust, etc. The sample was large but mainly comprised males, between 18 and 35 years of age. The cash shortage due to a recent demonetization move in India had spurred mobile payment adoption but usage and retention remained low. Many other banking self-service technologies had not been successful and digitization was critical for easing payments and potentially paving the way for mobile banking. However, using mobile phones for financial transactions raises PCs that attenuate the positive impact of AR. Also, understanding overall attitudes with TR is important in a rapidly digitizing country with relatively novice users. Adoption of mobile payment technology can help address social and economic challenges in India, such as financial inclusion, corruption and tax evasion. Given the increasing awareness of privacy issues in India, mobile payment adoption, which already faces acquisition and retention challenges, will likely to face greater resistance in the future. The findings add to the literature on emerging markets and marketing of technology products by identifying the critical role of privacy in the adoption of financial technology services. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that given the rapid introduction of technology in India, consumers’ overarching TR has to be considered along with AR for mobile payments. Thus, the authors offer a tripartite, customer–technology–transaction view of the mobile payment adoption process in India.",AreaDigital finance Digital

"Abstract This empirical study aims to determine factors that influence an individual's intention to use mobile payment (MP) systems. The study investigates direct, indirect and total effects as well as factors that mediate or moderate effects on intention. A theoretical model is derived from previous studies and combines factors from technology acceptance model and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention) with factors relevant to MP (perceived security, uncertainty avoidance, trust, network externalities and self-efficacy). Gender, age, MP experience and income are included as moderators of direct effects on behavioral intention. The sample includes 736 participants from the four large cities in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze and develop the theoretical model. Self-efficacy has the greatest total effect on behavioral intention, followed in decreasing order of importance by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, trust, network externalities and uncertainty Avoidance. only gender and MP experience have significant moderating effects whereby the direct effects of self-efficacy and network externalities on behavioral intention are influenced by gender and MP experience, respectively. Trust, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have important mediation effects. This study fills the gap in the limited theoretical understanding of MP adoption in Indonesia.

"Abstract To assess the contribution of a digital health real-time monitoring platform towards the achievement of coverage targets during a national immunisation campaign in Indonesia. A digital health platform was introduced to facilitate real-time reporting and data visualisation. Health workers submitted reports of children immunised each day by geolocation using mobile phones. Automated reports were generated for programme managers at all levels to enable early responses to coverage gaps. Risk profiles were generated for each district to assess precampaign immunisation programme performance. Digital health platform use and progress towards targets were monitored continuously throughout the campaign. Study outcomes were total coverage and time to achieve full (100%) coverage. Kaplan-Meier, Cox and linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations and outcomes after adjusting for district risk profiles. A complementary qualitative assessment explored user experiences and acceptance through interviews with vaccinators and programme managers in provinces and districts selected through multistage random sampling.
Between August and December 2018, 6462 health facilities registered to use the digital health platform across 28 provinces and 395 districts. After adjusting for precampaign district risk profile and intracampaign delays due to vaccine hesitancy, districts with greater platform utilisation demonstrated higher coverage overall (R2=0.28, p<0.0001) and a shorter interval to achieving full coverage (>75% reporting compliance; Risk Ratio 15.4, 95%CI 5.8 to 40.6). Stronger effects were observed among districts experiencing implementation delays due to vaccine hesitancy. Results from 106 key informant interviews conducted in 6 provinces and 18 districts suggest high degrees of acceptability, ease of use and satisfaction. A digital health platform introduced for real-time monitoring of a national immunisation campaign in Indonesia was feasible, well liked and associated with improved problem solving and programme performance, particularly among districts affected by vaccine hesitancy.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract The advent of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has had and is having a major impact on Indonesian cultural resource management, and on the safeguarding methods of its tangible and intangible cultural heritages. Despite varied levels and visible gaps between rural and urban regions in terms of technology usage, innovative initiatives have been created, which correspond to the needs and expectations of a technology-savvy public. As a starting point, a number of public institutions dealing with tangible cultural heritage (e.g. museums, palaces, temples, World Heritage Sites (WHS)) do use innovative digital tools in order to communicate to various audiences, as well as to enrich visitors’ experience, especially taking into consideration young generations. This paper will firstly examine the role of ICTs in intangible cultural heritage (ICH) (e.g. Batik, Wayang puppet theatre, etc.); secondly, the authors will explain how ICTs can help to communicate and promote the values, history, and significances of ICH products, both for locals and tourists, with the goal of raising awareness on cultural identity. However, the knowledge of ICH still requires contacts with its own communities and is vulnerable, as it can be exposed to excessive cultural commoditization through e-platforms. This study aims at giving an overview and some examples of digital interventions for cultural heritage communication implemented by various stakeholders in Indonesia. In addition, this paper analyses to what extent a participatory approach engaging local communities, academics, private sectors, NGOs and the government, can ensure higher levels of effectiveness and efficiency, hence supporting the conservation of UNESCO tangible/ICH in Indonesia. This paper aims at: (1) presenting the development of digital heritage platforms in Indonesia; (2) providing a grid of analysis of digital heritage knowledge platforms dedicated to UNESCO tangible and ICH in forms of websites and mobile apps.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract As a developing country, Indonesia faces a crucial issue concerning the provision of health services to the public. The 1998 political reform led to demands for more aspiring and accommodating bureaucratic services being aﬀorded to the public. The political reform brought about bureaucratic reform bearing good governance, wherein one of its forms is the provision of health services through the innovation of an information technology (IT) based service named e-Health. Keeping in mind Indonesia’s characteristics as a developing country, the implementation of IT-based services evokes numerous debates. This study aims to analyze the implementation of e-Health along with the opportunities it has, and the challenges it faces. By using a study case approach on the Surabaya Municipality Health Authority as the initiator and implementer of e-Health, as well as observations and user surveys, the results show that in spite of having been prepared properly with supporting policies, infrastructure, budgeting, dissemination, and operational system, there were still many prevalent obstacles encountered, particularly concerning digital divide, technical diﬃculties, psychological barriers, and cultural issues. Nevertheless, there are numerous opportunities available for refining e-Health implementation, provided there is a political will from the government to improve and enhance the ICT infrastructure, widespread use of mobile devices, involvement of public participation, and equal distribution of service points easily accessible to the public. Strong government commitment also serves as a guarantee for e-Health service program sustainability in Surabaya Municipality.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract Women have been recognized as environmental activists and having a greater awareness of ecology worldwide since the 19th century. There are many stories of women activists worldwide who have developed significant models for protecting the environment. Social media’s popularity has changed how activists advocate their ideas to generate awareness and environmental protection  participation. This study focuses on the grassroots women who join SSI and actively campaign for water and river conservation through social media. It attempts to identify how they use social media to campaign and analyzes their posts’ digital contents to understand their motivation for challenging the water river degradation and their value systems and insights, which drive them to take action. This study considers social media as cultural artifacts and providing spaces for social interaction. The researchers observe SSI’s posting behaviors and identify how they use social media for environmental activism to obtain the data. The finding shows two kinds of women activists join SSI: those who actively involve and participate in the campaign and those who click to support the activities. It also shows that the environmental activist women use social media to communicate their activities rather than maximizing its function to campaign to change the public perspective and attitude concerning the need to take care of the rivers’ water and riverbanks.

"Abstract The merging of broadcast platforms, the Internet and social media has challenged the former state-owned broadcasters of Indonesia to find new content strategies and forms suited to the networked media environment. Over the past decade, the arrival of digital technology and rapid growth of social media has broken down the previous linear model of service delivery in Indonesian broadcasting. However, national policy on this issue remains lacking. At present, the Indonesian Broadcast Law (Law No. 32 of 2002) only gives the country's public radio an ability to use the spectrum in the analogue model. Digital migration, as well as legal protection of social media services, remains an ongoing debate among policy-makers, that will allow free market competition, in particular to opportune the interface of service providers and content producers. Drawing from semi-structured interviews, observations and regulatory reviews, this article broadly investigates the introduction of digital interfaces in the new public service broadcasters of Indonesia, with particular focus on the process through which Indonesian PSBs have embraced the digital media
 environment to enable the flow of information and public participation between the media entities and their publics. In this article, I present both technology and regulatory perspectives by emphasizing the dynamics of the digital media modes of public service delivery, particularly those through which analogue broadcasts and social media have sought new ways to intertwine. In detail, I will examine certain interactive services applied by Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), the flagship of Indonesian national public radio, namely RRI-Play, RRI.co.id and RRI-Net, to manage audience participation. Since 2016, these digital platforms have mediated public access to RRI content, generated data on media users, and monitored technological performance. In inspecting these platforms, I refer firstly to the normative debate of public service broadcasters as 'deliberative
 public sphere' before segueing into the three public-service functions that are important in social network media landscape: curation, moderation and monitoring. Furthermore, this article analyses problems behind the regulatory design of Indonesian public-service media within the context of digital broadcasts in the country.",AreaPolicy and regulation

"Abstract While Indonesia is recorded as one of the greatest social media republics in the world, the gap of rural-urban internet access remains a great challenge. As reported in the 2016 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Indicators, the number of households with internet access in rural areas is nearly half of those in urban areas; 26.3% and 48.5% in a consecutive way. Rather than simply seeing the internet as a medium, this paper discusses the internet as material culture; therefore, it goes beyond the access and focuses on the ways people use the internet to define their culture. From this perspective, this paper draws the two levels of the digital divide of Indonesian rural-urban dwellers. Lack of motivation and limited material access due to social inequality is at the very base of the digital divide. Subsequently, digital skills and usage deepen the digital divide. While splitting people into either rural or urban categories often produces misleading policies, this paper proposes the rural-urban linkages to bridge the digital divide in Indonesia. The rural-urban linkages particularly incorporate the flow of people and information across space as well as the interconnection between sectors, such as agriculture and service.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Worldwide, refugees are increasingly living in uncertainty for undetermined periods of time, waiting for an enduring legal and social solution. In this article, I consider how this experience of waiting is perceived through and influenced by the ubiquity of transnational digital connections, which play a central role in Iraqi refugee households in Jordan. I draw on ethnographic fieldwork conducted among Iraqi refugees in Jordan's capital Amman to further understand the use of digital technologies in everyday experiences of prolonged displacement. Waiting is an intrinsic affective phenomenon, colored by hope and anxiety. I argue that affective affordances - the potential of different media forms to bring about affects like hope and anxiety - enable Iraqi refugees to reorient themselves to particular places and people. As ""no futures"" are deemed possible in Jordan or Iraq, digital technologies serve as orientation devices enabling them to imagine futures elsewhere. Through the interplay of media forms, the Iraqi refugees refract their own lives via the experiences of friends and family members who have already traveled onward and who in their perception are able to rebuild a dignified life. Transnational digital connections not only provide a space for hope and optimistic ideas of futures elsewhere but also help to sustain one's experience of immobility. I argue that using the imagination can be understood as an act of not giving in to structural constraints and might be crucial to making Iraqi refugee life in Jordan bearable.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Digital Financial Inclusion (DFI) refers to efforts to make digital financial services available and affordable to all individuals and institutions, regardless of their net expense or institution size and demographic location. Despite the immense benefits of DFI and DFI-based products and services such as mobile money and payment systems, users' acceptance is thin, limited, and disappointing in some developing countries as Jordan. Consequently, this study has investigated the factors influencing the acceptance of the mobile payment system in the Jordanian context. This study's research model synthesizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) variables and extended the model with perceived financial cost as an independent variable. The research model has been empirically confirmed by fitting the model to data collected from 304 Jordanian citizens using a survey instrument. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The result has confirmed that behavioural intention to use the m-payment system is significantly and positively influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived financial cost; behavioural intention to use m-payment system was not found to be significantly and positively influenced by perceived ease of use and hence the related hypothesis was not supported.

Recently the Jordanian government has developed a national executive plan for digital media literacy to develop community awareness and improve its capabilities in dealing with information and media sources during the Corona pandemic through the Ministry of Culture, Therefore, in this study, we will review the digital media literacy in Jordan and we will study the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract The transformational processes of the global economy and the development of digital technologies necessitate a conceptual review of existing management strategies and their improvement, a change in the processes of obtaining knowledge and assessing their relationships. In modern conditions, to ensure the effectiveness of activities, the necessary element of management is the use of innovative information and digital technologies in business, which allow optimizing costs and optimizing financial results. The expediency and relevance of the study, which is aimed at assessing the relationship of digital strategies and their impact on the Jordanian aviation sector, is substantiated. It has been taught that the availability of digital technologies contributes to the improvement of management strategies and educational processes, which allows them to become training centers at the regional level. It was determined that the development of digital tools (content, web pages, social networks, advertising, video and other marketing components) and their application in organization management strategies contribute to streamlining the management process and gaining knowledge. It is argued that the process of education and training of managers depends on the approach used by the organization's digital tools, as well as the type and industry of its economic activity. It is taught that the training used in the Jordanian aviation sector, as a managerial survey compiled by design specialists, explains the degree of accessibility of this sector of the economy and confirms the need to establish a training center at the regional level. It is proved that the establishment of a training center at the regional level will ensure the promotion of employees of the Jordanian aviation sector, state support, a new image and loyalty, which will make managers at the local and regional levels aware. To justify the relevance and necessity, a statistical one-way analysis of variance was carried out for the influence of factors on training processes in the aviation sector of Jordan. The main results of statistical one-way analysis of variance interpret the importance of this study and the need to improve the digital strategy, and its application in marketing activities, which focus on 3digital. Unique practical recommendations have been developed that are based on customer focus and focus on three digital strategies (clients; educational product; digital tools), which will achieve the organization's strategic goals and positive financial results.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity
"Abstract This study was concerned with perspectives of student teacher trainees' preparedness and adoption on integration of ICTs in public teacher training colleges. Effective preparedness and adoption on integration of ICTs contributes greatly to the quality of education delivered in an instructional process. The rationale was based on the view that properly designed and integrated ICTs add value to teaching and learning environment on which contact hours are limited. The curriculum needs academic standards and the development of digital age skills for the 21st century learners to fit in the global job market. The findings revealed that there was a significant relationship. However, preparedness on integration of ICTs was at an infant stage. The study also revealed that the training is only offering pedagogy, content knowledge but not the technology which make integration a reality in the classroom setting. Inadequate infrastructure to enhance integration and that the student teacher trainees revealed lack policy that will help adoption on integration of ICTs in teaching learning process.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity
"Abstract Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The rapid and massive adoption of mobile money transfer (MMT) services in East Africa, particularly in Kenya, stands in stark contrast to historically low use of formal financial systems on the continent. Its 'fertile grounds' therefore require in-depth analysis to understand the implications for African financial systems. This paper argues for the need to examine the underlying conceptual environment that enables low income and poor people's MMT adoption. It innovatively combines anthropological with ethnolinguistic analytical approaches to distinguish two repertoires around resource exchange. First, is a relational financial repertoire where relationships are developed and consolidated to create support and 'upliftment'. A contrasting resource-focused repertoire is more like that of the formal financial sector. Identifying the conceptual features of relationality, the study offers a new perspective on the adoption and use of MMT in Africa and highlights the potential for disjunctures with policy efforts to increase financial inclusion.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Birth registration is a critical element of newborn care. Increasing the coverage of birth registration is an essential part of the strategy to improve newborn survival globally, and is central to achieving greater health, social, and economic equity as defined under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Parts of Eastern and Southern Africa have some of the lowest birth registration rates in the world. Mobile technologies have been used successfully with mothers and health workers in Africa to increase coverage of essential newborn care, including birth registration. However, mounting concerns about data ownership and data protection in the digital age are driving the search for scalable, user-centered, privacy protecting identity solutions. There is increasing interest in understanding if a self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach can help lower the barriers to birth registration by empowering families with a smartphone based process while providing high levels of data privacy and security in populations where birth registration rates are low. The process of birth registration and the barriers experienced by stakeholders are highly contextual. There is currently a gap in the literature with regard to modeling birth registration using SSI technology. This paper describes the development of a smartphone-based prototype system that allows interaction between families and health workers to carry out the initial steps of birth registration and linkage of mothers-baby pairs in an urban Kenyan setting using verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and the emerging standards for their implementation in identity systems. The goal of the project was to develop a high fidelity prototype that could be used to obtain end-user feedback related to the feasibility and acceptability of an SSI approach in a particular Kenyan healthcare context. This paper will focus on how this technology was adapted for the specific context and implications for future research.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract Despite the expansive infrastructure of commercial banking in Kenya, a large percentage of the country's population is excluded from access to formal banking services/products. Further, there is insufficiency of credible information on the manner that digital banking strategies relates to inclusion on access to financial services. Accordingly, this study was in search of bridging the gap with the objective of evaluating the effects of the digital banking strategy on financial inclusion midst commercial banks in Kajiado County (a case of Kenya commercial bank in Kajiado county). This research utilised quantitative methods and espoused descriptive research design. It regarded the 323 Kenya commercial banks outlets (branches and bank agents) in Kajiado County for its target population and obtained a sample size of 179 respondents. A closed-ended questionnaire was administered using drop and pick approach, was developed for gathering data to be acquired from primary sources. This research adopted quantitative analysis approach to yield descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The study concludes that at 5% error level, digital banking channels, digital financial infrastructure, convenience of digital financial services, have a statistical positive significant effect on financial inclusion among commercial banks in Kajiado county while digital service offering has a statistically insignificant effect on financial inclusion among commercial banks in Kajiado county. The study recommends that the commercial banks in Kajiado should, provide digital banking services to areas that are not easily accessible, acquire adequate infrastructure facilities and adopt efficient technology, offer simple, cost effective and secure services to their customers and provide wide variety of digital service.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
Abstract The aim of this study is to assess the effect of interest rates on the financial performance of SMEs in urban informal settlements in Kenya. This study adopts the descriptive survey design. Data were collected from 120 SMEs in the 6 wards of Mathare Sub-County. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires. It was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings show that low-interest rates could influence the propensity of SMEs to apply for these loans. The ability to pay mobile loans without problems due to low interest rates enhanced the performance of the respondents’ businesses. This goes on to contribute to poverty alleviation in urban informal settlements through enhanced access to capital; one of the goals of the world bank. This has further ripple effects since it can contribute to income diversification for the inhabitants of poor urban areas. The following recommendations were made. The government should also reduce interest rates to lower the cost of mobile phone interests as well as the interest rates of other loan products. Mobile loan lenders should also ensure that their loan products are affordable for the urban poor.,AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of askNivi, a free sexual and reproductive health information service.",AreaDigital information services

Utilising a descriptive cross-sectional design within a concurrent mixed approach, the study examined the relationship between digital literacy intervention and online child abuse among primary school children in Langata sub-county. Targeted, were children between 9 and 17 years from private and public primary schools, teachers, parents and policy makers and child protection officers. Godden’s formula informed purposive and random sampling of 384 respondents, plus a 10% (423) respondents for Key Informant interviews and focused discussions. Quantitative and qualitative data was analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics and content analysis with the help of SPSS version 22 and Nvivo version 12 respectively. The study revealed stakeholders intervened in online child abuse at various levels using a number of strategies.  The study revealed a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure to online. Since the p-value (0.000) was less than alpha (0.05) and we conclude there was a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure to online child abuse.

"Abstract This study examines the relationship between teacher educators’ attitudes towards computers and their level of ICT integration in instruction in public primary teacher training colleges in Kenya. Rogers’s Theory on the Diffusion of Innovations (2003) is used to understand the key factors affecting ICT integration as well as the teacher educators’ attitudes towards ICT integration in the classroom. In terms of methodology, the simple random sampling technique was used to select six teacher training colleges in Kenya and 169 respondents to participate in the study. Data was collected using a questionnaire, interview schedule and observation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data collected for means, frequencies, means, percentages and standard deviation. The Pearson Moment Correlation was used to determine the relationship between teacher educators’ attitude and their level of ICT integration. The study results indicated a low level of ICT integration in teaching in all teacher-training colleges. It was also noted that teacher educators had positive attitudes towards ICT integration. However, they did not seem to integrate the available ICTs in their classroom instruction. It was further established that there was a positive relationship between their attitude and their level of ICT integration in instruction.  The Ministry of Education should organise in-service training for teacher educators in teacher education institutions on ICT integration in instruction. At the same time, there is a need to applaud and encourage by means of incentives teacher educators who exhibit positive attitudes so as improve their ICT integration in their teaching. Consideration should be given to older teacher educators’ who may be holding poor attitudes towards computers.",AreaUpskilling/Capacity Building Upskilling/Capacity
"Abstract The increased adoption of mobile telephone for development is based on the assumption that mobile telephony has the potential to foster social change. To some, such technology can aid most developing countries to leapfrog stages of development. Yet to others, the technology is at most counterproductive: development has been understood differently by the developed in comparison to the underdeveloped. Missing in this narrative is the people's own conceptualization of the term development as well as their gender roles, often a component of development programs. This study presents findings on an alternative conceptualization of development, dubbed maendeleo, a Swahili term that denotes process, participation, progress, growth, change, and improved standard of livingâ€”as defined by the people or women themselves as they interact with mobile telephony in rural Kenya. Using Manuel DeLanda's assemblage theory to analyze interviews, this study proposes an alternative conceptualization of development. This different perspective on development denotes both process and emergence, through the processes and roles that mobile telephony plays in the techno-social interactions of users, context, and other factors as they form social assemblages that are fluid in nature, hence challenging the Western proposition that new technologies produce development understood as social transformation.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract Increases in mobile phone ownership and Internet access throughout Africa continue to motivate initiatives to use information and communication technologies (ICTs)—in particular, mobile phones—to address long-standing socioeconomic problems in the “developing world.” While it is generally recognized that mobile phones may help to address these problems by providing pertinent information, less widely known is exactly how (and if) a handset’s human–computer interface—that is, its software and hardware design—supports this form of communication. The concept of “affordances” has long been used to answer such questions. In this paper, we use Hartson’s definition of affordances to qualitatively investigate rural Kenyan women’s interactions with their mobile phones. Our detailed analysis provides empirically grounded answers to questions about the cognitive, physical, and sensory affordances of handsets used in our field sites and how they support and/or constrain mobile communication. We then discuss the implications of our findings: in particular, how this affordance-based approach draws attention to mobile phones’ design features and to the context in which they and their users are embedded—a focus which suggests new design and research opportunities in mobile communication.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract To determine if reliable, objective audiologic data can be obtained by nonotolaryngology and nonaudiology practitioners using novel mobile technology in an effort to expand the capacity for early identification and treatment of disabling hearing loss in the developing world. Cross-sectional, proof-of-concept pilot study. Screenings took place during an annual 2-week otolaryngology surgical mission in October 2016 in semirural Malindi, Kenya. Eighty-seven patients (174 total ears) were included from 2 deaf schools (n = 12 and 9), a nondeaf school (n = 9), a tuberculosis ward (n = 8), and a walk-in otology clinic at a local hospital (n = 49). An automated, tablet-based, language-independent, clinically validated, play audiometry system and wireless otoscopic endoscopy via an iPhone or laptop platform was administered by Kenyan community health workers (CHWs) and nursing staff. Various degrees of hearing loss and otologic pathology were identified, including 1 child presumed to be deaf who was found to have unilaterally normal hearing. Other pathology included 2 active perforations, 2 healed perforations, 2 middle ear effusions, and 1 cholesteatoma. CHWs and nursing staff demonstrated proficiency performing audiograms and endoscopy. Patients screened in a deaf school were more likely to complete an unreliable audiogram than patients screened in other settings ( P < .01).  This study demonstrates the feasibility of a non-otolaryngology-based hearing screening program. This may become an important tool in reducing the impact of hearing loss and otologic pathology in areas bereft of otolaryngologists and audiologists by allowing CHWs to gather important patient data prior to otolaryngologic evaluation.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract Mobile phones and personal digital assistants have been used for data collection in developing world settings for over three decades, and have become increasingly common. However, the use of electronic data capture (EDC) through mobile phones is limited in many areas by inconsistent network connectivity and poor access to electricity, which thwart data transmission and device usage. This is the case in rural Liberia, where many health workers live and work in areas without any access to cellular connectivity or reliable power. Many existing EDC mobile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected settings, allowing a user to collect data while out of range of a cell tower and transmit data to a central server when he/she regains a network connection. However, few tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-disconnected settings, where a user will never have access to the internet or a cell network. This led us to create and implement an EDC software tool that allows for completely offline data transfer and application updating. We designed, pilot-tested, and scaled an open-source fork of Open Data Kit Collect (an Android application that can be used to create EDC systems) that allows for offline Bluetooth-based bidirectional data transfer, enabling a system in which permanently-offline users can collect data and receive application updates. We implemented this platform among a cohort of 317 community health workers and 28 supervisors in a remote area of rural Liberia with incomplete cellular connectivity and low access to power sources. Running a fully-offline EDC program that completely bypasses the cellular network was found to be feasible; the system is still running, over 4 years after the initial pilot program. The users of this program can theoretically collect data offline for months or years, assuming they receive hardware support when needed. Fully-offline EDC has applications in settings where cellular network coverage is poor, as well as in disaster relief settings in which portions of the communications infrastructure may be temporarily nonfunctional.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Poor road and communication infrastructure pose major challenges to tuberculosis (TB) control in many regions of the world. TB surveillance and patient support often fall to community health workers (CHWs) who may lack the time or knowledge needed for this work. To meet the End TB Strategy goal of reducing TB incidence by 90% by 2035, the WHO calls for intensified research and innovation including the rapid uptake of new tools, interventions and strategies. Technologies that ""leapfrog"" infrastructure challenges and support CHWs in TB control responsibilities have the potential to dramatically change TB outcomes in remote regions. Such technologies may strengthen TB control activities within challenged national tuberculosis treatment and control programmes (NTPs), and be adapted to address other public health challenges. The deployment of innovative technologies needs to be differentially adapted to context-specific factors. The Drone Observed Therapy System (DrOTS) project was launched in Madagascar in 2017 and integrates a bundle of innovative technologies including drones, digital adherence monitoring technology and mobile device-based educational videos to support TB control. This mixed-methods study gathers and analyses cultural perceptions of the DrOTS project among key stakeholders: patients, community members, CHWs, village chiefs and NTP-DrOTS mobile health teams. Data from questionnaires, semistructured interviews, focus group discussions (FGD) and ethnographic observation gathered from June 2018 to June 2019 are thematically analysed and compared to identify patterns and singularities in how DrOTS stakeholders perceive and interact with DrOTS technologies, its enrolment processes, objectives and team.
Ethics approval was obtained from the National Bioethics Research Committee of Madagascar and Stony Brook University institutional review board. Study results will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. In Madagascar, results will be presented in person to Ministry and other Malagasy decision-makers through the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. This study is designed to foreground the voices of patients and potential patients in the DrOTS programme.

"Abstract To further reduce malaria burden, identification of areas with highest burden for targeted interventions needs to occur. Routine health information has the potential to indicate where and when clinical malaria occurs the most. Developing countries mostly use paper-based data systems however they are error-prone as they require manual aggregation, tallying and transferring of data. Piloting was done using electronic data capture (EDC) with a cheap and user friendly software in rural Malawian primary healthcare setting to improve the quality of health records. Audit and feedback tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute (Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and Getting Research into Practice) were used in four primary healthcare facilities. Using this approach, the best available evidence for a malaria information system (MIS) was identified. Baseline audit of the existing MIS was conducted in the facilities based on available best practice for MIS; this included ensuring data consistency and completeness in MIS by sampling 25 random records of malaria positive cases. Implementation of an adapted evidence-based EDC system using tablets on an OpenDataKit platform was done. An end line audit following implementation was then conducted. Users had interviews on experiences and challenges concerning EDC at the beginning and end of the survey. The existing MIS was paper-based, occupied huge storage space, had some data losses due to torn out papers and were illegible in some facilities. The existing MIS did not have documentation of necessary parameters, such as malaria deaths and treatment within 14Â days. Training manuals and modules were absent. One health centre solely had data completeness and consistency at 100% of the malaria-positive sampled records. Data completeness and consistency rose to 100% with readily available records containing information on recent malaria treatment. Interview findings at the end of the survey showed that EDC was acceptable among users and they agreed that the tablets and the OpenDataKit were easy to use, improved productivity and quality of care. Improvement of data quality and use in the Malawian rural facilities was achieved through the introduction of EDC using OpenDataKit.

"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to present findings of a study conducted to determine eReadiness status of public university libraries in Malawi to use mobile phones in the provision of library and information services. The researcher carried out in-depth semi-structured interviews with university/college librarians and information and communications technology (ICT) directors using interview guides. Students were also administered with a survey questionnaire that contained closed- and some open-ended questions. Proceedings of the interviews were recorded using a tape recorder whilst backup notes were recorded in a notebook. Qualitative data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo software whilst quantitative data were analysed using SPPS. The study findings revealed that institutions studied had the ICT infrastructure necessary for offering library and information services on the mobile phone platform. Moreover, students had mobile phones which were connected to internet to facilitate their access to services offered. However, the institutions covered by this study did not have operational ICT policies to govern the operations of library and information services offered through mobile phones although draft ICT policies were available. The study further concluded that though the human resources required to manage the provision of library and information services through mobile phones in the institutions studied were available, they did not have the necessary skills and numbers to provide quality services. Other findings revealed that attitudes of library staff and students to the offering and access to services through mobile phones were positive.

"Abstract To effectively deliver on proposed objectives, it is vital that practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders are able to clearly understand how strongly their large-scale program is being implemented. This study sought to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and validity of a phone-based method as an innovative and cost-efficient approach to assessing program implementation strength (through an Implementation Strength Assessment - ISA), alternative to the traditional in-person field methods. We conducted 701 mobile phone and 356 in-person interviews with facility in-Charges and two types of community health workers who provide family planning services in the Dowa and Ntcheu districts in Malawi. Responses received via the phone interview were validated through in-person review of records and inspections. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to determine validity. Most indicators at the health facility and community health worker levels were above a 70% threshold for sensitivity. However, there were fewer indicators that met this threshold for specificity. The primary reason for lower specificity was due to poor recordkeeping. Collecting data via mobile phone was found to be feasible and twice as cost-efficient as collecting the same data via in-person inspections. The rapid increase in mobile phone ownership and network availability in lower income countries could offer an alternative, cost-effective avenue to collect data for a better understanding of program implementation. Through rigorous assessment, this study found that using mobile phones could be a low-cost alternative to collect data on health system delivery of services, especially in places where routine data quality is poor and traditional, in-person methods are costly.",AreaData systems and

The integration of them in the teaching-learning processes has experienced a great evolution, giving way to a digital transformation and the acquisition of new skills and knowledge, thus pointing towards quality education within the framework of sustainable development objectives. This document aims to describe and analyze the ways in which seven higher education institutions, three in Spain and four in Mexico, have taken up the challenge of adopting technologies and applying them to the educational process. To this end, in-depth interviews and direct observations were carried out. The results point to three dimensions: technological, pedagogical and organizational, which shed light on the different factors that influence the choice and availability of the use of technologies.

"Abstract The digital divide phenomenon arose in the early 90s due to internet popularization and telecommunications and information use management development. Numerous studies and authors agree that the basic premise of the digital divide is the difference that exists between individuals and societies that have access to computing, telecommunications and internet technology resources and those that do not (Schielfe 2008, Van Dijk & Hacker 2003, Servon 2002, OECD 2001, Ginsburg, Sabatini & Wagner 2000). The importance of information as a necessary element for society to function properly is where this phenomenon has its main emphasis, since those who do not have access to information, or have marginal contact with it, are excluded from a successful incorporation to social development.

"Abstract Household food insecurity remains a major policy challenge in low-income countries. Identifying accurate measures that are relatively easy to collect has long been an important priority for governments seeking to better understand and fund solutions for communities in remote settings. Conventional approaches based on surveys can be time-consuming and costly, while data derived from satellite imagery represent proxies focused on biological processes (such as rainfall and crop growth) lack granularity in terms of human behaviors. As a result, there has recently been interest in tapping into the large digital footprint offered by mobile phone usage. This paper explores empirical relationships between data relating to mobile phones (ownership and spending on service use), and food insecurity in rural Nepal. The work explores models for estimating community-level food insecurity through aggregated mobile phone variables in a proof-of-concept approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed by considering the performance of the models under different settings. The results suggest that mobile phone variables on ownership and expenditure can be used to estimate food insecurity with reasonable accuracy. This suggests that such an approach can be used in and beyond Nepal as an option for collecting timely food insecurity information, either alone or in combination with conventional approaches.",AreaData systems and

"Abstract Geographical information systems (GIS) can be effective decision-support tools. In this paper, we detail a GIS approach implemented by the Bauchi and Sokoto state primary healthcare development agencies in Nigeria to generate and convert routine immunisation (RI) paper maps to digital maps for microplanning. The process involved three stages: primary and secondary data collection and reconciliation, geospatial data processing and analysis, and production and validation of maps. The data collection and reconciliation stage identified a number of challenges with secondary data sources, including the need to standardise and reconcile health facility and settlement names. The study team was unable to apply population estimates generated from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to RI planning because operational boundaries for polio activities are defined differently from RI activities. Application of open-source GIS software enabled the combination of multiple datasets and analysis of geospatial data to calculate catchment areas for primary health centres (PHCs) and assign vaccination strategies to communities. The activity resulted in the development of PHC catchment area digital maps, and captured next steps and lessons learnt for RI microplanning in the two states.

"Abstract Strengthening health systems to improve access to maternity services remains challenging for Nigeria due partly to weak and irregular in-service training and deficient data management. This paper reports the implementation of digital health tools for video training (VTR) of health workers and digitization of health data at scale, supported by satellite communications (SatCom) technology and existing 3G mobile networks. To understand whether, and under what circumstances using digital interventions to extend maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services to remote areas of Nigeria improved standards of healthcare delivery. From March 2017 to March 2019, VTR and data digitization interventions were delivered in 126 facilities across three states of Nigeria. Data collection combined documents review with 294 semi-structured interviews of stakeholders across four phases (baseline, midline, endline, and 12-months post-project closedown) to assess acceptability and impacts of digital interventions. Data was analyzed using a framework approach, drawing on a modified Technology Acceptance Model to identify factors that shaped technology adoption and use. Analysis of documents and interview transcripts revealed that a supportive policy environment, and track record of private-public partnerships facilitated adoption of technology. The determinants of technology acceptance among health workers included ease of use, perceived usefulness, and prior familiarity with technology. Perceptions of impact suggested that at the micro (individual) level, repeated engagement with clinical videos increased staff knowledge, motivation and confidence to perform healthcare roles. At meso (organizational) level, better-trained staff felt supported and empowered to provide respectful healthcare and improved management of obstetric complications, triggering increased use of MNCH services. The macro level saw greater use of reliable and accurate data for policymaking.
Simultaneous and sustained implementation of VTR and data digitization at scale enabled through SatCom and 3G mobile networks are feasible approaches for supporting improvements in staff confidence and motivation and reported MNCH practices. By identifying mechanisms of impact of digital interventions on micro, meso, and macro levels of the health system, the study extends the evidence base for effectiveness of digital health and theoretical underpinnings to guide further technology use for improving MNCH services in low resource settings.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract This paper aims to explore the connectivity between social media use, access to migrant networks, information asymmetry and migration intentions. The study was conducted using data from individuals living in Nigeria and analysed with a generalized structural equation model, which is rare for this kind of research. The authors find a dual mediating role of the social media and the migrant networks in facilitating migration, i.e. reducing the threshold cost required to migrate and introducing a bias in terms of information asymmetry. While social media and access to migrant networks directly increase migration intentions, this changes when incomplete information is provided. People who use social media and their migrant networks for information are more likely to have information about destination countries than information on the transit risk. The study adds valuable insights for designing awareness campaigns aimed at reducing irregular migration. This study contributes to the understanding of the intersection of migration and digitalization",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest global economic and health challenge of the century. Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology.
The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria’s data privacy regulations.
We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria’s response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.",AreaData privacy Data
"Abstract Unprecedented growth in the use of ICTs has contributed to digital divide in Nigeria. Despite global efforts in bridging the digital divide in developed and developing nations, digital equality is yet to be achieved in nations. Government's effort in bridging the digital divide in Nigeria has become a daunting task due to several barriers hindering the use of ICTs by the rural dwellers such as low income, low deployment of telecommunication infrastructure, lack of skills, access, language and cultural challenges among others. In view of this, the aim of this paper is to unravel the socio-psychological consequences of the digital divide on rural dwellers in Nigeria. This paper further discussed dimensions and perspectives to digital divide, causes of digital divide, global efforts in bridging the digital divide, barriers militating against digital divide, and social psychological consequences of the digital divide on rural dwellers. Policy recommendations were made towards addressing the socio-psychological implications of digital divide on rural dwellers in Nigeria.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract The agriculture sector in Pakistan faces enormous challenges of lack of farm knowledge adoption due to the farmers’ lack of access to the latest information. Recently various mobile phone-based farm advisory services (FAS) have been introduced as an alternative to the conventional extension methods. Despite many ICT initiatives, the performance of these projects remains unsatisfactory. The current study was designed to identify these FAS, farmers’ extent of use, and factors associated with their adoption. Two hundred and forty farmers were surveyed in the rural areas of district Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed with SPSS software. Findings revealed that 77.08% of the sampled farmers were using mobile-based FAS. Telecom and private sector FAS were reported to have the highest share of users (37.08% and 25.83% respectively). Results of the logistic regression showed that farmers’ educational level, mobile use skills, mobile possession duration and the number of mobile phones in a family were found positively significant, while farmers’ age and contact with extension agents were negatively significant. The findings conclude that education and digital literacy are essential for the use of mobile-based alternatives and emphasize the need for training and educating the farmers.",AreaDigital information services

"Abstract Although considerable progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality over the past 25 years in Senegal, the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR), at 315 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still unacceptably high. In recent years a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to enhance maternal health care has been introduced in rural and remote areas of the country. CommCare is an application that runs on cell phones distributed to community health workers known as matrones who enroll and track women throughout pregnancy, birth and the post-partum, offering health information, moral support, appointment reminders, and referrals to formal health care providers.
An ethnographic study of the CommCare intervention and the larger maternal health program into which it fits was conducted in order to identify key social and cultural contextual factors that contribute to the uptake and functioning of this mHealth intervention in Senegal. Ethnographic methods and semi-structured interviews were used with participants drawn from four categories: NGO field staff (n = 16), trained health care providers (including physicians, nurses, and midwives) (n = 19), community level health care providers (n = 13); and women belonging to a community intervention known as the Care Group (n = 14). Data were analyzed using interpretive analysis informed by critical medical anthropology theory. The study identified five socio-cultural factors that work in concert to encourage the uptake and use of CommCare: convening women in the community Care Group; a cultural mechanism for enabling pregnancy disclosure; constituting authoritative knowledge amongst women; harnessing the roles of older women; and adding value to community health worker roles. We argue that, while CommCare is a powerful tool of information, clinical support, surveillance, and data collection, it is also a social technology that connects and motivates people, transforming relationships in ways that can optimize its potential to improve maternal health care. In Senegal, mHealth has the potential not only to bridge the gaps of distance and expertise, but to engage local people productively in the goal of enhancing maternal health care. Successful mHealth interventions do not work as ‘magic bullets’ but are part of ‘assemblages’ – people and things that are brought together to accomplish particular goals. Attention to the social and cultural elements of the global health assemblage within which CommCare functions is critically important to understand and develop this mHealth technology to its full potential.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract The 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest Ebola epidemic to date. Contact tracing was a core surveillance activity. Challenges with paper-based contact tracing systems include incomplete identification of contacts, delays in communication and response, loss of contact lists, inadequate data collection and transcription errors. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an electronic system for tracing contacts of Ebola cases in Port Loko District, Sierra Leone, and to compare this with the existing paper-based system. The electronic system featured data capture using a smartphone application, linked to an alert system to notify the District Ebola Response Centre of symptomatic contacts. The intervention was a customised three-tier smartphone application developed using Dimagi’s CommCare platform known as the Ebola Contact Tracing application (ECT app). Eligible study participants were all 26 Contact Tracing Coordinators (CTCs) and 86 Contact Tracers (CTs) working in the 11 Chiefdoms of Port Loko District during the study period (April–August 2015). Case detection was from 13th April to 17th July 2015. The CTCs and their CTs were provided with smartphones installed with the ECT app which was used to conduct contact tracing activities. Completeness and timeliness of contact tracing using the app were compared with data from April 13th-June 7th 2015, when the standard paper-based system was used. For 25 laboratory-confirmed cases for whom paper-based contact tracing was conducted, data for only 39% of 408 contacts were returned to the District, and data were often incomplete. For 16 cases for whom app-based contact tracing was conducted, 63% of 556 contacts were recorded as having been visited on the app, and the median recorded duration from case confirmation to first contact visit was 70 h. There were considerable challenges to conducting high-quality contact tracing in this setting using either the paper-based or the app-based system. However, the study demonstrated that it was possible to implement mobile health (mHealth) in this emergency setting. The app had the benefits of improved data completeness, storage and accuracy, but the challenges of using an app in this setting and epidemic context were substantial.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract South Africa’s MomConnect mobile messaging programme, which aims to promote safe motherhood and improve pregnancy outcomes for South African women, includes a helpdesk feature which allows women registered on the system to ask maternal and child health (MCH)-related questions and to provide feedback on health services received at public health clinics. Messages sent to the helpdesk are answered by staff located at the National Department of Health. We examined event data from the MomConnect helpdesk database to identify any patterns in messages received, such as correlation of frequency or types of messages with location. We also explored what these data could tell us about the helpdesk’s effectiveness in improving health service delivery at public health clinics. We found that approximately 8% of registered MomConnect users used the helpdesk, and that usage was generally proportional to the use of antenatal care (ANC) services in provinces (as indicated by number of ANC first visits and number of MomConnect registrations), except in two provinces. Language, category and key topics of helpdesk messages were correlated with provinces. Most users accessed the helpdesk to seek maternal information, and where feedback about health services was provided, there were significantly more compliments than complaints. The MomConnect helpdesk is an important resource providing expectant mothers and mothers of infants with an interactive option for accessing MCHrelated information—above that included in the standard MomConnect messages—and advances achievement of the health goals of the MomConnect programme.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract The study explored the contribution of information and communication technology (ICT)-based information sources to market participation among smallholder livestock farmers. Use of ICTs is considered paramount for providing smallholder farmers with required market information, and also to reduce market asymmetries. A double hurdle regression was utilized to analyze data collected from 150 smallholder livestock farmers in the study area. The results show that while use of ICT-based market information sources significantly influenced market participation, the effect of using ICT-based information sources on the intensity of market participation was not significant. Other variables shown to influence both market participation and the intensity of market participation were age, additional income and membership of farmer cooperatives. This suggests the need to consider other associated factors in the application and design of interventions that utilize ICT-based information sources to achieve market engagement among smallholders.",AreaDigital information services
"Abstract Basic service delivery is a fundamental right for all South Africans, especially vulnerable groups. Effective and efficient channels of communication between multi-stakeholder groups involved and affected by service delivery are essential. Digital citizen engagement has recently emerged as a key approach for supporting two-way communication between citizens and the government. It is essential for building evidence-based data to engage with government and apply social accountability measures to lobby for the provision of basic services. Key to building capacities and learning, is developing the abilities of both local government and citizens to become digitally literate (including civic and responsiveness literacy), in order to realise and action the true benefits of digital citizen engagement. This research set out to identify the roles of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement, and how it may be embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing digital citizen engagement initiatives. A pragmatist philosophical approach was applied: studying, observing and reflecting on actions in the MobiSAM case study. Using Szulanski’s four-stage model of knowledge transfer, key focus areas for developing digital literacy were identified, contributing to a Quadruple-E process of: (1) explore, (2) enable, (3) engage and (4) embed. Practices identified in the MobiSAM case study are provided as suggestions for each phase, with an indication of possible constraints that may be experienced in the knowledge transfer and digital literacy development process – a potential guideline for developing digital literacy in digital citizen engagement initiatives.

"Abstract Participatory land-use planning (LUP) is often promoted as a solution to various environment-related challenges. In Tanzania, planning processes often represent a stage in the conversion of village lands to different uses, such as wildlife conservation or large-scale farming. LUP in Tanzania is frequently dominated by powerful local, national, or international elites, resulting in loss of rights over village land despite the opposition of many villagers. Contemporary planning involves digital technologies such as global positioning system units, which enable easier storage and sharing of geospatial data. Using assemblage theory, and based on key informant interviews conducted in Arusha and Kilimanjaro Regions of Tanzania in 2015, this article shows that LUP, particularly when it involves digital technologies, is used to not only to change land uses but also to strengthen linkages between different organizations, reinforce certain narratives of environmental change, and legitimize particular forms of external intervention.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract This paper analyses the development of mobile money in Tanzania and the politics of financial inclusion that enhanced it. Mobile money has played a significant part in reaching the financially unreached and excluded people overtaking banking and other financial services in Tanzania. There is no doubt that mobile money emerged at a time when financial exclusion was a major issue, and that the advent of mobile money was opposed by the banks who thought that it was entering the money business, and that the banks were in a better position to do money business better than any other institutions. For this reason, it is crucial to understand the development of mobile money and the politics of financial inclusion that allowed it to succeed. I have chosen the case study of Tanzania because not only that mobile money has thrived there, but also mobile money as we perceive it today was firstly invented by the e-Fulusi, a Tanzanian company, and failed before it was relaunched in Kenya by MPesa and succeeded. Moreover, the development of mobile money and the politics of financial inclusion have proven their importance in fighting financial exclusion and in increasing access to formal financial services for the poor, which is key to economic growth and poverty alleviation.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

"Abstract There is a paucity of subnational data on patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in Tanzania to inform the development of digital health interventions. The aim of this study is to assess patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in pregnant women to inform the feasibility and design of digital health interventions for promoting timely uptake of childhood vaccines in southern Tanzania.
Between August and November 2017, pregnant women in their third trimester were enrolled at health facilities and from surrounding communities, and asked about their patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in an interviewer administered survey. Of 406 women, only 3 had never used a phone. Most women (>98%) could make and receive phone calls. Compared to urban women, rural women reported higher mobile phone use rates but were less likely to be sole owners of phones, and less likely to send or receive SMS, transact money, browse the internet, or use social media via mobile phones. The findings suggest high feasibility for digital health interventions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant women in southern Tanzania.

"Abstract This article examines the significance of digital entrepreneurship in East Asia as informal work, based on empirical research in Taiwan and Thailand. Digital entrepreneurs in East Asia can be thought of as a new class of 'creative workers' who aspire to the neoliberal ideals of the West that advocate free markets and individualism. While digital entrepreneurship offers low-cost opportunities, it also represents highly precarious careers. The transition to the digital economy also means the expansion of the informal economy, which has existed in both Taiwan and Thailand. The encouragement of start-up ecosystems by respective political and economic elites serves to sweet-talk the creative class into participating in precarious work, or it may be an open bid to gain market share by incorporating informal businesses. In response to the theme of the special issue, this article discusses two contrasting cases and considers the significance of digital entrepreneurship as informalisation of work.",AreaDigital infrastructure development

"Abstract Smartphone technology has improved access to mobile money services (MMS) and successful mobile money deployment has brought massive benefits to the unbanked population in both rural and urban areas of Uganda. Despite its enormous benefits, embracing the usage and acceptance of mobile money has mostly been low due to security issues and challenges associated with the system. As a result, there is a need to carry out a survey to evaluate the key security issues associated with mobile money systems in Uganda. The study employed a descriptive research design, and stratified random sampling technique to group the population. Krejcie and Morgan's formula was used to determine the sample size for the study. The collection of data was through the administration of structured questionnaires, where 741 were filled by registered mobile money (MM) users, 447 registered MM agents, and 52 mobile network operators' (MNOs) IT officers of the mobile money service providers (MMSPs) in Uganda. The collected data were analyzed using RStudio software. Statistical techniques like descriptive analysis and Pearson Chi-Square test was used in data analysis and mean (M) >3.0 and p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The findings revealed that the key security issues are identity theft, authentication attack, phishing attack, vishing attack, SMiShing attack, personal identification number (PIN) sharing, and agent-driven fraud. Based on these findings, the use of better access controls, customer awareness campaigns, agent training on acceptable practices, strict measures against fraudsters, high-value transaction monitoring by the service providers, developing a comprehensive legal document to run mobile money service, were some of the proposed mitigation measures. This study, therefore, provides a baseline survey to help MNO and the government that would wish to implement secure mobile money systems.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is a life-saving program that has helped reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality, but knowledge and skills retention after training remains a significant challenge for sustainability of impact. User-centred design (UCD) can be used to develop solutions to target knowledge and skills maintenance. We applied a process of UCD beginning with understanding the facilitators of, and barriers to, learning and retaining HBB knowledge and skills. HBB Master Trainers and frontline HBB providers participated in a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) to uncover the processes of skills acquisition and maintenance to develop a mobile application called ""HBB Prompt"". Themes derived from each FGD were identified and implications for development of the HBB Prompt app were explored, including feasibility of incorporating strategies into the format of an app. Data analysis took place after each iteration in Phase 1 to incorporate feedback and improve subsequent versions of HBB Prompt. Six HBB trainers and seven frontline HBB providers participated in a series of FGDs in Phase 1 of this study. Common themes included lack of motivation to practise, improving confidence in ventilation skills, ability to achieve the Golden Minute, fear of forgetting knowledge or skills, importance of feedback, and peer-to-peer learning. Themes identified that were not feasible to address pertained to health system challenges. Feedback about HBB Prompt was generally positive. Based on initial and iterative feedback, HBB Prompt was created with four primary functions: Training Mode, Simulation Mode, Quizzes, and Dashboard/Scoreboard. Developing HBB Prompt with UCD to help improve knowledge and skills retention was feasible and revealed key concepts, including drivers for successes and challenges faced for learning and maintaining HBB skills.

"Abstract Uganda's maternal mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Mobile phones can potentially provide affordable means of accessing maternal health services even among the otherwise hard-to-reach populations. Evidence about the acceptability and feasibility of mobile phone-based interventions targeting illiterate women, however, is limited.  To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile phone-based multimedia application (MatHealth app) to support maternal health amongst illiterate pregnant women in rural southwestern Uganda. 80 pregnant women initiating antenatal care from Mbarara regional referral hospital were enrolled in a pilot randomized controlled trial and followed until six weeks after delivery. The 40 women in the intervention group received a MatHealth app composed of educational videos/audios, clinic appointment reminders, and the calling function. Qualitative interviews on acceptability of this technology were carried out with 30 of the intervention participants. An inductive, content analytic approach was used to analyze qualitative data. Quantitative feasibility data were recorded and summarized descriptively. Participants reported that the intervention is acceptable as it enabled them adopt good maternal health practices, enhanced social support from spouses, provided clinic appointment reminders, and facilitated communication with healthcare providers. Challenges included: phone sharing (74%), accidental deletion of the application 15 (43%), lack of electricity 15 (43%), and inability to set up a reminder function 20 (57%).

"Abstract Fiscal solvency has become a popular phenomenon in numerous decentralizing countries in recent years. The ability to mobilize adequate revenue to fund expenditure in a given budget period, and provide public goods and services, makes fiscal solvency very pertinent, especially in local government. However, policy, practice, and research, claim that most local entities, both in the developed and developing world, rarely achieve required fiscal solvency standards. While no clear explanation of the problem abounds, digital financial inclusion dominates the ongoing debate. Besides, regulation is also considered a very crucial factor for fiscal solvency. This study examines the probable mediation effect regulation has on the digital financial inclusion-fiscal solvency relationship in local governments in Uganda, East Africa. Based on a cross-sectional research design, data were collected from 21 districts, nine municipalities, and many sub-counties in the country's post-conflict northern regions. The data were then subjected to structural equation modeling analysis. Its findings reveal that digital financial inclusion explains changes in fiscal solvency in surveyed local governments. Moreover, regulation has an indirect influence on the digital financial inclusion-fiscal solvency formation. Findings implications to practice and theory are discussed, and future research direction is provided.",AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract Adoption rates of mobile financial services within Africa still appear to be below par. The 2016 Groupe Spéciale Mobile Association report shows that over 60 per cent of the adult population in sub- Saharan Africa do not use mobile financial services. We investigate how cognitive resources, namely, mobile phone skills and English literacy, influence the use of mobile financial services. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 208 individuals from an urban location in Central Uganda. We measure actual mobile phone skill using a newly developed scale. The results show that a marginal increase in mobile phone skills has a strong effect on the odds of adopting mobile money, but a less strong effect on the extent to which the functionalities of the mobile money application are used. On the other hand, English literacy has no influence on both adoption and the magnitude of services individuals use.",AreaDigital literacy Digital
"Abstract By signing the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, Ukraine has demonstrated its intention and willingness to integrate into the system of formal institutions of the EU, to adopt the EU rules, norms, and practices, which will enable Ukraine to achieve significant economic benefits. One of those benefits is the opportunity to build a true scientific-educational and innovative partnership with the EU Member States within the European Research Area (ERA). This study considers opportunities and perspectives of creating an interstate and cross-border scientific-educational and innovative spaces between Ukraine as an associated country and the European Union Member States taking into account key priorities of the ERA and rapidly growing impact of digital technologies.

In this article, the authors use social movement literature and studies of peace and conflict to foreground the role of platform-mediated communication in creating a national identity in a fragile state. We argue that, by affording activists with a possibility of public, yet anonymous interactions, social media may play a crucial role in conferring state legitimacy during a violent conflict. Investigating the case of Mariupol, Ukraine, where a small group of citizens employed social media to support and legitimize the Ukrainian state among the city population, the authors illuminate the use of new media affordances to construct a national identity among digitally networked publics, mobilizing support for a threatened state.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The article examines the influence of the current stage of economy digitalization on the financial inclusion in Ukraine. The purpose is to assess the level of financial inclusion in the country, to determine the dominant influence of price and non-price barriers to access to financial services for the Ukrainian population when compared to other world countries and to define which part of the adult population is able to join the formal financial services system through the use of innovative channels and financial service systems. Based on the methodological approaches proposed by the World Bank and the G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators, the authors analyze the real traditional and digital access opportunities of the general public to financial services in Ukraine compared to other countries across the world. Particular emphasis is placed on overcoming existing non-price barriers that impede formal financial inclusion of the Ukrainian population. The research findings stress the need to adhere to the basic principles of digital financial inclusion in order to regulate activities of financial institutions and their agents in the digital provision of financial services, strengthen regulatory control over the use of innovative financial products and service systems, and protect the rights of consumers of financial services in Ukraine.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital

Abstract The rapid development of digital financial technologies in Ukraine leads to the emergence of new risks and to significant consumers' losses in the financial market. The aim of the study is to develop strategic directions of state policy of consumer protection in the digital financial services market considering the best world practices and features of the financial system of Ukraine. System scientific analysis was used to study the possibilities of implementing international quality standards for digital financial services in Ukrainian legislation. The method of statistical analysis of data was used to form the imperial basis of the study. Based on the global experience and taking into account the peculiarities of Ukrainian fintech market the state policy should consist of three strategic directions: 1) create a system of legal regulation of the mechanism of protection of consumers' rights of digital financial services; 2) introducing a risk-oriented approach to regulating the digital financial services delivery process to consumers; 3) strengthening of digital financial literacy and public awareness. Such state policy will form a reliable system of consumer protection in the digital services market in Ukraine.,AreaPolicy and regulation
"Abstract This article shows the main directions of improving higher education in the Republic of Uzbekistan in the context of the formation of the digital economy. The authors' research is based on real examples of the Tashkent State Economic University. The article proves that the digital transformation and change in the methods and means of teaching students and undergraduates in the context of the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID 19 infection require new technological approaches to teaching and managing the university from the teaching staff and university administration. In this article, the authors conclude that digital technologies individualize the educational process, diversify, develop students' independence, and develop creative thinking skills. Thus, the quality of education improves, and it is not only about the full and high-quality fulfillment of the requirements of the curriculum: classes begin to meet the personal interests and needs of students and undergraduates, which is undoubtedly an additional incentive to master the educational material.

"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to discover the contextual factors affecting the development of digital library education (DLE) in Vietnam and to determine how those factors are enabling or hindering its development. Based upon the literature and the theories of Fullan (2007), Nowlen (1988) and Rogers (2003), an initial model of contextual factors that were potentially affecting DLE development in Vietnam was developed. The model was then tested using a qualitative methodology involving interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders, along with the gathering of documentary evidence. The data were then analysed using the interactive model of Miles et al. (2014), and the initial model was then revised. The initial model allowed for the depiction of potential factors, both internal and external, along with some relationships between the factors. Based on the data analysis, a revised model was developed composed of seven major contextual factors that were enabling and/or hindering DLE development in the Vietnamese context. These are grouped into three categories: external factors - government, IT infrastructure and social and cultural values; internal factors -stakeholders' attitudes, DLE characteristics and the personal and organisational nexus; and change agents, which is both an internal and external factor. These factors had different levels of influence on DLE development and are inter-related.

"Abstract Over the recent decades, Vietnam has attained remarkable achievements in all areas of health care. However, shortcomings including health disparities persist particularly with a rapidly aging population. This has resulted in a shift in the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases such as dementia, cancer, and diabetes. These medical conditions require long-term care, which causes an accelerating crisis for the health sector and society. The current health care system in Vietnam is unlikely to cope with these challenges. The aim of this paper was to explore the opportunities, challenges, and necessary conditions for Vietnam in transforming toward a patient-centered care model to produce better health for people and reduce health care costs. We examine the applicability of a personalized and integrated Bespoke Health Care System (BHS) for Vietnam using a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis and examining the successes or failures of digital health care innovations in Vietnam. We then make suggestions for successful adoption of the BHS model in Vietnam. The BHS model of patient-centered care empowers patients to become active participants in their own health care. Vietnam's current policy, social, technological, and economic environment favors the transition of its health care system toward the BHS model. Nevertheless, the country is in an early stage of health care digitalization. The legal and regulatory system to protect patient privacy and information security is still lacking. The readiness to implement electronic medical records, a core element of the BHS, varies across health providers and clinical practices. The scarcity of empirical evidence and evaluation regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiatives is an obstacle to the Vietnamese government in policymaking, development, and implementation of health care digitalization. Implementing a personalized and integrated health care system may help Vietnam to address health care needs, reduce pressure on the health care system and society, improve health care delivery, and promote health equity. However, in order to adopt the patient-centered care system and digitalized health care, a whole-system approach in transformation and operation with a co-design in the whole span of a digital health initiative developing process are necessary.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Digital technologies are gaining an important role in the management of patients with diabetes. We assessed clinical outcomes and user satisfaction of incorporating a digital diabetes care system in diabetes clinics of a developing country. The system integrated a wireless blood glucose monitor that communicates data to any smartphone utilizing a patented acoustic data transfer method, a mobile-app, and cloud-based software that stores, analyzes, and presents data. Five hospital endocrinology clinics in Vietnam sequentially recruited all patients willing to join the study, providing they had a smartphone and access to internet connectivity. Face-to-face visits were conducted at baseline and at 12 weeks, with monthly digital visits scheduled in the interim and additional digital visits performed as needed. HbA1c levels were measured at baseline and at 12 weeks (±20 days). The study included 300 patients of whom 279 completed the evaluation. Average glucose levels declined from 170.4 ± 64.6 mg/dL in the first 2 weeks to 150.8 ± 53.2 mg/dL in the last 2 weeks (n = 221; p<0.001). HbA1c levels at baseline and 12 weeks declined from 8.3% ± 1.9% to 7.6% ± 1.3% (n = 126; p<0.001). The digital solution was broadly accepted by both patients and healthcare professionals and improved glycemic outcomes.

In general, the rates of using mobile money service and account ownership at financial intermediaries in Vietnam are still low, and other indicators of digital transactions suggest low levels compared to those of countries with low- and middle- income as well as to the world averages. The research also shows that owning an account at a financial intermediary facilitates the use of mobile money. This is a positive trend, at least compared to the situation in some African countries. Finally, having an account at a financial intermediary and using mobile money services generally have a positive effect on the participation in non-cash transactions.",AreaDigital inclusion Digital
"Abstract The use of mobile learning, or M-learning, has been increasingly appreciated by educators due to its sustainability potential in different facets such as finance (i.e., affordable cost) and flexibility (i.e., time and pace of learning). However, it may not be effective in all situations. This study explored the feasibility of using M-learning for students' self-study of mathematics in the context of Vietnamese high schools. Using 542 student and 40 teacher responses to two surveys, the study showed that the use of M-learning might not be feasible for students' self-study of mathematics due to difficulties related to accessing mathematics websites, the quality of mathematics website content, students' low level of self-learning ability and learning disengagement. This study suggests that the use of M-learning may contribute to the sustainability of education; adopting it should be based on a critical examination of contextual factors, especially students' self-learning ability and engagement. M-learning can be promising and beneficial to students due to its capability to equip students to prepare for the fast-changing and technological-driven world. Educators have increasingly appreciated the use of M-learning, because it becomes more affordable and flexible. Nonetheless, there is still a question about near-future adoptions of M-learning due to unavailability of and inaccessibility to quality contents from trusted maths websites. The propensity of student engagements in M-learning is also an important issue for future research.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract Integrated community case management (iCCM) of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia is a comprehensive, equity based strategy to improve treatment access for underserved children under five years old. This paper presents data on cost of iCCM and incremental costs of mHealth enhanced supervision and supply chain management in Zambia. We collected cost data using three questionnaires applied at national, district, health facility and community levels. We interviewed 40 health facility supervisors and 75 community health workers. A provider perspective and an ingredient costing method was used. We entered and analyzed data in a customized excel costing tool. The result shows that total iCCM cost per patient contact was USD 18.43. The incremental cost of using the mHealth intervention per child contact for all iCCM conditions was USD 11.35. The incremental cost per treatment of diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria with mHealth intervention was USD 9.58, USD 10.37 and USD 12.82. Program costs accounted for 67% of the total, and the largest share was associated with supervision estimated at 36%, followed by supply chain management at 27%.

"Abstract Mobile money agents (MMAs) are the pedestal of inclusive finance by bringing financial services closer to unbanked people by offering them capabilities to move from cash to electronic money and vice versa. This function is effective in an environment where hard cash is in uninterrupted circulation. The aim of this paper is to investigate implications of cash liquidity challenges in Zimbabwe to the development of financial inclusion through MMAs in a rural set-up. Phenomenological in-depth interviews were conducted with MMAs. Due to national liquidity challenges, MMAs ceased to receive cash float support, limiting their cash-in and cash-out services. Pure agents were adversely affected, while those who operate retail goods services reported increased goods sales through mobile money point-of-sale payments. Consumers are restricted to deal in electronic funds in the cashless economy making the cash-in and cash-out function of MMAs redundant. MMAs need support to sustain their operations and recoup invested capital in infrastructure. Risk management strategies, including the principal-agent contracts that minimize the exposure of MMAs to disruption of the service are important. MMAs could form an association to lobby financial regulators for support, negotiation with principals, market research, political power and active participation of agents in deepening financial inclusion. Perhaps pure MMAs could improve their economic sustainability by diversifying their businesses.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Despite producing top of the range products and services, entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe's rural Gokwe face limited access to markets. Access to local and regional trading markets is further aggravated by inadequate technological infrastructure and financial resources to carry out business activities.

"Abstract In recent years, there has been a surge of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the conduct of business. Public sector institutions in Zimbabwe have also embraced ICTs with an objective of promoting accountability, transparency and service delivery. This has increased the generation of digital records which are key in day-to-day business activities. However, the management of such records has been a challenge for most public sector institutions in most countries including Zimbabwe. Despite embracing ICTs, there have not been many changes to create a favourable environment for managing the resultant digital records. The findings reported in this research article were part of a broader study on the management of digital records in selected financial services parastatals in Zimbabwe. The study utilised the digital curation centre (DCC) curation lifecycle model as the theoretical framework of the study. This multiple case study research adopted a qualitative research approach to collect data from four purposively selected financial services parastatals in Zimbabwe using interviews, document analysis and observation as data collection tools. The study established that the financial services parastatals under investigation still lack requisite tools such as policies, guidelines and standards, adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower for effective and efficient management of digital records. In addition, the National Archives of Zimbabwe (NAZ), which has the legal mandate of regulating records management, has not been sufficiently involved in the management of digital records due to the lack of a legal and professional framework. Therefore, the study recommends the crafting of in-house policies and guidelines for managing digital records, procurement of adequate infrastructure and the recruitment of skilled and experienced manpower, if an enabling environment for the effective and efficient management of digital records is to be created.",AreaDigital infrastructure development
"Abstract The importance of marketing capabilities continues to grow yet research remains concentrated in developed markets. Although several researchers provide evidence of the influence of marketing capabilities on market performance, very little of similar evidence exists in the digital marketing domain. Empirical evidence of the impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance of small to medium enterprise (SME) agro-processors particularly from developing 
 countries remains scarce.  The purpose of this paper was to investigate the impact of digital marketing capabilities on SME agro-processors' both intermediate and final market performance outcomes. To achieve this, we conducted a survey of 298 SME agro-processors' managers and owners in Harare, Zimbabwe. A mixed sampling approach consisting of quota and stratified sampling approaches was adopted. We distributed a closed-ended questionnaire through the drop-off & pick-up and interviewer-based methods. The data was analysed statistically using STATA version 15. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to determine impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance. Our findings indicate that digital strategy development & execution, digital market innovation, e-market sensing and leadership capabilities positively influence intermediate market outcomes of customer awareness, customer attitudes, availability, and brand associations. However only digital strategy development & execution capability was positively associated with final market performance outcomes of sales growth, market share and profitability. These results imply that agro-processors must develop digital marketing capabilities that enable them to move beyond intermediate market outcomes to attain the primary business objectives of profitability, sales growth and market share. Attaining intermediate market outcomes only is not enough for business sustainability. The study contributes to literature by extending the marketing capabilities discussion to the digital marketing environment in a developing country context. This was important because marketing knowledge is contextual, as such cannot easily be transferred from one market to the other.",AreaDigital finance Digital
"Abstract Amid ongoing research about, Digital Health Interventions (DHI) in Zimbabwe, is the largely overlooked impact of DHI to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To contribute towards filling this knowledge gap, the study seeks to examine the DHI strategies that have been adopted to curb the inimical effects of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. DHI such as telemedicine, use of social media, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), Mobile Health (mHealth), and Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) have been disposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19.

"Abstract Twenty-six million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa; epidemics are widely dispersed, due to high levels of mobility. However, global elimination strategies do not consider mobility. We use Call Detail Records from 9 billion calls/texts to model mobility in Namibia; we quantify the epidemic-level impact by using a mathematical framework based on spatial networks. We find complex networks of risk flows dispersed risk countrywide: increasing the risk of acquiring HIV in some areas, decreasing it in others. Overall, 40% of risk was mobility-driven. Networks contained multiple risk hubs. All constituencies (administrative units) imported and exported risk, to varying degrees. A few exported very high levels of risk: their residents infected many residents of other constituencies. Notably, prevalence in the constituency exporting the most risk was below average. Large-scale networks of mobility-driven risk flows underlie generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to eliminate HIV, it is likely to become increasingly important to implement innovative control strategies that focus on disrupting risk flows.",AreaData systems and
"Abstract Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in children and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the importance of their identification for intervention purposes. It stands to reason that parents can influence child MTSD use, via their attitudes, beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles specifically with regard to child MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents (N = 1283) were surveyed about their children’s digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regarding the child’s MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct “digital parenting styles” were identified and these resembled general parenting styles. Findings further suggested that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes towards, and attributed less harm and more benefits to, early device use. These results are the first evidence for existence of digital parenting styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential prevention and treatment targets.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract As children in high, middle and even low-income countries gain access to the internet via a range of digital devices and services – most often via a mobile phone – parents are feeling challenged in their competence, role and authority. In response, parents draw on their available resources – socioeconomic and cultural – and their preferred parenting styles as well as some of the principles of positive parenting. In high income countries, a shift is underway from restrictive towards enabling forms of parental mediation. In middle and low-income countries, the evidence suggests that restrictive mediation is generally favoured by parents, although this brings costs in terms of children’s opportunities online, especially for girls. In all countries, the rapid pace of technological innovation undermines parental competence, this is in turn undermining children’s willingness to turn to parents for support.

The interventions included are heterogeneous in terms of participants (e.g., secondary students, patients, healthcare professionals) and contexts (e.g., rural, urban, schools, primary health care), aims, and modalities (e.g., website, online games). While these studies confirmed the feasibility of Internet-based interventions, the shortage of studies on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness makes it difficult to disseminate and scale up these Internet-based programs. However, the growing amount of knowledge accumulated in the Chilean context could guide practices in other developing countries for supporting the mental health of underserved populations.",AreaChild Protection Child

This present study used concepts from the theory of planned behavior and organizational control theory to examine the effects of factors such as attitude, subjective norms, organizational facilitators, monitoring, and self-efficacy on workers’ participation in unhygienic cyber practices. A cross-sectional survey of Nigerian professionals was used to test the formulated hypotheses. Partial least squares technique of structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis. The results indicate that attitude toward cyber hygiene has a negative effect on worker’s participation in unhygienic cyber practices; similarly, subjective norms have a negative effect on engagement in such acts. The data did not show that organizational facilitators, self-efficacy, and monitoring had a meaningful impact on Nigerian workers’ participation in unhygienic cyber practices. Implications of the study were discussed and contribution to the extant literature noted.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract Threat information sharing practices have the potential to improve cyber security. However, participation in sharing communities is not widely adopted. The existing literature finds a variety of benefits and challenges that either promote or deter organisations from engaging in such practices. Many of these findings relate to developed countries. A gap exists between developed and developing countries in terms of cyber threat information sharing. In this paper, we describe a case study to identify the barriers and incentives for implementing threat information sharing in a developing country: Saudi Arabia. Our results offer insight into the successful implementation of threat information sharing initiatives in Saudi Arabia, showing that socio-cultural barriers and technological incentives for sharing threat information are important factors. Our survey tool can be applied in other countries both developed and developing.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The use of Information and Communication Technologies maintains inherent risks that affect the processes they support, many with state responsibility and that must be systematically managed through a National Cybersecurity Strategy (ENC). However, in some developing countries this has not yet happened, due to circumstances in the region and due to political, economic or social considerations that in some way have impeded their development or have developed in an incipient manner with the collaboration of concerned international organizations. Models and examples of National Strategies have been published, but in some cases oriented to developed countries or cultures different from that of the region. Good practice manuals have also been prepared by international organizations that work on these issues, based on lessons learned in similar exercises carried out in some cases with foreign consultants far from the local reality. This work presents a proposal based on good practices and knowledge of the local reality previously defined through research carried out on the components of a National Strategy. The proposal aims to guide those interested in the product to obtain after a participatory methodological process of executing a life cycle explained in previous works published by these authors.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that

"Abstract Cybercrime issues across many economies are increasing at a faster rate. The rapid
diffusion and penetration of the internet, as well as the processes of digitization of
economic activities, have been the major catalysts. These cybercrime activities continue to
pose a serious threat to e-commerce technologies and influence consumers' intention to
conduct transactions using such a medium. Considering the upsurge of cyber-crime
activities and the paucity of research in this domain, particularly in developing countries,
this paper investigated how cyber-crime and trust affect users' intention to conduct
business via e-commerce technologies. Using a survey approach, an online questionnaire
was distributed and data from 476 participants was rigorously analyzed using Partial Least
Square Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicate that trust in internet media,
attitude towards behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and cyber-crime
perceptions are significant predictors of intention to purchase using e-commerce
technologies. The findings elucidate businesses and stakeholders on the impacts of trust
and cybercrime perceptions on users' purchase intentions. It further brings to the fore the
need to incorporate security features that reduce the vulnerability of e-commerce
platforms.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the global e-commerce market place and has also been seen as the future of cybercrime. Cybercrimes are emerging in Asia, and the developing countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are becoming a hub for cybercriminals. To prevent Asia from becoming a cybercrime hub and safe-haven for cybercriminals, it is important that countries be equipped with comprehensive cybercrime laws aligned with international standards. This chapter reviews the development of the Internet in Asia (both Northeast and Southeast Asia) and examines existing legal measures adopted by these countries and compares them with the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention). The chapter finds that cybercrime laws in Northeast Asian countries are all aligned favorably with the Budapest Convention. While most ASEAN countries are favorably or moderately aligned with the Budapest Convention, more work needs to be done to support countries like Myanmar, Indonesia, and Cambodia to build cybercrime laws more closely aligned with the Budapest Convention. It suggests that actions need to be taken to reduce the digital divide and raise cybersecurity awareness among ASEAN member countries. It is also suggested that the Budapest Convention should be updated to match the development of new technologies and crime such as hate speech and fake news.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract In recent years, developing countries have experienced fast growth in internet usage. As a result, there has been rapid development in the deployment of information and communication
technologies in these countries. Information is often exchanged through these technologies by users. Over the years, this information
has been under attack by those with malicious intent. While there is growing awareness about these threats in the Western world, awareness in developing countries is poor. Nigeria is a developing country in Africa that has experienced rapid growth in internet and mobile
technology usage with a reported mobile phone teledensity of 97.47% and nearly 186 million active mobile internet subscriptions {NCC,
2019, Industry Statistics}. As these advancements are new, the citizens of this country may not be aware of the threats associated
with them. This paper examines the level of cyber-security awareness amongst the general public using a quantitative online survey. A
sample size of 176 Nigerians responded to the survey. The results from the survey indicate that the knowledge of cybersecurity is
moderate although, several cases of poor practices such as choice of weak passwords, free anti-virus software, and password sharing
were observed. It was also found that despite the presence of ngCERT, a body tasked with the responsibility of managing the risks
of cyber threats in Nigeria and also the first point of contact for victims of cyber-crime, many of the respondents (77.84%) are not
aware of this. Thus, there is an immediate need for concerned agencies to create more awareness programs to enlighten citizens on
the dangers of poor cyber-security practices.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that

Drawing on the program's experience, the paper identifies various challenges to managing an effective program as well as eight lessons learned which might be applicable to other programs. Key amongst the lessons learned is the need for a solid understanding of how the internet is accessed and used in the host country, and the need for local content to attract target audience attention.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract Smartphones have diffused rapidly across South African society and constitute the most dominant information and communication technologies in everyday use. That being so, it is important to ensure that all South Africans know how to secure their smart devices. Doing so requires a high level of security awareness and knowledge. As yet, there is no formal curriculum addressing cyber security in South African schools. Indeed, it seems to be left to universities to teach cyber security principles, and they currently only do this when students take computing-related courses. The outcome of this approach is that only a very small percentage of South Africans, i.e. those who take computing courses at university, are made aware of cyber security risks and know how to take precautions. In this paper we found that, because this group is overwhelmingly male, this educational strategy disproportionately leaves young South African women vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We thus contend that cyber security ought to be taught as children learn the essential “3 Rs”—delivering requisite skills at University level does not adequately prepare young South Africans for a world where cyber security is an essential skill. Starting to provide awareness and knowledge at primary school, and embedding it across the curriculum would, in addition to ensuring that people have the skills when they need them, also remove the current gender imbalance in cyber security awareness.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that

"Abstract Today, vital social infrastructures — electricity, finance, water, transportation, health and food — are increasingly dependent on the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks for functioning, distribution and interconnectedness. This dependence results in both opportunities and vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by a variety of actors ranging from individuals to organisations and governments. This indicates that information revolution, experienced by the contemporary world, is both a boon and bane. To a large extent, it is a bane because the ICT has an ‘enabling function’ for disruption, crime and state-level aggression. The ICT dependence may become more prone to vulnerabilities in the times of social unrest, political tensions and other appalling events. At present, Pakistan experiences a fast growing application of the ICT in different sectors but seriously lacks in cyber readiness. In addition, the country confronts a hostile security environment internally as well as externally. These factors expose it to various cyber threats. Drawing on the securitisation theory, this paper attempts to examine the cyber threat landscape of Pakistan and focuses on the cyber threats that the country faces across the spectrum — hacking, serious and organised cybercrime, cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare. This is followed by an evaluation of Pakistan’s cyber readiness profile in the light of the five-pillar criteria laid down by the UN specialised agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), namely legal, technical, organisational, capacity building and international cooperation.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The emergence and rapid development of information and communication technology has brought about various opportunities and challenges. One of them is the active interaction between individuals and the digital-based information service providers. In modern economic development, related information including personal data or also known as digital dossier—the collection of large amounts of an individual’s information using digital technology—are valuable assets due to their high economic value since they are widely utilized by businesses. In this regard and due to the increasing number of cellphone and internet users, there is a need to study the issues on the importance of protecting one’s personal data. In Indonesia, there is no specific regulation regarding the protection of personal data. Therefore, it is essential to come up with specific and comprehensive legislation related to personal data protection as legal basis for better implementation of personal data protection in Indonesia in the future. The purpose of this research is to find out and analyze the current policies on protection of personal data of internet users in Indonesia. This study uses a normative juridical method with a statutory approach and utilizes literature study. The result shows that the concept of personal data protection implies that individuals have the right to determine whether one will join an online community, share or exchange personal data with another, and the conditions that must be met in order to do so. The study likewise found that the threat of personal data leakage is increasingly occurring because of the development of the e-commerce sector in Indonesia.",AreaCybersecurity CybersecurityInterventions that
"Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology of the 21st century. It is described as the first real evolution of the Internet that could positively or negatively affect all aspects of life. The basic idea of the IoT revolves around connecting things and objects (persons, animals, cars, trees, etc.) to the Internet and enabling them to communicate and then process (generate, receive, send, etc.) data about themselves and the environment surrounding them. Without a doubt, the IoT will bring countless benefits and provide timely data and information about places and objects. However, the IoT, like other technologies, has disadvantages especially in terms of privacy and security of data. Particularly, the IoT might challenge personal data protection law and misgive its ability to effectively stand in the rapid successive technology waves. As the most important law relating to the protection of personal data in Malaysia, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010 could be used as a benchmark for assessing the adequacy of data protection law in the country. Thus, this paper attempts to shed light on data protection challenges in the IoT era and then assess the adequacy of this Act in dealing with those challenges. The paper employs a legal doctrinal method to analyze the legal frameworks relevant to personal data protection. It may also use a comparative method to compare the PDPA with its counterparts in other countries. A study such as this is arguably useful and timely as Malaysia is already embarked in the IoT caravan with the vision of being “the Premier Regional IoT Development Hub.”",AreaData privacy Data
"Abstract Advances in new technologies present challenges to general expectations relating to collection, usage and cross-border control and transfer of personal data in recent times.

Using a qualitative approach, and further enabled by the institutional theory as a framework the paper examines the implications of the NDPR requirements for Data Controllers and Processors in key sectors of the economy. Findings from the study shows that there are five key components of the NDPR that can compel, motivate or support organizations to make significant structural changes such as standardization of processes, practices and IT assets to show conformity and/or gain legitimacy. The study equally identified the factors that facilitate or inhibit the adoption and implementation of the conditions of the NDPR categorised in line with the three pillars of the institutional theory framework.

"Abstract Objectives
To assess knowledge, attitude, and beliefs about the right to privacy and confidentiality from the viewpoints of the general public (GP) and the health system (HS) professionals in Jordan.

Methods
An online-based cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire was distributed across Jordan during May & June of 2020. A total number of 388 respondents filled in the online survey assessing their knowledge, attitude, and opinion about the right to privacy and confidentiality being practiced during the professional contact between the patients and their health care providers.

Results
Amongst the respondents, 44 (11.3%) participants were health care professionals, and 344 (88.6%) participants were from the general public. Most of the respondents were females (69.6%) and the mean age was about 27 years. The main sources of knowledge about patients’ right to privacy and confidentiality regulations were from school and media platforms. Only 18.1% of the GP respondents reported that they have been introduced to patients’ right to privacy and confidentiality regulations by medical staff during professional contact. Almost about 97% of GP respondents and 93.2% of HS professionals valued patients’ right to assure the level of their data privacy prior to receiving medical care. A significantly (P = .012) higher percentage (93%) of GP respondents believed that there should be no prioritisation of privacy based on the gender of the patient. Most of the GP respondents had concerns about electronic medical records being violated and their data being reached by unauthorised parties.

Conclusion
The general public and health system professionals in Jordan are familiar with the patients’ right to privacy and confidentiality regulations. More efforts must be put in place to inform patients about their rights to privacy and confidentiality practices when they are in professional contact with their healthcare providers. In addition, rules, laws, and legal agreements must be effectively established and monitored to prevent privacy violations.",AreaData privacy Data

The study uses the latest Supreme Court judgement on right to privacy and historical cases on right to privacy in India. This paper uses Indian Constitution as a source of Information for study along with case laws and judgements of different courts in India.
This paper tries to find if personal data privacy is a fundamental right in India. In addition, the paper provides recommendations to different concerned authorities on protecting personal information in online platform.
This study deals with privacy issues so far as Indian citizens are concerns and does not focus on other countries. Moreover, the study tries to understand the issue of fundamental rights from Indian Constitution perspective. In addition, the recommendations provided to the policymakers and other authorities of India have wide implications for formulation of new policy and management of personal data, so that it should not go to wrong hands and the personal data and privacy is protected of the citizens.
Millions of people put their personal information in online platform. In addition, there are few government initiatives in India such as Aadhaar card where the biometric information is taken from the residents of India, and in many cases, the personal data are compromised under various circumstances. As the personal data of the citizens are in question, thus the study has direct practical implication mainly for all the citizens whose personal data are available in online platform.
This study has social implication as it dealt with the “personal data” of the citizens of India. As the paper discusses the issue of protection of personal data in the context of right to privacy, thus this study has a direct social impact so far as online citizen of India is concerned.

"Abstract The purpose of this article is to find the most successful ways, forms and methods of personal data protection on the Internet among foreign countries for domestic political and legal realities. The following methods were used in the article: dialectical, logical-semantic, comparative-legal, documentary analysis, analytical, information-analytical. Issues related to the adaptation of the successful experience of a number of developed countries in the field of personal data protection on the Internet are brought up for discussion. Some options are covered and specified, which include effective methods and ways to implement an effective mechanism for personal data protection on the Internet in Ukraine. It is emphasized that the protection and proper confidentiality of personal data of individuals is one of the key tasks currently facing modern jurists. It is also added that the nature and specifics of the use and protection of personal data of individuals, including on the Internet, are extremely closely related to the institution of intellectual property. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the level of protection of personal data of individuals in a country is an indicator of the extent to which such a state meets the criteria of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. are empirically, theoretically, and politically crucial for HE scholars. First, most literature is examining the impacts of digitalisation on the HE sector and its subjects alone. I argue that current changes in digitalising HE cannot be studied in isolation from broader changes in the global economy. Specifically, HE digitalisation is embedded in the expansion of the digital economy, which is marked by new forms of value extraction and rentiership. Second, the emerging research on the intersection of marketisation and digitalisation in HE seems to follow the theories of marketisation qua production and commodification. I argue that we need theories with better explanatory power in analysing the current digitalisation dynamics. I propose to move from commodification to assetisation, and from prices to rents. Finally, universities are digitalising in the time when the practice is superseding policy, and there is no regulation beyond the question of data privacy. However, digital data property is already a reality, governed by ‘terms of use’, and protected by the intellectual property rights regime. The current pandemic has led to ‘emergency pedagogy’, which has intensified overall digitalisation in the sector and is bypassing concerns of data value redistribution. I argue that we urgently need public scrutiny and political action to address issues of value extraction and redistribution in HE.",AreaData privacy Data
"Abstract European law has recognised the need for international cross-disciplinary collaboration to both identify, locate and safeguard victims and prevent, investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse (OCSEA). However, there is evidence that these crimes are continuing to increase and develop in step with technological advances.

"Abstract Advances in information and communication technologies facilitate opportunities for sexual exploitation and abuse of children online (SEACO). Despite the presence of laws against child pornography, trafficking, and cybercrime, the Philippines has become known as a key hub of the billion-dollar global child cybersex industry.
The objective of this study was to provide insight on SEACO in the Philippines.
The methodology consisted of a review of readily available news articles and reports. The search term “Philippines cybersex” was used in Advanced Search in Google News (https://news.google.com.ph) for English language reports from 1995 to 2015 to describe the geographic distribution of media reported cases of SEACO, the profile of victims and offenders, and how offenders and victims became involved in SEACO.
The review found 55 reports and articles from 2011 to 2015. Cases were reported from 9 regions in the country with victims ranging from 18 months to 17 years in age. Three types of SEACO were identified: live streaming of child sexual abuse, child sexual abuse material (child pornography), and sextortion using minors.
Cases of SEACO were found to be present throughout the country. National policies and preventive measures are needed to stem this crime.",AreaChild Protection Child

"Abstract This study focused on the drivers of online child sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA) among Filipino children and youth, with emphasis on community norms. An ethnographic qualitative study was conducted in two communities in MetroManila that are considered “hotspots” for child sexual abuse. One hundred and forty-four (144) males and females from various age groups served as key informants. Political officials, Internet shop managers, professionals and police officers were also interviewed. Non-participant observations and mapping were used to provide context regarding OCSEA in the communities.The results revealed that OCSEA was committed online by heterosexual and same sex attracted men in their 40s–50s. The usual victims were girls aged 13–17 years, although boys were also noted. The victims came from poor families and were out-of-school. The various forms of online activities leading to OCSEA included sexual chatting, showing of child sex photos and live videos as well as sextortion. The online transactions were usually initiated by the peer group and some enablers. In general, online sexual activities were perceived as “normal” among young people, although regarded as “disgusting”. Online sex activities had become a source of “easy money” for the child and family. They were perceived as not harmful because of anonymity and the absence of any actual physical contact. People in the community tolerate these online practices and do not report the incidence to authorities. The effects on children and youth were predominantly social and psychological, albeit perceived as economically beneficial. Some preventive and mitigating actions were recommended to curb the incidence of OCSEA in the communities.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract Our report sets out the outcomes from reviews of the relevant literature, and a series of consultations held by IWG_OSO, with participation from practitioners and researchers working in the field of child protection and online sex offending.

Online sex offending.

Internationally, researchers and practitioners have documented rises in the scale and impact of online sex offending, including the grooming of minors and vulnerable people for sexual purposes, sexual trafficking, and most dramatically, child sexual exploitation material and the related offences of its possession, production and distribution. Such a ‘high volume crime’ outweighs the capacity for effective management and prevention through the strategies and resources currently being used. This makes prosecution and case management increasingly difficult.

Challenges to good practice.

Without empirically based good practice, professionals are unable to deal effectively with the prevention of online sex offending, risk-management, and treatment decisions. This creates major limitations for the police, courts, probation, child protection, and other services, which are working to protect and safeguard children from online child sexual offenders, and to manage and prevent offending behaviours.

Current issues and possible solutions.

A series of current issues were highlighted, with possible solutions offered by IWG_OSO stakeholders. These included suggestions for changes in: international policy on CSEM offending; working with the internet industry; policing issues; research concerns; risk assessment and treatment developments; inter-agency and multi-disciplinary collaboration; barriers to change; and preventative methods.

Conclusions.

An increase in arresting and prosecuting offenders;
An increase in earlier interventions and primary and secondary prevention;
An increase in research to aid risk assessments, treatment options and prevention approaches;
An increase in international collaboration and consistency in applying learning to policy and practice.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract Research on prevalence, risk factors, and prevention interventions for child sexual abuse has continued to focus on western and developed countries. Where country-level prevalence data or large-scale research exists, rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and non-western countries than their western and developed counterparts.
We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries, the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their effectiveness.
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases and identified eight studies to include in our analysis.
Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on preschool and primary school-aged children. Most have focused on interventions delivered in educational settings, with a lack of focus on population-level interventions to prevent child sexual abuse. Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self-protection and help-seeking, not deployment of those skills, actual reduction in prevalence of CSA, or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contexts.
If the focus on school-based strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries, a significant gap in knowledge of the efficacy of population-level interventions outside of school contexts, and consistency across the application of interventions will remain. Evaluations are needed that address the efficacy of broader government-led or whole-of-community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse, or that can link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract This article presents a study that applies integrated and multi-factor path analysis to report the direct and indirect effects of young Brazilian individual and home factors on their online opportunities and risks. The results show that engaging in more online opportunities, being older and having a lower level of parental mediation are associated with a higher number of online risks. At the same time, being older, having Internet access at home, having parents with a higher educational level, possessing more digital skills and receiving a higher level of co-use and active parental mediation are positively associated with online opportunities. Although restrictive parental mediation is negatively associated with online risks, it also reduces opportunities. In addition, co-use and active mediation are positively associated with parental educational level.

"Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine preschool teachers and parents' attitudes and their practices regarding the use of digital technologies during preschool education. The main research questions the study intended to address focused on teachers' and parents' attitudes and practices about the role of digital technology supplies in young children's development. The study used a mixed research approach, using in-depth interviews and an online questionnaire. The results have shown that only one of the eight preschool teachers reported a positive attitude regarding the impact of digital technology in children's development. Most of the interviewed preschool teachers showed preference towards authentic play and activities exercising children's psycho-motor skills. However, most of parents have suggested that their children, starting from early years of their development, are exposed to different digital technologies. In conclusion, there are two contradictory findings (progressive and regressive philosophies) among parents and preschool teachers regarding their perceptions and practices on the use of digital technologies in young children's learning and development. The study advocates for continuous cooperation between parents and teachers to ensure prospects of maximizing benefits and alleviating potential risks of using digital technologies in early childhood education.",AreaChild Protection Child

mediating role as primary technology educators is grossly underestimated. Parents who
lack digital skills and awareness have a passive attitude towards shaping children’s digital
experiences, and seem to ignore the fact that they are role models for their kids.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract Between 2015 and 2019, Indonesian Internet users increased by 22%. In 2019, 43.5% of the 270 million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet. Of the roughly 117.5 million people with Internet access, 25.5% are children and adolescents. Digital activity has also intensified, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is an urgent need to increase digital literacy from an early age to minimize the risk of online harm, to equip children who are future voters and consumers with the skills and understanding they need to assume those roles, and to maximize meaningful use of the Internet.
Generally, Indonesians have poor digital literacy. This problem was exacerbated when Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was dropped from the national school curriculum in 2013.
Several government initiatives, including the National Literacy Movement (Gerakan Literasi Nasional/GLN), the Siberkreasi program, and reintroducing ICT to the school curriculum, have yet to be implemented effectively and with a specific focus on improving digital literacy skills.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in the developing countries of Palestine, Libya, and Afghanistan, as reported by middle-school students, their parents, and teachers. These countries have been struggling with an unstable and violent situation for decades. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 participants from the three countries and 60 online classes were observed. Findings revealed that COVID-19 widened the digital gap among students and families, which created challenges in terms of online class attendance. In addition, violation of students' and parents' digital privacy emerged as another key challenge to emergency remote teaching. However, teacher presence and timely feedback in synchronous online sessions strengthened students' engagement within the emergency remote teaching environment. Overall, emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 crisis deepened inequities across students and infringed upon the digital ethics of students, teachers, and parents.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract On 14 October 2020, the EU Delegation to the UN and the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN, in collaboration with UNICEF, hosted a forward-looking side event panel discussion in the margins of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Children. The panel discussion followed the 12 October Interactive Dialogue, where UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Charlotte Petri Gornitzka presented the Report on the Status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (attached) and other child rights reports at the Third Committee.

The panel focused on children’s rights in the digital environment.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract In 1989, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which sets out the human rights of every person under 18 years old, was adopted by the UN General Assembly. The Convention affirms that all children have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, develop to their full potential, participate in society and be protected. Since then, 196 States have become parties to the Convention and, as a result, now have an obligation to protect children from violence, including online child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA).",AreaChild Protection Child

"Abstract This research reviews the literature about a new form of harassment, the cyberbullying. This harassment uses technologies such as Internet, smartphones, social networks, e-mail, to annoy, assault and harass other individuals. This work analyses why does this happen, who is the cyber-bully and who the cybervictim, in what contexts, how does the cyberbullying look like, and what can be done to prevent or diminish the threat. Results reveal that men are more prone to act both as an aggressor and as a victim, mainly between the ages of 9 and 17 years old. The cyberbully is generally older than the victim. Although not very frequent, cyberbullying is also present among adults. Additionally, the amount of time spent on the use of the Internet is highly related to the frequency and magnitude of the cyberbullying. The chances of being attacked are higher when students have access to Internet in the classroom. The role of parents is critical to prevent and diminish the threat.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract Background: This study examined the cyberbullying experience and coping manners of adolescents in urban Vietnam and explored the mediating effect of different support to the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 484 students at four secondary schools. Cyberbullying experience, coping strategies, psychological problems, and family, peer, and teacher support were obtained. Structural equation modeling was utilized to determine the mediating effects of different support on associations between cyberbullying and psychological problems.

Results: There were 11.6 and 28.3% of students who reported that they experienced and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last 3 months, respectively. Among the victims, only 48.2% tried to stop the perpetrators. Meanwhile, the majority of observers belonged to the “Intervene” group who tried to report cyberbullying acts or help victims. Family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among adolescents.

Conclusion: The 3-month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban adolescents aged 11–14 was low. However, current coping strategies against cyberbullying were not sufficient. Family support is an important factor that should be considered for designing interventions to mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health of adolescents.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract Risk classifications guide practitioners and policymakers in their work and in communicating their results. EU Kids Online’s (2009) 3Cs of online risk is used widely as a classic point of reference for stakeholders internationally. It is timely to update this classification, given the variation in its use, the emerging risks in the digital environment, and our growing understanding of children’s experiences of online risks of harm. This report proposes a new CO:RE 4Cs classification.",AreaChild Protection Child
"Abstract There is surprisingly little research directly conveying children's experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Much of the existing research has also focused on identifying potential risks to children rather than directly measuring the evidence of harm that some have faced. This is understandable, as its ethically more complex to conduct research with young people who have experienced harm. Yet fully understanding online harms is important to inform preventions and responses. It must also be remembered that in reality, the vast majority of cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse go unreported, making it difficult to truly determine the scope of this problem in the first place. Ensuring that the voices of children who have had experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are part of the evidence – as was achieved in this project - enables child-centred and informed approaches that better prevent this issue from occurring, and better support those young people subjected to these crimes.",AreaChild Protection Child
